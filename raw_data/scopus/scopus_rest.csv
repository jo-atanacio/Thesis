Accurate Crop Yield Prediction (CYP) necessitates the basic understanding of the functional relativity among yields and the collaborative factor. Disclosing such connection requires both wide-ranging datasets and an efficient model. The CYP is important to accomplish irrigation scheduling and assessing labor necessities for reaping and storing. Predicting yield using various kinds of irrigation is effective for optimizing resources, but CYP is a difficult process owing to the existence of distinct factors. Recently, Deep Learning (DL) approaches offer solutions to complicated data like weather parameters, maturity groups, genotype, etc. In this aspect, this paper presents an Automated Crop Yield Prediction utilizing Chaotic Political Optimizer with Deep Learning (ACYP-CPODL) model. The proposed ACYP-CPODL technique involves different processes namely pre-processing, prediction and parameter optimization. In addition, the hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) technique is designed for the prediction process. Moreover, the hyperparameter tuning of the CNN-LSTM approach is performed by the CPO algorithm. The proposed ACYP-CPODL technique has produced an effective result with an MSE of 0.031 and R2 Score of 0.936, whereas the BLSTM model has produced a near-optimal results. As a result, the proposed ACYP-CPODL method has proven to be an effective tool for predicting the crop yields. For validating the improved predictive performance of the ACYP-CPODL technique, a wide range of simulations take place on benchmark datasets and the comparative results highlighted the betterment of the ACYP-CPODL technique over the recent methods. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

This paper presents a deep learning framework using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for crop yield prediction based on environmental data and management practices. The proposed CNN-RNN model, along with other popular methods such as random forest (RF), deep fully connected neural networks (DFNN), and LASSO, was used to forecast corn and soybean yield across the entire Corn Belt (including 13 states) in the United States for years 2016, 2017, and 2018 using historical data. The new model achieved a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) 9% and 8% of their respective average yields, substantially outperforming all other methods that were tested. The CNN-RNN has three salient features that make it a potentially useful method for other crop yield prediction studies. (1) The CNN-RNN model was designed to capture the time dependencies of environmental factors and the genetic improvement of seeds over time without having their genotype information. (2) The model demonstrated the capability to generalize the yield prediction to untested environments without significant drop in the prediction accuracy. (3) Coupled with the backpropagation method, the model could reveal the extent to which weather conditions, accuracy of weather predictions, soil conditions, and management practices were able to explain the variation in the crop yields. © Copyright © 2020 Khaki, Wang and Archontoulis.","convolutional neural networks; crop yield prediction; deep learning; feature selection; recurrent neural networks",,Article,Scopus

The drawback, however, is that a one-fits-all prediction model is often employed over an entire region without considering subregional VCI and TCI’s spatial variability resulting from environmental and climatic factors. Furthermore, when using nonlinear ML, redundant VCI/TCI data present additional challenges that adversely affect the models’ output. This study proposes a framework that (i) employs higher-order spatial independent component analysis (sICA), and (ii), exploits a combination of the principal component analysis (PCA) and ML (i.e., PCA-ML combination) to deal with the two challenges in order to enhance crop yield prediction accuracy. The proposed framework consolidates common VCI/TCI spatial variability into their respective subregions, using Vietnam as an example. Compared to the one-fits-all approach, subregional rice yield forecasting models over Vietnam improved by an average level of 20% up to 60%. PCA-ML combination outper-formed ML-only by an average of 18.5% up to 45%. The framework generates rice yield predictions 1 to 2 months ahead of the harvest with an average of 5% error, displaying its reliability. © 2022 by the authors.

Satellite-based Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) products have revealed hot spots of photosynthesis over global croplands, such as in the U.S. Midwest. However, to what extent these satellite-based SIF products can enhance the performance of crop yield prediction when benchmarking against other existing satellite data remains unclear. Here we assessed the benefits of using three satellite-based SIF products in yield prediction for maize and soybean in the U.S. Midwest: gap-filled SIF from Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2), new SIF retrievals from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and the coarse-resolution SIF retrievals from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). The yield prediction performances of using SIF data were benchmarked with those using satellite-based vegetation indices (VIs), including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and land surface temperature (LST). Five machine-learning algorithms were used to build yield prediction models with both remote-sensing-only and climate-remote-sensing-combined variables. We found that high-resolution SIF products from OCO-2 and TROPOMI outperformed coarse-resolution GOME-2 SIF product in crop yield prediction. Using high-resolution SIF products gave the best forward predictions for both maize and soybean yields in 2018, indicating the great potential of using satellite-based high-resolution SIF products for crop yield prediction. However, using currently available high-resolution SIF products did not guarantee consistently better yield prediction performances than using other satellite-based remote sensing variables in all the evaluated cases. The relative performances of using different remote sensing variables in yield prediction depended on crop types (maize or soybean), out-of-sample testing methods (five-fold-cross-validation or forward), and record length of training data. We also found that using NIRv could generally lead to better yield prediction performance than using NDVI, EVI, or LST, and using NIRv could achieve similar or even better yield prediction performance than using OCO-2 or TROPOMI SIF products. We concluded that satellite-based SIF products could be beneficial in crop yield prediction with more high-resolution and good-quality SIF products accumulated in the future. © 2020 The Authors","crop yield; forecasting; machine learning; prediction; Solar-induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence","chlorophyll; crop yield; fluorescence; forecasting method; machine learning; maize; NDVI; prediction; satellite imagery; soybean; Midwest; United States; Glycine max",Article,Scopus

However, their utility is limited by unrealistic time structure of daily rainfall and biases in rainfall frequency and intensity distributions. Crop growth is very sensitive to daily variations of rainfall; thus any mismatch in daily rainfall statistics could impact crop yield simulations. Here, we present an improved methodology to correct GCM rainfall biases and time structure mismatches for maize yield prediction in Katumani, Kenya. This includes GCM bias correction (BC), to correct over- or under-predictions of rainfall frequency and intensity, and nesting corrected GCM information with a stochastic weather generator, to generate daily rainfall realizations conditioned on a given monthly target. Bias-corrected daily GCM rainfall and generated rainfall realizations were used to evaluate crop response. Results showed that corrections of GCM rainfall frequency and intensity could improve crop yield prediction but yields remain under-predicted. This is strongly attributed to the time structure mismatch in daily GCM rainfall leading to excessively long dry spells. To address this, we tested several ways of improving daily structure of GCM rainfall. First, we tested calibrating thresholds in BC but were found not very effective for improving dry spell lengths. Second, we tested BC-stochastic disaggregation (BC-DisAg) and appeared to simulate more realistic dry spell lengths using bias-corrected GCM rainfall information (e.g., frequency, totals) as monthly targets. Using rainfall frequency alone to condition the weather generator removed biases in dry spell lengths, improved predicted yields, but under-predicted yield variability. Combining rainfall frequency and totals, however, not only produced more realistic yield variability but also corrected under-prediction of yields. We envisaged that the presented method would enhance the utility of daily GCM rainfall in crop yield prediction. © 2010 Royal Meteorological Society.","Bias correction; Crop models; GCM; Stochastic disaggregation; Weather generator","Bias correction; Crop models; GCM; Stochastic disaggregation; Weather generator; Climate models; Crops; Drought; Forecasting; Stochastic systems; Rain; climate modeling; computer simulation; correction; crop yield; global climate; maize; precipitation assessment; precipitation intensity; prediction; rainfall; stochasticity; Eastern Province [Kenya]; Katumani; Kenya; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Six different AI models for crop yield prediction are tested in this research. Then, a comprehensive and objective comparison is conducted between the AI models. Particularly for the deep neural network (DNN) model, we performed an optimization process to ensure the best configurations for the layer structure, cost function, optimizer, activation function, and drop-out ratio. In terms of mean absolute error (MAE), our DNN model with the JA database was approximately 21–33% and 17–22% more accurate for corn and soybean yields, respectively, than the other five AI models. This indicates that corn and soybean yields for a given year can be forecasted in advance, at the beginning of September, approximately a month or more ahead of harvesting time.

First, it achieved a relative root mean square error of 8% or less in three Midwest states (Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa) in the US for both corn and soybean yield prediction, outperforming state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Second, it identified about a dozen environment by management interactions for corn and soybean yield, some of which are consistent with conventional agronomic knowledge whereas some others interactions require additional analysis or experiment to prove or disprove. Third, it quantitatively dissected crop yield into contributions from weather, soil, management, and their interactions, allowing agronomists to pinpoint the factors that favorably or unfavorably affect the yield of a given location under a given weather and management scenario.

Then using two type machine learning algorithms crop yield of Habiganj is predicted from its existing parameters and for better accuracy future values of its datasets are predicted by using two type of time series analysis model. Such analytical reports and prediction allows monitoring crop growth dynamic and identifying early signs of reduction in crop productivity. Furthermore, comparative studies are concluded between two platforms, algorithms and time series analysis to determine the most suited environment and model for this research purpose. © 2020 IEEE.","Agriculture; Crop monitoring; Crop yield prediction; K-means segmentation; Machine learning; Satellite; Time series forecast","Agricultural robots; Crops; Food supply; Forecasting; Forestry; Harmonic analysis; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Time series analysis; Agriculture sectors; Analytical reports; Comparative studies; Crop growth and yields; Crop productivity; Multi-spectral; Remote sensing index; Research purpose; Learning algorithms",Conference Paper,Scopus

Machine learning has risen with massive processing techniques to perceive new contingencies in agricultural development. Machine learning is a novel onset for the investigation and determination of unpredictable agrarian issues. Machine learning models actualize the need for scaling the learning model’s performance. Feature selection can impact a machine learning model’s performance by defining a significant feature subset for increasing the performance and identifying the variability. This paper explains a novel hybrid feature extraction procedure, which is an aggregation of the correlation-based filter (CFS) and random forest recursive feature elimination (RFRFE) wrapper framework. The proposed feature extraction approach aims to identify an optimal subclass of features from a collection of climate, soil, and groundwater characteristics for constructing a crop-yield forecasting machine learning model with better performance and accuracy. The model’s precision and effectiveness are estimated (i) with all the features in the dataset, (ii) with essential features obtained using the learning algorithm’s inbuilt ‘feature_importances’ method, and (iii) with the significant features obtained through the proposed hybrid feature extraction technique. The validation of the hybrid CFS and RFRFE feature extraction approach in terms of evaluation metrics, predictive accuracies, and diagnostic plot performance analysis in comparison with random forest, decision tree, and gradient boosting machine learning algorithms are found to be profoundly satisfying. © 2020 by the authors.

Machine learning (ML) is an essential approach for achieving practical and effective solutions for this problem. Many comparisons of ML methods for yield prediction have been made, seeking for the most accurate technique. Generally, the number of evaluated crops and techniques is too low and does not provide enough information for agricultural planning purposes. This paper compares the predictive accuracy of ML and linear regression techniques for crop yield prediction in ten crop datasets. Multiple linear regression, M5-Prime regression trees, perceptron multilayer neural networks, support vector regression and k-nearest neighbor methods were ranked. Four accuracy metrics were used to validate the models: the root mean square error (RMS), root relative square error (RRSE), normalized mean absolute error (MAE), and correlation factor (R). Real data of an irrigation zone of Mexico were used for building the models. Models were tested with samples of two consecutive years. The results show that M5- Prime and k-nearest neighbor techniques obtain the lowest average RMSE errors (5.14 and 4.91), the lowest RRSE errors (79.46% and 79.78%), the lowest average MAE errors (18.12% and 19.42%), and the highest average correlation factors (0.41 and 0.42). Since M5-Prime achieves the largest number of crop yield models with the lowest errors, it is a very suitable tool for massive crop yield prediction in agricultural planning.","K-nearest neighbor; Multiple linear regression; Neural networks; Regression trees; Support vector regression",,Article,Scopus

Economical and rapid means of identifying spatial variability is obtained through the use of geotechnology (remotely sensed images of the crop field, image processing, GIS modeling approach, and GPS usage) and data mining techniques for model development. Higher-end image processing techniques are followed to establish more precision. The goal of this paper was to investigate the strength of key spectral vegetation indices for agricultural crop yield prediction using neural network techniques. Four widely used spectral indices were investigated in a study of irrigated corn crop yields in the Oakes Irrigation Test Area research site of North Dakota, USA. These indices were: (a) red and near-infrared (NIR) based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), (b) green and NIR based green vegetation index (GVI), (c) red and NIR based soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and (d) red and NIR based perpendicular vegetation index (PVI). These four indices were investigated for corn yield during 3 years (1998, 1999, and 2001) and for the pooled data of these 3 years. Initially, Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN) models were developed, including 16 models (4 indices * 4 years including the data from the pooled years) to test for the efficiency determination of those four vegetation indices in corn crop yield prediction. The corn yield was best predicted using BPNN models that used the means and standard deviations of PVI grid images. In all three years, it provided higher prediction accuracies, coefficient of determination (r2), and lower standard error of prediction than the models involving GVI, NDVI, and SAVI image information. The GVI, NDVI, and SAVI models for all three years provided average testing prediction accuracies of 24.26% to 94.85%, 19.36% to 95.04%, and 19.24% to 95.04%, respectively while the PVI models for all three years provided average testing prediction accuracies of 83.50% to 96.04%. The PVI pool model provided better average testing prediction accuracy of 94% with respect to other vegetation models, for which it ranged from 89-93%. Similarly, the PVI pool model provided coefficient of determination (r2) value of 0.45 as compared to 0.31-0.37 for other index models. Log10 data transformation technique was used to enhance the prediction ability of the PVI models of years 1998, 1999, and 2001 as it was chosen as the preferred index. Another model (Transformed PVI (Pool)) was developed using the log10 transformed PVI image information to show its global application. The transformed PVI models provided average corn yield prediction accuracies of 90%, 97%, and 98% for years 1998, 1999, and 2001, respectively. The pool PVI transformed model provided as average testing accuracy of 93% along with r2 value of 0.72 and standard error of prediction of 0.05 t/ha. © 2010 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International, Basel, Switzerland.","Back propagation neural network (BPNN); Data mining; Green vegetation index (GVI); Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); Perpendicular vegetation index (PVI); Soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI); Yield estimation","Back-propagation neural networks; Green vegetation index (GVI); Normalized difference vegetation index; Perpendicular vegetation index; Yield estimation; Backpropagation; Crops; Data mining; Forecasting; Image processing; Imaging systems; Infrared devices; Investments; Lakes; Metadata; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Standards; Vegetation",Article,Scopus

We evaluated a machine-learning method, Random Forests (RF), for its ability to predict crop yield responses to climate and biophysical variables at global and regional scales in wheat, maize, and potato in comparison with multiple linear regressions (MLR) serving as a benchmark. We used crop yield data from various sources and regions for model training and testing: 1) gridded global wheat grain yield, 2) maize grain yield from US counties over thirty years, and 3) potato tuber and maize silage yield from the northeastern seaboard region. RF was found highly capable of predicting crop yields and outperformed MLR benchmarks in all performance statistics that were compared. For example, the root mean square errors (RMSE) ranged between 6 and 14% of the average observed yield with RF models in all test cases whereas these values ranged from 14% to 49% for MLR models. Our results show that RF is an effective and versatile machine-learning method for crop yield predictions at regional and global scales for its high accuracy and precision, ease of use, and utility in data analysis.

Several parameters such as weather, pests, biophysical and physio morphological features merit their consideration while determining the yield. However, these parameters are uncertain in their nature, thus making the determined amount of yield to be approximate. It is exactly here that the fuzzy logic comes into play. This paper elaborates an attempt to develop fuzzy inference systems for crop yield prediction. Physio morphological features of Sorghum were considered. A huge database (around 1000 records) of physio morphological features such as days of 50 percent flowering, dead heart percentage, plant height, panicle length, panicle weight and number of primaries and the corresponding yield were considered for the development of the model. In order to find out the sensitivity of parameters, one-to-one, two-to-one and three-to-one combinations of input and output were considered. The results have clearly shown that panicle length contributes for the yield as the lone parameter with almost one-to-one matching between predicted yield and actual value while panicle length and panicle weight in combination seemed to play a decisive role in contributing for the yield with the prediction accuracy reflected by very low RMS value. © de Gruyter 2012.","Approximate Reasoning; Crop Yield; Fuzzy Logic; Fuzzy Rule Base; Membership Functions; Physio-Morphological Features","Agricultural activities; Approximate reasoning; Crop yield; Fuzzy inference systems; Fuzzy rule base; Input and outputs; Market requirements; Morphological features; Panicle length; Physio-Morphological Features; Plant height; Predicted yield; Prediction accuracy; Sensitivity of parameters; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy systems; Membership functions; Uncertainty analysis; Agriculture",Article,Scopus

A set of nine regional configurations with eight regional models from the ENSEMBLES project is evaluated. Although they are all based on similar large-scale conditions, the performances of regional models in reproducing the most crucial variables for crop production are extremely variable. This therefore leads to a large dispersion in crop yield prediction when using regional models in a climate/crop modelling system. This dispersion comes from the different physics in each regional model and also the choice of parametrizations for a single regional model. Indeed, two configurations of the same regional model are sometimes more distinct than two different regional models. Promising results are obtained when applying a bias correction technique to climate model outputs. Simulated yields with bias corrected climate variables show much more realistic means and standard deviations. However, such a bias correction technique is not able to improve the reproduction of the year-to-year variations of simulated yields. This study confirms the importance of the multi-model approach for quantifying uncertainties for impact studies and also stresses the benefits of combining both regional and statistical downscaling techniques.

Farmers must have advance knowledge about predicted crop production and crop condition within particular area to make economic and farming decisions. To generate yield, we consider factors like temperature, humidity, pressure, NDVI values, Latitude, Longitude etc. When cultivating a particular crop on a specific type of soil, there are a number of factors to be considered. A crop recommender system considers soil properties such as N, P, and K, as well as other factors like rainfall, humidity, and pH levels, to choose the best crop for the farm. This paper presents a predictive algorithm that would estimate crop yield using deep neural networks with geographical data. A recommendation system was built using machine learning algorithm like Xgboost to recommend the suitable crop. A user interface named CROPUP has been developed to scale up crop productivity and efficiency using the proposed algorithms. © 2022 The authors.","Crop Yield; Deep Neural Networks; Geographical data; Recommendation; Xgboost",,Article,Scopus

In contrast to conventional regression-based yield prediction methods, a very broad range of possible input features and their combinations are exhaustively tested for maximum explanatory power. Weather variables such as temperature, precipitation, and sunshine duration are aggregated over different seasonal time periods preceding the harvest to 45 potential input features per original variable. In a first step, this large set of features is reduced to those aggregates very probably holding explanatory power for observed yields. The second, computationally demanding step evaluates predictions for all districts with all of their possible combinations. Step three selects those combinations of weather features that showed the highest predictive power across districts. Finally, the district-specific best performing regressions among these are used for actual prediction, and the results are spatially aggregated. To evaluate the new approach, ABSOLUT v1.2 is applied to predict the yields of silage maize, winter wheat, and other major crops in Germany based on two decades of data from about 300 districts. It turned out to be absolutely crucial to not only make out-of-sample predictions (solely based on data excluding the target year to predict) but to also consequently separate training and testing years in the process of feature selection. Otherwise, the prediction accuracy would be over-estimated by far. The question arises whether performances claimed for other statistical modelling examples are often upward-biased through input variable selection disregarding the out-of-sample principle. © 2022, The Author(s).","Crop yield modelling; Machine learning; Multiple linear regression; Statistical inference; Weather-based yield prediction","crop; season; statistical model; weather; wheat; Crops, Agricultural; Linear Models; Seasons; Triticum; Weather",Article,Scopus

This study’s objective was to compare techniques to quantify the relationship between soil and topographic characteristics for predicting crop yield using high-resolution data and analytical techniques. The study was conducted on a multiple field dataset located in Southwestern Ontario, Canada, where few studies have assessed the impact of applications for precision agriculture and machine learning (ML) to the soil property-yield relationship in this region. The dataset included 145,500 observations of corn and soybean yield, topographic and soil nutrient characteristics. The attributes considered for this study included pH, soil organic matter (OM) content, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil test phosphorus, zinc (Zn), potassium (K), elevation and topographic wetness index. Multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural networks, decision trees and random forests were compared to identify methods able to relate soil properties and crop yields on a subfield scale (2 m). Random forests were the most successful at predicting yield with an R2 value of 0.85 for corn and 0.94 for soybeans. MLR was the least successful with an R2 of 0.40 for corn and 0.45 for soybeans. Cross-validation experiments showed that random forest models in most cases could predict low- and high-yield areas from fields excluded from training datasets, but this was not possible in all cases. Techniques tested the models and identified significant soil and topographic attributes when predicting yield, though the identification was subject to some uncertainty. These results suggest that ML techniques might be used to predict high yield areas of fields without existing yield maps, if those fields have similar relationships of soil properties to yield. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Phosphorus; Regression; Spatial cross-validation; Spatial data mining; Variable importance; Yield","cation exchange capacity; crop yield; data mining; data set; machine learning; model validation; potassium; precision agriculture; regression analysis; soil nutrient; soil organic matter; soybean; statistical analysis; training; Ontario [Canada]",Article,Scopus

As an object-based method, it is spatially scalable from parcel to regional scale, making it useful for prediction tasks in which the reference data are available only at a coarser level, such as counties. We show that deep learning-based temporal convolutional network (TCN) outperforms the classical machine learning method random forests and produces more accurate results overall than published national crop forecasts. Our novel contribution is to show that mean-aggregated regional predictions with histogram-based features calculated from farm-level observations perform better than other tested approaches. In addition, TCN is robust to the presence of cloudy pixels, suggesting TCN can learn cloud masking from the data. The temporal compositing of information do not improve prediction performance.

This study aims to develop a crop yield forecasting model at large spatial scales using meteorological variables closely related to crop growth. The influence of climate patterns on agricultural productivity can be spatially inhomogeneous due to local soil and environmental conditions. We propose a Bayesian spatially varying functional model (BSVFM) to predict county-level corn yield for five Midwestern states, based on annual precipitation and daily maximum and minimum temperature trajectories modeled as multivariate functional predictors. The proposed model accommodates spatial correlation and measurement errors of functional predictors, and respects the spatially heterogeneous relationship between the response and associated predictors by allowing the functional coefficients to vary over space. The model also incorporates a Bayesian variable selection device to further expand its capacity to accommodate spatial heterogeneity. The proposed method is demonstrated to outperform other highly competitive methods in corn yield prediction, owing to the flexibility of allowing spatial heterogeneity with spatially varying coefficients in our model.

Five ML models (linear regression, LASSO, LightGBM, random forest, and XGBoost) and six ensemble models have been designed to address the research question.

The results of sensitivity analysis showed that the yields of maize and soybean were both extremely sensitive to the reference harvest index (HI0) and the parameters of canopy growth and root growth. The difference was that maize was more sensitive to the canopy decline coefficient (CDC), while soybean was more sensitive to the shape factor for water stress coefficient for canopy expansion (Pexshp). Maize was more sensitive to the maximum effective rooting depth (Zx) because of its deep root, while soybean was more sensitive to the shape factor describing root zone expansion (Rexshp) because of its short roots. Maize was extremely sensitive to the crop coefficient before canopy formation and senescence (KcTr,x) and the normalized water productivity (WP*) due to the large water demand, while soybean was only generally sensitive. After calibrated the high sensitivity parameters with experiment data, the regression coefficient of simulated yield and measured yield of maize increased from 0.34 to 0.89, and the regression coefficient of simulated yield and measured yield of soybean increased from 0.80 to 0.88.

In previous studies, remote sensing data or climate data are often used alone in statistical yield estimation models. In this study, we synthetically used agrometeorological indicators and remote sensing vegetation parameters to estimate maize yield in Jilin and Liaoning Provinces of China. We applied two methods to select input variables, used the random forest method to establish yield estimation models, and verified the accuracy of the models in three disaster years (1997, 2000, and 2001). The results show that the R2 values of the eight yield estimation models established in the two provinces were all above 0.7, Lin’s concordance correlation coefficients were all above 0.84, and the mean absolute relative errors were all below 0.14. The mean absolute relative error of the yield estimations in the three disaster years was 0.12 in Jilin Province and 0.13 in Liaoning Province. A model built using variables selected by a two-stage importance evaluation method can obtain a better accuracy with fewer variables. The final yield estimation model of Jilin province adopts eight independent variables, and the final yield estimation model of Liaoning Province adopts nine independent variables. Among the 11 adopted variables in two provinces, ATT (accumulated temperature above 10◦C) variables accounted for the highest proportion (54.54%). In addition, the GPP (gross primary production) anomaly in August, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) anomaly in August, and standardized precipitation index with a two-month scale in July were selected as important modeling variables by all methods in the two provinces. This study provides a reference method for the selection of modeling variables, and the results are helpful for understanding the impact of climate on potential yield. © 2021 by the authors.

As a result, it is of great importance to construct powerful predictive models for phenotype prediction based on Genotype and Environment data (so-called G by E problem). The objective of the G by E analysis is to understand how genotype and the environment jointly determine the phenotype (such as crop yield and disease resistance) of plant or animal species. In this research, deep neural networks are trained and used as predictive models. Deep neural networks have become a popular tool in supervise learning due to considerable ability in training nonlinear features [5]. Recent articles have stated that the network depth is a vital factor in decreasing classification or regression error. But, deeper networks have a so-called vanishing/exploding gradients problem which makes the training and optimizing deeper networks difficult. He et al. proposed residual learning method which alleviates this problem very well and showed that deep residual networks are significantly better and more efficient than previous typical networks [5]. As a result, residual training has been used in this research to prevent gradient degradation and ease the optimization process. Finally, since it is difficult to predict the yield difference directly, two separate residual neural networks have been trained to predict yield and check yield. After training the networks, the RMSE for check yield and yield are 8.23 and 10.52, respectively, which are very good because of considerable amount of missing values, uncertainty, and complexity in the datasets. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Deep neural networks; G-by-E interaction analysis; Machine learning; Supervised learning",,Conference Paper,Scopus

It relay on weather and other environmental aspects. Some of the factors on which agriculture is dependent are Soil, climate, flooding, fertilizers, temperature, precipitation, crops, insecticides and herb. The crop yield is dependent on these factors and hence difficult to predict. To know the status of crop production, in this work we perform descriptive study on agricultural data using various machine learning techniques. Crop yield estimates include estimating crop yields from available historical data such as precipitation data, soil data, and historic crop yields. This prediction will help farmers to predict crop yield before farming. Here we are utilizing three datasets like as clay dataset, precipitation dataset, and production dataset of Karnataka state, then we structure an assembled data sets and on this dataset we employ three different algorithms to get the genuine assessed yield and the precision of three different methods. K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Support Vector Machine(SVM), and Decision tree algorithms are applied on the training dataset and are tested with the test dataset, and the implementation of these algorithms is done using python programming and spyder tool. The performance comparison of algorithms is shown using mean absolute error, cross validation and accuracy and it is found that Decision tree is giving accuracy of 99% with very less mean square error(MSE).

Accurate yield prediction requires fundamental understanding of the functional relationship between yield and these interactive factors, and to reveal such relationship requires both comprehensive datasets and powerful algorithms. In the 2018 Syngenta Crop Challenge, Syngenta released several large datasets that recorded the genotype and yield performances of 2,267 maize hybrids planted in 2,247 locations between 2008 and 2016 and asked participants to predict the yield performance in 2017. As one of the winning teams, we designed a deep neural network (DNN) approach that took advantage of state-of-the-art modeling and solution techniques. Our model was found to have a superior prediction accuracy, with a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) being 12% of the average yield and 50% of the standard deviation for the validation dataset using predicted weather data. With perfect weather data, the RMSE would be reduced to 11% of the average yield and 46% of the standard deviation. We also performed feature selection based on the trained DNN model, which successfully decreased the dimension of the input space without significant drop in the prediction accuracy. Our computational results suggested that this model significantly outperformed other popular methods such as Lasso, shallow neural networks (SNN), and regression tree (RT). The results also revealed that environmental factors had a greater effect on the crop yield than genotype. © 2019 Khaki and Wang.","Deep learning; Feature selection; Machine learning; Weather prediction; Yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

From a modelling perspective, agroforestry has received much less attention than monocultures. However, for the potential of agroforestry to impact food security in Africa to be fully evaluated, models are required that accurately predict crop yields in the presence of trees. The positive effects of the fertiliser tree gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) on maize (Zea mays) are well documented and use of this tree-crop combination to increase crop production is expanding in several African countries. Simulation of gliricidia-maize interactions can complement field trials by predicting crop response across a broader range of contexts than can be achieved by experimentation alone. We tested a model developed within the APSIM framework. APSIM models are widely used for one dimensional (1D), process-based simulation of crops such as maize and wheat in monoculture. The Next Generation version of APSIM was used here to test a 2D agroforestry model where maize growth and yield varied spatially in response to interactions with gliricidia. The simulations were done using data for gliricidia-maize interactions over two years (short-term) in Kenya and 11 years (long-term) in Malawi, with differing proportions of trees and crops and contrasting management. Predictions were compared with observations for maize grain yield, and soil water content. Simulations in Kenya were in agreement with observed yields reflecting lower observed maize germination in rows close to gliricidia. Soil water content was also adequately simulated, except for a tendency for slower simulated drying of the soil profile each season. Simulated maize yields in Malawi were also in agreement with observations. Trends in soil carbon over a decade were similar to those measured, but could not be statistically evaluated. These results show that the agroforestry model in APSIM Next Generation adequately represented tree-crop interactions in these two contrasting agro-ecological conditions and agroforestry practices. Further testing of the model is warranted to explore tree-crop interactions under a wider range of environmental conditions. © 2017","Alley cropping; Competition; Hedgerow; Intercropping; Nitrogen; Water","agricultural management; agricultural modeling; agroforestry; alley cropping; competition (ecology); crop production; crop yield; growth; hedgerow; intercropping; interspecific interaction; maize; monoculture; nitrogen; one-dimensional modeling; prediction; tree; two-dimensional modeling; water uptake; Africa; Gliricidia; Gliricidia sepium; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Crop growth models have been considered as potential tools for simulating growth and yield of crops. Hence, DSSAT v 4.5/ CERES-Rice (Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer / Crop Estimation through Resource and Environment Synthesis) was applied to validate the Rice productivity from Bihar State in India. Long term historical weather data (1980-2011) and (1985-2011) from South and North West Alluvial plane zones of Bihar was used for yield analysis. Genetic coefficients required for running the CERES-Rice vs 4.5 model were derived and the performance of the model was tested under the climate variability conditions experienced by these two agroclimatic zones. Management combinations simulated were three transplanting dates (1st, 15th &amp; 30th July) for rice cultivar Rmansuri under rainfed conditions. The results indicated that both the early and late sowing dates result in lower yields as compared to optimum sowing date of 15th July. The simulated phenology and yield were found to be in agreement with observed data suggesting that the calibrated model may be operationally used with routinely observed soil, crop management and weather parameters for Rice yield estimation from these two regions of Bihar. The analysis also brought out that the yield differences under potential and rainfed condition during the study period, was influenced by variations in thermal, radiation regime as well as moisture regimes. The results showed that phenological stage of panicle initiation to grain filling is sensitive to water and Nitrogen availability status in the Rice Crop. This model is also satisfactory in predicting the Rice phenology. These results indicate that the CERES rice vs 4.5 models is capable of estimating growth stages and grain yield of rice cultivar Rmansuri in climatic conditions of Bihar with reasonable accuracy and hence show potential for its use as a tool in making various strategic and tactical decisions related to Agriculture planning in the state of Bihar. © 2014, India Meteorological Department.

A fairer comparison should include the best subset of features for each regression technique; an evaluation including several crops is preferred. This paper evaluates the most common data-driven modeling techniques applied to yield prediction, using a complete method to define the best attribute subset for each model. Multiple linear regression, stepwise linear regression, M5′ regression trees, and artificial neural networks (ANN) were ranked.

To validate the models, three accuracy metrics were used: the root relative square error (RRSE), relative mean absolute error (RMAE), and correlation factor (R).

In order to optimally control greenhouses’ environmental parameters, one indispensable requirement is to accurately predict crop yields based on given environmental parameter settings. In addition, crop yield forecasting in greenhouses plays an important role in greenhouse farming planning and management, which allows cultivators and farmers to utilize the yield prediction results to make knowledgeable management and financial decisions. It is thus important to accurately predict the crop yield in a greenhouse considering the benefits that can be brought by accurate greenhouse crop yield prediction. In this work, we have developed a new greenhouse crop yield prediction technique, by combining two state-of-the-arts networks for temporal sequence processing—temporal convolutional network (TCN) and recurrent neural network (RNN). Comprehensive evaluations of the proposed algorithm have been made on multiple datasets obtained from multiple real greenhouse sites for tomato growing. Based on a statistical analysis of the root mean square errors (RMSEs) between the predicted and actual crop yields, it is shown that the proposed approach achieves more accurate yield prediction performance than both traditional machine learning methods and other classical deep neural networks. Moreover, the experimental study also shows that the historical yield information is the most important factor for accurately predicting future crop yields. © 2021 by the authors.

Others are knowledge driven, which focus on integrating scientific understanding of crop growth mechanism in the modeling structure.

While yield prediction with remote sensing has been a research aim for years, it is only recently that observations with the suited spatial and temporal resolutions have become accessible to improve crop yield predictions. Here we developed a yield prediction framework that integrates daily high-resolution (3 m) CubeSat imagery into the APSIM crop model. The approach trains a regression model that correlates simulated yield to simulated leaf area index (LAI) from APSIM. That relationship is then employed to determine the optimum date at which the regression best predicts yield from the LAI. Additionally, our approach can forecast crop yield by utilizing a particle filter to assimilate CubeSat-based LAI in the model APSIM to generate yield maps at 3 m several weeks before the optimum regression date. Our method was evaluated for a rainfed site located in the US Corn belt, using a collection of spatially varying yield data. The proposed approach does not need in situ data to rain the regression, with outcomes reporting that even with a single assimilation step, accurate yield predictions were provided up to 21 days before the optimum regression date. The spatial variability of crop yield was reproduced fairly well, with a good correlation against in situ measurements (R2 Combining double low line 0.73 and RMSE Combining double low line 1.69), demonstrating that high-resolution yield predictions early in the season have great potential to meet and improve upon digital agricultural goals. © Authors 2022","APSIM; Crop modeling; Crop yield prediction; CubeSat; LAI; Particle filter","Crops; Cultivation; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; APSIM; Crop modeling; Crop yield; Crop yield prediction; Cubesat; Field crops; High resolution; Leaf Area Index; Particle filter; Yield prediction; Monte Carlo methods",Conference Paper,Scopus

The data and methods they used may not be transferable to other crops and locations. On the other hand, operational large-scale systems, such as the European Commission's MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS), do not use machine learning. Machine learning is a promising method especially when large amounts of data are being collected and published. We combined agronomic principles of crop modeling with machine learning to build a machine learning baseline for large-scale crop yield forecasting. The baseline is a workflow emphasizing correctness, modularity and reusability. For correctness, we focused on designing explainable predictors or features (in relation to crop growth and development) and applying machine learning without information leakage. We created features using crop simulation outputs and weather, remote sensing and soil data from the MCYFS database. We emphasized a modular and reusable workflow to support different crops and countries with small configuration changes. The workflow can be used to run repeatable experiments (e.g. early season or end of season predictions) using standard input data to obtain reproducible results. The results serve as a starting point for further optimizations. In our case studies, we predicted yield at regional level for five crops (soft wheat, spring barley, sunflower, sugar beet, potatoes) and three countries (the Netherlands (NL), Germany (DE), France (FR)). We compared the performance with a simple method with no prediction skill, which either predicted a linear yield trend or the average of the training set. We also aggregated the predictions to the national level and compared with past MCYFS forecasts. The normalized RMSE (NRMSE) for early season predictions (30 days after planting) were comparable for NL (all crops), DE (all except soft wheat) and FR (soft wheat, spring barley, sunflower). For example, NRMSE was 7.87 for soft wheat (NL) (6.32 for MCYFS) and 8.21 for sugar beet (DE) (8.79 for MCYFS). In contrast, NRMSEs for soft wheat (DE), sugar beet (FR) and potatoes (FR) were twice as much compared to MCYFS. NRMSEs for end of season were still comparable to MCYFS for NL, but worse for DE and FR. The baseline can be improved by adding new data sources, designing more predictive features and evaluating different machine learning algorithms. The baseline will motivate the use of machine learning in large-scale crop yield forecasting. © 2020 The Authors","Crop yield prediction; Large-scale crop yield forecasting; Machine learning; Modularity; Reusability","Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Helianthus; Hordeum; Solanum tuberosum",Article,Scopus

Remote sensing is becoming increasingly important in crop yield prediction. Based on remote sensing data, great progress has been made in this field by using machine learning, especially the Deep Learning (DL) method, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Recent experiments in this area suggested that CNN can explore more spatial features and LSTM has the ability to reveal phenological characteristics, which both play an important role in crop yield prediction. However, very few experiments combining these two models for crop yield prediction have been reported. In this paper, we propose a deep CNN-LSTM model for both end-of-season and in-season soybean yield prediction in CONUS at the county-level. The model was trained by crop growth variables and environment variables, which include weather data, MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) data, and MODIS Surface Reflectance (SR) data; historical soybean yield data were employed as labels. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), all these training data were combined and transformed into histogram-based tensors for deep learning. The results of the experiment indicate that the prediction performance of the proposed CNN-LSTM model can outperform the pure CNN or LSTM model in both end-of-season and in-season.

While the remote sensing of within-field insights has been a research goal for many years, it is only recently that observations with the required spatio-temporal resolutions, together with efficient assimilation methods to integrate these into modeling frameworks, have become available to advance yield prediction efforts. Here we explore a yield prediction approach that combines daily high-resolution CubeSat imagery with the APSIM crop model. The approach employs APSIM to train a linear regression that relates simulated yield to simulated leaf area index (LAI). That relationship is then used to identify the optimal regression date at which the LAI provides the best prediction of yield: in this case, approximately 14 weeks prior to harvest. Instead of applying the regression on satellite imagery that is coincident, or closest to, the regression date, our method implements a particle filter that integrates CubeSat-based LAI into APSIM to provide end-of-season high-resolution (3 m) yield maps weeks before the optimal regression date. The approach is demonstrated on a rainfed maize field located in Nebraska, USA, where suitable collections of both imagery and in-situ data were available for assessment. The procedure does not require in-field data to calibrate the regression model, with results showing that even with a single assimilation step, it is possible to provide yield estimates with good accuracy up to 21 days before the optimal regression date. Yield spatial variability was reproduced reasonably well, with a strong correlation to independently collected measurements (R2 = 0.73 and rRMSE = 12%). When the field averaged yield was compared, our approach reduced yield prediction error from 1 Mg/ha (control case based on a calibrated APSIM model), to 0.5 Mg/ha (using satellite imagery alone), and then to 0.2 Mg/ha (results with assimilation up to three weeks prior to the optimal regression date). Such a capacity to provide spatially explicit yield predictions early in the season has considerable potential to enhance digital agricultural goals and improve end-of-season yield predictions. © 2021 The Author(s)","APSIM; Crop modeling; Crop yield prediction; CubeSat; Data assimilation; LAI","crop yield; leaf area index; maize; prediction; satellite imagery; yield response; Nebraska; United States",Article,Scopus

In this study, we used three main machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, neural network) and one multiple linear regression method, namely Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), to predict yields of the main food staple crops (peanut, maize, millet and sorghum) in 24 departments of Senegal. Three combination of predictors (climate data, vegetation data or a combination of both) are used to compare the respective contribution of statistical methods and inputs in the predictive skill. Our results showed that the combination of climate and vegetation with the machine learning methods gives the best performance. The best prediction skill is obtained for peanut yield likely due to its high sensitivity to interannual climate variability. Although more research is needed to integrate the results of this study into an operational framework, this paper provides evidence of the promising performance machine learning methods.

Advanced development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) based systems redesigned “smart agriculture”. This emergence in innovative farming systems gradually increases crop yields, reduces irrigation wastages and making it more profitable. Machine learning (ML) methods achieve the requirement of scaling the learning performance of the model. This paper introduces a hybrid ML model with IoT for yield prediction. This work involves three phases: pre-processing, feature selection (FS) and classification. Initially, the dataset is pre-processed and FS is done on the basis of Correlation based FS (CBFS) and the Variance Inflation Factor algorithm (VIF). Finally, a two-tier ML model for an IoT based smart agriculture system is proposed. In the first tier, the Adaptive k-Nearest Centroid Neighbour Classifier (aKNCN) model is proposed to estimate the soil quality and to classify the soil samples into different classes based on the input soil properties. In the second tier, the crop yield is predicted using the Extreme Learning Machine algorithm (ELM). In the optimized strategy, the weights are updated using a modified Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (mBOA) to improve the performance accuracy of ELM with minimum error values. PYTHON is the implementation tool for evaluating the proposed system. Soil dataset is utilized for performance evaluation of the proposed prediction model. Various metrics such as accuracy, RMSE, R2, MSE, MedAE, MAE, MSLE, MAPE and Explained Variance Score (EVS) are considered for the performance evaluation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Agriculture; Classification; Crop yield prediction; IoT; Machine learning; Sensors","Crops; Forecasting; Internet of things; Nearest neighbor search; Soils; Agriculture systems; Classification prediction; Crop yield; Crop yield prediction; Features selection; Machine algorithm; Machine learning models; Performances evaluation; Smart agricultures; Yield prediction; Machine learning",Article,Scopus

In this study, we propose a methodology for the early prediction of rice yield at pixel scale combining a crop model and a deep learning model for different agricultural systems throughout South and North Korea. Initially, satellite-integrated crop models were applied to obtain a pixel-scale reference rice yield. Then, the pixel-scale reference rice yields were used as target labels in the deep learning model to leverage the advantages of crop models. Models of five different deep learning network architectures were employed to help determine the hybrid structure of long-short term memory (LSTM) and one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) layers by predicting the optimal model about two months ahead of harvest time. The suggested model showed good performance [R2 = 0.859, Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency = 0.858, root mean squared error = 0.605 Mg ha−1], with specific spatial patterns of rice yields for South and North Korea. Analysis of the relative importance of the input variables showed the water-related index and maximum temperature in North Korea and the vegetation indices and geographic variables in South Korea to be crucial for predicting rice yields.

The use of Earth Observation (EO) data allows crop monitoring at a range of spatial scales, but can be hampered by limitations in the data. Crop growth modelling, on the other hand, can be used to simulate the physiological processes that result in crop development. Data assimilation (DA) provides a way of blending the monitoring properties of EO data with the predictive and explanatory abilities of crop growth models. In this paper, we first provide a critique of both the advantages and disadvantages of both EO data and crop growth models. We use this to introduce a solid and robust framework for DA, where different DA methods are shown to be derived from taking different assumptions in solving for the a posteriori probability density function (pdf) using Bayes’ rule. This treatment allows us to provide some recommendation on the choice of DA method for particular applications. We comment on current computational challenges in scaling DA applications to large spatial scales. Future areas of research are sketched, with an emphasis on DA as an enabler for blending different observations, as well as facilitating different approaches to crop growth models.

The crop fractions, as well as total weight of crop and weeds aboveground biomass, were used as the indicators of crop status. As a result of investigations it was found that NDVI in the middle of the growing season is predefined by the combined effect of cultivated plants and weeds, and at the end of the season the role of weeds becomes predominant. Theoretically, NDVI for this period can be used as a proxy of general weedness of crops. In the case of NDVI usage as a predictor of crop yields it seems better to use index values, received during the first half of the vegetative season. Based on specifics of crop phenology and physiology, one can conclude that the same results can be received not only for barley, but also for wheat, triticale, and rye.

Though successful, machine learning models generated within a specific spatial domain often lose their validity when directly applied to new regions. To address this issue, we designed an unsupervised adaptive domain adversarial neural network (ADANN). Specifically, through domain adversarial training, the ADANN model reduced the impact of domain shift by projecting data from different domains into the same subspace. Also, the ADANN model was designed to be trained in an adaptive way, which guaranteed the model can learn the domain-invariant features and perform accurate yield prediction simultaneously. Informative variables including time-series vegetation indices and sequential weather observations were first collected from multiple data sources and aggregated to the county level. Then, we trained the ADANN model with the extracted features and corresponding reported county-level corn yield from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Finally, the trained model was evaluated in four testing years 2016–2019. The U.S. corn belt was used as the study area and counties under study were grouped into two diverse ecological regions. The experimental results showed that the developed ADANN model had better performance than three other state-of-the-art machine learning models in both local experiments (train and test in the same region) and transfer experiments (train and test in different regions).

Currently, crop models are widely used for crop yield prediction. However, they are hampered by the uncertainty or similarity of input parameters when extrapolated to field scale. Data assimilation methods that combine crop models and remote sensing are the most effective methods for field yield estimation. In this study, the World Food Studies (WOFOST) model is used to simulate the growing process of spring maize. Common assimilation methods face some difficulties due to the scarce, constant, or similar nature of the input parameters. For example, yield spatial heterogeneity simulation, coexistence of common assimilation methods and the nutrient module, and time cost are relatively important limiting factors. To address the yield simulation problems at field scale, a simple yet effective method with fast algorithms is presented for assimilating the time-series HJ-1 A/B data into the WOFOST model in order to improve the spring maize yield simulation. First, the WOFOST model is calibrated and validated to obtain the precise mean yield. Second, the time-series leaf area index (LAI) is calculated from the HJ data using an empirical regression model. Third, some fast algorithms are developed to complete assimilation. Finally, several experiments are conducted in a large farmland (Hongxing) to evaluate the yield simulation results. In general, the results indicate that the proposed method reliably improves spring maize yield estimation in terms of spatial heterogeneity simulation ability and prediction accuracy without affecting the simulation efficiency. © 2016 by the authors.","Fast assimilation algorithms; Prediction accuracy; Remote sensing; Spatial heterogeneity; WOFOST model; Yield simulation","Agriculture; Crops; Decision making; Digital storage; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Time series; Assimilation algorithms; Prediction accuracy; Spatial heterogeneity; Wofost models; Yield simulation; Algorithms",Article,Scopus

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide a fast and convenient approach to crop yield prediction, but most existing crop yield models have rarely been tested across different years, cultivars and sensors. This has limited the ability of these yield models to be transferred to other years or regions or to be potentially used with data from other sensors. In this study, UAV-based multispectral imagery was used to predict rice grain yield at the booting and filling stages from four field experiments, involving three years, two rice cultivars, and two UAV sensors. Reflectance and texture features were extracted from the UAV imagery, and vegetation indices (VIs) and normalized difference texture indices (NDTIs) were computed. The models were independently validated to test the stability and transferability across years, rice cultivars, and sensors. The results showed that the red edge normalized difference texture index (RENDTI) was superior to other texture indices and vegetation indices for model regression with grain yield in most cases. However, the green normalized difference texture index (GNDTI) achieved the highest prediction accuracy in model validation across rice cultivars and sensors. The yield prediction model of Japonica rice achieved stronger transferability to Indica rice with root mean square error (RMSE), bias, and relative RMSE (RRMSE) of 1.16 t/ha, 0.08, and 11.04%, respectively. Model transferability was improved significantly between different sensors after band correction with a decrease of 15.05–59.99% in RRMSE. Random forest (RF) was found to be a good solution to improve the model transferability across different years and cultivars and obtained the highest prediction accuracy with RMSE, bias, and RRMSE of 0.94 t/ha, −0.21, and 9.37%, respectively.

However, past experience has shown that the empirical nature of the VI based models and the intensive data requirement of the complex mechanistic models has limited their use for regional and spatial crop yield prediction especially for operational use. The present study was aimed at development of an intermediate method based on the use of remote sensing and the physiological concepts such as the photo-synthetically active solar radiation (PAR) and the fraction of PAR absorbed by the crop (fAPAR) in Monteith's radiation use efficiency based equation (Monteith, 1977) for operational wheat yield forecasting by the Department of Agriculture (DoA). Net Primary Product (NPP) has been computed using the Monteith model and stress has been applied to convert the potential NPP to actual NPP. Wheat grain yield has been computed using the actual NPP and Harvest index. Kalpana-VHRR insolation has been used for deriving the PAR. Maximum radiation use efficiency has been collected from literature and wheat crop mask was derived at MNCFC, New Delhi using RS2-AWiFS data. Water stress has been derived from the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) which has been derived periodically from the MODIS surface reflectance data (NIR and SWIR1). Temperature stress has been derived from the interpolated daily mean temperature. Results indicated that this model underestimated the yield by 3.45 % as compared to the reported yield at state level and hence can be used to predict wheat yield at state level. This study will be able to provide the spatial wheat yield map, as well as the district-wise and state level aggregated wheat yield forecast. It is possible to operationalize this remote sensing based modified Monteith's efficiency model for future yield forecasting with around 0.15 t ha-1 RMSE at state level.","K1-VHRR; LSWI; MODIS; Monteith efficiency model; Regional wheat yield; Remote sensing; RS2-AWiFS","Agriculture; Crops; Efficiency; Forecasting; Plants (botany); Radiometers; Solar radiation; Sun; Surface waters; Efficiency models; K1-VHRR; LSWI; MODIS; RS2-AWiFS; Wheat yield; Remote sensing",Conference Paper,Scopus

Crop recommendation for a specific region is a tedious process as it can be affected by various variables such as soil type and climatic parameters. At the same time, crop yield prediction was based on several features like area, irrigation type, temperature, etc. The recent advancements of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models pave the way to design effective crop recommendation and crop prediction models. In this view, this paper presents a novel Multimodal Machine Learning Based Crop Recommendation and Yield Prediction (MMML-CRYP) technique. The proposed MMML-CRYP model mainly focuses on two processes namely crop recommendation and crop prediction. At the initial stage, equilibrium optimizer (EO) with kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) technique is employed for effectual recommendation of crops. Next, random forest (RF) technique was executed for predicting the crop yield accurately. For reporting the improved performance of the MMML-CRYP system, a wide range of simulations were carried out and the results are investigated using benchmark dataset. Experimentation outcomes highlighted the significant performance of the MMML-CRYP approach on the compared approaches with maximum accuracy of 97.91%. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

Evaluating the crop yield based on wheat ears counting is still done manually, which is a labor-intensive, tedious and costly task. Thus, there is a significant need to develop a real-time wheat spikes/ears counting system for plant breeders for effective and efficient crop yield predictions. This paper proposed two deep learning-based methods based on EfficientDet and Faster-RCNN to detect and count the spikes. The images are taken using high-throughput phenotyping techniques under natural field conditions, and the algorithms localize and automatically count wheat spikes/ears.

This work utilizes an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) to capture standard RGB imagery datasets for corn grain yield prediction at three early- to mid-season growth stages. The imagery is processed into simple VI-orthoimages for crop/non-crop classification and 3D CSMs for crop height determination at different spatial resolutions. Three linear regression models are tested on their prediction ability using site-specific (i) unclassified mean heights, (ii) crop-classified mean heights and (iii) a combination of crop-classified mean heights with according crop coverages. The models show determination coefficients R2 of up to 0.74, whereas model (iii) performs best with imagery captured at the end of stem elongation and intermediate spatial resolution (0.04 m·px-1).

The standard WMA models the linguistic information using type-1 (T1) fuzzy sets (FSs), which have a reduced capability to model the semantics of linguistic information. Therefore, we propose a novel Enhanced WMA, which models the linguistic information using the type-2 (T2) FSs. Further, our Enhanced T2 FS-based WMA can be modified to reflect the use of interval type-2 (IT2) FSs, for modelling linguistic uncertainty. IT2 FSs are suitable when better uncertainty handling capabilities are required compared to T1 FSs, however, at a computational cost lesser than the T2 FSs. Performance of Enhanced WMA is demonstrated through a real-world crop-yield prediction problem in smart agriculture and an additional exemplar application on users’ satisfaction ratings. Further, we have compared our approach with the performance obtained from the T1 FS-based WMA and the original estimations given in the original data. We found that our Enhanced WMA provides more precise estimates than the other two with 95% confidence level.

In agriculture, crop yields are increasingly affected by warmer temperatures, and pest infestations caused by climate change have increased agricultural losses. Increasing local production is important to reduce our dependence on imported food and provide a buffer in case of supply disruptions such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. To increase food security, it is important to optimize agricultural yields, despite the high costs associated with factors such as supplemental feeding, pest control measures, or operating costs. We present a Machine Vision method (MV) with Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE) as an approach to crop yield optimization. Predicted leaf area is projected from initial germination to early vegetative stages. Generative machine learning models are analyzed to determine a suitable architecture for crop yield prediction. Images of romaine lettuce grown over time under different conditions (e.g., light intensity) are used as the data set. Preliminary results show that the model created is able to predict an image with sufficient accuracy based on a single condition.

The study was carried out from 2008 to 2017. Aerobiological data were obtained with a Lanzoni VPPS-2000 volumetric sampler, following the Spanish Aerobiological Network protocol. The pollen and flower production was studied on ten vines of the Godello grapevine cultivar. A HOBO Micro Station and a MeteoGalicia station were used to obtain meteorological information. We observed the detrimental effect of rain on airborne pollen presence, and we statistically corroborated the negative effect of high temperatures on fruit set and ripening. We developed an accurate multiple regression model to forecast the grape yield, applying a Spearman’s correlation test to identify the most influential variables.

We jointly model multiple functional predictors that are cross-correlated using multivariate functional principal component analysis (mFPCA), and model the nonparametric effects of the principal component scores as additive components in the PLFAM. To address the high-dimensional nature of functional data, we let the number of mFPCA components diverge to infinity with the sample size, and adopt the component selection and smoothing operator (COSSO) penalty to select relevant components and regularize the fitting. A fundamental difference between our framework and the existing high-dimensional additive models is that the mFPCA scores are estimated with error, and the magnitude of measurement error increases with the order of mFPCA. We establish the asymptotic convergence rate for our estimator, while allowing the number of components diverge. When the number of additive components is fixed, we also establish the asymptotic distribution for the partially linear coefficients.

In most of these models, different equations are parameterized leaving the choice of the equation to the user. However, the impact of the choice of the ET0 equations on crop yield prediction has been little studied. The present study proposes a sensitivity analysis of the impact of the choice of the ET0 equation on simulated millet yields using SARRA-H crop model over 12 Senegalese stations representative of the Sudano-Sahelian climate conditions of West Africa. Priestley-Taylor, a modified Priestley-Taylor and Hargreaves equations lead to simulated yields up to 19% than those calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation. Despite high biases in wind speed, among the tested methods, the Penman-Monteith method remains the most robust to derive ET0 and yield over the major part of Senegal, Hargreaves equation being more appropriated under dry climates. The choice of ET0 formulation introduces uncertainties representing 8% of baseline yield regardless of precipitation changes; for wet conditions these uncertainties approach 30% of the overall climate change impact.

Here, we analyze county-level corn and soybean yields and observed climate for the period 1983-2012 to understand how growing-season (June, July and August) mean T, P and R influence crop yields jointly and in isolation across the CONterminous United States (CONUS). Results show that nationally averaged corn and soybean yields exhibit large interannual variability of 21% and 22%, of which 35% and 32% can be significantly explained by T and P, respectively.

Further analyses indicate large spatial variation in the relative contributions of different climate variables to the variability of historical corn and soybean yields.

To model such areas we need representations that can be reliably estimated already for small parcels and that are invariant to the size of the parcel. We propose representing the parcels using density estimates of remote imaging pixels and provide a computational pipeline that combines the representation with arbitrary supervised learning algorithms, while allowing easy integration of multiple imaging sources.

This paper describes the temporal evolution of sugarcane biophysical parameters, such as total biomass, leaf area index, number of plants per meter, and productivity. During two seasons, a commercial field in Araras/SP, planted with variety SP80-1842, on the 4th and 5th cuts, was monitored on eight different dates, and data were obtained for 2 m of sugarcane in three crop rows at 18 sampling points. Linear and multiple regression analyses were used to study growth analysis and to correlate agronomic variables (leaf area index and number of plants per meter) with biomass and productivity. Gompertz model, a sigmoidal curve, was the best adjustment curve for total biomass and yield in relation to days after cutting (r2 = 0.8987 and r2 = 0.9682, respectively); number of plants and leaf area index showed best fit with a cubic exponential model and a quadratic exponential model, respectively. Total biomass and cane productivity were well correlated with LAI in the first two stages of the sugarcane cycle using linear regression. At the end of the cycle, total biomass and cane productivity were more related to number of plants, and lower r2 values than in other stages were obtained by the models. © 2005, Scientia Agricola.

Combining high-performance computing with innovative technologies of big data processing, machine learning (ML) advances data-intensive science and provides an important supporting frame for crop yield prediction. This paper evaluated the performance of five ML algorithms, including linear regression (LR), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), ensemble learning (EL), and Gaussian process regression (GPR), for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield and dry matter prediction using data collected from previous studies conducted within the last twenty years in the North China Plain (NCP). In addition, winter wheat yield and dry matter were explored using the best algorithm, while polynomial functions were proposed that could describe the relationship of water and nitrogen application with winter wheat yield and dry matter. Results confirmed that the GPR model outperformed all other models for predicting the yield (R2 = 0.87) and dry matter (R2 = 0.86) of winter wheat. The prediction errors of the GPR model for maximum yield and dry matter of winter wheat were 5.8 % and 1.1 %, respectively. The yield and dry matter of winter wheat in the NCP could be predicted by the GPR model and polynomial functions, and the optimal water and nitrogen application for maximum yield and dry matter could be obtained.

Assessing crop yields is key to optimising on-field decisions and defining sustainable agricultural strategies. Remote sensing applications have greatly enhanced our ability to monitor and manage farming operation. The main objective of this research was to evaluate machine learning system for within-field soyayield prediction trained on Sentinel-2 multispectral images and soil parameters. Multispectral images used in the study came from ESA’s Sentinel-2 satellites. A total of 3 cloud-free Sentinel-2 multispectral images per year from specific periods of vegetation were used to obtain the time-series necessary for crop yield prediction. Yield monitor data were collected in three crop seasons (2018, 2019 and 2020) from a number of farms located in Upper Austria. The ground-truth database consisted of information about the location of the fields and crop yield monitor data on 411 ha of farmland. A novel method, namely the Polygon-Pixel Interpolation, for optimal fitting yield monitor data with satellite images is introduced. Several machine learning algorithms, such as Multiple Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Random Forest, were compared for their performance in soya yield prediction. Among the tested machine learning algorithms, Stochastic Gradient Descent regression model performed better than the others, with a mean absolute error of 4.36 kg/pixel (0.436 t/ha) and a correlation coefficient of 0.83%. © 2022 by the authors.

Several studies have recently been conducted to estimate crop LAI using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral and hyperspectral data. However, there are few studies on estimating the LAI of winter wheat using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) RGB images. In this study, we estimated the LAI of winter wheat at the jointing stage on simple farmland in Xinjiang, China, using parameters derived from UAV RGB images. According to gray correlation analysis, UAV RGB-image parameters such as the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI), the Red Green Blue Vegetation Index (RGBVI), the Digital Number (DN) of Blue Channel (B) and the Green Leaf Algorithm (GLA) were selected to develop models for estimating the LAI of winter wheat. The results showed that it is feasible to use UAV RGB images for inverting and mapping the LAI of winter wheat at the jointing stage on the field scale, and the partial least squares regression (PLSR) model based on the VARI, RGBVI, B and GLA had the best prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.776, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.468, residual prediction deviation (RPD) = 1.838) among all the regression models. To conclude, UAV RGB images not only have great potential in estimating the LAI of winter wheat, but also can provide more reliable and accurate data for precision agriculture management. © 2019 by the authors.","Grey correlation analysis; Jointing stage; Leaf area index; UAV; Vegetation indices","accuracy assessment; correlation; crop yield; estimation method; image analysis; leaf area index; parameter estimation; spectral analysis; unmanned vehicle; vegetation index; wheat; winter; China; Xinjiang Uygur; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

This study investigates the links between the large-scale atmospheric circulation and crop yields in Europe, providing the basis to develop seasonal crop yield forecasting and thus enabling a more effective and dynamic adaptation to climate variability and change. Four dominant modes of large-scale atmospheric variability have been used: North Atlantic Oscillation, Eastern Atlantic, Scandinavian and Eastern Atlantic-Western Russia patterns. Large-scale atmospheric circulation explains on average 43% of inter-annual winter wheat yield variability, ranging between 20% and 70% across countries. As for grain maize, the average explained variability is 38%, ranging between 20% and 58%. Spatially, the skill of the developed statistical models strongly depends on the large-scale atmospheric variability impact on weather at the regional level, especially during the most sensitive growth stages of flowering and grain filling. Our results also suggest that preceding atmospheric conditions might provide an important source of predictability especially for maize yields in south-eastern Europe. Since the seasonal predictability of large-scale atmospheric patterns is generally higher than the one of surface weather variables (e.g. precipitation) in Europe, seasonal crop yield prediction could benefit from the integration of derived statistical models exploiting the dynamical seasonal forecast of large-scale atmospheric circulation. © 2017 The Author(s)","Atmospheric variability; Crop yield; Grain maize; NAO; Winter wheat","anomaly; atmospheric circulation; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; crop yield; growth; maize; North Atlantic Oscillation; regional pattern; seed; wheat; Europe; Russian Federation; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

However, ground-based recording networks are not available at spatial and temporal scales needed to drive the models at many critical places on earth. An alternative would be to employ satellite-based observations of either precipitation or soil moisture. Satellite observations of precipitation are currently not considered capable of forcing the models with sufficient accuracy for crop yield predictions. However, deduction of soil moisture from space-based platforms is in a more advanced state than are precipitation estimates so that these data may be capable of forcing the models with better accuracy. In this study, a mature two-source energy balance model, the Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) model, was used to deduce root zone soil moisture for an area of North Alabama, USA. The soil moisture estimates were used in turn to force the state-of-the-art Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop simulation model. The study area consisted of a mixture of rainfed and irrigated cornfields. The results indicate that the model forced with the ALEXI moisture estimates produced yield simulations that compared favorably with observed yields and with the rainfed model. The data appear to indicate that the ALEXI model did detect the soil moisture signal from the mixed rainfed/irrigation corn fields and this signal was of sufficient strength to produce adequate simulations of recorded yields over a 10 year period. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","ALEXI; Crop modeling; DSSAT; Maximum entropy; Remote sensing; Soil moisture","Agrotechnology transfer; ALEXI; Crop modeling; DSSAT; Root zone soil moistures; Satellite observations; Spatial and temporal scale; Two-source energy balance model; Artificial intelligence; Crops; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Estimation; Maximum entropy methods; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Space platforms; Computer simulation",Article,Scopus

Although various statistical models and machine learning models have been developed to enhance prediction accuracy, spatial and temporal non-stationarity, an intrinsic attribute of many geographical processes, is still rarely considered in crop yield modeling. From a statistical point of view, this study respectively provided evidence for the existence of spatial non-stationarity and temporal non-stationarity in winter wheat yield prediction based on geographically weighted regression (GWR) and temporally weighted regression (TWR). Then, a geographically and temporally weighted neural network (GTWNN) model was proposed by integrating artificial neural network (ANN) into geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) using publicly available data sources, including satellite imagery and climate data. For a more credible evaluation, the leave-one-year-out strategy was adopted to make out-of-sample prediction resulting in a total of 12 test years from 2008 to 2019. The experiment results showed that the proposed GTWNN outperformed ANN, GTWR and support vector regression (SVR) achieving the average coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.766, 0.759 and 0.720 at the three prediction times of end of July, end of June and end of May. Moreover, an extended Moran's I was adopted to assess the degree of spatiotemporal autocorrelation of the prediction errors. The error aggregation of GTWNN was lower than other models, indicating that GTWNN is applicable to addressing spatial non-stationarity in modeling the relationship between predictors and yield response.

The goal of this study is to explore spatial and temporal variability of a summer crop (maize)and a winter crop (wheat)yields and its linkages with influential climate oscillations in the United States. The county level yield data over 1960–2016 for maize and winter wheat were aggregated into each of the 260 climate divisions in the rainfed regions of the United States, with the linear yield trend being removed. The rotated Principal Component Analysis (PCA)reveals that the first five principal components explain 79% (maize)and 72% (winter wheat)of the spatial and temporal variability of crop anomalies. The first principal component of crop yield variability is strongly associated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). The results of multiple linear regressions for predicting yield anomalies using climate indices show that, climate indices during the reproductive period of maize explained final yield better than the vegetation period (30% versus 26%), while climate indices for winter wheat during the dormant and reproductive growth periods are similar and not significant (25% versus 28%). Categorical yield forecasts using random forecast techniques show that the low (below 30th percentile)and high (above 70th percentile)yields are well predicted by climate indices. Spatially, AMO is identified as the most important predictor for maize in 46% climate divisions and for wheat in 33% climate divisions.

We quantified the response of maize yield to projected climate changes in three main maize growing areas of South Africa (Bloemfontein, Lichtenburg and Nelspruit) using two crop modelling solutions: existing (EMS) and modified (MMS) CropSyst. The MMS considers explicitly the impact of extreme heat and drought. Both solutions were run with climate data generated from two radiative forcing scenarios using six general circulation models and three time horizons representing baseline (1990–2020), near future (2021–2050) and far future (2051–2080) time periods. Reduced yields were projected with both modelling solutions especially under far future time period. Simulated maize yield using EMS with high radiative forcing for far future decreased (compared with the simulated baseline for EMS) by 30%, 25.9% and 18.3% at Bloemfontein, Lichtenburg and Nelspruit, respectively. Simulated grain yield with MMS showed reductions of 27.6%, 24.3% and 18.7%, respectively (compared with the simulated baseline for MMS). Grain yield differences between the EMS and MMS ranged between 9 and 21%. This difference showed an increasing trend as time progressed from the baseline to the far future and varied across locations. Accounting explicitly for the impact of extreme weather events (MMS) resulted in lower simulated yields compared with the model without (EMS).

Specifically, EVI2 temporal trajectory of crop growth was simulated using a hybrid piecewise logistic model (HPLM) for individual pixels, which was used to detect crop phenological metrics. The derived crop phenology was then applied to calculate crop greenness defined as EVI2 amplitude and EVI2 integration during annual crop growing seasons, which was further aggregated for croplands in each country, respectively. The interannual variations in EVI2 amplitude and EVI2 integration were combined to correlate to the variation in cereal yield from 1982-2012 for individual countries using a stepwise regression model, respectively. The results show that the confidence level of the established regression models was higher than 90% (P value < 0.1) in most countries in the northern hemisphere although it was relatively poor in the southern hemisphere (mainly in Africa). The error in the yield predication was relatively smaller in America, Europe and East Asia than that in Africa. In the 10 countries with largest cereal production across the world, the prediction error was less than 9% during past three decades.

Traditional yield prediction method based on secondary traits is time-consuming, costly, and destructive. It is urgent to develop innovative methods to improve selection efficiency and accelerate genetic gains in the breeding cycle. Results: Crop yield prediction using remote sensing has gained popularity in recent years. This paper proposed a novel ensemble feature selection (EFS) method to improve yield prediction from hyperspectral data. For this, 207 wheat cultivars and breeding lines were grown under full and limited irrigation treatments respectively, and their canopy hyperspectral reflectance was measured at the flowering, early grain filling (EGF), mid grain filling (MGF), and late grain filling (LGF) stages. Then, 115 vegetation indices were extracted from the hyperspectral reflectance and combined with four feature selection methods, i.e., mean decrease impurity (MDI), Boruta, FeaLect, and RReliefF to train deep neural network (DNN) models for yield prediction. Next, a learning framework was developed by combining the predicted values of the selected and the full features using multiple linear regression (MLR). The results show that the selected features contributed to higher yield prediction accuracy than the full features, and the MDI method performed well across growth stages, with a mean R2 ranging from 0.634 to 0.666 (mean RMSE = 0.926–0.967 t ha−1). Also, the proposed EFS method outperformed all the individual feature selection methods across growth stages, with a mean R2 ranging from 0.648 to 0.679 (mean RMSE = 0.911–0.950 t ha−1). Conclusions: The proposed EFS method can improve grain yield prediction from hyperspectral data and can be used to assist wheat breeders in earlier decision-making. © 2022, The Author(s).","Deep neural network; Feature selection; Hyperspectral; Vegetation index; Wheat yield",,Article,Scopus

To tackle this problem, this research has designed two-phase universal machine learning (ML) model to predict wheat yield (Wpred), utilizing 27 agricultural counties’ data within the Agro-ecological zone. The universal model, online sequential extreme learning machines coupled with ant colony optimization (ACO-OSELM) is developed, by incorporating the significant annual yield data lagged at (t − 1) as the model’s predictor to generate future yield at 6 test stations. In the first phase, ACO is adopted to search for suitable, statistically relevant data stations for model training, and the corresponding test station by virtue of a feature selection strategy. An annual wheat yield time-series input dataset is constructed utilizing data from each selected training station (1981–2013) and applied against 6 test stations (with each case modelled with 26 station data as the input) to evaluate the hybrid ACO-OSELM model. The partial autocorrelation function is implemented to deduce statistically significant lagged data, and OSELM is applied to generate Wpred. The two-phase hybrid ACO-OSELM model is tested within the 6 agricultural districts (represented as stations) of Punjab province, Pakistan and the results are benchmarked with extreme learning machine (ELM) and random forest (RF) integrated with ACO (i.e., hybrid ACO-ELM and hybrid ACO-RF models, respectively). The performance of the ACO-OSELM model was proven to be good in comparison to ACO-ELM and ACO-RF models. The hybrid ACO-OSELM model revealed its potential to be implemented as a decision-making system for crop yield prediction in areas where a significant association with the historical agricultural crop is well-established. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"ant colony optimization; article; autocorrelation; decision making; feature selection; harvest; machine learning; nonhuman; Pakistan; prediction; random forest; time series analysis; wheat; algorithm; crop; education; machine learning; Algorithms; Crops, Agricultural; Education, Distance; Machine Learning; Triticum",Article,Scopus

This study used leaf reflectance from a spectroradiometer to model grain yield (GY) and aboveground biomass yield (ABY) of maize (Zea mays L.) at Aba Gerima catchment, Ethiopia. A FieldSpec IV (350–2,500 nm wavelengths) spectroradiometer was used to estimate the spectral reflectance of crop leaves during the grain-filling phase. The spectral vegetation indices, such as enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference VI (NDVI), green NDVI (GNDVI), soil adjusted VI, red NDVI, and simple ratio were deduced from the spectral reflectance. We used regression analyses to identify and predict GY and ABY at the catchment level. The coefficient of determination (R2), the root mean square error (RMSE), and relative importance (RI) were used for evaluating model performance. The findings revealed that the best-fitting curve was obtained between GY and NDVI (R2 = 0.70; RMSE = 0.065; P &lt; 0.0001; RI = 0.19), followed by EVI (R2 = 0.65; RMSE = 0.024; RI = 0.61; P &lt; 0.0001). While the best-fitting curve was obtained between ABY and GNDVI (R2 = 0.71; RI = 0.24; P &lt; 0.0001), followed by NDVI (R2 = 0.77; RI = 0.17; P &lt; 0.0001). The highest GY (7.18 ton/ha) and ABY (18.71 ton/ha) of maize were recorded at a soil bunded plot on a gentle slope. Combined spectral indices were also employed to predict GY with R2 (0.83) and RMSE (0.24) and ABY with R2 (0.78) and RMSE (0.12). Thus, the maize’s GY and ABY can be predicted with acceptable accuracy using spectral reflectance indices derived from spectroradiometer in an area like the Aba Gerima catchment. An estimation model of crop yields could help policy-makers in identifying yield-limiting factors and achieve decisive actions to get better crop yields and food security for Ethiopia. © 2022 Tiruneh et al.

Subsurface water retention technology (SWRT) is a stable approach that preserves water in sandy soils using water saving membranes. An optimal use of SWRT depends on its shape, location and other factors. In order to predict crop yield for different irrigation schedule, we require at least two computational processes: (i) a crop growth modeling process and (ii) a water and nutrient permeation process through soil to the root system. Validation of software parameters to suit properties of specific field becomes increasingly hard since they involve a coordination with field data and coordination between two software. In this paper, we propose a computationally fast approach that utilizes HYDRUS-2D software for water and nutrient flow simulation and DSSAT crop simulation software with an evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) procedure in a coordinated manner to minimize water utilization and maximize crop yield prediction. Our proposed method consists of training one-dimensional crop model (DSSAT) on data generated by two dimensional model calibrates and validates (HYDRUS-2D), that accounts for water accumulation in the SWRT membranes. Then we used DSSAT model to find the best irrigation schedules for maximizing crop yield with the highest plant water use efficiency (Tambussi et al., 2007; Blum, 2009) using for the EMO methodology. The optimization procedure minimizes water usage with the help of rainfall water and increases corn yield prediction as much as six times compare to a non-optimized and random irrigation schedule without any SWRT membrane. Our framework also demonstrates an integration of latest computing software and hardware technologies synergistically to facilitate better crop production with minimal water requirement. © 2019","crop yield; DSSAT; HYDRUS-2D; Irrigation rate; Multi-objective optimization","Computer software; Cultivation; Forecasting; Irrigation; Multiobjective optimization; Nutrients; One dimensional; Plants (botany); Water conservation; Crop yield; Crop yield simulations; DSSAT; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; HYDRUS-2D; Irrigation rates; Optimization procedures; Sustainable agriculture; Crops; crop production; crop yield; flow modeling; growth modeling; irrigation system; maize; optimization; precision agriculture; software; technological development; water retention; water use efficiency; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly popular in recent years for agricultural remote sensing applications such as crop yield forecasting and precision agriculture (PA). The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a low-cost UAV-based remote sensing technology for Bambara groundnut yield prediction. A multirotor UAV equipped with a near-infrared sensitive consumer-grade digital camera was used to collect image data during the 2018 growing season (April to August). Flight missions were carried out six times during critical phenological stages of the life-cycle of the monitored crop. Yield was recorded at harvest. Four vegetation indices (VIs) namely normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), and simple ratio (SR) generated from the Red-Green-Near Infrared bands were calculated using the georeferenced orthomosaic UAV images. Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient (r) and Bland–Altman testing showed a significant agreement between remotely and proximally sensed VIs. Significant and positive correlations were found between the four VIs and yield, with the strongest relationship observed between SR and yield at podfilling stage (r = 0.81, P &lt; 0.01). Multi-temporal accumulative VIs improved yield prediction significantly with the best index being ∑SR and the best interval being from podfilling to maturity (r = 0.88, P &lt; 0.01). The accumulated ∑SR from podfilling to maturity resulted in higher prediction accuracy with a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0.71, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.20 and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 14.2% than SR spectral index at a single stage (R 2 = 0.68, RMSE = 0.24, MAPE = 15.1%).

Compared to most wheat producing areas, this island is characterized by wet climate owing to greater annual precipitation and abundant snowmelt water supply in spring. Based on yield statistics collected from 119 municipalities for 14 years (N = 1,516) and high-resolution surface meteorological data, correlation analyses showed that precipitation, daily minimum air temperature, and irradiance during the grain-filling period had significant effects on the yield throughout the island while the effect of snow depth in early winter and spring was dependent on sites. Using 10-d mean meteorological data within a certain period between seeding and harvest as predictor variables and one-year-leave-out cross-validation procedure, performance of machine learning models based on neural network (NN), random forest (RF), support vector machine regression (SVR), partial least squares regression (PLS), and cubist regression (CB) were compared to a multiple linear regression model (MLR) and a null model that returns an average yield of the municipality. The root mean square errors of PLS, SVR, and RF were 872, 982, and 1,024 kg ha−1 and were smaller than those of MLR (1,068 kg ha−1) and null model (1,035 kg ha−1). These models outperformed the controls in other metrics including Pearson's correlation coefficient and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. Variable importance analysis on PLS indicated that minimum air temperature and precipitation during the grain-filling period had major roles in the prediction and excluding predictors in this period (i.e. yield forecast with a longer lead-time) decreased forecast performance of the models. These results were consistent with our understanding of meteorological impacts on wheat yield, suggesting usefulness of explainable machine learning in meteorological crop yield prediction under wet climate.

The objectives of this study were to develop minimum dataset (MDS) variable selection methods that reflects the total dataset (TDS) of soil properties for SQ assessment and crop yield prediction in Yucheng County, a major grain-producing region in the North China Plain. Critical values of soil properties for standardized scoring functions were established based on local crop yields in field condition and the key restricting indicators limiting crop productivity were evaluated. In this study, 99 topsoil (0–20 cm) samples were collected and 14 soil properties including pH, electrical conductivity, clay content, soil organic matter, cation exchangeable capacity, total nitrogen, phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), available P, K, Cu, Mn, Mo and Zn were analyzed. Three MDSs were created by different variable selection methods using principal component analysis (PCA) of soil properties. Among these MDSs, the indicator of norm values derived from the total principal component loadings was considered to be the most suitable method for evaluating SQ. The MDS-based soil quality index (SQI) had higher correlations with the TDS-based SQI and crop yield. The critical values of soil properties were identified by regressing soil variables with local yields of maize and wheat in the field condition. The SQIs calculated using measured critical values were more accurate than that based on published empirical values. The evaluation results revealed that the calculated SQI accounted for 28% of the variation in crop yields, and there probably are some strong limitations for crop yield through soil characteristics (soil texture, salinization, and nutrient supply, etc.). Thus, management practices and amelioration of the above soil-limiting factors should be comprehensively considered in agricultural production.

Early estimation of yield at field or plot scale also contributes to high-throughput plant phenotyping and precision agriculture. New developments in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms and sensor technology facilitate cost-effective data collection through simultaneous multi-sensor/multimodal data collection at very high spatial and spectral resolutions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the power of UAV-based multimodal data fusion using RGB, multispectral and thermal sensors to estimate soybean (Glycine max) grain yield within the framework of Deep Neural Network (DNN). RGB, multispectral, and thermal images were collected using a low-cost multi-sensory UAV from a test site in Columbia, Missouri, USA. Multimodal information, such as canopy spectral, structure, thermal and texture features, was extracted and combined to predict crop grain yield using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), input-level feature fusion based DNN (DNN-F1) and intermediate-level feature fusion based DNN (DNN-F2). The results can be summarized in three messages: (1) multimodal data fusion improves the yield prediction accuracy and is more adaptable to spatial variations; (2) DNN-based models improve yield prediction model accuracy: the highest accuracy was obtained by DNN-F2 with an R2 of 0.720 and a relative root mean square error (RMSE%) of 15.9%; (3) DNN-based models were less prone to saturation effects, and exhibited more adaptive performance in predicting grain yields across the Dwight, Pana and AG3432 soybean genotypes in our study. Furthermore, DNN-based models demonstrated consistent performance over space with less spatial dependency and variations.

However, inappropriate land selection decisions limit cassava yields and increase production-related costs to farmers. As a root crop, yield prediction using vegetation indices and biophysical properties is essential to maximize the yield of cassava before harvesting. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to develop a yield prediction model based on suitable areas that assess with land suitability analysis (LSA). For LSA, the priority indicators were identified using a fuzzy expert system combined with a multicriteria decision method including ecological categories. Furthermore, the yield prediction method was developed using satellite remote sensing datasets. In this analysis, Sentinel-2 datasets were collected and analyzed in SNAP® and ArcGIS® environments. The multisource database of ecological criteria for cassava production was built using the fuzzy membership function. The results showed that 42.17% of the land area was highly suitable for cassava production. Then, in the highly suitable area, the yield prediction model was developed using the vegetation indices based on Sentinel-2 datasets with 10 m resolution for the accuracy assessment. The vegetation indices were used to predict cassava growth, biophysical condition, and phenology over the growing seasons. The NDVI, SAVI, IRECI, LAI, and fAPAR were used to develop the model for predicting cassava growth. The generated models were validated using regression analysis between observed and predicted yield. As the vegetation indices, NDVI showed higher accuracy in the yield prediction model (R2 = 0.62) compared to SAVI and IRECI. Meanwhile, LAI had a higher prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.70) than other biophysical properties, fAPAR. The combined model using NDVI, SAVI, IRECI, LAI, and fAPAR reported the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.77). The ground truth data were used for the evaluation of satellite remote sensing data in the comparison between the observed and predicted yields.

Among these applications, UAV-based agricultural mapping and monitoring have attracted significant attention from both the research and professional communities. The interest in UAV-based remote sensing for agricultural management is motivated by the need to maximize crop yield. Remote sensing-based crop yield prediction and estimation are primarily based on imaging systems with different spectral coverage and resolution (e.g., RGB and hyperspectral imaging systems). Due to the data volume, RGB imaging is based on frame cameras, while hyperspectral sensors are primarily push-broom scanners. To cope with the limited endurance and payload constraints of low-cost UAVs, the agricultural research and professional communities have to rely on consumer-grade and light-weight sensors. However, the geometric fidelity of derived information from push-broom hyperspectral scanners is quite sensitive to the available position and orientation established through a direct geo-referencing unit onboard the imaging platform (i.e., an integrated Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS). This paper presents an automated framework for the integration of frame RGB images, push-broom hyperspectral scanner data and consumer-grade GNSS/INS navigation data for accurate geometric rectification of the hyperspectral scenes. The approach relies on utilizing the navigation data, together with a modified Speeded-Up Robust Feature (SURF) detector and descriptor, for automating the identification of conjugate features in the RGB and hyperspectral imagery. The SURF modification takes into consideration the available direct geo-referencing information to improve the reliability of the matching procedure in the presence of repetitive texture within a mechanized agricultural field. Identified features are then used to improve the geometric fidelity of the previously ortho-rectified hyperspectral data. Experimental results from two real datasets show that the geometric rectification of the hyperspectral data was improved by almost one order of magnitude. © 2016 by the authors.","Automated image registration; Hyperspectral push-broom scanners; Ortho-rectification; Phenotyping; SURF; UAV-based agricultural management","Agriculture; Air navigation; Automation; Crops; Geometry; Global positioning system; Image resolution; Imaging systems; Inertial navigation systems; Navigation systems; Remote sensing; Scanning; Spectroscopy; Tracking (position); Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Agricultural management; HyperSpectral; Ortho-rectification; Phenotyping; SURF; Hyperspectral imaging",Article,Scopus

A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based method is employed to evaluate crop condition by inter-annual comparisons of both spatial variability (using NDVI images) and seasonal dynamics (based on crop condition profiles). Since this type of method will generate false information if there are changes in crop rotation, cropping area or crop phenology, information on cropped/uncropped arable land is integrated to improve the accuracy of crop condition monitoring. The study proposes a new method to retrieve adjusted NDVI for cropped arable land during the growing season of winter crops by integrating 16-day composite Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data at 250-m resolution with a cropped and uncropped arable land map derived from the multi-temporal China Environmental Satellite (Huan Jing Satellite) charge-coupled device (HJ-1 CCD) images at 30-m resolution. Using the land map's data on cropped and uncropped arable land, a pixel-based uncropped arable land ratio (UALR) at 250-m resolution was generated. Next, the UALR-adjusted NDVI was produced by assuming that the MODIS reflectance value for each pixel is a linear mixed signal composed of the proportional reflectance of cropped and uncropped arable land. When UALR-adjusted NDVI data are used for crop condition assessment, results are expected to be more accurate, because: (i) pixels with only uncropped arable land are not included in the assessment; and (ii) the adjusted NDVI corrects for interannual variation in cropping area. On the provincial level, crop growing profiles based on the two kinds of NDVI data illustrate the difference between the regular and the adjusted NDVI, with the difference depending on the total area of uncropped arable land in the region. The results suggested that the proposed method can be used to improve the assessment of early crop condition, but additional evaluation in other major crop producing regions is needed to better assess the method's application in other regions and agricultural systems. © 2014 by the authors.","Crop condition assessment; Cropped and uncropped arable land; Linear unmixing; NDVI; North China Plain","Agriculture; Charge coupled devices; Condition monitoring; Cultivation; Forestry; Image reconstruction; Land use; Pixels; Radiometers; Reflection; Satellite imagery; Arable land; Crop condition; Linear unmixing; NDVI; North China Plain; Crops",Article,Scopus

Multitemporal satellite observations allow analyzing vegetation seasonal dynamics over large areas by using vegetation indices or by deriving biophysical variables. The Nile Delta represents about half of all agricultural lands of Egypt. In this region, intensifying farming systems are predominant and multi-cropping rotations schemes are increasing, requiring a high temporal and spatial resolution monitoring for capturing successive crop growth cycles. This study presents a workflow for cropland phenology characterization and mapping based on time series of green Leaf Area Index (LAI) generated from NASA’s Harmonized Landsat 8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) surface reflectance dataset from 2016 to 2019. LAI time series were processed for each satellite dataset, which were used separately and combined to identify seasonal dynamics for a selection of crop types (wheat, clover, maize and rice). For the combination of L8 with S2 LAI products, we proposed two time series smoothing and fitting methods: (1) the Savitzky–Golay (SG) filter and (2) the Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR) fitting function. Single-sensor and L8-S2 combined LAI time series were used for the calculation of key crop Land Surface Phenology (LSP) metrics (start of season, end of season, length of season), whereby the detection of cropland growing seasons was based on two established threshold methods, i.e., a seasonal or a relative amplitude value. Overall, the developed phenology extraction scheme enabled identifying up to two successive crop cycles within a year, with a superior performance observed for the seasonal than for the relative threshold method, in terms of consistency and cropland season detection capability. Differences between the time series collections were analyzed by comparing the phenology metrics per crop type and year. Results suggest that L8-S2 combined LAI data streams with GPR led to a more precise detection of the start and end of growing seasons for most crop types, reaching an overall detection of 74% over the total planted crops versus 69% with S2 and 63% with L8 alone. Finally, the phenology mapping allowed us to evaluate the spatial and temporal evolution of the croplands over the agroecosystem in the Nile Delta. © 2022 by the authors.

Climate change is expected to have an adverse impact particularly on crop production. Previous studies have shown large discrepancies in the magnitude and sometimes in the direction of the impact on crop production. We assessed the impact of climate change on growth and yield of maize and wheat in Ethiopia using a multi-crop model ensemble. The multi-model ensemble (n = 48) was set up using the agroecosystem modelling framework Expert-N. The framework is modular which facilitates combining different submodels for plant growth and soil processes. The multi-model ensemble was driven by climate change projections representing the mid of the century (2021-2050) from ten contrasting climate models downscaled to finer resolution. The contributions of different sources of uncertainty in crop yield prediction were quantified. The sensitivity of crop yield to elevated CO2, increased temperature, changes in precipitations and N fertilizer were also assessed. Our results indicate that grain yields were very sensitive to changes in [CO2], temperature and N fertilizer amounts where the responses were higher for wheat than maize. The response to change in precipitation was weak, which we attribute to the high water holding capacity of the soils due to high organic carbon contents at the study sites. This may provide the sufficient buffering capacity for extended time periods with low amounts of precipitation. Under the changing climate, wheat productivity will be a major challenge with a 36 to 40% reduction in grain yield by 2050 while the impact on maize was modest. A major part of the uncertainty in the projected impact could be attributed to differences in the crop growth models. A considerable fraction of the uncertainty could also be traced back to different soil water dynamics modeling approaches in the model ensemble, which is often ignored. Uncertainties varied among the studied crop species and cultivars as well. The study highlights significant impacts of climate change on wheat yield in Ethiopia whereby differences in crop growth models causes the large part of the uncertainties. © 2022 Rettie et al.

Here we examined both bacterial and fungal communities across soils, epiphytic and endophytic niches of leaf and root, and plastic leaf of fake plant (representing environment-originating microbes) at three developmental stages of maize at two contrasting sites, and further explored the potential function of phylloplane microbiomes based on metagenomics. Results: Our results suggested that plant developmental stage had a much stronger influence on the microbial diversity, composition and interkingdom networks in plant compartments than in soils, with the strongest effect in the phylloplane. Phylloplane microbiomes were co-shaped by both plant growth and seasonal environmental factors, with the air (represented by fake plants) as its important source. Further, we found that bacterial communities in plant compartments were more strongly driven by deterministic processes at the early stage but a similar pattern was for fungal communities at the late stage. Moreover, bacterial taxa played a more important role in microbial interkingdom network and crop yield prediction at the early stage, while fungal taxa did so at the late stage. Metagenomic analyses further indicated that phylloplane microbiomes possessed higher functional diversity at the early stage than the late stage, with functional genes related to nutrient provision enriched at the early stage and N assimilation and C degradation enriched at the late stage. Coincidently, more abundant beneficial bacterial taxa like Actinobacteria, Burkholderiaceae and Rhizobiaceae in plant microbiomes were observed at the early stage, but more saprophytic fungi at the late stage. Conclusions: Our results suggest that host developmental stage profoundly influences plant microbiome assembly and functions, and the bacterial and fungal microbiomes take a differentiated ecological role at different stages of plant development. This study provides empirical evidence for host exerting strong effect on plant microbiomes by deterministic selection during plant growth and development. These findings have implications for the development of future tools to manipulate microbiome for sustainable increase in primary productivity.

However, it still remains unclear the ability of satellite SIF data to predict crop yields at the regional scale, comparing to widely used satellite vegetation index (VI), such as the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Additionally, few attempts have been made to verify if SIF products from the new Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite could be applied for regional corn and soybean yield estimates. With the deep neural networks (DNN) approach, this study investigated the ability of OCO-2 SIF, MODIS EVI, and climate data to estimate county-level corn and soybean yields in the U.S. Corn Belt. Monthly mean and maximum SIF and MODIS EVI during the peak growing season showed similar correlations with corn and soybean yields. The DNNs with SIF as predictors were able to estimate corn and soybean yields well but performed poorer than MODIS EVI and climate variables-based DNNs. The performance of SIF and MODIS EVI-based DNNs varied with the areal dominance of crops while that of climate-based DNNs exhibited less spatial variability. SIF data could provide useful supplementary information to MODIS EVI and climatic variables for improving estimates of crop yields. MODIS EVI and climate predictors (e.g., VPD and temperature) during the peak growing season (from June to August) played important roles in predicting yields of corn and soybean in the Midwestern 12 states in the U.S. The results highlighted the benefit of combining data from both satellite and climate sources in crop yield estimation. Additionally, this study showed the potential of adding SIF in crop yield prediction despite the small improvement of model performances, which might result from the limitation of current available SIF products. The framework of this study could be applied to different regions and other types of crops to employ deep learning for crop yield forecasting by combining different types of remote sensing data (such as OCO-2 SIF and MODIS EVI) and climate data. © 2020, by the authors.","Corn; Crop yield; Deep neural network; Soybean; Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence","Chlorophyll; Crops; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Fluorescence; Forecasting; Orbits; Remote sensing; Satellites; Vegetation; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Crop yield forecasting; Enhanced vegetation index; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Remote sensing data; Satellite vegetation; Spatial variability; Supplementary information; Radiometers",Article,Scopus

Earth observation (EO) remote sensing data provides a unique source of information to monitor crops in a temporally resolved and spatially explicit way. In this study, we propose the combination of multisensor (optical and microwave) remote sensing data for crop yield estimation and forecasting using two novel approaches. We first propose the lag between Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from MODIS and Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) derived from SMAP as a new joint metric combining the information from the two satellite sensors in a unique feature or descriptor. Our second approach avoids summarizing statistics and uses machine learning to combine full time series of EVI and VOD. This study considers two statistical methods, a regularized linear regression and its nonlinear extension called kernel ridge regression to directly estimate the county-level surveyed total production, as well as individual yields of the major crops grown in the region: corn, soybean and wheat. The study area includes the US Corn Belt, and we use agricultural survey data from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA-NASS) for year 2015 for quantitative assessment. Results show that (1) the proposed EVI-VOD lag metric correlates well with crop yield and outperforms common single-sensor metrics for crop yield estimation; (2) the statistical (machine learning) models working directly with the time series largely improve results compared to previously reported estimations; (3) the combined exploitation of information from the optical and microwave data leads to improved predictions over the use of single sensor approaches with coefficient of determination R≥20.76; (4) when models are used for within-season forecasting with limited time information, crop yield prediction is feasible up to four months before harvest (models reach a plateau in accuracy); and (5) the robustness of the approach is confirmed in a multi-year setting, reaching similar performances than when using single-year data. In conclusion, results confirm the value of using both EVI and VOD at the same time, and the advantage of using automatic machine learning models for crop yield/production estimation. © 2019 The Authors","Agro-ecosystems; Crop yield estimation; Enhanced vegetation index; Kernel ridge regression; Machine learning; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS); Soil moisture active passive (SMAP); Vegetation optical depth","Crops; Forecasting; Learning systems; Machine learning; Optical properties; Radiometers; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Surveys; Time series; Vegetation; Video on demand; Agro ecosystems; Crop yield; Enhanced vegetation index; Kernel ridge regressions; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Soil moisture active passive (SMAP); Vegetation optical depth; Microwave sensors; agricultural ecosystem; crop yield; index method; machine learning; MODIS; multiple regression; optical depth; phenology; regression analysis; satellite data; satellite sensor; soybean; Corn Belt; United States; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The SCYP consists of an image preprocessing module (IPM) to determine crop diseases through the Google Vision API and image resizing, a crop disease diagnosis module (CDDM) based on CNN to diagnose the types and extent of crop diseases through photographs, and a crop yield prediction module (CYPM) based on ANN by using information of crop diseases, remaining time until harvest (based on the date), current temperature, humidity and precipitation (amount of snowfall) in the area, sunshine amount, ground temperature, atmospheric pressure, moisture evaporation in the ground, etc. Four experiments were conducted to verify the efficiency of the SCYP. In the CDMM, the accuracy and operation time of each model were measured using three neural network models: CNN, region-CNN(R-CNN), and you only look once (YOLO). In the CYPM, rectified linear unit (ReLU), Sigmoid, and Step activation functions were compared to measure ANN accuracy. The accuracy of CNN was about 3.5% higher than that of R-CNN and about 5.4% higher than that of YOLO. The operation time of CNN was about 37 s less than that of R-CNN and about 72 s less than that of YOLO. The CDDM had slightly less operation time, but in this paper, we prefer accuracy over operation time to diagnose crop diseases efficiently and accurately. When the activation function of the ANN used in the CYPM was ReLU, the accuracy of the ANN was 2% higher than that of Sigmoid and 7% higher than that of Step. The CYPM prediction was about 34% more accurate when using multiple diseases than when not using them. Therefore, the SCYP can predict farm yields more accurately than traditional methods. © 2019 by the authors.","ANN; CNN; Crop disease diagnosis; Image preprocessing; Yield prediction","algorithm; artificial neural network; crop yield; detection method; image processing; prediction; yield response",Article,Scopus

The increasing scarcity of rain gauges in West Africa generally limits assessments of the degree and spatial extent of hardship arising from rainfall deficiency. However, the improved availability and robustness of satellite-based rainfall products since the early 1980s, offers an alternative source of rainfall data which is spatially, and often temporally, more complete than rain gauges. This research evaluates four satellite-based rainfall products for their ability to represent both long term rainfall trends such as recovery from decadal droughts, and trends in seasonal rainfall variables relevant to crop yield prediction. The Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) rainfall product at 5 km resolution, was observed to be consistently most representative of ground station rainfall across northern Nigeria over a 35-year period 1981–2015, followed by TARCAT. CHIRPS was found to give a good overall prediction of rainfall amounts at dekadal, monthly and seasonal time scales, and was therefore used in the study to represent the typical performance of satellite rainfall datasets. The CHIRPS-observed increase in growing season length since the 1970s and 80s drought decades, was accompanied by significant rainfall increases in the later part of the growing season, especially marked in northern and northeastern states. This is especially important for the main subsistence crops sorghum and millet as the risk of late drought impedes swelling of the grain, affecting dry weight production. The CHIRPS data also indicate a significant decrease in dry spells in the northwest and southern parts of the study area, which would have favourable outcomes for crop production in the densely populated rural hinterlands of the cities of Sokoto, Jos and Abuja. In view of the continued intra-and inter-annual rainfall variability across northern Nigeria, and amid rapid rural population growth recently, a return to the rainfall levels of the drought decades, would require informed response. The study suggests that satellite rainfall estimates can offer such information, especially since we observed high spatial variability in rainfall distributions and trends. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Northern Nigeria; Rainfall recovery; Satellite rainfall products; Season rainfall variables; Spatio-temporal analysis; Sudano-Sahelian","crop yield; drought; growing season; millet; prediction; rainfall; raingauge; satellite data; seasonal variation; sorghum; spatiotemporal analysis; trend analysis; Nigeria; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; Sudan; West Africa",Article,Scopus

The crop growth model based on field scale is limited when it is extrapolated to regional scale to estimate crop yield due to the uncertainty of the input parameters. The data assimilation method which combines crop growth model and remotely sensed data has been proven to be the most effective method in regional yield estimation. The methods based on cost function are powerless with crop dynamic growth simulation and state variable dynamic update. However, sequence assimilation method has more advantages to overcome these problems, this paper presents a method of assimilation of time series HJ-1 A/B Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) into the coupled model (e.g. WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) crop growth model and A two layer Canopy Reflectance Model (ACRM) radiative transfer mode) for winter wheat yield estimates using Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) at the regional scale. The WOFOST model was selected as the crop growth model and calibrated and validated by the field measured data in order to accurately simulate the state variables and the growing process of winter wheat. The theoretically optimal time series LAI profile was obtained with the EnKF algorithm to reduce the errors which existed in both time series HJ-1 CCD NDVI and WOFOST-ACRM model. Finally, the winter wheat yield at the county level was estimated based on the optimized WOFOST model running on the wheat planting pixel. The experiment illustrates that in the potential mode, the EnKF algorithm has significantly improved the regional winter wheat yield estimates (R2=0.51, RMSE=775 kg/ha) over the WOFOST simulation without assimilation (R2=0.25, RMSE=2168 kg/ha) at county level compared to the official statistical yield data. Meanwhile, in the water-limited mode the results showed a high correlation (R2=0.53, RMSE=3005 kg/ha) with statistical data. In general, our results indicate that EnKF is a reliable optimization method for assimilating remotely sensed data into the crop growth model for predicting regional winter wheat yield. © 2012.","Ensemble Kalman Filter; HJ-1; Winter wheat yield; WOFOST","Bandpass filters; Cost functions; Food supply; Kalman filters; Remote sensing; Time series; Uncertainty analysis; Canopy reflectance model; Data assimilation methods; Ensemble Kalman Filter; HJ-1; Normalized difference vegetation index; Remotely sensed data; Winter wheat yields; WOFOST; Crops",Article,Scopus

LAI can be used in field crop growth monitoring and verification of remote sensing products. Therefore, accurate, rapid and large-scale estimation of LAI is not only conducive to better monitoring crops, but also conducive to its application in modeling, crop management and precision agriculture. Remote sensing technique has become a promising method to detect and monitor the crop LAI due to its many advantages. In this paper, Banjiequan Village, Wumachang Township, Qitai County, Xinjiang, China was selected as the study area. In order to rapidly and extensively retrieve LAI of winter wheat using domestic remote sensing images, 17 common vegetation indices were extracted from the GF-1/2 images, which was synchronized with field sampling, and observation at intervals of 20 m in the east-west direction and 30 m in the north-south direction in a 130 m × 420 m block. A total of 78 sampling points were taken from a small area of 4 rows × 50 cm. Sampling width was measured by tape ruler and coordinates of sampling points were given by GPS. Based on the vegetation indices extracted from GF-1/2 image and LAI data measured at erecting stage, jointing stage and flowering stage, we established univariate (linear, exponential, power, quadratic polynomials) and multivariate (partial least squares regression, PLSR) empirical models for inversion of winter wheat LAI, and validated them. The correlation coefficients of LAI with MSR (modified simple ratio), GNDVI (green normalized difference vegetation index), EVI (enhanced vegetation index) extracted from the erecting, jointing and flowering stages of GF-1 were the maximum, which were 0.708, 0.671, and 0.743, respectively, indicating that the correlation between these vegetation indices and LAI of winter wheat was significant. The univariate model R2 based on MSRGF-1, NDVIGF-2 (normalized difference vegetation index), GNDVIGF-1 at jointing stage and EVIGF-1 at flowering stage were all greater than 0.7. Compared with different image data at the same growth stage, the quadratic polynomial model based on NDVIGF-2 and PLSR model based on NDVIGF-2, MSRGF-2, and SAVIGF-2 (soil-adjusted vegetation index) were more precise than those based on GF-1, with R2 of 0.768 and 0.809 respectively. Compared with the models with the same data (GF-1) at different growth stages, the quadratic polynomial model based on GNDVIGF-1 at jointing stage and the PLSR model based on EVIGF-1, GSRGF-1 (green simple ratio) and NDVIGF-1 at flowering stage had the maximum value of R2, which was 0.783. The RMSE of the PLSR model was smaller than that of the quadratic polynomial model, indicating the stability of the multivariate model was better than univariate model. Analyzing the LAI distribution maps inverted from different growth stages, it was found that the LAI inversion values basically coincided with the measured LAI values. The above results show that the domestic high-resolution remote sensing image has certain application value in crop physiological parameter inversion, and provides some references for related researches in the future. © 2020, Science Press.

Crop growth models have been widely used for crop growth process description and yield prediction. In particular, the accurate simulation of important state variables, such as leaf area index (LAI) and root zone soil moisture (SM), is of great importance for yield estimation. Data assimilation is a useful tool that combines a crop model and external observations (often derived from remote sensing data) to improve the simulated crop state variables and consequently model outputs like crop total biomass, water use and grain yield. In spite of its effectiveness, applying data assimilation for monitoring crop growth at the regional scale in China remains challenging, due to the lack of high spatiotemporal resolution satellite data that can match the small field sizes which are typical for agriculture in China. With the accessibility of freely available images acquired by Sentinel satellites, it becomes possible to acquire data at high spatiotemporal resolution (10–30 m, 5–6 days), which offers attractive opportunities to characterize crop growth. In this study, we assimilated remotely sensed LAI and SM into the Word Food Studies (WOFOST) model to estimate winter wheat yield using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) algorithm. The LAI was calculated from Sentinel-2 using a lookup table method, and the SM was calculated from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 based on a change detection approach. Through validation with field data, the inverse error was 10% and 35% for LAI and SM, respectively. The open-loop wheat yield estimation, independent assimilations of LAI and SM, and a joint assimilation of LAI + SM were tested and validated using field measurement observation in the city of Hengshui, China, during the 2016–2017 winter wheat growing season. The results indicated that the accuracy of wheat yield simulated by WOFOST was significantly improved after joint assimilation at the field scale. Compared to the open-loop estimation, the yield root mean square error (RMSE) with field observations was decreased by 69 kg/ha for the LAI assimilation, 39 kg/ha for the SM assimilation and 167 kg/ha for the joint LAI + SM assimilation. Yield coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.41, 0.65, 0.50, and 0.76 and mean relative errors (MRE) of 4.87%, 4.32%, 4.45% and 3.17% were obtained for open-loop, LAI assimilation alone, SM assimilation alone and joint LAI + SM assimilation, respectively. The results suggest that LAI was the first-choice variable for crop data assimilation over SM, and when both LAI and SM satellite data are available, the joint data assimilation has a better performance because LAI and SM have interacting effects. Hence, joint assimilation of LAI and SM from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 at a 20 m resolution into the WOFOST provides a robust method to improve crop yield estimations. However, there is still bias between the key soil moisture in the root zone and the Sentinel-1 C band retrieved SM, especially when the vegetation cover is high. By active and passive microwave data fusion, it may be possible to offer a higher accuracy SM for crop yield prediction. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Satellite remote sensing provides an effective means for regional and global cropland monitoring, particularly in data-sparse regions that lack reliable ground observations and reporting. The conventional approach of using visible and near-infrared based vegetation index (VI) observations has prevailed for decades since the onset of the global satellite era. However, other satellite data encompass diverse spectral ranges that may contain complementary information on crop growth and yield, but have been largely understudied and underused. Here we conducted one of the first attempts at synergizing multiple satellite data spanning a diverse spectral range, including visible, near-infrared, thermal and microwave, into one framework to estimate crop yield for the U.S. Corn Belt, one of the world's most important food baskets. Specifically, we included MODIS Enhanced VI (EVI), estimated Gross Primary Production based on GOME-2 solar-induced fluorescence (SIF-GPP), thermal-based ALEXI Evapotranspiration (ET), QuikSCAT Ku-band radar backscatter, and AMSR-E X-band passive microwave Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) in this study, benchmarked on USDA county-level crop yield statistics. We used Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), an effective statistical model for dimension reduction, to distinguish commonly shared and unique individual information from the various satellite data and other ancillary climate information for crop yield estimation. In the PLSR model that includes all of the satellite data and climate variables from 2007 to 2009, we assessed the first two major PLSR components and found that the first component (an integrated proxy of crop aboveground biomass) explained 82% variability of modelled crop yield, and the second component (dominated by environmental stresses) explained 15% variability of modelled crop yield. We found that most of the satellite derived metrics (e.g. SIF-GPP, radar backscatter, EVI, VOD, ALEXI-ET) share common information related to aboveground crop biomass (i.e. the first component). For this shared information, the SIF-GPP and backscatter data contain almost the same amount of information as EVI at the county scale. When removing the above shared component from all of the satellite data, we found that EVI and SIF-GPP do not provide much extra information; instead, Ku-band backscatter, thermal-based ALEXI-ET, and X-band VOD provide unique information on environmental stresses that improves overall crop yield predictive skill. In particular, Ku-band backscatter and associated differences between morning and afternoon overpasses contribute unique information on crop growth and environmental stress. Overall, using satellite data from various spectral bands significantly improves regional crop yield predictions. The additional use of ancillary climate data (e.g. precipitation and temperature) further improves model skill, in part because the crop reproductive stage related to harvest index is highly sensitive to environmental stresses but they are not fully captured by the satellite data used in our study. We conclude that using satellite data across various spectral ranges can improve monitoring of large-scale crop growth and yield beyond what can be achieved from individual sensors. These results also inform the synergistic use and development of current and next generation satellite missions, including NASA ECOSTRESS, SMAP, and OCO-2, for agricultural applications. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Crop yield; Fluorescence; Microwave; Optical; Partial least square regression6; Radar; Thermal","Agriculture; Backscattering; Climate models; Crops; Ecology; Fluorescence; Infrared devices; Microwaves; NASA; Radar; Remote sensing; Satellites; Vegetation; Video on demand; Crop yield; Microwave satellite data; Optical; Partial least square (PLS); Partial least square regression; Solar-induced fluorescences; Thermal; Visible and near infrared; Space-based radar; AMSR-E; backscatter; crop yield; environmental stress; estimation method; fluorescence; GOME; least squares method; MODIS; NSCAT; OCO; optical depth; optical method; QuikSCAT; radar altimetry; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite mission; vegetation index; Corn Belt; United States; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Agriculture provides the primary source of food, income, livelihood and employment to the majority of rural populations in India. Many crops are destroyed every year due to a lack of technical knowledge and unpredictable weather patterns such as temperature, rainfall, and other atmospheric parameters, which play a massive role in deciding the crop yield and profit. Therefore, choosing the right crop to grow and enhancing crop yield is an essential aspect of improving real-life farming scenarios. One of the motives is to collect and integrate the agricultural data from specific regions that may be used to analyse the optimal crop and estimate the crop yield. This script is novel by using simple crop, soil and weather parameters like crop, the area under cultivation, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium content of the soil, season, average rainfall and temperature of a district in Karnataka, India. The user can predict the most suitable crop and its estimated yield for a chosen year. This model uses primary classification, techniques like the random forest, k-NN, logistic regression, decision tree, XGBoost, SVM and gradient boosting classifier for determining the most suitable crop and regression algorithms like Linear Regression, k-NN, DBSCAN, Random Forest and ANN algorithm to estimate the yield of the most optimal crop identified earlier. The algorithm that has the least mean error is chosen for prediction and estimation and thus gives better results than the particular machine learning algorithm domain. There is a web interface for ease of use for end-users. Therefore, this project assists the farmers in choosing the suitable crop that can be grown in a particular region during a specific season or specific period and estimate its yield and predict if the recommended crop is profitable. Hence this project helps the farmers in preserving their time by assisting them in the decision-making process. © 2022 River Publishers.","Agriculture; Classification algorithms; Crop recommendation; Machine learning; Regression algorithms; Yield estimation",,Article,Scopus

The system builds a deep recurrent Q-network (DRQN) with the Q-DRL algorithm. The layers of CNNRNN were stacked in series, and then given the input variables. Based on these variables, the Q-learning network creates a rubber yield estimation model during training, by linearly mapping CNNRNN outputs to Q-factors. Then, the RL agent combines parametric attributes with a threshold to assist with rubber yield prediction. Further, the agent accepts an overall rate for the actions executed to minimize error and maximize forecast accuracy. If the time series is too long, however, the DRL-based RNN might suffer vanishing gradients. To solve the problem, probabilistic modeling schemes, such as data analytics, and probabilistic bias-difference decomposition, were introduced to the DRL to deal with the inherent ambiguity in geometric estimations. After that, the model predictive control (MPC) learns a probabilistic shift method utilizing Gaussian processes (GPs). Then, the MPC was applied to obtain a control series to minimize the predicted long-term cost. Because MPC enables the trained system to be restructured instantly, our method, denoted as CNNRNNPCDRL, became more robust to model inaccuracies. © 2021 Lavoisier.

Facing with aging farmers, data driven approach for the prediction have been pursued. Nevertheless, they are not necessarily sufficient in terms of practical use. One of the issue is to adopt weather forecast as the feature so that the predictive performance is varied by the accuracy of the forecast. The other issue is that the performance is varied by region and the regional characteristics have not been used as the features for the prediction. With this background, we propose a feature engineering to quantify hidden regional characteristics as the feature for the prediction.

The developed data set is a combination of management, environment, and historical corn yields from 1980 to 2019. Two scenarios for ensemble creation are considered: homogenous and heterogenous ensembles. In homogenous ensembles, the base CNN-DNN models are all the same, but they are generated with a bagging procedure to ensure they exhibit a certain level of diversity. Heterogenous ensembles are created from different base CNN-DNN models which share the same architecture but have different hyperparameters. Three types of ensemble creation methods were used to create several ensembles for either of the scenarios: Basic Ensemble Method (BEM), Generalized Ensemble Method (GEM), and stacked generalized ensembles. Results indicated that both designed ensemble types (heterogenous and homogenous) outperform the ensembles created from five individual ML models (linear regression, LASSO, random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM). Furthermore, by introducing improvements over the heterogenous ensembles, the homogenous ensembles provide the most accurate yield predictions across US Corn Belt states. This model could make 2019 yield predictions with a root mean square error of 866 kg/ha, equivalent to 8.5% relative root mean square and could successfully explain about 77% of the spatio-temporal variation in the corn grain yields. The significant predictive power of this model can be leveraged for designing a reliable tool for corn yield prediction which will in turn assist agronomic decision makers. © Copyright © 2021 Shahhosseini, Hu, Khaki and Archontoulis.","CNN-DNN; heterogenous ensemble; homogenous ensemble; US Corn Belt; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

This will ensure proper crop allocation throughout the country since optimal production for each crop will be secured. It will also increase the farmer's revenue margin. The study focuses on six major crops of Bangladesh which are Aman rice, Aus rice, Boro rice, Potato, Wheat and Jute. The algorithms that were used are Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and K-Nearest Neighbor Regression (KNNR). Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) gave the most accurate results during the analysis and was incorporated into an android application. The android application system is also able to prepare a schedule of the complete farming process for a chosen crop, e.g. the correct time to apply fertilizers, irrigation, etc. © 2017 IEEE.","android application; dependent variable; fertilizer suggestion; independent variables; K-Nearest Neighbor Regression (KNNR); Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) Analysis; prediction","Android (operating system); Crops; Fertilizers; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Linear regression; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Android applications; Dependent variables; Independent variables; K-nearest neighbors; Multiple linear regressions; Learning algorithms",Conference Paper,Scopus

The effectiveness and interpretability of these handcrafted features depends on the expertise of the people designing them. Neural networks have the ability to learn features directly from input data and train the feature learning and prediction steps simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate the performance and interpretability of neural network models for crop yield forecasting using data from the MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. The selected neural networks can handle sequential or time series data and include long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network and 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN). Performance was compared with a linear trend model and a Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) model, trained using hand-designed features. Feature importance scores of input variables were computed using feature attribution methods and were analyzed by crop yield modeling and agronomy experts. Results showed that LSTM models perform statistically better than GBDT models for soft wheat in Germany and similar to GBDT models for all other case studies. In addition, LSTM models captured the effect of yield trend, static features (e.g. elevation, soil water holding capacity) and biomass features on crop yield well, but struggled to capture the impact of extreme temperature and moisture conditions. Our work shows the potential of deep learning to automatically learn features and produce reliable crop yield forecasts, and highlights the importance and challenges of involving human stakeholders in assessing model interpretability. © 2023 The Author(s)","Crop yield; Deep learning; Human stakeholders; Interpretability; Neural networks","Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Learning systems; Soil moisture; Boosted decision trees; Crop yield; Crop yield forecasting; Decision-tree model; Deep learning; Human stakeholder; Interpretability; Learn+; Neural-networks; Performance; Long short-term memory; artificial neural network; biomass; crop yield; soil water; stakeholder; Germany",Article,Scopus

These regulations require that growers apply nitrogen to meet, but not exceed, the annual N demand for crop and tree growth and nut production. To accurately predict seasonal nitrogen demand, therefore, growers need to estimate block-level almond yield early in the growing season so that timely N management decisions can be made. However, methods to predict almond yield are not currently available. To fill this gap, we have developed statistical models using the Stochastic Gradient Boosting, a machine learning approach, for early season yield projection and mid-season yield update over individual orchard blocks. We collected yield records of 185 orchards, dating back to 2005, from the major almond growers in the Central Valley of California. A large set of variables were extracted as predictors, including weather and orchard characteristics from remote sensing imagery. Our results showed that the predicted orchard-level yield agreed well with the independent yield records. For both the early season (March) and mid-season (June) predictions, a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.71, and a ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) of 2.6 were found on average. We also identified several key determinants of yield based on the modeling results. Almond yield increased dramatically with the orchard age until about 7 years old in general, and the higher long-term mean maximum temperature during April–June enhanced the yield in the southern orchards, while a larger amount of precipitation in March reduced the yield, especially in northern orchards. Remote sensing metrics such as annual maximum vegetation indices were also dominant variables for predicting the yield potential. While these results are promising, further refinement is needed; the availability of larger data sets and incorporation of additional variables and methodologies will be required for the model to be used as a fertilization decision support tool for growers. Our study has demonstrated the potential of automatic almond yield prediction to assist growers to manage N adaptively, comply with mandated requirements, and ensure industry sustainability. © 2019 Zhang, Jin, Chen and Brown.","Almond orchard; Central valley; Machine learning; Nitrogen management; Remote sensing; Yield prediction; Yield variation",,Article,Scopus

Accurate foresights of natural circumstances a year in advance can have a considerable impact on management decisions regarding crop selection, rotational location in crop rotations, agrotechnical methods employed, and long-term land use planning. One of the most important aspects of precision farming is sustainability. The novelty of this study is to evidence the effective of the temperature, pesticides, and rainfall environment parameters in the influence sustainable agriculture and economic efficiency at the farm level in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, predicting the future values of main crop yield in Saudi Arabia. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to estimate the impact of environment factors and agrotechnical parameters on agricultural crop yields and to anticipate yields is examined in this study. Using artificial neural networks (ANNs), a highly effective multilayer perceptron (MLP) model was built to accurately predict the crop yield, temperature, insecticides, and rainfall based on environmental data. The dataset is collected from different Saudi Arabia regions from 1994 to 2016, including the temperature, insecticides, rainfall, and crop yields for potatoes, rice, sorghum, and wheat. For this study, we relied on five different statistical evaluation metrics: the mean square error (MSE), the root-mean-square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), Pearson's correlation coefficient (R%), and the determination coefficient (R2). Analyses of datasets for crop yields, temperature, and insecticides led to the development of the MLP models. The datasets are randomly divided into separate samples, 70% for training and 30% for testing. The best-performing MLP model is characterized by values of (R = 100%) and (R2 = 96:33) for predicting insecticides in the testing process. The temperature, insecticides, and rainfall were examined with different crop yields to confirm the effectiveness of these parameters for increasing product crop yields in Saudi Arabia; we found that these items had highest relationships.

Since there is a tendency towards increased weather extremes in the future, understanding weather-related yield factors becomes increasingly important not only for yield prediction, but also for the design of insurance products. Although insurance products mitigate financial losses for farmers, they suffer from considerable basis risk, i.e., a discrepancy between losses and the indemnity payment. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to explore the potential of machine learning for estimating the relationship between crop yield and weather conditions at the farm level and to use it as a tool for reducing basis risk in index insurance applications. METHODS: An artificial neural network was set up and calibrated to a rich set of farm-level yield data in Germany, covering the period from 2003 to 2018. A nonlinear regression model, which uses rainfall, temperature, and soil moisture as explanatory variables for yield deviations, served as a benchmark. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The empirical application revealed that compared with traditional estimation approaches, the gain in forecasting precision by using machine learning techniques was substantial. Moreover, the use of regionalized models and disaggregated high-resolution weather data improved the performance of artificial neural networks. A considerable part of yield variability at the farm level, however, could not be captured by statistical methods which solely use “big weather data”. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings have important implications for the design of weather-index based insurance because they document that a rather high level of basis risk remains if insurance products are based on an estimation of the weather-yield relationship. © 2021 The Authors","Basis risk; Index insurance; Machine learning; Weather risk; Yield prediction","artificial diet; artificial nest; artificial neural network; crop production; crop yield; exploration; machine learning; soil moisture; spatiotemporal analysis; Germany",Article,Scopus

This study analyzes the performance of machine learning and deep learning methods for winter wheat yield prediction using an extensive dataset of weather, soil, and crop phenology variables in 271 counties across Germany from 1999 to 2019. We proposed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which uses a 1-dimensional convolution operation to capture the time dependencies of environmental variables. We used eight supervised machine learning models as baselines and evaluated their predictive performance using RMSE, MAE, and correlation coefficient metrics to benchmark the yield prediction results. Our findings suggested that nonlinear models such as the proposed CNN, Deep Neural Network (DNN), and XGBoost were more effective in understanding the relationship between the crop yield and input data compared to the linear models. Our proposed CNN model outperformed all other baseline models used for winter wheat yield prediction (7 to 14% lower RMSE, 3 to 15% lower MAE, and 4 to 50% higher correlation coefficient than the best performing baseline across test data). We aggregated soil moisture and meteorological features at the weekly resolution to address the seasonality of the data. We also moved beyond prediction and interpreted the outputs of our proposed CNN model using SHAP and force plots which provided key insights in explaining the yield prediction results (importance of variables by time). We found DUL, wind speed at week ten, and radiation amount at week seven as the most critical features in winter wheat yield prediction. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"machine learning; season; soil; wheat; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Seasons; Soil; Triticum",Article,Scopus

The medicinal plant Aloe arborescens L. was chosen as the object of this research given that this plant had been for decades one of the best-selling new products in the world. Aloe arborescens L. is famous for its medicinal properties used in medicine, cosmetology, and even the food industry. Diagnosing the abnormalities in the plant development in a timely and accurate manner plays an important role in preventing the loss of crop production yields. The current study has built a method for recognizing the causes of abnormalities in the development of Aloe arborescens L. caused by a lack of watering or lighting, based on the use of transfer training of the VGG-16 convolutional neural network (United Kingdom). A given architecture is aimed at recognizing objects in images, which is the main reason for using it to achieve the goal set. The analysis of the quality metrics of the proposed image classification process by specified classes has revealed high recognition reliability (for a normally developing plant, 91%; for a plant without proper watering, 89%; and for a plant without proper lighting, 83%). The analysis of the validity of test sample recognition has demonstrated a similar validity of the plant’s classification to one of three classes: 92.6%; 87.5%; and 85.5%, respectively.

In this study, different multispectral and red-green-blue (RGB) vegetation indices were analyzed, as well as the digitally estimated canopy cover and plant density, in order to estimate corn grain yield using a neural network model. The relative importance of the predictor variables was also analyzed. An experiment was established with five levels of nitrogen fertilization (140, 200, 260, 320, and 380 kg/ha) and four replicates, in a completely randomized block design, resulting in 20 experimental polygons. Crop information was captured using two sensors (Parrot Sequoia_4.9, and DJI FC6310_8.8) mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for two flight dates at 47 and 79 days after sowing (DAS). The correlation coefficient between the plant density, obtained through the digital count of corn plants, and the corn grain yield was 0.94; this variable was the one with the highest relative importance in the yield estimation according to Garson’s algorithm. The canopy cover, digitally estimated, showed a correlation coefficient of 0.77 with respect to the corn grain yield, while the relative importance of this variable in the yield estimation was 0.080 and 0.093 for 47 and 79 DAS, respectively. The wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI), plant density, and canopy cover showed the highest correlation coefficient and the smallest errors (R = 0.99, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.028 t ha−1, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.125 t ha−1 ) in the corn grain yield estimation at 47 DAS, with the WDRVI index and the density being the variables with the highest relative importance for this crop development date. For the 79 DAS flight, the combination of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference red edge (NDRE), WDRVI, excess green (EXG), triangular greenness index (TGI), and visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI), as well as plant density and canopy cover, generated the highest correlation coefficient and the smallest errors (R = 0.97, MAE = 0.249 t ha−1, RMSE = 0.425 t ha−1 ) in the corn grain yield estimation, where the density and the NDVI were the variables with the highest relative importance, with values of 0.295 and 0.184, respectively. However, the WDRVI, plant density, and canopy cover estimated the corn grain yield with acceptable precision (R = 0.96, MAE = 0.209 t ha−1, RMSE = 0.449 t ha−1 ). The generated neural network models provided a high correlation coefficient between the estimated and the observed corn grain yield, and also showed acceptable errors in the yield estimation. The spectral information registered through remote sensors mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles and its processing in vegetation indices, canopy cover, and plant density allowed the characterization and estimation of corn grain yield.

Most solutions for yield forecast rely on NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data which, besides being time-consuming to acquire and process, only allows forecasting once crop season has already started. To bring scalability for yield forecast, in the present paper we describe a system that incorporates satellite-derived precipitation and soil properties datasets, seasonal climate forecasting data from physical models and other sources to produce a pre-season prediction of soybean/maize yield-with no need of NDVI data. This system provides significantly useful results by the exempting the need for high-resolution remote-sensing data and allowing farmers to prepare for adverse climate influence on the crop cycle. In our studies, we forecast the soybean and maize yields for Brazil and USA, which corresponded to 44% of the world's grain production in 2016.

The difficulty of creating a yield forecast system is in the correct choice of predictors that have the greatest impact on yield. To build the model, moisture in the 100 cm layer of the soil, the content of nitrogen, phosphorus, humus, and soil acidity in the soil were used as input parameters. The amount of precipitation over 4 months, the average air temperature for the same period, as well as the presence of diseases, pests, and weeds were also taken into consideration. Data on 13 districts of the North Kazakhstan region in the period from 2008 to 2017 were used. The output parameter was the yield of spring wheat over the same time period. The relative importance of input variables in relation to the output variable was used to determine the weight values of input variables. An artificial neural network of error backpropagation was used as a method. The advantage of this method is that the quality of the forecast increases with a large amount of training data, as well as the ability to model nonlinear relationships between different data sources. After training the artificial neural network and obtaining predictive data, good results were achieved for predicting wheat yields (p = 0.52, mean absolute error in percentage (MAPE) = 12.02 %, root mean square error (RMSE) = 3.368).

Recent research has shown that machine learning (ML) can provide reasonable predictions faster and with higher flexibility compared to simulation crop modeling. However, a single machine learning model can be outperformed by a “committee” of models (machine learning ensembles) that can reduce prediction bias, variance, or both and is able to better capture the underlying distribution of the data. Yet, there are many aspects to be investigated with regard to prediction accuracy, time of the prediction, and scale. The earlier the prediction during the growing season the better, but this has not been thoroughly investigated as previous studies considered all data available to predict yields. This paper provides a machine leaning based framework to forecast corn yields in three US Corn Belt states (Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa) considering complete and partial in-season weather knowledge. Several ensemble models are designed using blocked sequential procedure to generate out-of-bag predictions. The forecasts are made in county-level scale and aggregated for agricultural district and state level scales. Results show that the proposed optimized weighted ensemble and the average ensemble are the most precise models with RRMSE of 9.5%. Stacked LASSO makes the least biased predictions (MBE of 53 kg/ha), while other ensemble models also outperformed the base learners in terms of bias. On the contrary, although random k-fold cross-validation is replaced by blocked sequential procedure, it is shown that stacked ensembles perform not as good as weighted ensemble models for time series data sets as they require the data to be non-IID to perform favorably. Comparing our proposed model forecasts with the literature demonstrates the acceptable performance of forecasts made by our proposed ensemble model. Results from the scenario of having partial in-season weather knowledge reveals that decent yield forecasts with RRMSE of 9.2% can be made as early as June 1st. Moreover, it was shown that the proposed model performed better than individual models and benchmark ensembles at agricultural district and state-level scales as well as county-level scale. To find the marginal effect of each input feature on the forecasts made by the proposed ensemble model, a methodology is suggested that is the basis for finding feature importance for the ensemble model. The findings suggest that weather features corresponding to weather in weeks 18–24 (May 1st to June 1st) are the most important input features. © Copyright © 2020 Shahhosseini, Hu and Archontoulis.","corn yields; ensemble; forecasting; machine learning; US Corn Belt",,Article,Scopus

Corn planting and harvest scheduling is challenging because corn hybrids have different planting windows, and, subsequently, inaccurate planting and harvest scheduling can result in inconsistent and unpredictable weekly harvest quantities and logistical and productivity issues. In the 2021 Syngenta Crop Challenge, participants were given several large datasets including recorded historical daily growing degree units (GDU) of two sites and provided with planting windows, required GDUs, and harvest quantities of corn hybrids planted in these two sites, and were asked to schedule planting and harvesting dates of corn hybrids under two storage capacity cases so that facilities are not over capacity in harvesting weeks and have consistent weekly harvest quantities. The research problem includes determining the planting and harvest scheduling of corn hybrids under two storage capacity cases: (1) given the maximum storage capacity, and (2) without maximum storage capacity to determine the lowest storage capacity for each site. To help improve corn planting and harvest scheduling, we propose two mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models and a heuristic algorithm to solve this problem for both storage capacity cases. Daily GDUs are required for planting and harvest scheduling, but they are unknown at the beginning of the growing season. As such, we use recurrent neural networks to predict the weekly GDUs of 70 weeks and consider this as the predicted GDU scenario to solve this problem. In addition, we solve this problem considering all given 10 historical GDU scenarios from 2010 to 2019 together for both storage capacity cases to include historical GDUs directly to our model rather than using predicted GDUs. Our extensive computational experiments and results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, which can provide optimal planting and harvest scheduling considering deterministic GDU scenario and uncertainties in historical GDU scenarios for both storage capacity cases to provide consistent weekly harvest quantities that are below the maximum capacity. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"adult; article; computer heuristics; crop production; growing season; human; price; productivity; recurrent neural network; system analysis; uncertainty; crop production; maize; uncertainty; Crop Production; Humans; Uncertainty; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Methods such as volume or force-impact have been used to measure mass flow; however, these methods are limited in application and accuracy.

To overcome these issues, an effective dimensionality reducing strategy: Self Organizing Map (SOM) is proposed along with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The SOM strategy is one of the proper dimensionality reducing strategy to highlight the self-arranging outline. After reducing the measurement, the dimensionality reduced information are used to forecast climate for a reasonable outcome. A reasonable season for an appropriate crop is arranged with the guide of Deep Neural Network (DNN) classification system. This research work depends on finding appropriate information model, which helps in accomplishing high precision and simplification for value forecast.

However, the diffusion of this technology is still limited by the lack of clear applicability for crop input management and by the farmer's perception of risk. In this work, we tackle both problems by incorporating uncertainty quantification into our previously proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for yield prediction, and by proposing a risk-averse optimization algorithm on top of it. We redesign our CNN architecture under the Deep Ensemble framework, so the predictive model outputs a probability distribution instead of a single value. Then, a gradient-based optimization algorithm uses this model to find the maps of crop inputs that maximize the expected net revenue while satisfying risk constraints. We show that the new model not only provides uncertainty quantification but also increases the predicted performance of its former version. Experiments with the optimization algorithm show an increase up to 6.4% in the expected net revenue when compared with the status quo management, and provide a flexible setup to match different levels of risk aversion. © 2020 The Authors","Convolutional neural network; Deep ensemble; Deep learning; On-farm research; Risk-averse optimization; Yield modeling","Agricultural robots; Convolution; Crops; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Optimization; Predictive analytics; Probability distributions; Risk analysis; Risk perception; Uncertainty analysis; Gradient based optimization algorithms; Optimization algorithms; Predicted performance; Predictive modeling; Risk aversion; Risk constraints; Uncertainty quantifications; Yield prediction; Convolutional neural networks; algorithm; artificial neural network; crop yield; management practice; optimization; risk assessment; risk perception",Article,Scopus

In the 2020 Syngenta Crop Challenge, Syngenta released several large datasets that recorded the historical yield performances of around 4% of total cross combinations of 593 inbreds with 496 testers which were planted in 280 locations between 2016 and 2018 and asked participants to predict the yield performance of cross combinations of inbreds and testers that have not been planted based on the historical yield data collected from crossing other inbreds and testers.

In this work, we propose to further improve the yield prediction task by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) given their unique ability to exploit the spatial information of small regions of the field. We present a novel CNN architecture called Hyper3DNetReg that takes in a multi-channel input raster and, unlike previous approaches, outputs a two-dimensional raster, where each output pixel represents the predicted yield value of the corresponding input pixel. Our proposed method then generates a yield prediction map by aggregating the overlapping yield prediction patches obtained throughout the field. Our data consist of a set of eight rasterized remotely-sensed features: nitrogen rate applied, precipitation, slope, elevation, topographic position index (TPI), aspect, and two radar backscatter coefficients acquired from the Sentinel-1 satellites. We use data collected during the early stage of the winter wheat growing season (March) to predict yield values during the harvest season (August).

Remote sensing-based platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) show promise to predict different traits including grain yield. Attention is currently being devoted to machine learning methods in order to extract the most meaningful information from the massive amounts of data generated by UAV images. These methods have shown a promising capability to come up with nonlinearity and explore patterns beyond the human ability. This study investigates the application of two different machine learning based regressor methods to predict wheat grain yield using extracted vegetation indices from UAV images. The goal of the study was to investigate the strength of Support Vector Regression (SVR) in combination with Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) for grain yield prediction and compare the results with LASSO regressor with an internal feature selector. Models were tested on grain yield data from 600 plots of spring wheat planted in South-Eastern Norway in 2018. Five spectral bands along with three different vegetation indices; the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) were extracted from multispectral images at three dates between heading and maturity of the plants. These features for each field trial plot at each date were used as input data for the SVR model. The best model hyperparameters were estimated using grid search. Based on feature selection results from both methods, NDVI showed the highest prediction ability for grain yield at all dates and its explanatory power increased toward maturity, while adding MTCI and EVI at earlier stages of grain filling improved model performance. Combined models based on all indices and dates explained up to 90% of the variation in grain yield on the test set. Inclusion of individual bands added collinearity to the models and did not improve the predictions. Although both regression methods showed a good capability for grain yield prediction, LASSO regressor proved to be more affordable and economical in terms of time. © 2021 The Author(s)","LASSO; Machine learning; SFS (Sequential Forward Selection); Support Vector Regression (SVR); Wheat phenotyping; Yield","Antennas; Data mining; Forecasting; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Aerial vehicle; Grain yield; LASSO; Machine-learning; Sequential forward selection; Support vector regression; Wheat phenotyping; Yield; Yield prediction; Grain (agricultural product); crop yield; machine learning; MERIS; NDVI; plant breeding; regression analysis; satellite imagery; spring (hydrology); spring (season); support structure; support vector machine; wheat; Norway",Article,Scopus

It is a well-known fact that climate change has been accelerated over the past decades due to various human induced activities. In addition, demand for the food is increasing day-by-day due to the rapid growth of population. Therefore, understanding the relationships between climatic factors and paddy production has become crucial for the sustainability of the agriculture sector. However, these relationships are usually complex nonlinear relationships. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are extensively used in obtaining these complex, nonlinear relationships. However, these relationships are not yet obtained in the context of Sri Lanka; a country where its staple food is rice. Therefore, this research presents an attempt in obtaining the relationships between the paddy yield and climatic parameters for several paddy grown areas (Ampara, Batticaloa, Badulla, Bandarawela, Hambantota, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, and Puttalam) with available data. Three training algorithms (Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), Bayesian Regularization (BR), and Scaled Conjugated Gradient (SCG)) are used to train the developed neural network model, and they are compared against each other to find the better training algorithm. Correlation coefficient (R) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) were used as the performance indicators to evaluate the performance of the developed ANN models. The results obtained from this study reveal that LM training algorithm has outperformed the other two algorithms in determining the relationships between climatic factors and paddy yield with less computational time. In addition, in the absence of seasonal climate data, annual prediction process is understood as an efficient prediction process. However, the results reveal that there is an error threshold in the prediction. Nevertheless, the obtained results are stable and acceptable under the highly unpredicted climate scenarios. The ANN relationships developed can be used to predict the future paddy yields in corresponding areas with the future climate data from various climate models. © 2020 Vinushi Amaratunga et al.",,"Agricultural robots; Climate models; Complex networks; Forecasting; Mean square error; Neural networks; Population statistics; Bayesian regularization; Correlation coefficient; Efficient predictions; Levenberg-Marquardt; Neural network model; Non-linear relationships; Performance indicators; Seasonal climate data; Climate change",Article,Scopus

Accurate wheat yield prediction is critical to satisfying local consumption and increasing exports regionally and globally to meet human food security. This paper incorporates remote satellite-based information in a wheat-growing region in South Australia to estimate the yield by integrating the kernel ridge regression (KRR) method coupled with complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and the grey wolf optimisation (GWO). The hybrid model, ‘GWO-CEEMDAN-KRR,’ employing an initial pool of 23 different satellite-based predictors, is seen to outperform all the benchmark models and all the feature selection (ant colony, atom search, and particle swarm optimisation) methods that are implemented using a set of carefully screened satellite variables and a feature decomposition or CEEMDAN approach. A suite of statistical metrics and infographics comparing the pre-dicted and measured yield shows a model prediction error that can be reduced by ~20% by employing the proposed GWO-CEEMDAN-KRR model. With the metrics verifying the accuracy of simulations, we also show that it is possible to optimise the wheat yield to achieve agricultural profits by quantifying and including the effects of satellite variables on potential yield. With further improvements in the proposed methodology, the GWO-CEEMDAN-KRR model can be adopted in agricultural yield simulation that requires remote sensing data to establish the relationships between crop health, yield, and other productivity features to support precision agriculture. © 2022 by the authors.

However, to save energy, water and nutrients, additional parameters related to crop performance and physiology will have to be considered. In addition, detecting crop stress before it is clearly visible by naked eye is an advantage that could aid in microclimate control. In this study, a Machine Learning (ML) model which takes into account microclimate and crop physiological data to detect different types of crop stress was developed and tested. For this purpose, a multi-sensor platform was used to record tomato plant physiological characteristics under different fertigation and air temperature conditions. The innovation of the current model lies in the integration of photosynthesis rate (Ps) values estimated by means of remote sensing using a photochemical reflectance index (PRI). Through this process, the time-series Ps data were combined with crop leaf temperature and microclimate data by means of the ML model. Two different algorithms were evaluated: Gradient Boosting (GB) and MultiLayer perceptron (MLP). Two runs with different structures took place for each algorithm. In RUN 1, there were more feature inputs than the outputs to build a model with high predictive accuracy. However, in order to simplify the process and develop a user-friendly approach, a second, different run was carried out. Thus, in RUN 2, the inputs were fewer than the outputs, and that is why the performance of the model in this case was lower than in the case of RUN 1. Particularly, MLP showed 91% and 83% accuracy in the training sample, and 89% and 82% in testing sample, for RUNs 1 and 2, respectively. GB showed 100% accuracy in the training sample for both runs, and 91% and 83% in testing sample in RUN 1 and RUN 2, respectively. To improve the accuracy of RUN 2, a larger database is required. Both models, however, could easily be incorporated into existing greenhouse climate monitoring and control systems, replacing human experience in detecting greenhouse crop stress conditions. © 2022 by the authors.","gradient boosting; microclimate; multilayer perceptron; photosynthesis rate; soft sensor",,Article,Scopus

This study investigated lettuce yield (fresh weight) prediction using four machine learning (ML) models, namely, support vector regressor (SVR), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), random forest (RF), and deep neural network (DNN). It was cultivated in three hydroponics systems (i.e., suspended nutrient film technique system, pyramidal aeroponic system, and tower aeroponic system), which interacted with three different magnetic unit strengths under a controlled greenhouse environment during the growing season in 2018 and 2019. Three scenarios consisting of the combinations of input variables (i.e., leaf number, water consumption, dry weight, stem length, and stem diameter) were assessed. The XGB model with scenario 3 (all input variables) yielded the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 8.88 g followed by SVR with the same scenario that achieved 9.55 g, and the highest result was by RF with scenario 1 (i.e., leaf number and water consumption) that achieved 12.89 g. All model scenarios having Scatter Index (SI) (i.e., RMSE divided by the average values of the observed yield) values less than 0.1 were classified as excellent in predicting fresh lettuce yield. Based on all of the performance statistics, the two best models were SVR with scenario 3 and DNN with scenario 2 (i.e., leaf number, water consumption, and dry weight). However, DNN with scenario 2 requiring less input variables is preferred.

Yield prediction requires monitoring of phenological and climatic characteristics over extended time periods to model the complex relations involved in crop development.

The field of yield prediction is currently dominated by Deep Learning approaches. While the accuracies reached with those approaches are promising, the needed amounts of data and the “black-box” nature can restrict the application of Deep Learning methods. The limitations can be overcome by proposing a pipeline to process remote sensing images into feature-based representations that allow the employment of Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for yield prediction.

A computer‐based land evaluation information system (MicroLEIS) was developed for optimal use of agricultural and forestry land systems under Mediterranean conditions. Through an interactive procedure several land capability, suitability and yield prediction methods may be applied. The system addresses land evaluation at reconnaissance, semi‐detailed and detailed scales in an interrelated manner. Biophysical land evaluation methods are incorporated using empirical, scale‐appropriate models, which range from purely qualitative (reconnaissance) through semi‐quantitative (semi‐detailed) to quantitative (detailed). This software is helpful for teaching, research and development, predicting appropriate agroforestry land uses. Its use is illustrated by an example. MicroLEIS runs on IBM PC, XT, AT, or a compatible microcomputer with at least 128 kilobytes of RAM and a PC‐DOS or MS‐DOS version 2.0 or later operating system.

A little less than 41 percent of Indians are employed in agriculture, which accounts for approximately 19 percent of the country's gross domestic product. As is the case in every other industry, researchers and scientists in this one are exerting a lot of effort to enhance agricultural practices by utilising cutting-edge methods such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, big data, and so on. The findings of the study described in this paper are predicated on the assumption that the method of machine learning results in an improvement in the accuracy of the prediction of soil chemical characteristics. The correlations that were discovered as a result of this research are essential for comprehending the comprehensive approach to predicting the soil attributes using ML/DL models. A number of findings from previous study have been reported and analysed. A state of the art machine learning algorithm, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest are implemented and compared. Additionally, the innovative Deep Learning Hybrid CNN-RF and VGG-RNN Model for Categorization of Soil Properties is also implemented along with CNN. An investigation into the significance of the selected category for nutritional categorization revealed that a multi-component technique provided the most accurate predictions. Both the CNN-RF and VGG-RNN models that were proposed were successful in classifying the soil with average accuracies of 95.8% and 97.9%, respectively, in the test procedures. A study was carried out in which the CNN-RF model, the VGG-RNN model, and five other machine learning and deep learning models were compared. The suggested VGG-RNN model achieved superior accuracy of classification and real-time durability, respectively. © 2022 The authors.","feature extraction; Machine Learning; segmentation; Soil Classification; Soil Nutrients",,Article,Scopus

Instead of pursuing the maximum yield, most turfgrass managers use nitrogen (N) to maintain a sub-maximal growth rate. Few tools or soil tests exist to help managers guide N fertilizer decisions. Turf growth prediction models have the potential to be useful, but the currently existing turf growth prediction model only takes temperature into account, limiting its accuracy. This study developed machine-learning-based turf growth models using the random forest (RF) algorithm to estimate short-term turfgrass clipping yield. To build the RF model, a large set of variables were extracted as predictors including the 7-day weather, traffic intensity, soil moisture content, N fertilization rate, and the normalized difference red edge (NDRE) vegetation index. In this study, the data were collected from two putting greens where the turfgrass received 0 to 1,800 round/week traffic rates, various irrigation rates to maintain the soil moisture content between 9 and 29%, and N fertilization rates of 0 to 17.5 kg ha–1 applied biweekly. The RF model agreed with the actual clipping yield collected from the experimental results. The temperature and relative humidity were the most important weather factors. Including NDRE improved the prediction accuracy of the model. The highest coefficient of determination (R2) of the RF model was 0.64 for the training dataset and was 0.47 for the testing data set upon the evaluation of the model. This represented a large improvement over the existing growth prediction model (R2 = 0.01). However, the machine-learning models created were not able to accurately predict the clipping production at other locations. Individual golf courses can create customized growth prediction models using clipping volume to eliminate the deviation caused by temporal and spatial variability. Overall, this study demonstrated the feasibility of creating machine-learning-based yield prediction models that may be able to guide N fertilization decisions on golf course putting greens and presumably other turfgrass areas. © Copyright © 2021 Zhou and Soldat.","machine learning; nitrogen management; random forest; turfgrass; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

Farmers and their advisors want user-friendly decision support tools for predicting yield. Simulation models can be used to accurately predict yield, but they are complex and difficult to parameterise. The goal of this study is to build a simple and parsimonious model for predicting wheat yields that can be implemented in a decision tool to be used by farmers at a paddock level. A large yield data set accumulated from trials on commonly grown varieties in Western Australia is used to build and validate a generalised additive model (GAM) for predicting wheat yield. Explanatory variables tested included weather data and derivatives, geolocation, soil type, land capability, and wheat varieties. Model selection followed a forward stepwise approach in combination with cross-validation to select the smallest set of explanatory variables. The predictive performance is also evaluated using independent data. The final model uses seasonal water availability, location and year to predict wheat yield. Because the GAM model has minimal inputs, it can be easily employed in a decision tool to predict yield throughout the growing season using rainfall data up to the prediction date and either climatological averages or seasonal forecasts of rainfall for the remainder of the growing season. It also has the potential to be used as an input to agronomic models that predict the effect on yield of various management choices for fertiliser, pest, weed and disease management. © 2019","Crop modelling; Crop water relations; Decision support; Precision farming; Waterlogging; Yield prediction","agricultural management; agricultural modeling; crop production; crop yield; decision support system; farming system; growing season; implementation process; model validation; numerical model; parameterization; plant water relations; precision agriculture; prediction; rainfall; water use efficiency; waterlogging; wheat; yield response; Australia; Western Australia; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

This paper addresses the problem of optimally identifying seed varieties to reliably increase crop yield within a risk-sensitive decision making framework. Specifically, a novel hierarchical machine learning mechanism for predicting crop yield (the yield of different seed varieties of the same crop) is introduced. This prediction mechanism is then integrated with a weather forecasting model and three different approaches for decision making under uncertainty to select seed varieties for planting so as to balance yield maximization and risk. The model was applied to the problem of soybean variety selection given in the 2016 Syngenta Crop Challenge. The prediction model achieved a median absolute error of 235 kg/ha and thus provides good estimates for input into the decision models. The decision models identified the selection of soybean varieties that appropriately balance yield and risk as a function of the farmer’s risk aversion level.

Due to climatic and environmental variations of different countries, water supply is not available in constant and desire quantity that is necessary for better wheat yield. So, there is a strong relationship and dependency that exists between water supply and wheat yield. Therefore, water supply is becoming an issue because it directly effects wheat yield.

Several researchers have investigated cropping operations’ role in mycotoxin contamination, but these findings were inconclusive, precluding their use in predictive modeling. In this study a machine learning (ML) approach was considered, which included weather-based mechanistic model predictions for AFLA-maize and FER-maize [predicting aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and fumonisins (FBs), respectively], and cropping system factors as the input variables. The occurrence of AFB1 and FBs in maize fields was recorded, and their corresponding cropping system data collected, over the years 2005–2018 in northern Italy. Two deep neural network (DNN) models were trained to predict, at harvest, which maize fields were contaminated beyond the legal limit with AFB1 and FBs. Both models reached an accuracy &gt;75% demonstrating the ML approach added value with respect to classical statistical approaches (i.e., simple or multiple linear regression models). The improved predictive performance compared with that obtained for AFLA-maize and FER-maize was clearly demonstrated. This coupled to the large data set used, comprising a 13-year time series, and the good results for the statistical scores applied, together confirmed the robustness of the models developed here. © Copyright © 2021 Camardo Leggieri, Mazzoni and Battilani.","aflatoxins; Aspergillus flavus; cropping system; deep learning; fumonisins; Fusarium verticillioides; predictive models","aflatoxin B1; fumonisin; mycotoxin; Article; controlled study; cropping system; cross validation; deep learning; deep neural network; diagnostic accuracy; food safety; kernel method; learning algorithm; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; local field potential; machine learning; maize; nerve cell; nonhuman; prediction; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; support vector machine; validation process",Article,Scopus

In the case of agriculture, it is especially interesting to have advance information on the profitability of a farm. In this sense, depending on the time of the year when this information is available, important decisions can be made that affect the economic balance of the farm. The aim of this study is to develop an effective model for predicting crop yields in advance that is accessible and easy to use by the farmer or farm manager from a web-based application. In this case, an olive orchard in the Andalusia region of southern Spain was used. The model was estimated using spatio-temporal training data, such as yield data from eight consecutive years, and more than twenty meteorological parameters data, automatically charged from public web services, belonging to a weather station located near the sample farm. The workflow requires selecting the parameters that influence the crop prediction and discarding those that introduce noise into the model.

It is critical to complete this activity with high precision at the regional and national levels to facilitate speedy decision-making. Tea is a big cash crop that contributes significantly to economic development, with a market of USD 200 billion in 2020 that is expected to reach over USD 318 billion by 2025. As a developing country, Bangladesh can be a greater part of this industry and increase its exports through its tea yield and production with favorable climatic features and land quality. Regrettably, the tea yield in Bangladesh has not increased significantly since 2008 like many other countries, despite having suitable climatic and land conditions, which is why quantifying the yield is imperative. This study developed a novel spatiotemporal hybrid DRS-RF model with a dragonfly optimization (DR) algorithm and support vector regression (S) as a feature selection approach. This study used satellite-derived hydro-meteorological variables between 1981 and 2020 from twenty stations across Bangladesh to address the spatiotemporal dependency of the predictor variables for the tea yield (Y). The results illustrated that the proposed DRS-RF hybrid model improved tea yield forecasting over other standalone machine learning approaches, with the least relative error value (11%). This study indicates that integrating the random forest model with the dragonfly algorithm and SVR-based feature selection improves prediction performance. This hybrid approach can help combat food risk and management for other countries. © 2022 by the authors.

Whereas traditional agricultural systems mainly rely on scarce ground-survey data, freely available multi-temporal and multi-spectral remote sensing images are excellent tools to support these vulnerable systems by accurately monitoring and estimating crop yields before harvest. In this context, we introduce the use of Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery, with a medium spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions, to estimate rice crop yields in Nepal as a case study. Firstly, we build a new large-scale rice crop database (RicePAL) composed by multi-temporal S2 and climate/soil data from the Terai districts of Nepal. Secondly, we propose a novel 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) adapted to these intrinsic data constraints for the accurate rice crop yield estimation. Thirdly, we study the effect of considering different temporal, climate and soil data configurations in terms of the performance achieved by the proposed approach and several state-of-the-art regression and CNN-based yield estimation methods.

Agricultural systems that rely on monsoon rainfall are especially vulnerable to changes in climate variability. This paper uses machine learning to deepen understanding of how monsoon variability impacts agricultural productivity. We demonstrate that random forest modelling is effective in representing rice production variability in response to monsoon weather variability. Our random forest modelling found monsoon weather predictors explain similar levels of detrended anomaly variation in both rice yield (33%) and area harvested (35%). The role of weather in explaining harvested rice area highlights that production area changes are an important pathway through which weather extremes impact agricultural productivity, which may exacerbate losses that occur through changes in per-area yields. We find that downwelling shortwave radiation flux is the most important weather variable in explaining variation in yield anomalies, with proportion of area under irrigation being the most important predictor overall. Machine learning modelling is capable of representing crop-climate variability in monsoonal agriculture and reveals additional information compared to traditional parametric models. For example, non-linear yield and area responses of irrigation, monsoon onset and season length all match biophysical expectations. Overall, we find that random forest modelling can reveal complex non-linearities and interactions between climate and rice production variability. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"agriculture; article; climate change; crop; expectation; India; machine learning; nonhuman; nonlinear system; plant yield; productivity; random forest; rice; season; weather",Article,Scopus

Mapping and monitoring agricultural dynamics and production in real-time at high spatial resolution are essential for ensuring food security and shaping policy interventions. However, an accurate yield estimation might be challenging in some arid and semi-arid regions since input datasets are generally scarce, and access is restricted due to security challenges. This work examines how well Sentinel-2 satellite sensor-derived data, topographic and climatic variables, can be used as covariates to accurately model and predict wheat crop yield at the farm level using statistical models in low data settings of arid and semi-arid regions, using Sulaimani governorate in Iraq as an example. We developed a covariate selection procedure that assessed the correlations between the covariates and their relationships with wheat crop yield. Potential non-linear relationships were investigated in the latter case using regression splines. In the absence of substantial non-linear relationships between the covariates and crop yield, and residual spatial autocorrelation, we fitted a Bayesian multiple linear regression model to model and predict crop yield at 10 m resolution. Out of the covariates tested, our results showed significant relationships between crop yield and mean cumulative NDVI during the growing season, mean elevation, mean end of the season, mean maximum temperature and mean the start of the season at the farm level. For in-sample prediction, we estimated an R2 value of 51 % for the model, whereas for out-of-sample prediction, this was 41 %, both of which indicate reasonable predictive performance. The calculated root-mean-square error for out-of-sample prediction was 69.80, which is less than the standard deviation of 89.23 for crop yield, further showing that the model performed well by reducing prediction variability. Besides crop yield estimates, the model produced uncertainty metrics at 10 m resolution. Overall, this study showed that Sentinel-2 data can be valuable for upscaling field measurement of crop yield in arid and semi-arid regions. In addition, the environmental covariates can strengthen the model predictive power. The method may be applicable in other areas with similar environments, particularly in conflict zones, to increase the availability of agricultural statistics. © 2023 The Authors",,"Arid regions; Crops; Farms; Food supply; Linear regression; Mean square error; Uncertainty analysis; Agricultural productivity; Arid and semi-arid regions; Covariates; Crop yield; Environmental variables; Farming system; Food insecurity; Non-linear relationships; Semi arid; Socio-economics; Forecasting; agricultural production; arid environment; crop yield; data set; food security; semiarid region; Sentinel; smallholder; wheat; Iraq",Article,Scopus

Because the process-based and statistical approaches to simulating crop yields are different in nature, a comparison between them is needed. This study investigates the accuracy of crop yield simulations in the historical period as well as future projections using two modelling approaches: 1) a process-based approach employing the Soil and Water Assessment Tool+ (SWAT+) model, and 2) a statistical approach employing a data-driven model, Feed Forward Back Propagation Neural Network (FFBPNN) over a medium-sized catchment in north-western Poland. The application of two potential evapotranspiration methods (Penman-Monteith and Hargreaves) in SWAT+ permitted calibration (2004–2011) and validation (2012–2019) of runoff and yields of winter wheat and spring barley. Different combinations of climatic parameters with a drought index based on Joint Deficit Index were applied to simulate and project rainfed crop yields (winter wheat, barley, potato, rye, rapeseed, sugar beets, cereals, maize for grain, maize for green forage, pulses) with FFBPNN. The results reveal that adding the new drought index helped increase the FFBPNN performance. This approach showed that future yields of the studied crops would slightly increase under RCP8.5 by 2060. Winter wheat and spring barley projections from SWAT+ showed very small changes using both the Penman-Monteith and Hargreaves method. Policy-wise, the results should be of interest to climate change adaptation practitioners and food security experts. Future studies should aim at more thorough investigation of the role of the downscaling technique and extreme events, as well as the effect of elevated CO2 on future crop yields. © 2022 The Authors","Artificial Neural Network; Baltic Sea basin; Global warming; Machine learning; Oder River basin","Backpropagation; Catchments; Crops; Drought; Feedforward neural networks; Food supply; Global warming; Sugar beets; Baltic sea basins; Crop yield; Machine-learning; Oder river; Oder river basin; Process-based approach; Rainfed crop; River basins; Soil and Water assessment tools; Statistical approach; SWAT; adaptation; artificial neural network; barley; comparative study; crop yield; global warming; rainfed agriculture; simulation; statistical analysis; wheat; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Oder Basin; Poland [Central Europe]",Article,Scopus

Therefore, it is essential to provide appropriate solutions to increase water productivity (WP). As an element of research, this study presents a hybrid machine learning approach and investigates its potential for estimating date palm crop yield and WP under different levels of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI). The amount of applied water in the SDI system was compared at three levels of 125% (T1), 100% (T2), and 75% (T3) of water requirement. The proposed ACVO-ANFIS approach is composed of an anti-coronavirus optimization algorithm (ACVO) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Since the effect of irrigation factors, climate, and crop characteristics are not equal in estimating the WP and yield, the importance of these factors should be measured in the estimation phase. To fulfill this aim, ACVO-ANFIS employed eight different feature combination models based on irrigation factors, climate, and crop characteristics. The proposed approach was evaluated on a benchmark dataset that contains information about the groves of Behbahan agricultural research station located in southeast Khuzestan, Iran. The results explained that the treatment T3 advanced data palm crop yield by 3.91 and 1.31%, and WP by 35.50 and 20.40 kg/m3, corresponding to T1 and T2 treatments, respectively. The amount of applied water in treatment T3 was 7528.80 m3/ha, which suggests a decrease of 5019.20 and 2509.6 m3/ha of applied water compared to the T1 and T2 treatments. The modeling results of the ACVO-ANFIS approach using a model with factors of crop variety, irrigation (75% water requirement of SDI system), and effective rainfall achieved RMSE = 0.005, δ = 0.603, and AICC = 183.25.

Machine learning methods can be used to predict crop yield based on a combination of remote sensing data and data collected by ground weather stations. This paper argues that forecasting drylands farming yield can be reliable for management purpose under uncertain conditions using machine learning methods and remote sensing data and determines which indicators are most important in predicting the yield of chickpea. In this study, the yield of rainfed chickpea farms in 11 top chickpea producing counties in Kermanshah province, Iran, was predicted using three machine learning methods, namely support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). To improve prediction accuracy, for each county, remote sensing data were overlaid by the satellite images of rainfed farms with a suitable slope and altitude for rainfed farming. An integrated database was created by combining weather data, remote sensing data, and chickpea yield statistics. The methods were evaluated using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) technique and compared in terms of multiple measures. Given the sensitivity of rainfed chickpea yield to the time of data, the predictions were made in two scenarios: (1) using the averages of the data of all growing months, and (2) using the data of a combination of months. The results showed that RF provides more accurate yield predictions than other methods. The predictions of this method were 7–8% different from the statistics reported by the Statistical Center and the Ministry of Agriculture of Iran. It was found that for pre-harvest prediction of rainfed chickpea yield, using the data of the March–April period (the averages of two months) offers the best result in terms of the correlation coefficient for the relationship between the yield and the predictor indices. © 2021 by the authors.

For more than a decade, the time series leaf area index (LAI) products obtained from high temporal resolution satellites have been widely used in global crop growth monitoring. However, the spatial resolutions (250–1000 m) of these satellite sensors are too coarse for areas with complex and diverse land-use types, especially in China, which causes great uncertainties in crop growth monitoring and yield estimation results. In addition, due to the influence of clouds, optical remote sensing satellites cannot obtain continuous time series data at a given time step over the main crop growth and development period. In this paper, a method based on spatiotemporal data fusion and singular vector decomposition (SVD) is proposed to reconstruct field-scale time series LAI imagery over the main growth and development period of winter wheat. In this method, the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) is used to fuse the reflectance imagery of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3, and a linear regression model between the LAI data retrieved from the fused reflectance data and the singular vectors derived from the 4-day interval Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI data is established to reconstruct the continuous time series field-scale LAI imagery at a given time step. The accuracy of the reconstructed LAI and its capability for winter wheat yield estimation were tested on the Guanzhong Plain of China. The results indicate that (1) the ESTARFM model can fuse the reflectance bands from visible to shortwave infrared of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 on the Guanzhong Plain accurately within a 20-day interval of the winter wheat growth and development period; (2) the 4-day interval field-scale LAI imagery over the main winter wheat growth and development period can be accurately reconstructed based on the linear regression models between the fused LAI data and the singular vectors derived from the 4-day interval MODIS LAI data; and (3) the yield map estimated from the reconstructed field-scale LAI shows more yield distribution details than MODIS yield estimation results. This study shows the feasibility of reconstructing continuous time series field-scale LAI data over the main winter wheat growth and development period on the Guanzhong Plain by combining the spatiotemporal data fusion model with SVD and the potential for estimating the winter wheat yield at field scales. © 2020 The Authors","Crop yield estimation; Field scale; Singular vector decomposition (SVD); Spatiotemporal data fusion; time series LAI reconstruction","Continuous time systems; Crops; Data fusion; Image enhancement; Land use; Landforms; Radiometers; Reflection; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Satellites; Time series; Crop growth and development; Growth and development; High temporal resolution; Linear regression models; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Optical remote sensing; Short wave infrared; Spatio-temporal data; Image reconstruction; crop yield; field method; growth; land use; leaf area index; MODIS; reconstruction; satellite data; satellite imagery; satellite sensor; Sentinel; spatial resolution; time series; wheat; yield response; China; Guanzhong Plain; Shaanxi; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Crop yield forecasts can help decision makers to formulate policies on maintaining national food reserves, sustaining food supply chains and attaining national food security. Inter field crop yield heterogeneity arising from varied field management and agricultural practices necessitates this forecasting to be done at field-level. Such field level information can aid farmers to identify gaps in water and farm management practices and take corrective actions, if needed. So far, no scalable tools are available to predict crop yields at field level that leverage the availability of open-access high-resolution RS data. This research implements an operational framework to predict field level crop biomass by evaluating different regression algorithms to develop data driven models, leveraging historical and near real time open-access high resolution optical satellite data from Sentinel-2, radar data from Sentinel-1 and evapotranspiration (ETa) and Net Primary Production (NPP) data from Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) Water Productivity through Open-access Remotely sensed data (WaPOR) platform. NPP is used as a proxy for biomass production/yield. Five of the most commonly used regression algorithms were tested to build a data-driven model for sugarcane NPP prediction in Wonji-Shoa sugarcane estate, located in the Awash Basin, Ethiopia. The models tested were the Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR), Stepwise Multivariate Linear Regression (SMLR), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest Regression (RFR). The results revealed that for seasonal sugarcane NPP predictions, the linear regression models (MLR and SMLR) yielded more accurate predictions than the non-linear machine learning models (BRT, SVR and RFR) tested. The highest accuracy was achieved for MLR models for which estimates with 89% accuracy could be made 4 months prior to the harvest and with accuracies of 79% up to 200 days (approx. 6.5 months) before the harvest. The non-linear machine learning models, however, could not provide reliable estimates of sugarcane NPP (accuracies < 61%). Cumulative vegetation indices (VIs) were found to have higher predictive power than standard VIs for predicting future sugarcane NPP. Cumulative Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was found to be the variable with the highest predictive power, followed by VH polarized Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data and WaPOR ETa. The study shows the usefulness of high-resolution RS information to predict seasonal NPP at field level. The methods presented here can be translated into an automated framework towards an operational system. © 2022","Crop biomass prediction; Cumulated vegetation indices; Data driven models; Food security; Operational framework; Regression algorithms; Remote sensing","algorithm; biomass; crop production; data set; food security; regression analysis; remote sensing; vegetation dynamics",Article,Scopus

A model that predicts the yield of multiple crops and concurrently considers the interaction between multiple crop yields. We propose a new convolutional neural network model called YieldNet which utilizes a novel deep learning framework that uses transfer learning between corn and soybean yield predictions by sharing the weights of the backbone feature extractor.

The introduction of remote sensing in agricultural monitoring makes accurate estimation of regional crop yields possible. However, remote sensing images and crop distribution maps with coarse spatial resolution usually cause inaccuracy in yield estimation due to the existence of mixed pixels. This study aimed to estimate the annual yields of maize and sunflower in Hetao Irrigation District in North China using 30 m spatial resolution HJ-1A/1B CCD images and high accuracy multi-year crop distribution maps. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series obtained from HJ-1A/1B CCD images was fitted with an asymmetric logistic curve to calculate daily NDVI and phenological characteristics. Eight random forest (RF) models using different predictors were developed for maize and sunflower yield estimation, respectively, where predictors of each model were a combination of NDVI series and/or phenological characteristics. We calibrated all RF models with measured crop yields at sampling points in two years (2014 and 2015), and validated the RF models with statistical yields of four counties in six years. Results showed that the optimal model for maize yield estimation was the model using NDVI series from the 120th to the 210th day in a year with 10 days’ interval as predictors, while that for sunflower was the model using the combination of three NDVI characteristics, three phenological characteristics, and two curve parameters as predictors. The selected RF models could estimate multi-year regional crop yields accurately, with the average values of root-mean-square error and the relative error of 0.75 t/ha and 6.1% for maize, and 0.40 t/ha and 10.1% for sunflower, respectively. Moreover, the yields of maize and sunflower can be estimated fairly well with NDVI series 50 days before crop harvest, which implicated the possibility of crop yield forecast before harvest. © 2018 by the authors.

This paper proposes a parallel version of the FuzzyPred algorithm based on the amount of data that can be processed within each of the processing threads, synchronously and independently. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Computer architecture; Data handling; Large dataset; Data size; Large datasets; Large volumes; Parallel version; Technological advances; Data mining",Retracted,Scopus

The article presents the results of analysis of its long-term dynamics for the period of 2001−2016 for the municipalities of Belgorod Region. The main causes of the observed dynamics are analyzed. It was found that the most significant factors are the changes in crops acreage and the climatic conditions of the growing season. The date of the first NDVI value at the start of the season correlates well with air temperature data. But the trend of this indicator for the period of research (2001−2017) on the territory of the region is not revealed. An indistinct 5−7 years periodicity of local minima and maximums of this indicator is observed. Dynamics of crops acreage has stronger effect on the date of seasonal NDVI maximum than trends of weather conditions (which act towards the onset of an earlier peak in the growing season). It leads, albeit to a weak, but increasingly later NDVI seasonal peak date in the second half of the analyzed period. The main factor of the dynamics of the magnitude of the seasonal NDVI maximum in Belgorod Region is dynamics of the cropping rotations, the combination of crop yields and acreage.

More than 785,000 workers are directly employed in this activity, which represents the 26% of all jobs in the agricultural sector. Colombian coffee growers estimate the production of cherry coffee with the main aim of planning the required activities, and resources (number of workers, required infrastructures), anticipating negotiations, estimating, price, and foreseeing losses of coffee production in a specific territory. These important processes can be affected by several factors that are not easy to predict (e.g., weather variability, diseases, or plagues.).

With the advent of modern Earth Observation programmes such as the Sentinel satellites, which provide quasi-synchronous and high-resolution multi-source information over any area of the continental surfaces, new opportunities are opened up to accurately map crop yields in smallholder farming systems.

Accurate and timely estimation of the sugarcane yield before harvest plays a particularly important role in the management of agroecosystems. The rapid development of remote sensing technologies, especially Light Detecting and Ranging (LiDAR), significantly enhances aboveground fresh weight (AFW) estimations. In our study, we evaluated the capability of LiDAR mounted on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in estimating the sugarcane AFW in Fusui county, Chongzuo city of Guangxi province, China. We measured the height and the fresh weight of sugarcane plants in 105 sampling plots, and eight variables were extracted from the field-based measurements. Six regression algorithms were used to build the sugarcane AFW model: multiple linear regression (MLR), stepwise multiple regression (SMR), generalized linear model (GLM), generalized boosted model (GBM), kernel-based regularized least squares (KRLS), and random forest regression (RFR). The results demonstrate that RFR (R2 = 0.96, RMSE = 1.27 kg m−2) performs better than other models in terms of prediction accuracy. The final fitted sugarcane AFW distribution maps exhibited good agreement with the observed values (R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 1.33 kg m−2). Canopy cover, the distance to the road, and tillage methods all have an impact on sugarcane AFW. Our study provides guidance for calculating the optimum planting density, reducing the negative impact of human activities, and selecting suitable tillage methods in actual cultivation and production. © 2020 by the authors.

Simulation crop models can assist in scenario planning, but their use is limited because of data requirements and long runtimes. Thus, there is a need for more computationally expedient approaches to scale up predictions. We evaluated the potential of four machine learning (ML) algorithms (LASSO Regression, Ridge Regression, random forests, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and their ensembles) as meta-models for a cropping systems simulator (APSIM) to inform future decision support tool development. We asked: (1) How well do ML meta-models predict maize yield and N losses using pre-season information? (2) How many data are needed to train ML algorithms to achieve acceptable predictions? (3) Which input data variables are most important for accurate prediction? And (4) do ensembles of ML meta-models improve prediction? The simulated dataset included more than three million data including genotype, environment and management scenarios. XGBoost was the most accurate ML model in predicting yields with a relative mean square error (RRMSE) of 13.5%, and Random forests most accurately predicted N loss at planting time, with a RRMSE of 54%. ML meta-models reasonably reproduced simulated maize yields using the information available at planting, but not N loss. They also differed in their sensitivities to the size of the training dataset. Across all ML models, yield prediction error decreased by 10%-40% as the training dataset increased from 0.5 to 1.8 million data points, whereas N loss prediction error showed no consistent pattern. ML models also differed in their sensitivities to input variables (weather, soil properties, management, initial conditions), thus depending on the data availability researchers may use a different ML model. Modest prediction improvements resulted from ML ensembles. These results can help accelerate progress in coupling simulation models and ML toward developing dynamic decision support tools for pre-season management. © 2019 The Author(s).

An initial attempt has been made in this study to select important parameters to be used as input to the machine learning method. Mean Decrease Accuracy and Mean Decrease Gini measures of random forest algorithm have been used to select the important parameters for predictive modelling. The results of the study revealed that Green Normalized Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Land Surface Water Index performed best among other indices. Bands B2, B3, B6 and B7 of Landsat-8 recorded as top scorers.

The Random Forest method exhibits a significant performance (RMSE= 1.51 t/ha and R2 = 0.94) as compared with other methods such as Classification and Regression Tree, Support Vector Regression and K-Nearest Neighbor. The proposed model based on random forest algorithm is best among all the scenarios and growth stages, whereas model based on classification and regression tree performs worst in all the cases. The proposed study indicates that the numerical value of a single spectral parameter and single-date data is not sufficient for the reliable yield estimation because it is difficult to discriminate some of the crops due to similar phenology in a particular growth period. © 2020 Lavoisier.

Under the FASAL project, the jute acreage estimation was carried out in the last 6 years by using both microwave SAR data (2012-13 to 2016-17) and high resolution optical multi-spectral data (2017-18). In the assessment using SAR data, hierarchical decision rule classification technique and for optical data hybrid classification approach was used. Yield was estimated using, agro-meteorological parameter based statistical models. In the present study, different statistical parameters such as correlation coefficient (r) and RMSE were used for evaluating and comparing the results of the last 6 years (2012-13 to 2017-18) with DES (government) estimates. The RMSE values over the years were found to be 7-20%and 5-13% for area and production, respectively. The correlation coefficient (r) over the years between DES and FASAL estimates ranging between 0.995 to 1.00 and 0.996 to 1.00 in acreage and production estimates respectively. At district level, the correlation coefficient (r) values for the area and production were 0.967 and 0.962 respectively. On the basis of statistical criteria used in this study, FASAL estimates were close to DES estimates and improved over the years.

Monitoring salt affected areas and assessing land cover changes, which caused by salinization, can be an effective approach to rehabilitate saline soils and prevent further salinization of agricultural fields. Using potential of satellite imagery taken over time along with remote sensing techniques, makes it possible to determine salinity changes at regional scales. This study deals with monitoring salinity changes and trend of the expansion in different land cover types of Bakhtegan Salt Lake district during the last two decades using multi-temporal Landsat images. For this purpose, per-pixel trend analysis of soil salinity during years 2000 to 2016 was performed and slope index maps of the best salinity indicators were generated for each pixel in the scene. The results of this study revealed that vegetation indices (GDVI and EVI) and also salinity indices (SI-1 and SI-3) have great potential to assess soil salinity trends in vegetation and bare soil lands respectively due to more sensitivity to salt features over years of study. In addition, images of May had the best performance to highlight changes in pixels among different months of the year. A comparative analysis of different slope index maps shows that more than 76% of vegetated areas have experienced negative trends during 17 years, of which about 34% are moderately and highly saline. This percent is increased to 92% for bare soil lands and 29% of salt affected soils had severe salinization. It can be concluded that the areas, which are close to the lake, are more affected by salinity and salts from the lake were brought into the soil which will lead to loss of soil productivity ultimately.","Land covers; Landsat time series data; Per-pixel trend analysis; Salinity indicators; Slope index; Soil salinity","Lakes; Maps; Pixels; Productivity; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Time series; Time series analysis; Vegetation; Weathering; Land cover; Landsat time series; Slope index; Soil salinity; Trend analysis; Soils",Conference Paper,Scopus

Accordingly, the objective of this investigation was to develop a method that can accurately define the most suitable environment in the greenhouse for an optimal yield of roses. Herein, an optimal and highly accurate BO-DNN surrogate model was developed (based on 300 experimental data points) for a quick and reliable classification of the rose yield environment considering some of the most influential variables including soil humidity, temperature and humidity of air, CO2 concentration, and light intensity (lux) into its architecture. Initially, two BO techniques (GP and GBRT) are used for the tuning process of the hyper-parameters (such as learning rate, batch size, number of dense nodes, number of dense neurons, number of input nodes, activation function, etc.). After that, an optimal and simple combination of the hyper-parameters was selected to develop a DNN algorithm based on 300 data points, which was further used to classify the rose yield environment (the rose yield environments were classified into four classes such as soil without water, correct environment, too hot, and very cold environments). The very high accuracy of the proposed surrogate model (0.98) originated from the introduction of the most vital soil and meteorological parameters as the inputs of the model. The proposed method can help in identifying intelligent greenhouse environments for efficient crop yields. © 2021 by the authors.

The recent success in applying multi-task learning to various geospatial prediction problems shows that the model parameters themselves may also be spatially related. This suggests the possibility of employing convolutional methods to learn the spatial dependencies among the model parameters at different locations, especially in situations where there are limited training data available to fit accurate local models.

From a public health perspective, food security is an essential social determinant for promoting healthy nutrition. Food security embraces four dimensions: physical availability of food, economic and physical access to food, food utilization, and the sustainability of the dimensions above. Integrally addressing the four dimensions is vital. Surprisingly most of the works focused on a single dimension of food security: the physical availability of food. Objective: The paper proposes a multi-dimensional dataset of open data and satellite images to characterize food security in the department of Cauca, Colombia. Methods: The food security dataset integrates multiple open data sources; therefore, the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining methodology was used to guide the construction of the dataset. It includes sources such as population and agricultural census, nutrition surveys, and satellite images. Results: An open multidimensional dataset for the Department of Cauca with 926 attributes and 9 rows (each row representing a Municipality) from multiple sources in Colombia, is configured. Then, machine learning models were used to characterize food security and nutrition in the Cauca Department. As a result, The Food security index calculated for Cauca using a linear regression model (Mean Absolute Error of 0.391) is 57.444 in a range between 0 and 100, with 100 the best score. Also, an approach for extracting four features (Agriculture, Habitation, Road, Water) of satellite images were tested with the ResNet50 model trained from scratch, having the best performance with a macro-accuracy, macro-precision, macro-recall, and macro-F1-score of 91.7, 86.2, 66.91, and 74.92%, respectively. Conclusion: It shows how the CRISP-DM methodology can be used to create an open public health data repository. Furthermore, this methodology could be generalized to other types of problems requiring the creation of a dataset. In addition, the use of satellite images presents an alternative for places where data collection is challenging. The model and methodology proposed based on open data become a low-cost and effective solution that could be used by decision-makers, especially in developing countries, to support food security planning.

Three transfer learning methods, namely, fine-tuned DeepLab V3+, SegNet, and fully convolutional network-8s (FCN-8s), were utilized to detect clover fractions (on an area basis). The detected clover fraction (CFdetected), together with auxiliary variables, viz., measured clover height (Hclover) and grass height (Hgrass), were used to build multiple linear regression (MLR) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) models for BC estimation. A total of 347 clover–grass images were used to build the estimation model on clover fraction and BC. Of the 347 samples, 226 images were augmented to 904 images for training, 25 were selected for validation, and the remaining 96 samples were used as an independent dataset for testing. Testing results showed that the intersection-over-union (IoU) values based on the DeepLab V3+, SegNet, and FCN-8s were 0.73, 0.57, and 0.60, respectively. The root mean square error (RMSE) values for the three transfer learning methods were 8.5, 10.6, and 10.0%. Subsequently, models based on BPNN and MLR were built to estimate BC, by using either CFdetected only or CFdetected, grass height, and clover height all together. Results showed that BPNN was generally superior to MLR in terms of estimating BC. The BPNN model only using CFdetected had a RMSE of 8.7%. In contrast, the BPNN model using all three variables (CFdetected, Hclover, and Hgrass) as inputs had an RMSE of 6.6%, implying that DeepLab V3+ together with BPNN can provide good estimation of BC and can offer a promising method for improving forage management. © Copyright © 2021 Sun, Liang, Zuo, Parsons, Morel, Shi, Wang, Luo, Zhao, Fang, He and Zhou.","back propagation neural network; crop species classification; DeepLab V3+; forage crop; transfer learning",,Article,Scopus

Temperature, radiation, water availability and other environmental conditions influence crop growth, development, and final grain yield in a complex nonlinear manner. Machine learning (ML) techniques, and deep learning (DL) methods in particular, can account for such nonlinear relations between yield and its covariates. However, they typically lack transparency and interpretability, since the way the predictions are derived is not directly evident. Yet, in the context of yield forecasting, understanding which are the underlying factors behind both a predicted loss or gain is of great relevance. Here, we explore how to benefit from the increased predictive performance of DL methods while maintaining the ability to interpret how the models achieve their results. To do so, we applied a deep neural network to multivariate time series of vegetation and meteorological data to estimate the wheat yield in the Indian Wheat Belt. Then, we visualized and analyzed the features and yield drivers learned by the model with the use of regression activation maps. The DL model outperformed other tested models (ridge regression and random forest) and facilitated the interpretation of variables and processes that lead to yield variability. The learned features were mostly related to the length of the growing season, and temperature and light conditions during this time. For example, our results showed that high yields in 2012 were associated with low temperatures accompanied by sunny conditions during the growing period. The proposed methodology can be used for other crops and regions in order to facilitate application of DL models in agriculture. © 2020 The Author(s).

Linear regression is an old data processing tool, and artificial neural networks are a comparatively new one. The goal of the study was to determine whether artificial neural networks are more accurate than linear regression in sweet corn yield prediction. In the study we used a dataset obtained from field experiments on the technological improvement of sweet corn cultivation. The field experiments were conducted during the period from 2014 to 2016 on dark-chestnut soil under drip irrigated conditions in the Steppe Zone of Ukraine. We studied the impact of the moldboard plowing depths, mineral fertilizer application rates and plant densities on the crop yield. A significant impact of all the studied factors on the sweet corn productivity was proved by using the analysis of variance. The highest yield of sweet corn ears without husks (10.93 t ha–1) was under the moldboard plowing at the depth of 20–22 cm, mineral fertilizers application rate of N120P120, plant density of 65,000 plants ha–1. Data processing by using the linear regression and artificial neural network methods showed that the latter is a great deal better than linear regression in sweet corn yield prediction. Higher accuracy of the artificial neural network prediction was proved by the higher value of the coefficient of determination (R2) – 0.978, in comparison to 0.897 for the linear regression prediction model. We conclude that artificial neural networks are a much better data processing tool, especially, in the life sciences and for prediction of the non-linear natural processes and phenomena. The main disadvantage of the neural network models is their “black box” nature. However, linear regression will not lose its popularity among scientists in the nearest future. Linear regression is a much simpler data analysis tool, it is easier to perform the prediction, but it still provides a sufficiently high level of accuracy. © 2018 Oles Honchar Dnipro National University.

The higher spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 compared to Landsat allows for satellite-based crop yield mapping even in relatively small scaled agricultural settings such as found in Switzerland and other central European regions. In this study, five years (2017–2021) of cereal crop yield data from a combine harvester were used to model crop yield within-field, on a spatial scale corresponding to the Sentinel-2 pixel level. Three established methods from literature using (i-ii) spectral indices and (iii) raw satellite reflectance as well as (iv) a recurrent neural network (RNN) were chosen for analysis. Although the RNN approach did not outperform the other methods, it was more efficient because of the comparatively simple end-to-end training of the model, resulting in much less time spent on data cleaning and feature extraction needed for spectral index time series analysis. The RNN was also able to discriminate cloudy data by itself, reaching similar performance levels as if using pre-processed, cloud-free data. Modelling was performed on individual years, all years combined and on unseen years using leave-one-year-out cross-validation. The models performed best when using data from all years (R2 up to 0.88, relative RMSE up to 10.49 %) and showed poor performance when predicting on unseen data years, especially for years with previously unknown weather patterns. This highlights the importance of yearly model calibration and the need for continuous data collection enabling long time series for future crop yield models. © 2023 The Authors","Cereals; Crop yield; Precision farming; Random forest; Recurrent neural network; Sentinel-2; Spectral indices; Time series analysis","artificial neural network; calibration; cereal; crop yield; Landsat; mapping method; pixel; policy making; precision agriculture; prediction; Sentinel; spatial resolution; spectral analysis; time series analysis; Switzerland",Article,Scopus

The Gaussian process regression (GPR) and radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) models exhibited the most accurate SSY predictions, with determination coefficients, or R2 values, of 0.99 and 0.91, respectfully. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) obtained using the ML models ranged between 0 and 0.30 t/ha (metric tons/hectare) for the varied modeling process phases. The estimation of the sesame seed yield with the coupled PCA-ML models improved the performance accuracy. According to the k-fold process, we utilized the datasets with the lowest error rates to ensure the continued accuracy of the GPR and RBF models. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the capsule number per plant (CPP), seed number per capsule (SPC), and 1000-seed weight (TSW) were the most significant seed yield determinants. © 2022 by the authors.","agro-morphological; data-driven; machine learning; seed yield; sensitivity analysis",,Article,Scopus

Therefore, the implementation of efficient nutrient management stratigies is important for food security and environmental safety. Amongst the essential plant nutrients, managing nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) based production systems is citically important to maximize profitable production with minimal negative environmental impacts. We investigated the effects of different fertilizer-N (viz. 0–240 kg N ha-1; N0-N240) and fertilizer-K (viz. 0–90 kg K ha-1; K0-K90) application rates on wheat productivity, nutrient (N and K) use efficiency viz. partial factor productivity (PFPN/K), agronomic efficiency (AEN/K), physiological efficiency (PEN/K), reciprocal internal use efficiency (RIUEN/K), and profitability in terms of benefit-cost (B-C) ratio, gross returns above fertilizer cost (GRAFC) and the returns on investment (ROI) on fertilizer application. These results revealed that wheat productivity, plant growth and yield attributes, nutrients uptake and use efficiency increased significantly (p&lt;0.05)with fertilizer-N application, although the interaction effect of N x K application was statistically non-significant (p&lt;0.05). Fertilizer-N application at 120 kg N ha-1 (N120) increased the number of effective tillers (8.7%), grain yield (17.3%), straw yield (15.1%), total N uptake (25.1%) and total K uptake (16.1%) than the N80. Fertilizer-N application significantly increased the SPAD reading by ~4.2–10.6% with fertilizer-N application (N80N240), compared with N0. The PFPN and PFPK increased significantly with fertilizer-N and K application in wheat. The AEN varied between 12.3 and 22.2 kg kg-1 with significantly higher value of 20.8 kg kg-1 in N120. Fertilizer-N application at higher rate (N160) significantly decreased the AEN by ~16.3% over N120. The N120treatment increased the AEK by ~52.6% than N80 treatment. Similarly the RIUEN varied between 10.6 and 25.6 kg Mg-1 grain yield, and increased significantly by ~80.2% with N120 as compared to N0 treatment. The RIUEK varied between 109 and 15.1 kg Mg-1 grain yield, and was significantly higher in N120 treatment. The significant increase in mean gross returns (MGRs) by ~17.3% and mean net returns (MNRs) by ~24.1% increased the B-C ratio by ~15.1% with N120 than the N80 treatment. Fertilizer-N application in N120 treatment increased the economic efficiency of wheat by ~24.1% and GRAFC by ~16.9%. Grain yield was significantly correlated with total N uptake (r = 0.932**, p&lt;0.01), K uptake (r = 0.851**), SPAD value (r = 0.945**), green seeker reading (r = 0.956**), and the RIUEN (r = 0.910**). The artificial neural networks (ANNs) showed highly satisfactory performance in training and simulation of testing data-set on wheat grain yield. The calculated mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) for wheat were 0.0087, 0.834 and 0.052, respectively. The well trained ANNs model was capable of producing consistency for the training and testing correlation (R2 = 0.994**, p&lt;0.01) between the predicted and actual values of wheat grain yield, which implies that ANN model succeeded in wheat grain yield prediction. © 2022 Sharma et al.

It was well-known for its richness of natural resources. Indonesia is one of the world's largest tropical countries, because of its tropical environment. According to the statistics, however, arable land in Indonesia has declined dramatically over the years in response to increased demand for residential areas. This data reveals a fairly alarming fact: It is feasible that, despite its wealth of natural resources, Indonesia could one day be unable to meet its domestic food demands. Furthermore, rivalry and obstacles faced by Indonesian farmers may exacerbate the country's restricted food supply. The assessments of potential investment in basil plant (Ocimum basillicum P.) were conducted, to support the agricultural innovation to be more appealing among stakeholders, researchers, and farmers. In assessing the potential investment, the financial aspect of the feasibility study is used in this study, where this assessment was commonly used in planning and forecasting the financial gains of a project or investment.

The information collected by the sensor was analysed by cloud computing technology, which provided a basis for agronomic operation and result evaluation of regional experiment. The test results show that there is no significant difference between the rice data collected by cloud computing and the manually collected rice data. It can replace the manually collected rice information, reduce labour costs and improve experimental quality. Regional test of crop varieties is an intermediate link in the breeding and popularization of new varieties, and the results of regional test are the main basis for the approval of crop varieties. With the popularization and application of network, it brings opportunities for the networking of regional test management, statistics and variety evaluation.

This paper focuses on developing a machine learning method to predict and determine the tobacco grade based on the environment condition and the plantation. Four independent variables that are temperature, sunlight hours, humidity, rainfall, and the plantation were used as a predictor to one target variable, which is the tobacco leaves grade. We applied two regression methods: Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine to predict whether there is a relationship between independent and dependent variables. The results depicted that Gradient Boosting Machine and Random Forest methods could be done to predict the tobacco grade successfully. The result also showed that Gradient Boosting Machine is superior to Random Forest in two experiments (with and without the plantation variables).

Despite tremendous technological advancements, fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil) continue to be the world’s primary source of energy. Global energy scenarios indicate a change in coal consumption trends in the future, which in turn will have commercial, geopolitical, and environmental consequences. We investigated coal consumption up to 2030 using a new hybrid method of WOANFIS (whale optimization algorithm and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system). The WOANFIS method’s performance was assessed by the MSE (Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), STD (error standard deviation), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and coefficient of correlation (R2) among the real dataset and the WOANFIS result. For the prediction of global coal consumption, the proposed WOANFIS had the best MAE, RMSE, and correlation coefficient (R2) values, which were 0.00113, 0.0047, and 0.98, respectively. Lastly, future global coal consumption was predicted up to 2030 by WOANFIS.

Satellite imagery is an interesting big data source that has potential applications in agriculture. When applying satellite imagery for crop yield estimation, practitioners choose which resolution (i.e., grid size) of images to use. Processing higher resolution images requires greater computing resources compared to lower resolution images. Practitioners may choose to use lower resolution images, but there may be a loss in crop yield model estimation accuracy. The cost of computation has decreased significantly with the advent of cloud computing and open access computing portals such as Google Earth Engine. These technologies have made satellite image processing more economical. The objective of this research is to quantify the crop yield estimation accuracy improvement that could be achieved by using higher resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with a cropland mask. NDVI (a measure of crop greenness) data was collected for 48 U.S. states for four crops over 11 years. The crops investigated were corn, soybeans, spring wheat, and winter wheat. Each crop yield regression model estimation showed improved accuracy (R2) as the satellite NDVI resolution increased. Results suggest that using higher resolution satellite NDVI provides more accurate crop yield estimation compared to lower resolution satellite NDVI.

Yet, the majority of sensor-based decision tools which support fertiliser management have relied on simplistic mechanistic frameworks normally informed by a single sensor. This study used a 20-year nitrogen (N) experiment on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to test a range of approaches for N decision support systems, including commercial sensor-based options and a novel, multivariate, data-driven approach. The latter was based on a non-mechanistic framework in which various digital variables were trained directly against optimum N application rates using machine learning. It was hypothesized that such a method would enhance our ability to handle system complexity, resulting in higher accuracy for the decision, as compared to current farm management or to available sensor-based options, both of which are normally underpinned by mechanistic methods. Results showed that the proposed approach was able to predict the optimal N rate with an RMSE of 16.5 kg N ha–1 (R2 = 0.79). This method was also the only one that was statistically superior (p &lt; 0.05) to the control scenario (the application of the historical average optimal N rate; RMSE =38.0 kg N ha–1). This proposed approach used a multivariate digital input including a spectral vegetation index (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI), weather and soil moisture data and information from on-farm experimentation (the in-situ N response using a ‘N-rich’ strip) to guide the decision. When similar data input and modelling techniques were used to predict yield potential to then derive an N recommendation through a mechanistic decision framework – a nutrient mass balance – the recommendation error (RMSE) increased to 26.0 kg N ha−1 (R2 = 0.51). In summary, by forcing the input data through the mechanistic framework, the decision error increased. This study challenges the ideas that farm decisions should follow pre-established agronomic mechanistic frameworks and that digital technologies must necessarily be used to estimate specific crop and soil attributes so as to enable deployment of current decision systems at scale and site-specifically. © 2021 The Authors","Crop reflectance sensors; Decision support systems; Nitrogen; On-farm experimentation; Soil moisture sensors","accuracy assessment; agricultural management; artificial intelligence; cost analysis; decision support system; error analysis; machine learning; optimization; sensor; soil moisture; wheat; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Therefore, there is an incentive to apply it in other important domains such as agriculture. Fertilizers, electricity, chemicals, human labor, and water are the components of total energy consumption in agriculture. Yield estimates are critical for food security, crop management, irrigation scheduling, and estimating labor requirements for harvesting and storage. Therefore, estimating product yield can reduce energy consumption. Two deep learning models, Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units, have been developed for the analysis of time-series data such as agricultural datasets. In this paper, the capabilities of these models and their extensions, called Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units, to predict end-of-season yields are investigated. The models use historical data, including climate data, irrigation scheduling, and soil water content, to estimate end-of-season yield. The application of this technique was tested for tomato and potato yields at a site in Portugal. The Bidirectional Long Short-Term memory outperformed the Gated Recurrent Units network, the Long Short-Term Memory, and the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units network on the validation dataset. The model was able to capture the nonlinear relationship between irrigation amount, climate data, and soil water content and predict yield with an MSE of 0.017 to 0.039. The performance of the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory in the test was compared with the most commonly used deep learning method, the Convolutional Neural Network, and machine learning methods including a Multi-Layer Perceptrons model and Random Forest Regression. The Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory outperformed the other models with an R2 score between 0.97 and 0.99. The results show that analyzing agricultural data with the Long Short-Term Memory model improves the performance of the model in terms of accuracy. The Convolutional Neural Network model achieved the second-best performance. Therefore, the deep learning model has a remarkable ability to predict the yield at the end of the season. © 2021 by the authors.

Considering the LSTM model has characteristics of memorizing time series information, we adopted different time steps to estimate wheat yield. The results showed that the accuracy of yield estimation was highest (RMSE = 357.77 kg/ha and R2 = 0.83) under two time steps and the input combination (meteorological data and two remotely sensed indices). We evaluated the yield estimation accuracy of the optimal LSTM model performance compared with the back propagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector machine (SVM). As a result, the LSTM model outperformed BPNN (R2 = 0.42 and RMSE = 812.83 kg/ha) and SVM (R2 = 0.41 and RMSE = 867.70 kg/ha), since its recurrent neural network structure that can incorporate nonlinear relationships between multi-features inputs and yield. To further validate the robustness of the optimal LSTM method, the correlations between estimated yield and measured yield at the irrigation sites and the rain-fed sites from 2008 to 2016 were analyzed, and the results demonstrated that the proposed model can serve as an effective approach for different type sampling sites and has better adaptability to interannual fluctuations of climate. Our findings demonstrated a reliable and promising approach for improving yield estimation. © 2021","Leaf area index (LAI); Long short-term memory (LSTM); Meteorological data; Vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI); Yield estimation","artificial neural network; back propagation; crop yield; economic development; estimation method; food security; leaf area index; meteorology; remote sensing; satellite data; wheat; China; Guanzhong Plain; Shaanxi",Article,Scopus

For a commercial organization that manages large amounts of crops, collecting accurate and consistent data is a bottleneck. Due to limited time and labor, accurately phenotyping crops to record color, head count, height, weight, etc. is severely limited. However, this information, combined with other genetic and environmental factors, is vital for developing new superior crop species that help feed the world's growing population. Recent advances in machine learning, in particular deep learning, have shown promise in mitigating this bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method for counting on-ear corn kernels in-field to aid in the gathering of real-time data and, ultimately, to improve decision making to maximize yield. We name this approach DeepCorn, and show that this framework is robust under various conditions. DeepCorn estimates the density of corn kernels in an image of corn ears and predicts the number of kernels based on the estimated density map. DeepCorn uses a truncated VGG-16 as a backbone for feature extraction and merges feature maps from multiple scales of the network to make it robust against image scale variations. We also adopt a semi-supervised learning approach to further improve the performance of our proposed method. Our proposed method achieves the MAE and RMSE of 41.36 and 60.27 in the corn kernel counting task, respectively.

Therefore, monitoring the real-time net photosynthesis plays an essential role in improving the quality of productions in commercial greenhouses. Net photosynthesis mainly depends on three environmental parameters, that are light level, temperature and CO2 concentration. However, it is challenging to calculate accurate net photosynthesis due to the highly nonlinear relation. In this paper, Deep Learning (DL) is utilized to model this relationship in order to predict the net photosynthesis based on the three inputs. Firstly, the architecture of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model is designed according to the features of this problem, and three activation functions are concerned for the DNN model design. Secondly, a training dataset is established, and two schedules of Learning Rate (LR), fixed LR and exponential decay LR, are elaborated. Then, to select the optimal hyperparameters for the DNN model, experiments of hyperparameters tuning related to activation functions and LR schedules are implemented, respectively. Finally, through a comprehensive evaluation of the training speed and the prediction accuracy, a DNN model that is with ReLU activation function and decay LR is determined.

Artificial neural networks are increasingly used by food producers at every stage of agricultural production and in efficient farm management.

Artificial intelligence methods support decision-making systems in agriculture, help optimize storage and transport processes, and make it possible to predict the costs incurred depending on the chosen direction of management. The inclusion of machine learning methods in the “life cycle of a farm” requires handling large amounts of data collected during the entire growing season and having the appropriate software.

As the most intuitive effect of dams, deformation contains important information on dam evolution. Actual response has the purpose of diagnosis and early warning compared with model prediction. Given the poor generalization ability of the conventional statistical model, establishing a dam deformation monitoring model is thus essential. The prediction of concrete dam deformation using statistical model and random forest regression (RFR) model is studied. To build an optimized RFR model, the statistical model is used to establish input variables, select the appropriate parameters Mtry and Ntree according to out-of-bag error, and extract strong explanatory variables. The model's advantage is that the influence factors can describe concrete dam deformation, and RF can serve as a sensible new data mining tool. The importance of variables for deformation prediction is measured by RF. The RFR method can extract representative influencing factors based on variable importance. The methods are applied to an actual concrete dam. Results indicate that the RFR model can be applied for analysis and prediction of other structural behavior.

Nevertheless, these temporal observations should be utilized to benefit the classification process. After extensive research has been conducted on modeling temporal dynamics by spectro-temporal profiles using vegetation indices, we propose a deep learning approach to utilize these temporal characteristics for classification tasks.

Recent developments in interpretable machine learning techniques offer opportunities to use these methods in agronomic studies. Our objectives were two-fold: (1) to assess the performance of different machine learning methods to explain on-farm wheat yield variability in the Northwestern Indo-Gangetic Plains of India, and (2) to identify the most important drivers and interactions explaining wheat yield variability. A suite of fine-tuned machine learning models (ridge and lasso regression, classification and regression trees, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, gradient boosting, extreme gradient boosting, and random forest) were statistically compared using the R2, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The best performing model was again fine-tuned using a grid search approach for the bias-variance trade-off. Three post-hoc model agnostic techniques were used to interpret the best performing model: variable importance (a variable was considered “important” if shuffling its values increased or decreased the model error considerably), interaction strength (based on Friedman's H-statistic), and two-way interaction (i.e., how much of the total variability in wheat yield was explained by a particular two-way interaction). Model outputs were compared against empirical data to contextualize results and provide a blueprint for future analysis in other production systems. Tree-based and decision boundary-based methods outperformed regression-based methods in explaining wheat yield variability. Random forest was the best performing method in terms of goodness-of-fit and model precision and accuracy with RMSE, MAE, and R2 ranging between 367 and 470 kg ha−1, 276–345 kg ha−1, and 0.44–0.63, respectively. Random forest was then used for selection of important variables and interactions. The most important management variables explaining wheat yield variability were nitrogen application rate and crop residue management, whereas the average of monthly cumulative solar radiation during February and March (coinciding with reproductive phase of wheat) was the most important biophysical variable. The effect size of these variables on wheat yield ranged between 227 kg ha−1 for nitrogen application rate to 372 kg ha−1 for cumulative solar radiation during February and March. The effect of important interactions on wheat yield was detected in the data namely the interaction between crop residue management and disease management and, nitrogen application rate and seeding rate. For instance, farmers’ fields with moderate disease incidence yielded 750 kg ha−1 less when crop residues were removed than when crop residues were retained. Similarly, wheat yield response to residue retention was higher under low seed and N application rates. As an inductive research approach, the appropriate application of interpretable machine learning methods can be used to extract agronomically actionable information from large-scale farmer field data. © 2022 The Authors","Accumulated local effect plot; Big data; Interaction strength; Partial dependency plot; Quantile regression; Random forest; Variable importance","crop yield; disease incidence; machine learning; productivity; regression; India",Article,Scopus

Traditional methods typically use linear regression models with clear assumptions; such methods are unable to capture the complex relationships between genotypes and phenotypes. Non-linear models (e.g., deep neural networks) have been proposed as a superior alternative to linear models because they can capture complex non-additive effects. Here we introduce a deep learning (DL) method, deep neural network genomic prediction (DNNGP), for integration of multi-omics data in plants. We trained DNNGP on four datasets and compared its performance with methods built with five classic models: genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP); two methods based on a machine learning (ML) framework, light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and support vector regression (SVR); and two methods based on a DL framework, deep learning genomic selection (DeepGS) and deep learning genome-wide association study (DLGWAS). DNNGP is novel in five ways. First, it can be applied to a variety of omics data to predict phenotypes. Second, the multilayered hierarchical structure of DNNGP dynamically learns features from raw data, avoiding overfitting and improving the convergence rate using a batch normalization layer and early stopping and rectified linear activation (rectified linear unit) functions. Third, when small datasets were used, DNNGP produced results that are competitive with results from the other five methods, showing greater prediction accuracy than the other methods when large-scale breeding data were used. Fourth, the computation time required by DNNGP was comparable with that of commonly used methods, up to 10 times faster than DeepGS. Fifth, hyperparameters can easily be batch tuned on a local machine. Compared with GBLUP, LightGBM, SVR, DeepGS and DLGWAS, DNNGP is superior to these existing widely used genomic selection (GS) methods. Moreover, DNNGP can generate robust assessments from diverse datasets, including omics data, and quickly incorporate complex and large datasets into usable models, making it a promising and practical approach for straightforward integration into existing GS platforms. © 2022 The Author","deep learning; genomic selection; multi-omics data; prediction method","genome-wide association study; genomics; plant breeding; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Multiomics; Neural Networks, Computer; Plant Breeding",Article,Scopus

The weather plays a crucial role in crop growth and development. Therefore, models using weather variables can provide reliable forecasts for crop yield and choosing the right model for crop production forecasts can be difficult. Therefore in the present study, an attempt was made to find the best model for wheat yield forecast by using five different techniques viz. Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression (SMLR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Elastic Net (ELNET) and Ridge regression. Historical wheat yield data (taken from the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare) and weather data of past 18-20 years were collected for seven different districts of Uttarakhand. Analysis was carried out by fixing 80% of the data for calibration and remaining dataset for validation. The present study concluded that the performance of ANN was good for crop yield forecasting as compared to the other models based on the value of RMSE (0.005-0.474) and nRMSE (0.166-26.171). © 2022, Association of Agrometeorologists.

Firstly, in order to reduce the influence of light on image processing, the RGB color image is converted to HSI color image, and the S component image of the HSI color space is extracted as a research object. Then, the S component image is binarized by the Otsu method, the hole of the binary image is filled by morphology closing algorithm, and the sugarcane and the background are initially separated by the horizontal projection map of the binary image. Finally, the position of sugarcane stem is preliminarily determined by continuously taking the derivative of the vertical projection function of the binary image, and the sum of the local pixel value of the suspicious pixel column is compared to further determine the sugarcane stem node. The experimental results showed that the recognition rate of single stem node is 100%, and the standard deviation is less than 1.1 mm. The accuracy of simultaneous identification of double stem nodes is 98%, and the standard deviation is less than 1.7 mm. The accuracy of simultaneous identification of the three stem nodes is 95%, and the standard deviation is less than 2.2 mm.

However, cost-effectively characterizing agronomically important phenotypic traits on a large scale remains a bottleneck. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based high-throughput phenotyping has recently become a prominent method, as it allows large numbers of plants to be analyzed in a time-series manner. In this experiment, 233 inbred lines from the maize (Zea mays L.) diversity panel were grown in the field under different nitrogen treatments. Unmanned aerial vehicle images were collected during different plant developmental stages throughout the growing season. A workflow for extracting plot-level images, filtering images to remove nonfoliage elements, and calculating canopy coverage and greenness ratings based on vegetation indices (VIs) was developed. After applying the workflow, about 100,000 plot-level image clips were obtained for 12 different time points. High correlations were detected between VIs and ground truth physiological and yield-related traits. The genome-wide association study was performed, resulting in n = 29 unique genomic regions associated with image extracted traits from two or more of the 12 total time points. A candidate gene Zm00001d031997, a maize homolog of the Arabidopsis HCF244 (high chlorophyll fluorescence 244), located underneath the leading single nucleotide polymorphisms of the canopy coverage associated signals were repeatedly detected under both nitrogen conditions.

In this study, we demonstrate the use of agronomic knowledge of crop growth drivers in a Long Short-Term Memory-based, domain-guided neural network (DgNN) for in-season crop progress estimation. The DgNN uses a branched structure and attention to separate independent crop growth drivers and captures their varying importance throughout the growing season. The DgNN is implemented for corn, using RS data in Iowa, U.S., for the period 2003–2019, with United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) crop progress reports used as ground truth. State-wide DgNN performance shows significant improvement over sequential and dense-only NN structures, and a widely-used Hidden Markov Model method. The DgNN had a 4.0% higher Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency over all growth stages and 39% more weeks with highest cosine similarity than the next best NN during test years. The DgNN and Sequential NN were more robust during periods of abnormal crop progress, though estimating the Silking–Grainfill transition was difficult for all methods. Finally, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection visualizations of layer activations showed how LSTM-based NNs separate crop growth time-series differently from a dense-only structure. Results from this study exhibit both the viability of NNs in crop growth stage estimation (CGSE) and the benefits of using domain knowledge. The DgNN methodology presented here can be extended to provide near-real time CGSE of other crops. © 2021 by the authors.

The overarching approach is to develop and adopt a systems-agronomy framework relevant to any wheat production system. It first establishes the scale of current yield gaps, identifies defensible benchmarks, and takes a holistic approach to understand and overcome exploitable yield gaps to complement genetic increases in potential yield. New opportunities to increase productivity will be sought by exploiting future Genotype × Environment × Management synergies in different wheat systems. To identify research gaps and opportunities for collaboration among different wheat producing regions, the EWG compiled a comprehensive database of currently funded wheat agronomy research (n = 782) in countries representing a large proportion of the wheat grown in the world. The yield gap analysis and research database positions the EWG to influence priorities for wheat agronomy research in member countries that would facilitate collaborations, minimize duplication, and maximize the global impact on wheat production systems. This paper outlines a vision for a global WI agronomic research strategy and discusses activities to date. The focus of the WI-EWG is to transform the agronomic research approach in wheat cropping systems, which will be applicable to other crop species. © Copyright © 2020 Beres, Hatfield, Kirkegaard, Eigenbrode, Pan, Lollato, Hunt, Strydhorst, Porker, Lyon, Ransom and Wiersma.","agronomy; Expert Working Group; Genotype × Environment × Management; wheat; Wheat Initiative",,Article,Scopus

Machine learning (ML), with its predictive power to tackle complex systems, may solve this barrier in the development of locally based N recommendations. The objective of this study was to explore application of ML methodologies to predict economic optimum nitrogen rate (EONR) for corn using data from 47 experiments across the US Corn Belt. Two features, a water table adjusted available water capacity (AWCwt) and a ratio of in-season rainfall to AWCwt (R AWCwt), were created to capture the impact of soil hydrology on N dynamics. Four ML mod-els—linear regression (LR), ridge regression (RR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, and gradient boost regression trees (GBRT)—were assessed and validated using “leave-one-location-out” (LOLO) and “leave-one-year-out” (LOYO) approaches. Generally, RR outperformed other models in predicting both at planting and split EONR times. Among the 47 tested sites, for 33 sites the predicted split EONR using RR fell within the 95% confidence interval, suggesting the chance of using the RR model to make an acceptable prediction of split EONR is ~70%. When RR was used to test split EONR prediction with input weather features surrogated with 10 yr of historical weather data, the model demonstrated robustness (MAE, 33.6 kg ha–1; R2 = 0.46). Incorporating mechanistically derived hydrological features significantly enhanced the ability of the ML procedures to model EONR.

Of all input data for WXGEN, precipitation is critical due to its sensitivity to the number of wet days. Since global climate model (GCM) data tend to have excessive wet days, use of GCM precipitation data for WXGEN may cause errors in the estimation of climate variables and therefore SWAT predictions. To examine such impacts of GCM data, we prepared two climate data for SWAT using WXGEN with both the original GCM data with the excessive number of wet days (EGCM) and the processed GCM data with the reasonable number of wet days (RGCM). We then compared SWAT simulations from EGCM and RGCM. Results show that because of the excessive wet days in EGCM, solar radiation generated by WXGEN was underestimated, subsequently leading to 143 mm lower ET and 0.6-0.8 m3/s greater streamflow compared to the simulations from RGCM. Simulated crop biomass under EGCM was smaller than RGCM due to less solar radiation. Although use of WXGEN is increasing in projecting climate change impacts using SWAT, potential errors from the combination of WXGEN and GCM have not well investigated. Our findings clearly demonstrate that GCM bias (excessive wet days) leads WXGEN to generate inaccurate climate data, resulting in unreasonable SWAT predictions. Thus, GCM data should be carefully processed to use them for WXGEN. © 2018 by the authors.","Excessive wet days; GCM bias; SWAT; WXGEN","Climate change; Solar radiation; Climate change impact; Excessive wet days; GCM bias; Global circulation model; Global climate model; Soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; WXGEN; Climate models; climate effect; climate modeling; comparative study; hydrological modeling; prediction; soil and water assessment tool; wet season",Article,Scopus

Especially India is an extensive agricultural resource for the world's expansive economic growth.

So time variation-based big data analysis is essential for research improvement. To resolve this problem, we propose a Timestamp feature variation-based weather prediction using multi-perception neural classification (TFV-MPNC) for successive crop recommendation in big data analysis. Initially, the pre-processing was carried out to prepare the redundant noise dataset for fast prediction. Initially, the Preprocessing ensures the Contemporary Forecasting rate (CFR) for predicting the previous deficiency rate. Based on that Time stamp feature analysis (TSFA). The Dense region harvest rate (DRHR) was evaluated, and features were decision using Fuzzy intensive decision Function (FIDF), selected the scaled features and trained with multi-perception neural classification (MPNN). The proposed system produces higher forecasting by prediction features as well supportive to the weather dependences related to higher classification rate in precision, and recall has the best classification result. © 2023 Auricle Global Society of Education and Research.

However, conventional spatial sequential pattern mining is not applied efficiently or directly in the aspect of serial remote sensing images. Therefore, a residue feature analysis with empirical mode decomposition is proposed so as to enhance the spatial sequential pattern mining efficacy from the raster serial remote sensing images. At first, input images are being extracted by means of minima and maxima pattern by computing the mean of envelops and the intrinsic mode function components. If the intrinsic mode function condition is satisfied, then it is being subtracted from the original image; finally, the image is decomposed into many intrinsic mode functions and residue. The experimental outcomes attained indicate that the proposed strategy is proficient of mining spatial sequential pattern from the images of serial remote sensing.

A phytoremediation study was undertaken at the Agricultural College and Research Institute (AC & RI), Killikulam, Thoothukudi District, Tamil Nadu, India, during 2020-2021 to evaluate the performance of cumbu napier varieties on sodic and neutral soil. Four cumbu napier varieties, CO (BN) 6, CO (BN) 5, KKM 1 and CO (CN) 4, were tested in both soils. Pots were filled with 10 kg of soil. Three cuttings of cumbu napiers per pot were planted as per the treatment schedule. Germination and growth parameters were observed up to three harvests. The results of the present study revealed that the germination percentage of variety CO (BN) 6 was highest (100%) among the varieties under sodic conditions. Growth parameters such as plant height, leaf length, number of leaves, and number of clumps of this variety showed better efficiency under high sodic levels than other varieties. This variety CO (BN) 6 could tolerate and be established well under alkaline soil and produced amaximum plant height (134 cm) and a higher number of clumps (10) during the third harvest. The growth pattern of cumbu napier varieties was in the order of CO (BN) 6> CO (BN) 5 > KKM 1 > CO (CN) 4. Furthermore, the experimental results revealed that cumbu napier could be recommended as a suitable crop for sodic soil. © Author (s).","Alkaline soil; Cumbu napier; Germination percentage; Growth parameters; Pennisetum purpureum; Sodic soil",,Article,Scopus

Understanding relationship of water extraction of groundwater can lead to better watershed management. The main problem in this study is the complexity of recharge processes and limited observations in groundwater recharge in Malaysia makes it difficult to quantify. This study was done at Baung’s watershed (BW) which can be considered as an ungauged watershed. The estimation of groundwater recharge in BW was done using SWAT. However, BW cannot be calibrated due to lack of streams station availability but the uncalibrated SWAT able to provide satisfactory predictions on hydrologic budget. A framework for SWAT input data including hydrography, terrain, land-use, soil, and weather for BW was then focused in order to achieve the model simulation for ungauged basins. The results emphasize the importance and prospects of using accurate spatial input data for the physically based SWAT model. Normal condition, extreme-low precipitation and future in land-use development represented as scenarios 1, 2, and 3 were evaluated in this study. These conditions give different groundwater recharge rate as different scenarios give different impact to groundwater. Model was found to produce a reliable estimation of groundwater recharge of 405 mm/year (14.6%), 194.12 mm/year (11.1%), and 214.23 mm/year (7.7%) for scenarios 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In conclusion, it suggested that groundwater recharge should not be assumed always 6% of annual rainfall in Malaysia as the factors influencing groundwater recharge need to be took into consideration in assisting groundwater exploration and management. © 2020 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

The proposed TCP is composed of 1 gateway and 2 modules as follows. First, the optimized farm sensor gateway (OFSG) collects data by internetworking sensor nodes which use Zigbee, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth protocol and reduces the number of sensor data fragmentation times through the compression of a fragment header. Second, the data storage module (DSM) stores the collected farm data and weather data in a farm central server. Third, the crop self-diagnosis module (CSM) works in the cloud server and diagnoses by deep learning whether or not the status of a farm is in good condition for growing crops according to current weather and soil information. The TCP performance shows that the data processing rate of the OFSG is increased by about 7% compared with existing sensor gateways. The learning time of the CSM is shorter than that of the long short-term memory models (LSTM) by 0.43 s, and the success rate of the CSM is higher than that of the LSTM by about 7%. Therefore, the TCP based on deep learning interconnects the communication protocols of various sensors, solves the maximum data size that sensor can transfer, predicts in advance crop disease occurrence in an external environment, and helps to make an optimized environment in which to grow crops. © 2018 by the authors.","Crop-diagnosis; Deep leaning; Farm cloud server; Farm sensor gateway",,Article,Scopus

The utility of HadCM3 as a tool in climate change predictions in cross cultural studies is scarce. Therefore, this study sought to investigate and predict climate change induced temperature and precipitation in Iran. The calibration and validation using the HadCM3 was performed during 1961-2001, using daily temperatures and precipitation. The data on temperature and precipitation from 1961 to 1990 were used for calibration, and, for model validation, data from 1991 to 2001 were used. Moreover, in order to downscale general circulation models to station scales, SDSM version 4.2 was utilized. The least difference between observed data and simulation data during calibration and validation showed that the parameter was precisely modeled for most of the year. Simulation under the A2 scenario was performed for three time periods (2020, 2050, and 2080). According to our simulated model, precipitation showed a decreasing trend whereas temperature showed an increasing trend. The result of this research paper makes a significant contribution to climate smart agriculture in Iran. For example, rural development practitioners can devise effective policies and programs in order to reduce the vulnerability of local communities to climate change impacts. Moreover, the result of this study can be used as an optimal model for land allocation in agriculture. Moreover, a shortage of rainfall and decreased temperatures also have implications for agricultural land allocation. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate change; Global circulation model; HadCM3; Iran; Prediction; SDSM","agricultural land; agricultural management; agricultural production; climate change; climate effect; climate prediction; data processing; general circulation model; global climate; model validation; nature-society relations; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; temperature profile; vulnerability; Iran",Article,Scopus

A pertinent question is to know the optimal level of soil sampling or how many soil samples are needed formodel input, in order to improve model predictions. In this study, measured soil properties were clustered into five different configurations as inputs to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) simulation of the Castor River watershed (11-km2 area) in southern Quebec, Canada. SWAT is a process-based model that predicts the impacts of climate and land use management on water yield, sediment, and nutrient fluxes. SWAT requires geographical information system inputs such as the digital elevation model as well as soil and land use maps. Mean values of soil properties are used in soil polygons (soil series); thus, the spatial variability of these properties is neglected. The primary objective of this study was to quantify the impacts of spatial variability of soil properties on the prediction of runoff, sediment, and total phosphorus using SWAT. The spatial clustering of the measured soil properties was undertaken using the regionalized with dynamically constrained agglomerative clustering and partitioning method. Measured soil data were clustered into 5, 10, 15, 20, and 24 heterogeneous regions. Soil data from the Castor watershed which have been used in previous studies was also set up and termed ""Reference"". Overall, there was no significant difference in runoff simulation across the five configurations including the reference. This may be attributable to SWAT's use of the soil conservation service curve number method in flow simulation. Therefore having high spatial resolution inputs for soil data may not necessarily improve predictions when they are used in hydrologic modeling. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.","Heterogeneities; Hydrology; Model averaging; Spatial variability; Water quality",,Article,Scopus

Then, we corrected the climate model rainfall intensity bias by mapping its truncated rainfall distribution into the station's truncated distribution. Further improvements were made to the bias corrected GCM rainfall by linking it with a stochastic disaggregation scheme to correct the time structure problem inherent with daily GCM rainfall.

By combining an advanced statistical bias correction method with a dynamical downscaling it constitutes a hybrid technique that yields nearly unbiased, high-resolution, physically consistent, three-dimensional fields that can be used for climate impact studies. The method is based on a prior statistical distribution correction of large-scale global climate model (GCM) 3-dimensional output fields to be taken as boundary forcing of a dynamical regional climate model (RCM). GCM fields are corrected using meteorological reanalyses. We evaluate this methodology over a decadal experiment. The improvement in terms of spatial and temporal variability is discussed against observations for a past period. The biases of the downscaled fields are much lower using this hybrid technique, up to a factor 4 for the mean temperature bias compared to the dynamical downscaling alone without prior bias correction.

In this study, Sentinel-2 (multispectral data) and ZY-1 02D (hyperspectral data) were used together with 15709 gridded yield data (with a resolution of 5 m × 5 m) to predict the winter wheat yield. These estimates were based on four mainstream data-driven approaches: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The method that gave the best estimate of the winter wheat yield was determined, and the accuracy of the estimates based on multispectral and hyperspectral data were compared. The results showed that the LSTM model, for which the RMSE of the estimates was 0.201 t/ha, performed better than the RF (RMSE = 0.260 t/ha), GBDT (RMSE = 0.306 t/ha), and SVR (RMSE = 0.489 t/ha) methods. The estimates based on the ZY-1 02D hyperspectral data were more accurate than those based on the 30-m Sentinel-2 data: RMSE = 0.237 t/ha for the ZY-1 02D data, which is about a 5% improvement on the RSME of 0.307 t/ha for the 30-m Sentinel-2 data. However, the 10-m Sentinel-2 data performed even better, giving an RMSE of 0.219 t/ha. In addition, it was found that the greenness vegetation index SR (simple ratio index) outperformed the traditional vegetation indices. The results highlight the potential of the shortwave infrared bands to replace the visible and near-infrared bands for predicting crop yields Our study demonstrates the advantages of the deep learning method LSTM over machine learning methods in terms of its ability to make accurate estimates of the winter wheat yield.

This study aims to develop an early forecasting model of cereal yields (soft wheat, barley and durum wheat) at the scale of the agricultural province considering the 15 most productive over 2000–2017 (i.e., 15 × 18 = 270 yields values). To this objective, we built on previous works that showed a tight linkage between cereal yields and various datasets including weather data (rainfall and air temperature), regional climate indices (North Atlantic Oscillation in particular), and drought indices derived from satellite observations in different wavelengths. The combination of the latter three data sets is assessed to predict cereal yields using linear (Multiple Linear Regression, MLR) and non-linear (Support Vector Machine, SVM; Random Forest, RF, and eXtreme Gradient Boost, XGBoost) machine learning algorithms. The calibration of the algorithmic parameters of the different approaches are carried out using a 5-fold cross validation technique and a leave-one-out method is implemented for model validation. The statistical metrics of the models are first analyzed as a function of the input datasets that are used, and as a function of the lead times, from 4 months to 2 months before harvest. The results show that combining data from multiple sources outperformed models based on one dataset only. In addition, the satellite drought indices are a major source of information for cereal prediction when the forecasting is carried out close to harvest (2 months before), while weather data and, to a lesser extent, climate indices, are key variables for earlier predictions. The best models can accurately predict yield in January (4 months before harvest) with an R2 = 0.88 and RMSE around 0.22 t. ha−1 . The XGBoost method exhibited the best metrics. Finally, training a specific model separately for each group of provinces, instead of one global model, improved the prediction performance by reducing the RMSE by 10% to 35% depending on the provinces. In conclusion, the results of this study pointed out that combining remote sensing drought indices with climate and weather variables using a machine learning technique is a promising approach for cereal yield forecasting. © 2021 by the authors.

Due to the absence of complex microbial network interactions and soil heterogeneity in a restricted soilless medium, the architecture of roots is a function of genetics defined by the soilless matrix and exogenously supplied nutrients such as nitrogen (N). The knowledge of root trait combinations that offer the optimal nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is far from being conclusive. The objective of this study was to define the root trait(s) that best predicts and correlates with vegetative biomass under differed N treatments. We used eight image-derived root architectural traits of 202 diverse spinach lines grown in two N concentrations (high N, HN, and low N, LN) in randomized complete blocks design. Supervised random forest (RF) machine learning augmented by ranger hyperparameter grid search was used to predict the variable importance of the root traits. We also determined the broad-sense heritability (H) and genetic (rg) and phenotypic (rp) correlations between root traits and the vegetative biomass (shoot weight, SWt). Each root trait was assigned a predicted importance rank based on the trait’s contribution to the cumulative reduction in the mean square error (MSE) in the RF tree regression models for SWt. The root traits were further prioritized for potential selection based on the rg and SWt correlated response (CR). The predicted importance of the eight root traits showed that the number of root tips (Tips) and root length (RLength) under HN and crossings (Xsings) and root average diameter (RAvdiam) under LN were the most relevant. SWt had a highly antagonistic rg (− 0.83) to RAvdiam, but a high predicted indirect selection efficiency (− 112.8%) with RAvdiam under LN; RAvdiam showed no significant rg or rp to SWt under HN. In limited N availability, we suggest that selecting against larger RAvdiam as a secondary trait might improve biomass and, hence, NUE with no apparent yield penalty under HN. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"nitrogen; anatomy and histology; biomass; genetics; machine learning; metabolism; phenotype; plant root; quantitative trait; seedling; spinach; Biomass; Machine Learning; Nitrogen; Phenotype; Plant Roots; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Seedlings; Spinacia oleracea",Article,Scopus

This study evaluated the use and relative importance of readily available weather data to develop yield estimation models for maize and soybean in the US central Corn Belt. Total rainfall (Rain), average air temperature (Tavg), and the difference between maximum and minimum air temperature (Tdiff) at weekly, biweekly, and monthly timescales from May to August were used to estimate county-level maize and soybean grain yields for Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Minnesota. Step-wise multiple linear regression (MLR), general additive (GAM), and support vector machine (SVM) models were trained with Rain, Tavg, and with/without Tdiff. For the total study area and at individual state level, SVM outperformed other models at all temporal levels for both maize and soybean. For maize, Tavg and Tdiff during July and August, and Rain during June and July, were relatively more important whereas for soybean, Tavg in June and Tdiff and Rain during August were more important. The SVM model with weekly Rain and Tavg estimated the overall maize yield with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 591 kg ha−1 (4.9% nRMSE) and soybean yield with a RMSE of 205 kg ha−1 (5.5% nRMSE). Inclusion of Tdiff in the model considerably improved yield estimation for both crops; however, the magnitude of improvement varied with the model and temporal level of weather data.

Machine learning (ML) approaches have emerged as promising artificial intelligence alternative and complimentary tools to the commonly used crop production models. The study was designed to answer the following questions: (a) Can machine learning techniques predict maize grain yields under conservation agriculture (CA)? (b) How close can ML algorithms predict maize grain yields under CA-based cropping systems in the highlands and lowlands of Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA)? Machine learning algorithms could predict maize grain yields from conventional and CA-based cropping systems under low and high potential conditions of the ESA region. Linear algorithms (LDA and LR) predicted maize yield more closely to the observed yields compared with nonlinear tools (NB, KNN, CART and SVM) under the conditions of the reported study. However, the KNN algorithm was comparable in its yield prediction to the linear tools tested in this study. Overall, the LDA algorithm was the best tool, and SVM was the worst algorithm in maize yield prediction.

Moreover, skilful and reliable daily forecast sequences are required to drive decision support models that operate on a daily time step. While downscaling of daily GCM outputs has been developed extensively in climate impacts studies, much less attention has been paid to the downscaling of ensemble GCM forecasts, which has the confronting aspect of low and diminishing skill with increasing lead time. Evidence is building that simple bias-correction methods that do not model correlation between forecasts and observations, nor attempt to correct spatial, temporal and inter-variable correlations, produce downscaled forecasts that perform poorly in applications models. Thus downscaling GCM forecasts requires inclusion of a full calibration component to reduce bias, improve reliability, capture skill where it is available and remove negative skill. In this study, we propose a new methodology for coupling a full GCM forecast calibration with empirical methods to (a) instil correct temporal, spatial and inter-variable correlations in ensembles and (b) perform a multivariate downscaling of ensembles to daily sequences at multiple sites. Through a case study application, the proposed methodology is shown to produce skilful monthly–seasonal forecasts of rainfall, temperature and solar radiation at regional spatial scales. It also produces realistic and coherent multivariate daily sequences at multiple sub-grid locations.

The three major fruit production areas on the Central Coast complement each other in producing fruits almost throughout the year. Forecasting strawberry yield with some lead time can help growers plan for required and often limited human resources and aid in making strategic business decisions. The objectives of this paper were to investigate the correlation among various weather parameters related with strawberry yield at the field level and to evaluate yield forecasts using the predictive principal component regression (PPCR) and two machine-learning techniques: (a) a single layer neural network (NN) and (b) generic random forest (RF). The meteorological parameters were a combination of the sensor data measured in the strawberry field, meteorological data obtained from the nearest weather station, and calculated agroclimatic indices such as chill hours. The correlation analysis showed that all of the parameters were significantly correlated with strawberry yield and provided the potential to develop weekly yield forecast models. In general, the machine learning technique showed better skills in predicting strawberry yields when compared to the principal component regression. More specifically, the NN provided the most skills in forecasting strawberry yield.

Hence, the evaluation of soil quality is very important for determining the amount of nutrients that the soil require for proper yield. In present decade, the application of deep learning models in many fields of research has created greater impact. The increasing soil data availability of soil data there is a greater demand for the remotely avail open source model, leads to the incorporation of deep learning method to predict the soil quality. With that concern, this paper proposes a novel model called Improved Soil Quality Prediction Model using Deep Learning (ISQP-DL). The work considers the chemical, physical and biological factors of soil in particular area to estimate the soil quality. Firstly, pH rating of soil samples has been collected from the soil testing laboratory from which the acidic range has been categorized through soil test and the same data has been taken as input to the Deep Neural Network Regression (DNNR) model. Secondly, soil nutrient data has been given as second input to the DNNR model. By utilizing this data set, the DNNR method is used to evaluate the fertility rate by which the soil quality has been estimated. For training and testing, the model uses Deep Neural Network Regression (DNNR), by utilizing the dataset. The results show that the proposed model is effective for SQP (Soil Quality Prediction Model) with efficient good fitting and generality is enhanced with input features with higher rate of classification accuracy. The results show that the proposed model achieves 96.7% of accuracy rate compared with existing models. © 2023 CRL Publishing.

Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) are all important nitrogen fertilizers extensively utilized in crops to supply a sufficient level of nutrients and keep their production level high. However, the application is generally limited to specific crops because of the global variability in these essential nutrients. Stability in fertilizer application, growth, and root growth rate increases crop fertility and crop production. To predict the suitable nutrients for different crops and provide nutrients recommendations by analyzing the crop fertility and yield production, this paper proposes nutrient recommendations through an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) that uses time-series sensor data and recommends various crop settings. A neighborhood-based strategy is then presented to handle exploration and exploitation for optimizing the parameters to obtain the maximum yield. The method can expand knowledge by using the population exploration strategy. The final recommendation is made by using the similarity between recommended patterns and real-time sensor data. With time, crop fertility decreases due to the low level of nutrients. This crop model will help to increase yield by analysis of the seasonal fertility performance of the soil. The proposed method is also a useful tool to improve soil fertility performance by providing the nutrient recommendation of optimal conditions for crop development. Experimental results show that the proposed model can recommend optimizing patterns and increasing the yearly yield efficiently. The method can help identify the region to assess crop suitability under certain nutrients levels and give insight into nutrient suitability assessments concerning specific crops in a climate-changing world. © 2021 The Author(s)","Agriculture; Evolutionary computation; Sensor data; Soil nutrients","Crops; Cultivation; Genetic algorithms; Nitrogen fertilizers; Soils; Agricultural productions; Energy inputs; Global variability; Minimal energy; Performance; Production level; Sensors data; Soil characteristics; Soil fertilization; Soil nutrients; Nutrients; crop production; crop yield; evolutionary theory; fertilizer application; genetic algorithm; growth; growth rate; nutrient; soil fertility; soil nutrient; time series analysis",Article,Scopus

The use of feature descriptors and detectors allows to find distinctive keypoints in an image and the use of this approach for agronomical applications has become a widespread field of study. By combining near infrared (NIR) images, acquired with a modified Nikon D80 camera, and visible spectrum (VIS) images, acquired with a Nikon D300s, a proper crop identification could be obtained. Still, the use of different sensors brings an image matching challenge due to the difference between cameras and the possible distortions from each imaging technique. The aim of this paper is to compare the performance of several feature descriptors and detectors by comparing near infrared and visual spectral bands in rice crop images. Therefore, a group of 20 different scenes with different cameras and growth stages in a rice crop were evaluated. Thus, red, green, blue (RGB) and L, a, b (CIE L*a*b*) channels were extracted from VIS images in order to compare the matches obtained between each of them and the corresponding NIR image. The BRISK, SURF, SIFT, ORB, KAZE, and AKAZE methods were implemented, which act as descriptors and detectors. Additionally, a combination was made between the FAST algorithm for the detection of keypoints with the BRIEF, BRISK, and FREAK methods for features description. BF and FLANN matching methods were used. The algorithms were implemented in Python using OpenCV library. The green channel presented the highest number of correct matches in all methods. In turn, the method that presented the highest performance both in time and in the number of correct matches was the combination of the FAST feature detector and the BRISK descriptor. © 2021 by the authors.

Soil salinization is one of the key problems of sustainable development of arid agricultural land. Exploring the use of shallow subsurface pipe drainage to improve soil salinization. Methods. This study investigates the desalinization effect of shallow subsurface pipe drainage, in combination with drip irrigation under plastic mulch, in an arid region in China. Field data collection was conducted in 2010. Soil salinity at a range of soil depths, water EC and pH of subsurface pipe drainage and crop yield during crop growth stages in salinized farmlands were measured. Results and Conclusion. The results show that soil salinity was reduced significantly on mildly (1-3 dS m-1) and moderately (3-6 dS m-1) salinized farmlands. The highest desalinization rate of mildly and moderately salinized soils was 51% and 91% respectively. The desalinization in upper soil layers, to a depth of 60 cm, was more significant than that in lower soil layers. Drainage water salinity was much higher than irrigation water salinity. Crop yield on mildly and moderately salinized land increased about 25% and 50%, respectively. This indicates that the combination of drip irrigation and shallow subsurface pipe drainage on farmlands is potential feasible to desalt farmlands and to improve crop yield.

As an important index of land deterioration and degree of drought, soil moisture can influence vegetation growth, hydrological cycle and water resource distribution in mountainous areas significantly. However, topographic effect of soil moisture under complicated mountainous terrain conditions still remains unknown. In the present study, a quantitative inversion on surface soil moisture content in a typical mountainous area of Dengfeng city, Henan province (China) in 2013 and 2017 was carried out by using temperature vegetation dryness index method based on Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) remote sensing images and digital elevation model (DEM). Results were conducive to analyze effects of terrain factors on spatial-temporal distribution of soil moisture and improve ecological environment in mountainous area. Besides, a quantitative analysis on topographic effect (e.g. elevation, slope and slope orientation) on soil moisture in mountainous area was performed based on DEM data. Results demonstrate that topographic factors (e.g. elevation, slope and slope orientation) can cause violent variations of soil moisture in mountainous areas. Soil moisture is positively correlated with elevation and slope. In view of slope orientations, shady slope generally presents the highest soil moisture, followed by semi-shady slope, sunny slope and semi-sunny slope successively. In 2017, the heat island effect in the study area is stronger and the arid area is significantly larger than those in 2013. Additionally, soil moisture in the region with elevation lower than 750 m and slope smaller than 25° is lower in relative to that in 2013, but it is higher in the region with elevation higher than 750 m and slope larger than 25°. This study discloses the influencing law of terrain factors on spatial-temporal distribution of soil moisture in mountainous areas.

In this study, artificial neural network (ANN) models were used for predicting maize in the major maize producing provinces of South Africa. The maize production prediction and projection analysis were carried out using the following climate variables: precipitation (PRE), maximum temperature (TMX), minimum temperature (TMN), potential evapotranspiration (PET), soil moisture (SM) and land cultivated (Land) for maize. The analyzed datasets spanned from 1990 to 2017 and were divided into two segments with 80% used for model training and the remaining 20% for testing. The results indicated that PET, PRE, TMN, TMX, Land, and SM with two hidden neurons of vector (5,8) were the best combination to predict maize production in the Free State province, whereas the TMN, TMX, PET, PRE, SM and Land with vector (7,8) were the best combination for predicting maize in KwaZulu-Natal province. In addition, the TMN, SM and Land and TMN, TMX, SM and Land with vector (3,4) were the best combination for maize predicting in the North West and Mpumalanga provinces, respectively. The comparison between the actual and predicted maize production using the testing data indicated performance accuracy adjusted R2 of 0.75 for Free State, 0.67 for North West, 0.86 for Mpumalanga and 0.82 for KwaZulu-Natal. Furthermore, a decline in the projected maize production was observed across all the selected provinces (except the Free State province) from 2018 to 2019.

However, many index variants produce similar results or unclear structures; therefore, their information content is restricted under practical conditions. The results analysis shows that a few indices are sufficient to regularly monitor irrigated fields. Talks with farmers revealed that advice is mainly needed to secure crop growth, leading to the decision to firstly select the indices NDVI and/or EVI.

This study extracted agricultural fields in the former homelands of Venda and Gazankulu in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Landsat 8 imageries for 2015 were used, applying the maximum likelihood supervised classifier to delineate the agricultural fields. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) applied on Landsat imageries on the mapped fields during the dry season (July to August) was used to identify irrigated areas, because years of satellite data analysis suggest that healthy crop conditions during dry seasons are only possible with irrigation. Ground truth points totaling 137 were collected during fieldwork for pre-processing and accuracy assessment. An accuracy of 96% was achieved on the mapped agricultural fields, yet the irrigated area map produced an initial accuracy of only 71%. This study explains and improves the 29% error margin from the irrigated areas. Accuracy was enhanced through post-classification correction (PCC) using 74 post-classification points randomly selected from the 2015 irrigated area map. High resolution aerial photographs of the 74 sample fields were acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to give a clearer picture of the irrigated fields. The analysis shows that mapped irrigated fields that presented anomalies included abandoned croplands that had green invasive alien species or abandoned fruit plantations that had high NDVI values.

A web service for preparing long-term climate data was implemented based on an international standard, Sensor Observation Service (SOS). The weather generator services, which are the core components of the framework, analyze climatological data, and can take seasonal climate forecasts as inputs for generating weather realizations. The generated weather realizations are encoded in a standard format, which are ready for use to crop modeling. All outputs are generated in SOS standard, which broadens the extent of data sharing and interoperability with other sectoral applications, e.g., water resources management. These services facilitate the development of other applications requiring input weather realizations, as these can be obtained easily by just calling the service.

Land surface patches within one HRU have identical hydrological properties (e.g., land use, soil, slope and management) and thus have similar hydrological responses. The non-spatial aspects of HRUs, however, are considered a key weakness of the SWAT model because it is difficult to determine the spatial locations and describe the interactions between different HRUs. Here, a new method to produce continuous HRUs with a clear spatial position for SWAT using Geographic Information System tools is proposed and then tested in a small catchment of the Taihu Basin, China.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for detecting and discriminating weeds growing in turfgrass based on their susceptibility to ACCase-inhibiting and synthetic auxin herbicides. Results: GoogLeNet, MobileNet-v3, ShuffleNet-v2, and VGGNet were trained to discriminate the vegetation into three categories based on the herbicide weed control spectrum: weeds susceptible to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides, weeds susceptible to synthetic auxin herbicides, and turfgrass without weed infestation (no herbicide). ShuffleNet-v2 and VGGNet showed high overall accuracy (≥ 0.999) and F1 scores (≥ 0.998) in the validation and testing datasets to detect and discriminate weeds susceptible to ACCase-inhibiting and synthetic auxin herbicides. The inference time of ShuffleNet-v2 was similar to MobileNet-v3, but noticeably faster than GoogLeNet and VGGNet. ShuffleNet-v2 was the most efficient and reliable model among the neural networks evaluated. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that the DCNNs trained based on the herbicide weed control spectrum could detect and discriminate weeds based on their susceptibility to selective herbicides, allowing the precision spraying of particular herbicides to susceptible weeds and thereby saving more herbicides.

This study evaluated the performance of an operational national wheat yield forecast system for the Australian wheatbelt using climatology and seasonal climate model-based input data, and introduces an alternative approach using a data fusion method. The crop forecasting system uses the APSIM wheat model to estimate water-limited potential yield. The climatology-based forecast tended to over predict national yield (high yield bias; 1.5 to 7% across forecast months), while the model-based method (using ACCESS-S1 dynamical model) tended to under predict yield (low yield bias; -5.9 to -0.5% across forecast months) and had a lower spread than climatology (10 to 50% lower across forecast months). The model-based forecast had skill in terms of accuracy and reliability during the second half of the season. The newly developed data fusion method used a weighting method calibrated for separate forecast locations (stations) to remove bias in the mean forecast yield and reduce ensemble spread. This resulted in improvements in the Australia-wide yield forecasts across all forecast start dates. This study provides a demonstration of how a data-driven approach can be applied to a crop forecast to improve accuracy and resolution of crop yield forecasts without the need for more computationally intensive downscaling approaches. © 2022","Data fusion; Forecast verification; Seasonal climate forecasts; Wheat yield; Yield forecasting","agroindustry; climate modeling; climatology; crop yield; downscaling; wheat; yield response; Australia",Article,Scopus

Such crop areas come from land cover maps or reported statistics, both of which can have errors and uncertainties. Sub-national or regional crop yield forecasting minimizes the propagation of these errors to some extent. In addition, regional forecasts provide added value and insights to stakeholders on regional differences within a country, which would otherwise compensate each other at national level. We propose a crop yield forecasting approach for multiple spatial levels based on regional crop yield forecasts from machine learning. Machine learning, with its data-driven approach, can leverage larger data sizes and capture nonlinear relationships between predictors and yield at regional level. We designed a generic machine learning workflow to demonstrate the benefits of regional crop yield forecasting in Europe. To evaluate the quality and usefulness of regional forecasts, we predicted crop yields for 35 case studies, including nine countries that are major producers of six crops (soft wheat, spring barley, sunflower, grain maize, sugar beets and potatoes). Machine learning models at regional level had lower normalized root mean squared errors (NRMSE) and uncertainty than a linear trend model, with Wilcoxon p-values of 3e-7 and 2e-7 for 60 days before harvest and end of season respectively. Similarly, regional machine learning forecasts aggregated to national level had lower NRMSEs than forecasts from an operational system in 18 out of 35 cases 60 days before harvest, with a Wilcoxon p-value of 0.95 indicating similar performance. Our models have room for improvement, especially during extreme years. Nevertheless, regional crop yield forecasts from machine learning and aggregated national forecasts provide a consistent forecasting method across spatial levels and insights from regional differences to support important policy decisions. © 2021 The Authors","Crop yield; Large-scale crop yield forecasting; Machine learning; Regional differences; Scalability","agricultural policy; crop production; crop yield; forecasting method; harvesting; land cover; machine learning; stakeholder; Europe; Helianthus; Hordeum; Solanum tuberosum",Article,Scopus

In spite of good performances to predict total aboveground biomass, poor results were obtained for final grain yield. In order to improve yield prediction, a surrogate model was developed from STICS dynamic simulations, feature selection techniques and regression learners.

Official yields in the top hazelnut producing municipalities in 2004–2019 are used as reference data, whereas ground observations of phenology and weather data represent the main HADES inputs. A statistical analysis allows inferring the occurrence and magnitude of biennial bearing in official yields and is used to aid the calibration of a process-based hazelnut simulation model. Then, a Random Forest algorithm is deployed in regression mode using the outputs of the process-based model as predictors, together with information on hazelnut varieties, the presence of alternate bearing in the yield series, and agro-meteorological indicators. HADES predictive ability in calibration and validation was balanced, with relative root mean square error below 20%, and R2 and Nash-Sutcliffe modeling efficiency above 0.7 considering all municipalities together.

Although many methods have been developed based on single remote sensing data sources, advances are still needed to exploit multisource remote sensing data with higher spatial and temporal resolution. More suitable time window selection methods and vegetation indexes, both of which are critical for yield estimations, have not been fully considered. In this article, the Chinese GaoFen-1 Wide Field View (GF-1 WFV) and Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were fused by the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) to generate time-series data with a high spatial resolution. Then, two time window selection methods involving distinguishing or not distinguishing the growth stages during the monitoring period, and three vegetation indexes, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) and wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI), were intercom-pared. Furthermore, the yield estimations obtained from two different spatial resolutions of fused data and MODIS data were analyzed. The results indicate that taking the growth stage as the time window unit division basis can allow a better estimation of winter wheat yield; and that WDRVI is more suitable for yield estimations than NDVI or EVI2. This study demonstrates that the spatial resolution has a great influence on yield estimations; further, this study identifies a better time window selection method and vegetation index for improving the accuracy of yield estimations based on a multisource remote sensing data fusion. © 2021 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers","Remote sensing; Spatiotemporal data fusion; Winter wheat; Yield estimation","Data fusion; Food supply; Image resolution; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Multisource remote sensing data; Remote-sensing; Selection methods; Spatio-temporal data; Spatiotemporal data fusion; Time windows; Vegetation index; Window selection; Winter wheat; Yield estimation; Crops",Article,Scopus

This study selected the remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI) and vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) which closely relate to crop growth and crop water stress as two key variables for indicating crop growth condition and estimating crop yields in the Guanzhong Plain, PR China. The single VTCI, the single LAI and the combination of VTCI and LAI at four growth stages of winter wheat (the turning green, jointing, heading-filling, and dough stages) were used as three input variable schemes of the back propagation (BP) neural network and the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm (IPSO)-BP neural network using a nonlinear decreasing inertia weight, respectively. The relative importance of the input variables to the output variable, yield of winter wheat, was used to determine the weight values of input variables at each growth stage. Based on the weights, the integrated index (I) was established, and then three linear regression models (weighted VTCIs, weighted LAIs, and I values) were established with yield data to estimate winter wheat yields. By calculating several statistical functions, i.e., coefficient of determination (R2) and probability value (P), the model between the I values and wheat yield performed better than those between the weighted VTCIs or weighted LAIs and wheat yields. The yield estimation model of I values by using the IPSO-BP neural network (R2 = 0.342) was found to be better than that using the BP neural network (R2 = 0.310). Therefore, we applied the model with better performance (R2 = 0.342) to map the regional winter wheat yields pixel by pixel in the Guanzhong Plain during 2011–2018, and analyzed the spatial and temporal characteristics of the estimated yields. Regarding the spatial distribution, the yields in the west part of the plain are the highest, followed by the central part, and the yields in the east part are lowest, consistent with previous studies. The estimated yields showed inter-annual fluctuations along with an increasing trend on the whole. Winter wheat yields were most depleted in 2013 and most abundant in 2015. These results were consistent with the actual situation of winter wheat production in the plain, which indicated that I can be used to provide a better quantification for monitoring regional winter wheat growth conditions and estimating crop yield. Thus, the approach of this study can provide significant benefit for regional crop production monitoring. © 2019","BP neural network; Integrated index; Leaf area index; Vegetation temperature condition index; Winter wheat yield estimation","Backpropagation algorithms; Cultivation; Food supply; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Pixels; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Traffic signals; Vegetation; BP neural networks; Integrated index; Leaf Area Index; Vegetation temperature condition index; Winter wheat yields; Crops; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Due to the importance of wheat production scale, it is advisable to predict its yield before harvesting. However, the current models are built solely on the basis of quantitative data. Therefore, the aim of the work was to create three multicriteria models for the prediction and simulation of winter wheat yield, which were made on the basis of extended quantitative and qualitative variables from field research in the year period 2008-2015. Neural networks with MLP (multi-layer perceptron) topology were used to build the following models, which can predict and simulate the yield on three dates: 15 April, 31 May, and 30 June. For this reason, they were designated as follows: QQWW15_4, QQWW31_5, and QQWW30_6. Each model is based on a different number of independent features, which ranges from 19 to 25. As a result of the conducted analyses, a MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) forecast error from 6.63% to 6.92% was achieved. This is equivalent of an error ranging from 0.521 to 0.547 t·ha-1, with an average yield of 6.57 ton per hectare of cultivated area. In addition, the most important quantitative and qualitative factors influencing the yield were also indicated. In the first predictive range (15 April), it is the average air temperature from 1 September to 31 December of the previous year (T9-12_PY). In the second predictive range (31 May) it is the sum of precipitation from 1 May to 31 May, and in the third (30 June) is the average air temperature from 1 January to 15 April of the year (T1-4_CY). In addition, one of the qualitative factors had a significant impact on the yield in the first phase-the type of forecrop in the previous year (TF_PY). The presented neural modeling method is a specific extension of the previously used predicting methods. An element of innovation of the presented concept of yield modeling is the possibility of performing a simulation before harvest, in the current agrotechnical season. The presented models can be used in large-area agriculture, especially in precision agriculture as an important element of decision-making support systems. © 2019 by the authors.","Artificial neural networks; Machine learning; MLP network; Precision agriculture; Sensitivity analysis; Winter wheat yield; Yield prediction; Yield simulation",,Article,Scopus

We assess the performance of these forecasts for soft wheat, durum wheat, grain maize, rapeseed, sunflower, potato and sugar beet, and sought to answer three questions. First, how good has the system performed? This was investigated by calculating several accuracy indicators (e.g. the mean absolute percentage error, MAPE) for the first forecasts during a season, forecasts one month pre-harvest, and the end-of-campaign (EOC) forecasts during 2006–2015 using reported yields. Second, do forecasts improve during the season? This was evaluated by comparing the accuracy of the first, the pre-harvest, and the EOC forecasts. Third, have forecasts systematically improved year-to-year? This was quantified by testing whether linear models fitted to the median of the national level absolute relative forecast errors for each crop at EU-12 (EU-27) level from 1993 to 2015 (2006–2015) were characterized by significant negative slopes. Encouragingly, the lowest median MAPE across all crops is obtained for Europe's largest producer, France, equalling 3.73%. Similarly, the highest median MAPE is obtained for Portugal, at 14.37%. Forecasts generally underestimated reported yields, with a systematic underestimation across all MS for soft wheat, rapeseed and sugar beet forecasts. Forecasts generally improve during the growing season; both the forecast error and its variability tend to progressively decrease. This is the case for the cereals, and to a lesser extent for the tuber crops, while seasonal forecast improvements are lower for the oilseed crops. The median EU-12 yield forecasts for rapeseed, potato and sugar beet have significantly (p-value < 0.05) improved from 1993 to 2015. No evidence was found for improvements for the other crops, neither was there any significant improvement in any of the crop forecasts from 2006 to 2015, evaluated at EU-27 level. In the early years of the MCYFS, most of the yield time series were characterized by strong trends; nowadays yield growth has slowed or even plateaued in several MS. In addition, an increased volatility in yield statistics is observed, and while crop yield forecasts tend to improve in a given year, in recent years, there is no evidence of structural improvements that carry-over from year-to-year. This underlines that renewed efforts to improve operational crop yield forecasting are needed, especially in the light of the increasingly variable and occasionally unprecedented climatic conditions impacting the EU's crop production systems. © 2018 The Authors","AMIS; Climate change; Crop production; Crop yield forecasting","accuracy assessment; assessment method; canola; climate change; climate conditions; crop improvement; crop plant; crop production; crop yield; European Union; growing season; growth; sugar beet; tuber; France; Portugal; Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Brassica napus; Helianthus; Solanum tuberosum; Triticum aestivum; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to analyze the past dataset of crop yields and predict future yields using regression-based approximation of time series fuzzy data. A framework-based algorithm, which we named DAbFP (data algorithm for degree approximation-based fuzzy partitioning), is proposed to forecast wheat yield production with fuzzy time series data. Specifically, time series data were fuzzified by the simple maximum-based generalized mean function. Different cases for prediction values were evaluated based on two-set interval-based partitioning to get accurate results. The novelty of the method lies in its ability to approximate a fuzzy relation for forecasting that provides lesser complexity and higher accuracy in linear, cubic, and quadratic order than the existing methods. A lesser complexity as compared to dynamic data approximation makes it easier to find the suitable de-fuzzification process and obtain accurate predicted values. The proposed algorithm is compared with the latest existing frameworks in terms of mean square error (MSE) and average forecasting error rate (AFER). © 2018 by the authors.","Fuzzy regression; Fuzzy rules; Time series; Wheat production prediction",,Article,Scopus

The typical approach consists in measuring multiple quantities and in applying complex and frequently just approximated mathematical models to characterize the sensor response. The use of machine learning to extract information from measurements in sensors have been tried in several forms before. But one of the problems with the approaches so far, is the difficulty in getting a training dataset that is representative of the measurements done by the sensor. Additionally, extracting multiple parameters from a single measurement has been so far an impossible problem to solve efficiently in luminescence. In this work a new approach is described for building an autonomous intelligent sensor, which is able to produce the training dataset self-sufficiently, use it for training a neural network, and then use the trained model to do inference on measurements done on the same hardware. For the first time the use of machine learning additionally allows to extract two parameters from one single measurement using multitask learning neural network architectures. This is demonstrated here by a dual oxygen concentration and temperature sensor. © 2021 by the authors.","dual sensor; machine learning; neural networks; optical sensors; oxygen sensing",,Article,Scopus

It can stabilize product quality and improve the economic efficiency of enterprises. In this paper, three process parameters of a carbonization furnace, namely feeding rate, rotation speed, and carbonization temperature, were adopted to build a quality optimization model for carbonized materials. First, an orthogonal test was designed to obtain the preliminary relationship between the process parameters and the quality indicators of a carbonized material and prepare data for modeling. Then, an improved SVR model was developed to establish the relationship between product quality indicators and process parameters. Finally, through the single-factor experiments and the Monte Carlo method, the process parameters affecting the quality of a carbonized material were determined and optimized. This showed that a high-quality carbonized material could be obtained with a smaller feeding rate, larger rotation speed, and higher carbonization furnace temperature. The quality of activated carbon reached its maximum when the feeding rate was 1.0 t/h, the rotation speed was 90 r/h, and the temperature was 836°C. It can effectively improve the quality of carbonized materials. © 2021, Physicochem. Probl. Miner. Process.

Adequate agricultural inputs, particularly nutrient amendments and best management practices, are essential to reverse this trend. There is a need to understand the cause of variations in maize yield, provide reliable early estimates of yields, and make necessary recommendations for fertilizer applications. Maize yield prediction and estimates of yield gaps using objective and spatial analytical tools could provide accurate and objective information that underpin decision support. A study was conducted in Rwanda at Nyakiliba sector and Gashora sector located in Birunga and Central Bugesera agro-ecological zones, with the objectives of (1) determining factors influencing maize yield, (2) predicting maize yield (using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) approach), and (3) assessing the maize yield gaps and the impact on food security. Maize grain yield was significantly higher at Nyakiliba (1.74 t ha−1) than at Gashora (0.6 t ha−1). NDVI values correlated positively with maize grain yield at both sites (R2 = 0.50 to 0.65) and soil fertility indicators (R2 = 0.55 to 0.70). Maize yield was highest at 40 kg P ha−1 and response to N fertilizer was adequately simulated at Nyakiliba (R2 = 0.85, maximum yield 3.3 t ha−1). Yield gap was 4.6 t ha−1 in Nyakiliba and 5.1 t ha−1 in Gashora. Soil variables were more important determinants of social class than family size.

The classifiers are built by classification algorithms using data. Nowadays, the data are high dimensional in nature since the data are massively generated due to advancements in information and communication technology. The high-dimensional space contains irrelevant and redundant features; both of them reduce the classification accuracy and increase space and building time of the classifiers. Redundancy and relevancy analysis mechanisms of the feature selection process remove the irrelevant and redundant features. Identifying the irrelevant features is a simple task since that only considers the relevancy between each feature and the target class of a dataset using any one of the statistical or information theoretic measures. Identifying the redundant features from a dataset is quite difficult, especially in high-dimensional space since it needs to consider the relevancy among the features. This leads to more computational complexity and an inappropriate relevancy measure that can degrade the classification accuracy.

The object of this study is to understand if surface karstification is the same as the interior karst development of an aquifer. Surface karstification was analyzed using Geographic Information System and remote sensing techniques, while interior karstification was studied with spring hydrograph analysis. The study area includes seven carbonate aquifers in the Zagros Region of Iran. The surface karstification of these aquifers is controlled by different factors including the thickness of carbonate formations, distance from faults, fracture density, precipitation, temperature, vegetation index, slope, and relief. The most important factors are precipitation and presence and density of faults and fractures; while the least significant factor is the vegetation cover. The spring hydrograph analysis shows that there are different ways of estimating the relative karst development, but each parameter that impacts the specific character of the karst aquifer might be independent of others. Furthermore, comparing the relative surface and interior karst development demonstrates that the possible relationship between them is unpredictable. Consequently, we define a specific and unique numeric method to assess the interior karst development that permits a meaningful concept and comparison among different aquifers throughout the world. © 2019, National Speleological Society Inc..

To this end, a 167&thinsp;ha catchment was delineated consisting of 10 hydrological response units. Daily data for streamflow and nitrate loadings from 2004 to 2015 were used to calibrate and validate the model, while annual values for crop yields (winter wheat, winter barley, rapeseed, maize silage) were available. In addition, the detailed field maps provided by the local farmer were used to implement exact crop rotations and nitrogen fertilization into the model. Nash-Sutcliffe-Efficiencies for streamflow were 0.54 during the calibration and 0.57 for the validation period. The modeling performance for nitrate loadings were lower with 0.31 for the calibration and 0.42 for the validation period. The average crop yields were reproduced well, while SWAT failed to reproduce the inter-annual crop yield variations. A scenario analysis revealed that a slight decrease of nitrogen fertilization leads to significant reductions in nitrate loadings, while crop yields remained on a high level. The outcome of the study may help practitioners to operate according to an economic and environmental optimal N management.

Consequently, analyzing the fuel consumption of agricultural machinery for farm operations of different sizes makes it possible to predict fuel consumption to set an appropriate budget for energy. The main purpose of this study was to determine the ability of the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the fuel consumption of tractor-chisel plow systems correctly. A training-set design of 139 points of 173 data points obtained from the literature was utilized, and the remaining 34 data points were applied as a test set. The input parameters were tractor power, plowing width, depth and speed of plowing, soil percentages of sand, silt, and clay, initial soil moisture content, and initial soil bulk density. The predictive power of the KNN method was compared with that of multiple linear regression (MLR), and experimental data were used to determine the predictive power of both methods. The KNN method generated better results than the multiple linear regression method. The test dataset correlation coefficients were 0.817 for the KNN (k = 2) method and 0.422 for the multiple linear regression method.

The spatial heterogeneity of crop condition (e.g., phenology and yields) at that scale could be substantial. Because the atmosphere-cropland exchanges of energy, water, and materials are sensitive to crop condition, this issue poses a question: How can we simulate the condition of a crop of interest on a GCM grid scale while taking into account the spatial heterogeneity of crop condition at a sub-grid scale? We therefore proposed an ensemble approach that uses stochastic parameter values to represent the spatial variation in the phenological and biophysical characteristics of a crop within a given GCM grid box, and tested its feasibility with simulation experiments. The combination of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) applied to maize in the Central Great Plains, United States, and coarse-resolution (2.5° × 2.5°) reanalysis data was taken as the example. The ensemble simulations successfully captured the spatial variation in the phenology and yield.

The Global Land Cover raster map (GLC2000) was used to select only the NDVI pixels that are related to agricultural land. Provincial wheat yields were assessed with errors varying from 80 to 762 kg ha-1, depending on the province. At national level, wheat yield was predicted at the third dekad of April with 73 kg ha-1 error, using NDVI and rainfall. However, earlier forecasts are possible, starting from the second dekad of March with 84 kg ha-1 error, at least 1 month before harvest. At the provincial and national levels, most of the yield variation was accounted for by NDVI.

With few tools available, the current study aimed to develop a yield estimation model based on remote sensing and climate data with a machine-learning approach. Using a satellite-based time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from Sentinel 2 images and climate data acquired by local automatic weather stations, a system for yield prediction based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network was implemented. The study was conducted in the Douro Demarcated Region in Portugal over the period 2016–2021 using yield data from 169 administrative areas that cover 250,000 ha, in which 43,000 ha of the vineyard are in production. The optimal combination of input features, with an Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 672.55 kg/ha and an Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 81.30 kg/ha, included the NDVI, Temperature, Relative Humidity, Precipitation, and Wind Intensity. The model was tested for each year, using it as the test set, while all other years were used as input to train the model. Two different moments in time, corresponding to FLO (flowering) and VER (veraison), were considered to estimate in advance wine grape yield. The best prediction was made for 2020 at VER, with the model overestimating the yield per hectare by 8 %, with the average absolute error for the entire period being 17 %. The results show that with this approach, it is possible to estimate wine grape yield accurately in advance at different scales. © 2022","Climate; Estimation; Machine learning; NDVI; Prediction; Remote sensing; Vineyard; Yield","climate effect; estimation method; growth response; machine learning; NDVI; prediction; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; vineyard; yield response; Douro Valley; Portugal",Article,Scopus

In order to further improve the accuracy of estimating winter wheat yield through remote sensing, this study analyzed the quantitative relationship between satellite remote sensing variables obtained from HJ-CCD images and the winter wheat yield, and used the partial least square (PLS) algorithm to construct and validate the multivariate remote sensing models of estimating the yield. The research showed a close relationship between yield and most remote sensing variables. Significant multiple correlations were also recorded between most remote sensing variables. The optimal principal components numbers of PLS models used to estimate yield were 4. Green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI) were sensitive variables for yield remote sensing estimation. Through model development and model validation evaluation, the yield estimation model’s coefficients of determination (R2) were 0.81 and 0.74 respectively. The root mean square error (RMSE) were 693.9 kg ha−1 and 786.5 kg ha−1. It showed that the PLS algorithm model estimates the yield better than the linear regression (LR) and principal components analysis (PCA) algorithms. The estimation accuracy was improved by more than 20% than the LR algorithm, and was 13% higher than the PCA algorithm. The results could provide an effective way to improve the estimation accuracy of winter wheat yield by remote sensing, and was conducive to large-area application and promotion. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"article; least square analysis; linear regression analysis; nonhuman; principal component analysis; quantitative analysis; remote sensing; senescence; soil; vegetation; winter wheat",Article,Scopus

Thus, determination of the relationship between them is crucial for food security and support importing-exporting strategies. The aim of this work was to analyze the aptitude of temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) to forecast maize yield. MODIS/AQUA enhanced vegetation index and land surface temperature (LST) at 1 km were used to calculate TVDI and maize yield over a large agricultural area of Argentine Pampas. The comparison between TVDI and official yield statistics was carried out to derive regression models in two agro-climatic zones, obtaining linear and quadratic adjustments. The models account for between 73% and 83% of yield variability, with the best prediction in the humid zone. The RMSE values ranged from 14% to 19% of average yield. The bias showed a slightly higher difference between predicted and observed yield data in semi-Arid zone. The models showed aptitude to estimate yield with reasonable accuracy 8-12 weeks before harvest. In addition, the TVDI-maize yield relationship and the impact of submonthly water stress were evaluated at field scale using yield measurements to ensure the analysis on maize. The highest \text{R}^{2} (0.61) was obtained using monthly values suggesting that the entire critical stage should be taken into account for yield forecasting. Although these results would not be directly extrapolated to other agricultural regions in the world, the proposed model is promising for forecasting spatial yield in other regions with poor data coverage several weeks before harvest. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Optical-Thermal; soil moisture; stress index; temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI)","Agriculture; Arid regions; Atmospheric temperature; Food supply; Regression analysis; Soil moisture; Vegetation; Agricultural areas; Enhanced vegetation index; Index measurements; Land surface temperature; Reasonable accuracy; Remotely sensed temperature; Soil moisture availability; Temperature-vegetation dryness indices; Forecasting; agricultural land; Aqua (satellite); crop yield; forecasting method; maize; MODIS; remote sensing; soil moisture; temperature profile; vegetation index; Argentina; Pampas; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Based on the results of YE, the farmers can make a better decision on the harvesting period, prevention strategies for crop disease, subsequent follow-up for cultivation practice, etc. In the current scenario, crop YE is performed manually, which has many limitations such as the requirement of experts for the bigger fields, subjective decisions and a more time-consuming process. To overcome these issues, an intelligent YE system was proposed which detects, localizes and counts the number of tomatoes in the field using SegNet with VGG19 (a deep learning-based semantic segmentation architecture). The dataset of 672 images was given as an input to the SegNet with VGG19 architecture for training. It extracts features corresponding to the tomato in each layer and detection was performed based on the feature score. The results were compared against the other semantic segmentation architectures such as U-Net and SegNet with VGG16. The proposed method performed better and unveiled reasonable results. For testing the trained model, a case study was conducted in the real tomato field at Manapparai village, Trichy, India.

Current robotic sampling methods seek to gather information about an observable spatial field. However, many applications, such as environmental monitoring and precision agriculture, involve phenomena that are not directly observable or are costly to measure, called latent phenomena. In our approach, we seek to reason about the latent phenomenon in real-time by effectively sampling the observable spatial fields using a team of robots with heterogeneous sensors, where each robot has a distinct sensor to measure a different observable field. The information gain is estimated using a learned model that maps from the observable spatial fields to the latent phenomenon. This model captures aleatoric uncertainty in the relationship to allow for information theoretic measures. Additionally, we explicitly consider the correlations among the observable spatial fields, capturing the relationship between sensor types whose observations are not independent. We show it is possible to learn these correlations, and investigate the impact of the learned correlation models on the performance of our sampling approach. Through our qualitative and quantitative results, we illustrate that empirically learned correlations improve the overall sampling efficiency of the team.

In this regard, we take maize as an example to collect a large amount of environmental climate and crop phenotypic traits data at multiple experimental sites and construct an extensive dataset.

A unique APSO (accelerated particle swarm optimization) based artificial neural network model (ANNM) for the relegation of benign and malignant tumours is presented in this study effort, which allows for the automated identification and categorization of brain tumours. Using APSO training to improve the suggested ANNM model parameters would give a unique method to alleviate the stressful work of radiologists performing manual identification of encephalon cancers from MR images.

In Africa, youth share is rising very slowly, but numbers are set to double in 40 years. Second, large majorities of rural youth live in spaces that are not inherently limiting: two-thirds live in zones with highest agricultural potential, and one-quarter combine this with highest commercialisation potential. The 4% that do live in inherently challenging spaces are concentrated in pockets of persistent poverty in middle-income countries. Third, rural spaces’ commercial potential has large impacts on welfare outcomes, but their agricultural potential has no detectable impact. Fourth, households with young members face income- and poverty ‘penalties’ in all regions and spaces within them, compared to households without young members.

On the basis of field survey data, the effect of weed infestation on winter wheat spectral reflectance at different stages of vegetation was analyzed using the example of individual fields in the Tula region with chernozems, grey forest, and alluvial arable soils. Under field conditions, crop weedness, spectral reflectance of crops, weeds, winter wheat leaves and soil determined using FieldSpec® HandHeld 2TM field spectro-radiometer (ASD, Inc., USA) was assessed several times during the growing season, and the crop canopy surface was photographed. The decoding of the photos showed that the projective weed coverage on the crop canopy surface is low enough at the beginning and middle of the wheat growing season, but increases significantly since the beginning of leaves yellowing. At the same time, the projective coverage of weeds in the field with chernozems was minimal at the beginning and middle of the growing season, and maximal - by the end of the growing season. Projective coverage of weeds on fields with grey forest and alluvial arable soils did not differ statistically, but on alluvial soils it increased significantly by the end of wheat vegetation. Using the spectral mixing model, the contribution of weeds infestation to the integral reflection of light by crops in the visible and near infrared bands of the electromagnetic waves was estimated. It has been found that despite the rather high weedness of winter wheat canopy in the spring-summer growing season, its projective coverage on the surface of the crop canopy is small. The magnitude of the projective cover of weeds on the surface of crop canopy weakly depends on soil conditions, and is more determined by other factors (history of fields use, crop rotation, etc.). The effect of weed vegetation on the spectral reflectivity of crop canopy changes over time. It is minimal at the peak of the growing season, accounting for several percent for all wavelengths of the visible and near IR range. At the beginning of the post-winter vegetation period, the contribution of weed vegetation to the spectral reflectance of crop canopy can reach 10-20%, and at the end of the vegetation season, weed vegetation can predetermine the spectral appearance of crops at most wavelengths of the considered range. The greatest contribution is observed in all cases in the near IR (710-730 nm) and in the green (520-560 nm) spectral region, but at certain times there are local maxima of the contribution and in the blue spectral region of electromagnetic waves (400-420 nm). The data obtained open up the possibility for the development of new vegetation indices for remote monitoring of crops, which will be less affected by weedness than those traditionally used (for example, NDVI). Conversely, on the basis of the data obtained, special vegetation indices can be proposed for the remote detection of the weedness of winter wheat canopy. © 2020 Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

The analysis was done using the Canadian Crop Yield Forecaster (CCYF), a tool for conducting crop yield outlooks within the growing season. We found that the GEPS data sets provided skillful forecasts of spring wheat and canola from selected Census of Agricultural Regions (CARs) in Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Aggregated results for the Prairie region showed that the GEPS data had a similar predictive skill as the statistically generated values of temperature and precipitation for spring wheat and showed improved prediction skill overall for canola from the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

This association knowledge is employed to improve predictions of sales using a spatial prediction technique, as shown with data collected from local markets of the Andean region of Ecuador. The commercial activity in these markets uses Alternative Marketing Circuits (CIALCO). This market platform establishes a direct relationship between producer and consumer prices and promotes direct commercial interaction among family groups. The problem is presented first as a general fusion problem with a network of spatially distributed heterogeneous data sources, and is then applied to the prediction of products sales based on association rules mined in available sales data.

In addition, the study was designed to also explore the potential of predicting the alfalfa yield using vegetation indices. A calibrated yield monitor mounted on a large rectangular hay baler was used to measure the actual alfalfa yield for four alfalfa harvests performed in the period from October 2013 to May 2014. A total of 18 Landsat-8 images, representing different crop growth stages, were used to derive different vegetation indices (VIs). Data from the yield monitor was used to generate yield maps, which illustrated a definite spatial variation in alfalfa yield across the experimental field for the four studied harvests as indicated by the high spatial correlation values (0.75 to 0.97) and the low P-values (4.7E-103 to 8.9E-27).

Effects of progress in agricultural management and breeding were subtracted from the data prior the machine learning modelling by fitting smooth non-linear trends to the 95th percentiles of observed yield data. An extensive feature selection approach was followed then to identify the most relevant predictors out of a large set of candidate predictors, comprising various soil and meteorological data.

We also tested the influence of adjusting the quantity of local fertilization and irrigation on crop production in Guizhou Province. Results showed that the total yield of the selected crops had, on average, reached over 72.5% of the theoretical maximum yield. Increasing irrigation tended to be more consistently effective at increasing crop yield than additional fertilization. Conversely, appropriate reduction of fertilization may even benefit crop yield in some regions, simultaneously resulting in significantly higher fertilization efficiency with lower residuals in the environment.

Thus, it is difficult for deep learning models to detect and distinguish every weed species with high accuracy. Training convolutional neural networks for detecting weeds susceptible to herbicides can offer a new strategy for implementing site-specific weed detection in turf. DenseNet, EfficientNet-v2, and ResNet showed high F1 scores (≥0.986) and MCC values (≥0.984) to detect and distinguish the sub-images containing dollarweed, goosegrass, old world diamond-flower, purple nutsedge, or Virginia buttonweed growing in bermudagrass turf. However, they failed to reliably detect crabgrass and tropical signalgrass due to the similarity in plant morphology. When training the convolutional neural networks for detecting and distinguishing the sub-images containing weeds susceptible to ACCase-inhibitors, weeds susceptible to ALS-inhibitors, or weeds susceptible to synthetic auxin herbicides, all neural networks evaluated in this study achieved excellent F1 scores (≥0.995) and MCC values (≥0.994) in the validation and testing datasets. ResNet demonstrated the fastest inference rate and outperformed the other convolutional neural networks on detection efficiency, while the slow inference of EfficientNet-v2 may limit its potential applications. Grouping different weed species growing in turf according to their susceptibility to herbicides and detecting and distinguishing weeds by herbicide categories enables the implementation of herbicide susceptibility-based precision herbicide application. We conclude that the proposed method is an effective strategy for site-specific weed detection in turf, which can be employed in a smart sprayer to achieve precision herbicide spraying.

Skilful yield forecasts at the beginning of, or before, a cropping season can provide farmers and other stakeholders in agribusiness with the necessary information for early planning and actions. Only a few yield forecast studies have a forecast lead time of four months or longer due to the problem complexity. To enable SCFs from Global Climate Models (GCMs) to be used for early-season yield forecasts, this paper uses a statistical downscaling technique, Extended Copula Post-Processing (ECPP) and the Schaake shuffle, to downscale four climate variables to generate weather-like daily data that are suitable for agricultural applications. Climate forecasts drive a process-based crop model APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) to simulate crop forecasts on 50 stations, well-distributed across the Australian grain zone. To focus on yield forecast skills attributable to SCF, we propose best practice management rules to predict water-limited winter wheat yield. Yield forecasts from ECPP have a significant improvement over quantile mapping downscaling and raw SCF from the Australian recent seasonal forecast model ACCESS-S1 in terms of bias, accuracy, reliability, and overall forecast skill. In addition, even at the beginning of a cropping season with a forecast lead time of four or more months, yield forecasts driven by ECPP illustrate higher skill than climatology, a benchmark for yield forecast. Early-season yield forecasts driven by SCFs provides a promising alternative to regression/machine-learning-based forecasts. Performance sensitivity and issues, and gaps on using skilful SCFs to help growers with their farming decision-making are discussed. © 2022","Crop model; Post-processing; Probabilistic yield forecasts; Seasonal climate forecasts; Wheat yield forecast","agroindustry; climate modeling; crop yield; cropping practice; downscaling; weather forecasting; wheat",Article,Scopus

However, the viability of using these datasets with machine learning to predict within-field cotton lint yield at key growth stages are largely unknown. This study was conducted on two cotton fields, located near Mungindi, New South Wales, Australia. Three years of yield data, soil, elevation, rainfall, and Landsat imagery were collected from each field. A total of 12 models were created using: (a) two machine learning algorithms: random forest (RF) and gradient boosting machines (GBM); (b) three growth stages: squaring, flowering, and boll-fill; and (c) two different amounts of variables: all variables and the optimal variables determined by a recursive feature elimination (RFE). Results showed a strong agreement between predicted and observed yields at flowering and boll-fill when more information was available. At flowering and boll-fill, root mean square error (RMSE) ranged between 0.15 and 0.20 t ha−1 and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC) ranged between 0.50 and 0.66, with RF providing superior results in most cases. Models created using the optimal variables determined by the RFE provided similar results compared to using all variables, allowing greater model accuracy and resolution with targeted sampling.

Yield prediction in the early growth stages significantly informs field management decisions for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A 10-year field experiment carried out in the Loess Plateau area tested how three tillage practices (deep ploughing (DP), subsoiling (SS), and no tillage (NT)) influenced cultivation and yield across different fallow periods. The experiment used the random forest (RF) algorithm to construct a prediction model of yields and yield components. Our results revealed that tillage during the fallow period was more effective than NT in improving yield in dryland wheat. Under drought condition, DP during the fallow period achieved a higher yield than SS, especially in drought years; DP was 16% higher than SS. RF was deemed fit for yield prediction across different precipitation years. An RF model was developed using meteorological factors for fixed variables and soil water storage after tillage during a fallow period for a control variable. Small error values existed in the prediction yield, spike number, and grains number per spike. Additionally, the relative error of crop yield under fallow tillage (5.24%) was smaller than that of NT (6.49%). The prediction error of relative meteorological yield was minimum and optimal, indicating that the model is suitable to explain the influence of meteorological factors on yield. © Copyright 2021 Feng et al.","Precipitation types; Random Forest; Tillage; Winter wheat; Yield prediction","calcium phosphate; nitrogen; nitrogen fertilizer; organic matter; phosphorus; phosphorus derivative; potassium sulfate; soil water; alkaline hydrolysis; Article; decision tree; evapotranspiration; fertilization; growth period; harvest; meteorological phenomena; plant yield; plowing; precipitation; random forest; spike; tillage; Triticum aestivum; wheat; winter wheat",Article,Scopus

With increasingly available topographical and soil information, there is a growing interest in developing variable rate planting strategies to exploit variation in the agri-landscape in order to maximize production. A random forest regression-based approach was developed to model the interactions between planting rate, hybrid/variety, topography, soil characteristics, weather variables, and their effects on yield by leveraging on-farm variable rate planting trials for corn and soybean conducted at 27 sites in New York between 2014 and 2018 (57 site-years) in collaboration with the New York Corn and Soybean Growers Association. Planting rate ranked highly in terms of random forest regression variable importance while explaining relatively minimal yield variation in the linear context, indicating that yield response to planting rate likely depends on complex interactions with agri-landscape features. Random forest models explained moderate levels of yield within site-years, while the ability to predict yield in untested site-years was low. Relatedly, variable importance measures for the predictors varied considerably across sites. Together, these results suggest that local testing may provide the most accurate optimized planting rate designs due to the unique set of conditions at each site. The proposed method was extended to identify the optimal variable rate planting design for maximizing yield at each site given the underlying conditions, and empirical validation of the resulting designs is currently underway. © 2020 The Authors.

A 22-ha study field in North Italy was monitored between 2016 and 2018; corn yield was measured and recorded by a grain yield monitor mounted on the harvester machine recording more than 20,000 georeferenced yield observation points from the study field for each season. VIs from a total of 34 Sentinel-2 images at different crop ages were analyzed for correlation with the measured yield observations. Multiple regression and two different machine learning approaches were also tested to model corn grain yield. The three main results were the following: (i) the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) provided the highest R2 value of 0.48 for monitoring within-field variability of corn grain yield; (ii) the most suitable period for corn yield monitoring was a crop age between 105 and 135 days from the planting date (R4-R6); (iii) Random Forests was the most accurate machine learning approach for predicting within-field variability of corn yield, with an R2 value of almost 0.6 over an independent validation set of half of the total observations. Based on the results, within-field variability of corn yield for previous seasons could be investigated from archived Sentinel-2 data with GNDVI at crop stage (R4-R6). © 2019 by the authors.","Corn yield; Digital farming; Machine learning; Precision agriculture; Sentinel-2; Vegetation indices; Within-field variability","Crops; Decision trees; Image enhancement; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Corn yields; Digital farming; Field variability; Sentinel-2; Vegetation index; Grain (agricultural product)",Article,Scopus

While phenomic research has drawn significant attention in the last decade, extracting meaningful and reliable numerical phenotypes from plant images especially by considering its individual components, e.g., leaves, stem, fruit, and flower, remains a critical bottleneck to the translation of advances of phenotyping technology into genetic insights due to various challenges including lighting variations, plant rotations, and self-occlusions.

However, data are lacking for this parameter in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This study produced the first spatially explicit, coherent and complete maps of the rootable depth and RZ-PAWHC of soil in SSA. We compiled geo-referenced data from 28,000 soil profiles from SSA, which were used as input for digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques to produce soil property maps of SSA. Based on these soil properties, we developed and parameterised (pedotransfer) functions, rules and criteria to evaluate soil water retention at field capacity and wilting point, the soil fine earth fraction from coarse fragments content and, for maize, the soil rootability (relative to threshold values) and rootable depth. Maps of these secondary soil properties were derived using the primary soil property maps as input for the evaluation rules and the results were aggregated over the rootable depth to obtain a map of RZ-PAWHC, with a spatial resolution of 1 km2. The mean RZ-PAWHC for SSA is 74 mm and the associated average root zone depth is 96 cm. Pearson correlation between the two is 0.95. RZ-PAWHC proves most limited by the rootable depth but is also highly sensitive to the definition of field capacity. The total soil volume of SSA potentially rootable by maize is reduced by one third (over 10,500 km3) due to soil conditions restricting root zone depth. Of these, 4800 km3 are due to limited depth of aeration, which is the factor most severely limiting in terms of extent (km2), and 2500 km3 due to sodicity which is most severely limiting in terms of degree (depth in cm). Depth of soil to bedrock reduces the rootable soil volume by 2500 km3, aluminium toxicity by 600 km3, porosity by 120 km3 and alkalinity by 20 km3. The accuracy of the map of rootable depth and thus of RZ-PAWHC could not be validated quantitatively due to absent data on rootability and rootable depth but is limited by the accuracy of the primary soil property maps. The methodological framework is robust and has been operationalised such that the maps can easily be updated as additional data become available. © 2018 The Authors","Digital soil map; Maize; Root zone depth; Rootability; Soil data; Soil water; Sub-Saharan Africa","Aluminum alloys; Correlation methods; Crops; Cultivation; Mapping; Seed; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Maize; Root zone; Rootability; Soil data; Soil maps; Soil water; Sub-saharan africa; Soils; agricultural management; crop production; crop yield; data set; digital map; fertilizer application; growth rate; maize; mapping method; pedotransfer function; plant water relations; rainfed agriculture; rhizosphere; soil property; Sub-Saharan Africa; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

However, these pesticides have an unforeseeable long-term impact on people's wellbeing as well as the ecosystem. Due to a shortage of basic pesticide exposure awareness, farmers typically utilize pesticides extremely close to harvesting. Pesticide residues within foods, particularly fruits as well as veggies, are a significant issue among farmers, merchants, and particularly consumers. The residual concentrations were far lower than these maximal allowable limits, with only a few surpassing the restrictions for such pesticides in food. There is an obligation to provide a warning about this amount of pesticide use in farming. Previous technologies failed to forecast the large number of pesticides that were dangerous to people, necessitating the development of improved detection and early warning systems. A novel methodology for verifying the status and evaluating the level of pesticides in regularly consumed veggies as well as fruits has been identified, named as the Hybrid Chronic Multi-Residual Framework (HCMF), in which the harmful level of used pesticide residues has been predicted for contamination in agro products using Q-Learning based Recurrent Neural Network and the predicted contamination levels have been analyzed using Complex Event Processing (CEP) by processing given spatial and sequential data. The analysis results are used to minimize and effectively use pesticides in the agricultural field and also ensure the safety of farmers and consumers. Overall, the technique is carried out in a Python environment, with the results showing that the proposed model has a 98.57% accuracy and a training loss of 0.30. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

Timely and accurate forecast of the price helps the farmers switch between the alternative nearby markets to sale their produce and getting good prices. The farmers can use the information to make choices around the timing of marketing. For forecasting price of agricultural commodities, several statistical models have been applied in past but those models have their own limitations in terms of assumptions. Methods In recent times, Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been much successful in modeling time series data. Though, numerous empirical studies have shown that ML approaches outperform time series models in forecasting time series, but their application in forecasting vegetables prices in India is scared. In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to explore efficient ML algorithms e.g. Generalized Neural Network (GRNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) for forecasting wholesale price of Brinjal in seventeen major markets of Odisha, India. Results An empirical comparison of the predictive accuracies of different models with that of the usual stochastic model i.e. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is carried out and it is observed that ML techniques particularly GRNN performs better in most of the cases. The superiority of the models is established by means of Model Confidence Set (MCS), and other accuracy measures such as Mean Error (ME), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Prediction Error (MAPE). To this end, Diebold-Mariano test is performed to test for the significant differences in predictive accuracy of different models. Conclusions Among the machine learning techniques, GRNN performs better in all the seventeen markets as compared to other techniques. RF performs at par with GRNN in four markets. The accuracies of other techniques such as SVR, GBM and ARIMA are not up to the mark. © 2022 Paul et al.

In this study we conducted a systematic literature review to shed light on the state-of-the-art knowledge about data-driven decision making in the pig sector. In order to cover both classical data analysis techniques and machine learning, we used two separate search strings to search the literature. The results show that the various attributes of live pigs and slaughter data are used in analytics. Most studies focus on the occurrence and prevention of diseases, followed by DNA-related analysis and the effect of feeding strategies on growth. Among the studies we analysed, there was a large variation in herd size under study. Most studies used a selected group of pigs in an experimental environment; fewer studies used a larger number of pigs. Notably, all studies except two focussed on real-life business contexts where real-time data is used. The application of machine learning, mainly the use of random forest and neural network algorithms, took off since 2018.

Protectiveness of data is natural in this setting: data is a precious commodity for data owners, which if used properly can provide them with useful insights on operations and processes leading to a competitive advantage. Unfortunately, novel AI technologies often require large amounts of training data in order to perform well, something that in many scenarios is unrealistic. However, recent machine learning advances, e.g. federated learning and privacy-preserving technologies, can offer a solution to this issue via providing the infrastructure and underpinning technologies needed to use data from various sources to train models without ever sharing the raw data themselves. In this paper, we propose a technical solution based on federated learning that uses decentralized data, (i.e. data that are not exchanged or shared but remain with the owners) to develop a cross-silo machine learning model that facilitates data sharing across supply chains. We focus our data sharing proposition on improving production optimization through soybean yield prediction, and provide potential use-cases that such methods can assist in other problem settings. Our results demonstrate that our approach not only performs better than each of the models trained on an individual data source, but also that data sharing in the agri-food sector can be enabled via alternatives to data exchange, whilst also helping to adopt emerging machine learning technologies to boost productivity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Agri-food; Data sharing; Federated learning; Machine learning","Competition; Electronic data interchange; Engineering education; Machine learning; Privacy-preserving techniques; Agri-food; AI Technologies; Competitive advantage; Data Sharing; Federated learning; Food sector; Large amounts; Privacy preserving; Train model; Training data; Supply chains; commodity; data set; machine learning; optimization; training",Article,Scopus

Geospatial data describing the energy system are required to manage generation intermittency, mitigate climate change risks, and identify trade-offs with biodiversity, conservation and land protection priorities caused by the land-use and land-cover change necessary for PV deployment. Currently available inventories of solar generating capacity cannot fully address these needs1–9.

Still, in many regions crop type mapping with satellite data remains constrained by a scarcity of field-level crop labels for training supervised classification models. When training data is not available in one region, classifiers trained in similar regions can be transferred, but shifts in the distribution of crop types as well as transformations of the features between regions lead to reduced classification accuracy. We present a methodology that uses aggregate-level crop statistics to correct the classifier by accounting for these two types of shifts. To adjust for shifts in the crop type composition we present a scheme for properly reweighting the posterior probabilities of each class that are output by the classifier. To adjust for shifts in features we propose a method to estimate and remove linear shifts in the mean feature vector. We demonstrate that this methodology leads to substantial improvements in overall classification accuracy when using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to map crop types in Occitanie, France and in Western Province, Kenya. When using LDA as our base classifier, we found that in France our methodology led to percent reductions in misclassifications ranging from 2.8% to 42.2% (mean = 21.9%) over eleven different training departments, and in Kenya the percent reductions in misclassification were 6.6%, 28.4%, and 42.7% for three training regions. While our methodology was statistically motivated by the LDA classifier, it can be applied to any type of classifier. As an example, we demonstrate its successful application to improve a Random Forest classifier. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Agriculture; Anticausal Learning; Classification; Crop mapping; Domain Shift; Machine Learning; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Transfer learning","Aggregates; Crops; Decision trees; Discriminant analysis; Mapping; Satellite imagery; Supervised learning; Anticausal learning; Crop mapping; Crop type mappings; Domain shift; Field level; Linear discriminant analysis; Machine-learning; Remote-sensing; Sentinel-2; Transfer learning; Remote sensing; crop plant; geostatistics; image classification; satellite data; satellite imagery; statistical analysis; supervised classification; France; Kenya; Occitanie; Western Province [Kenya]",Article,Scopus

In this paper, we present a framework where the individual smart farm owner's privacy is preserved, as it is shared to train robust anomaly detection models at the cooperative level. Here, we preserve the privacy of each farm owner by adding noise to their data through data perturbation techniques such as white Gaussian noise. Our experimental results show that the anomaly detection models can identify various anomalous events even when the training data is transformed with white noise.

The gathered data are forwarded and stored in a cloud-based server, which applies ML approaches to analyze data and suggest irrigation to the farmer.

However, detecting infestation with the RPW is highly challenging because symptoms are not visible until the death of the palm tree is inevitable. In addition, the use of automated RPW weevil identification tools to predict infestation is complicated by a lack of RPW datasets. In this study, we assessed the capability of 10 state-of-the-art data mining classification algorithms, Naive Bayes (NB), KSTAR, AdaBoost, bagging, PART, J48 Decision tree, multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and logistic regression, to use plant-size and temperature measurements collected from individual trees to predict RPW infestation in its early stages before significant damage is caused to the tree. The performance of the classification algorithms was evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure using a real RPW dataset. The experimental results showed that infestations with RPW can be predicted with an accuracy up to 93%, precision above 87%, recall equals 100%, and F-measure greater than 93% using data mining. Additionally, we found that temperature and circumference are the most important features for predicting RPW infestation.

In order to strengthen the economy and also to meet the food demand for the exponentially growing population, optimizing the agricultural practices has become necessity. In India, weather and geographical conditions are highly variable and were thought to be the major bottleneck of agricultural practices to achieve improved crop yield. Agricultural practices in India are facing many challenges such as change in climatic conditions, different geographical environment, conventional agricultural practices; economic and political scenario. Economic loss due to the lack of information on crop yield productivity is another major concern in the country. These hurdles can be overcome by the implementation of advanced technology in agriculture. Some of the trends observed are smart farming, digital agriculture and Big Data Analytics which provide useful information regarding various crop yields influencing factors and predicting the accurate amounts of crop yield. The exact prediction of crop yield helps formers to develop a suitable cultivation plan, crop health monitoring system, management of crop yield efficiently and also to establish the business strategy in order to decrease economic losses. This also makes the agricultural practices as one of the highly profitable ventures.

Although such raw images have less possibility to derive the insights, Serial Remote Sensing Images (SRSI) has the large potential to discover the patterns. The evolution of spatial patterns in various areas including urban development, expansion of vegetation cover and agriculture is the evidence for the utilization of SRSI accumulation. The application of conventional sequential pattern-mining algorithms on the SRSI images results in high computational complexity. This issue can be resolved by grouping the pixels and mining sequence patterns. A one-pass framework is introduced to compress and hide the data in the marked stream without any loss. In this paper, we proposed a Quantized ternary pattern based pixel grouping and Singular Value Decomposition—Run Length Coding based pattern mining.

To prevent a wildfire progression and minimize its impact, Fuel Management Zones (FMZs) have been stipulated, by law, around buildings, settlements, along national roads, and other infrastructures. FMZs require monitoring of the vegetation condition to promptly proceed with the maintenance and cleaning of these zones. To improve FMZ monitoring, this paper proposes the use of satellite images, such as the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, along with vegetation indices and extracted temporal characteristics (max, min, mean and standard deviation) associated with the vegetation within and outside the FMZs and to determine if they were treated. These characteristics feed machine-learning algorithms, such as XGBoost, Support Vector Machines, K-nearest neighbors and Random Forest.

An overestimation may thus incur further costs, whereas an underestimation entails potential crop waste. More interestingly, an accurate yield estimation enables stakeholders to better place themselves in the market. Yet, computer-aided precision farming is set to play a pivotal role in this respect. Kiwifruit represents a major produce in several countries (e.g., Italy, China, New and Zealand). However, up to date, the relevant literature remains short of a complete as well as automatic system for kiwifruit yield estimation. In this paper, we present a fully automatic and noninvasive computer vision system for kiwifruit yield estimation across a given orchard. It consists mainly of an optical sensor mounted on a minitractor that surveys the orchard of interest at a low pace. Afterwards, the acquired images are fed to a pipeline that incorporates image preprocessing, stitching, and fruit counting stages and outputs an estimated fruit count and yield estimation. Experimental results conducted on two large kiwifruit orchards confirm a high plausibility (i.e., errors of 6% and 15%) of the proposed system. The proposed yield estimation solution has been in commercial use for about 2 years. With respect to the traditional manual yield estimation carried out by kiwifruit companies, it was demonstrated to save a significant amount of time and cut down on estimation errors, especially when speaking of large-scale farming. © 2020 by the authors.

Mature tomato detection has been wildly studied, while immature tomato detection, especially when occluded with leaves, is difficult to perform using traditional image analysis, which is more important for long-term yield prediction. Therefore, tomato detection that can generalize well in real tomato cultivation scenes and is robust to issues such as fruit occlusion and variable lighting conditions is highly desired. In this study, we build a tomato detection model to automatically detect intact green tomatoes regardless of occlusions or fruit growth stage using deep learning approaches. The tomato detection model used faster region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) with Resnet-101 and transfer learned from the Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset. The detection on test dataset achieved high average precision of 87.83% (intersection over union ≥ 0.5) and showed a high accuracy of tomato counting (R2 = 0.87). In addition, all the detected boxes were merged into one image to compile the tomato location map and estimate their size along one row in the greenhouse. By tomato detection, counting, location and size estimation, this method shows great potential for ripeness and yield prediction. © 2020 by the authors.

Forecasting yields of bioenergy crops at fine spatial resolutions can help to evaluate near-term and long-term pathways for scaling up bio-based fuel and chemical production, and for understanding the impacts of abiotic stressors such as severe droughts and temperature extremes on potential biomass supply. We used a large dataset of 28,364 Sorghum bicolor yield samples (uniquely identified by county and year of observation), environmental variables, and multiple approaches to analyze historical trends in sorghum productivity across the USA. We selected the most accurate machine learning approach (a variation of the random forest approach) to predict future trends in sorghum yields under four greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios and two irrigation regimes. We identified irrigation practices, vapor pressure deficit, and time (a proxy for technological improvement) as the most important predictors of sorghum productivity. Our results showed a decreasing trend of sorghum yields over future years (on average 2.7% from 2018 to 2099), with greater decline under a high GHG emissions scenario (3.8%) and in the absence of irrigation (4.6%). Geographically, we observed the steepest predicted declines in the Great Lakes (8.2%), Upper Midwest (7.5%), and Heartland (6.7%) regions. Our study demonstrates the use of machine learning to identify environmental controllers of sorghum biomass yield and predict yields with reasonable accuracy.

In today's world condition, the existence of humans is not possible without the essential proliferation of plants. In the photosynthesis procedure, plants use solar energy to convert into chemical energy. This process is responsible for all life on earth, and the main controlling factor for proper plant growth is soil since it holds water, air, and all essential nutrients of plant nourishment. Though, due to overexposure, soil gets despoiled, so fertilizer is an essential component to hold the soil quality. In that regard, soil analysis is a suitable method to determine soil quality. Soil analysis examines the soil in laboratories and generates reports of unorganized and insignificant data. In this study, different big data analysis machine learning methods are used to extracting knowledge from data to find out fertilizer recommendation classes on behalf of present soil nutrition composition. For this experiment, soil analysis reports are collected from the Tata soil and water testing center. In this paper, Mahoot library is used for analysis of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), artificial neural network (ANN) performance on Hadoop environment. For better performance evaluation, we also used single machine experiments for random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbors K-NN, regression tree (RT), support vector machine (SVM) using polynomial function, SVM using radial basis function (RBF) methods. Detailed experimental analysis was carried out using overall accuracy, AUC-ROC (receiver operating characteristics (ROC), and area under the ROC curve (AUC)) curve, mean absolute prediction error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) validation measurements on soil reports dataset. The results provide a comparison of solution classes and conclude that the SGD outperforms other approaches. Finally, the proposed results support to select the solution or recommend a class which suggests suitable fertilizer to crops for maximum production. © 2019 by the authors.","Agriculture industry; Artificial neural network (ANN); Big data analytics; Fertilizer recommendations; Hadoop framework; K-NN; Random forest (RF); Regression tree (RT); Stochastic gradient descent (SGD); Sustainability-oriented performance; SVM","agricultural technology; agroindustry; algorithm; alternative agriculture; artificial neural network; comparative study; conceptual framework; data management; fertilizer application",Article,Scopus

Firstly, the capability of the SVM to predict annual electricity consumption was investigated at both a farm and catchment-level (combined consumption). Electricity consumption data were attained from 16 pasture-based, Irish dairy farms between June 2016 and May 2017 in conjunction with farm data related to herd size, milk production, infrastructural equipment and managerial tendencies, required to generate predictions using the SVM. The SVM predicted annual electricity consumption of dairy farms to within 10.4% (relative prediction error). Concurrently, catchment-level electricity consumption was predicted with an error value less than 5.0%. Secondly, an investigation was carried out to assess the impact of increasing herd size and milk production on dairy farm related electricity consumption at a catchment-level across ten hypothetical infrastructural scenarios. The dairy expansion analysis showed electricity economies of scale across all ten infrastructural scenarios. The greatest reduction in electricity consumption per litre was observed when all farms employed ground water for pre-cooling milk with two additional parlour units, reducing by 4% in 2018, relative to a base scenario (no change to infrastructural equipment). The results presented in this article demonstrate the potential effectiveness of the SVM as a macro-level simulation forecast tool for dairy farm electricity consumption that may be used to quantify the impact of milk production on electricity resources, or to offer decision support to dairy farmers. © 2019","Dairy expansion; Energy; Machine-learning; Milk production; Sustainability; SVM","Catchments; Dairies; Decision support systems; Economics; Electric power utilization; Expansion; Forecasting; Groundwater; Learning systems; Runoff; Support vector machines; Sustainable development; Annual electricity consumption; Decision supports; Economies of scale; Electricity resources; Electricity-consumption; Energy; Milk production; Prediction errors; Farms; dairy farming; electricity; energy use; future prospect; milk production; scenario analysis; support vector machine; sustainability; Ireland",Article,Scopus

Nutrient deficiency is the cause of serious diseases in plant growth, affecting crop yield. In this article, we employed artificial neural network models to recognize, classify, and predict the nutritional deficiencies occurring in tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.). To classify and predict the different macronutrient deficiencies in the cropping process, this paper handles the captured images of the macronutrient deficiency. This deficiency during the fruiting and leafing phases of tomato plant are based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). A total of 571 images were captured with tomato leaves and fruits containing the crop species at the growth stage. Among all images, 80% (461 captured images) were used for the training dataset and 20% (110 captured images) were applied for the validation dataset. In this study, we provide an analysis of two different model architectures based on convolutional neural network for classifying and predicting the nutrient deficiency symptoms. For instance, Inception-ResNet v2 and Autoencoder with the captured images of tomato plant growth under the greenhouse conditions. Moreover, a major type of statistical structure, namely Ensemble Averaging, was applied with two aforementioned predictive models to increase the accuracy of predictive validation. Three mineral nutrients, i.e., Calcium/Ca2+, Potassium/K+, and Nitrogen/N, are considered for use in evaluating the nutrient status in the development of tomato plant with these models. The aim of this study is to predict the nutrient deficiency accurately in order to increase crop production and prevent the emergence of tomato pathology caused by lack of nutrients. The predictive performance of the three models in this paper are validated, with the accuracy rates of 87.273% and 79.091% for Inception-ResNet v2 and Autoencoder, respectively, and with 91% validity using Ensemble Averaging. © 2019 by the authors.","Autoencoder; Classification; Deep learning; Ensemble averaging; Inception-ResNet v2; Nutrient deficiency; Prediction; Tomato plant",,Article,Scopus

However, the productivity of many agroforestry systems has been lower than expected in recent years, highlighting the need for an actionably deep mechanistic understanding of the competition between crops and trees. Here, three different fruit tree/ wheat (jujube/wheat, apricot /wheat, and walnut /wheat) intercropping agroforestry systems were chosen to investigate influence of different fruit tree shade intensity on the growth, yield and quality of intercropping wheat. Compared to the monoculture wheat system, the mean daily shade intensity of the jujube-, apricot-, and walnut-based intercropping systems were, respectively, 23.2%, 57.5%, and 80.7% shade. The photosynthetic rate of wheat in the jujube-, apricot-, and walnut-based intercropping systems decreased by, respectively, 11.3%, 31.9%, and 36.2% compared to monoculture wheat, and the mean number of fertile florets per spike decreased by 26.4%, 37.4%, and 49.5%. Moreover, the apricot- and walnut-based intercropping systems deleteriously affected grain yield (constituent components spike number, grains per spike, and thousand grain weight) and decreased the total N, P, and K content of intercropping wheat. Tree shading intensity strongly enhanced the grain protein content, wet gluten content, dough development time, and dough stability time of wheat, but significantly decreased the softening degree. Strong negative linear correlations were observed between tree shade intensity and the number of fertile florets, grain yield related traits (including spike number, grains per spike, and thousand grain weight), nutrient content (N, P and K), and softening degree of wheat. In contrast, Daily shade intensity was positively linearly correlated with grain protein content, wet gluten content, dough development time, and dough stability time. We conclude that jujube-based intercropping systems can be practical in the region, as they do not decrease the yield and quality of intercropping wheat. © 2019 Qiao et al.

Inherently, these are difficult to translate into information useful for decision support in agriculture. For example, probabilistic SCF must first be downscaled to daily weather realizations to link with process-based crop models, a tedious process, especially for non-technical users. Here, we present two approaches for downscaling probabilistic seasonal climate forecasts – a parametric method, predictWTD, and a non-parametric method, FResampler1, and compare their performance. The predictWTD, which is based on a conditional stochastic weather generator, was found to be not very sensitive to types of rainfall information (amount, frequency or intensity) in constraining or conditioning the stochastic weather generator, but conditioning the stochastic weather generator on both rainfall frequency and rainfall intensity had distorted the distribution of the downscaled seasonal rainfall total. Both predictWTD and FResampler1 are sensitive to the length of climate data, especially for a wet SCF; climate data longer than 30 years was found suitable for reproducing the theoretical distribution of SCF. FResampler1 performed well as predictWTD in downscaling probabilistic SCF, however, it requires the generation of more realizations to ensure stable simulations of the seasonal rainfall total distributions. © 2017 The Authors","Non-parametric downscaling; Parametric downscaling; Probabilistic seasonal climate forecast; Stochastic disaggregation",,Article,Scopus

This is a significant advancement over typical quantile-matching alternatives available for bias correction, as they implicitly assume that correction of individual variable attributes will lead to correction of dependence biases between multiple variables. Furthermore, existing approaches perform bias correction at a given time scale (e.g., daily), whereas applications often require biases to be addressed at more than one time scale (such as annual in the case of most water resources planning projects). The proposed approach addresses all these issues, and additionally attempts to correct for lag-1 dependence (and cross-dependence) attributes across multiple time scales. The approach is called multivariate recursive quantile nesting bias correction (MRQNBC). The fidelity of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a vector of CSIRO Mk3 GCM atmospheric variables and comparing the results with the commonly used quantile-matching approach. Following this, the implications of the approach in hydrology- and water resources–related applications are demonstrated by feeding the bias-corrected data to a rainfall downscaling model and comparing the downscaled rainfall attributes for current and future climate. The proposed approach is shown to represent the variability and persistence related attributes better and can thus be expected to have important consequences for the simulation of occurrence and intensity of extreme events such as floods and droughts in downscaled simulations, of importance in various climate impact assessment applications. © 2016 American Meteorological Society",,"Climate models; Rain; Time measurement; Atmospheric variables; Climate impact assessment; General circulation model; Hydrology and water resource; Multiple time scale; Rainfall downscaling; Systematic bias; Water resources planning; Water resources; atmospheric general circulation model; correction; downscaling; multivariate analysis; rainfall; vector",Article,Scopus

We attempted to assess the APEC Climate Center Multimodel Ensemble (APCC MME) seasonal hindcasts to a satellite-based rice yield prediction model to timely provide estimates of rice yields for efficacious intervention plans. The developed model by a multiple regression analysis is Yield = 5.635NDVI – 0.0012P9+ 0.91 (where yield is the white rice yield in t ha-1and P9 is the observed monthly precipitation in September in mm month-1). The goodness-of-fit measures were 0.66, -0.14%, 0.13 t ha-1, and 2.25%, for adjusted R2(coefficient of determination), Percent bias (PBIAS), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute percentage Error (MAPE), respectively. A statistical downscaling method using Empirical Orthogonal Function Analysis (EOFA) and Singular Value Decomposition Analysis (SDVA) was used to predict monthly precipitation hindcasts in September required for the developed model. Even though the estimates of rice yield using the predicted monthly precipitation for whole study period were not as good as the estimates using the 9.15 sampling method, the estimates for the two years of 2008 and 2009, when the 9.15 sampling method largely underestimated, were better than those using the 9.15 sampling method.

The purpose of this article is to construct a cheaper computational model (emulator) from simulations of the Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land (LPJmL), which is a dynamic global vegetation and crop model. This article focuses on statistical emulation of potential crop yields from LPJmL and an emulator is constructed using a combination of ordinary least squares, principal component analysis and weighted least squares methods. For five climate models, under cross-validation, the percentage of variance explained ranges from 60 to 88% for the rainfed crops and 62 to 93% for the irrigated crops.

Thus, drainage design simulation models provide for a simplistic and cost-effective method of determining the most appropriate subsurface drainage design parameters. In this study, the performance of the DRAINMOD model (Version 6.1) in predicting WTDs and DDs was investigated for a 32 ha sugarcane field in Pongola, South Africa. Water table depths were monitored in 1.7 m deep piezometers installed mid-way between two drains by using an electronic dip meter with a beeper, while DDs were measured at drain lateral outlet points, using a bucket and a stop watch. Both WTDs and DDs were monitored from September 2011 to February 2012. Results of the DRAINMOD model evaluation in predicting WTD, during calibration period, showed that there was a very strong agreement between simulated and observed WTDs with a goodness-of-fit (R2) of 0.826 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3 cm. Similarly, simulated and observed DDs during the model validation period also showed very strong agreement, with an R2 value of 0.801 and an MAE of 0.2 mm∙day-1. Results of simulated WTDs at various combinations of drain depth and spacing indicated that in clay soil a WTD of 1.0 to 1.5 m from the soil surface can be achieved by installing drain pipes at drain spacing ranging from 25 to 40 m and drain depth between 1.4 and 1.8 m. On the other hand, in clay-loam soil, the same 1.0 to 1.5 m WTD can be achieved when the drain pipes are installed at drain depths ranging from 1.4 to 1.8 m and corresponding drain spacing ranging from 55 to 70 m. Based on these results, it was concluded that DRAINMOD 6.1 can reliably be used as a subsurface drainage design tool in the Pongola region. This would simplify the design of subsurface drainage systems and the formulation of subsurface drainage design criteria for different crops and soil types found in the area and possibly throughout South Africa. © 2015, South African Water Research Commission.

It aims to improve the productivity of poorly drained agricultural fields. Nevertheless, studies have also shown that subsurface drainage is a significant pollution pathway to surface water. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of tile drain spacing on surface runoff, subsurface drainage flows, and phosphorus (P) loss from two tile-drained agricultural fields located near Bedford, Québec. Field data were used with the DRAINMOD model, and in developed regression models in order to perform the analysis. Both DRAINMOD and the regression models showed good performance. Simulation results indicated that when lateral tile drain spacing is increased, the volume of subsurface drain flow decreases, and the volume of surface runoff increases, at sites with sandy and clay loam soils. For every 5 m increase in drain spacing, total phosphorus (TP) loads in subsurface drainage decreased by 6% at a site with sandy loam soil, and increased by 20% at a site with clay loam soil.

It has been a great challenge to non-destructively estimate plant N status across different agro-ecological zones (AZs). The objective of this study was to use random forest regression (RFR) models together with multi-source data to improve the estimation of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) N status across two AZs. Fifteen site-year plot and farmers' field experiments involving different N rates and 19 cultivars were conducted in two AZs from 2015 to 2020. The results indicated that RFR models integrating climatic and management factors with vegetation index (R2 = 0.72–0.86) outperformed the models by only using the vegetation index (R2 = 0.36–0.68) and performed well across AZs. The Pearson correlation coefficient-based variables selection strategy worked well to select 6–7 key variables for developing RFR models that could achieve similar performance as models using full variables. The contributions of climatic and management factors to N status estimation varied with AZs and N status indicators. In higher-latitude areas, climatic factors were more important to N status estimation, especially water-related factors. The addition of climatic factors significantly improved the performance of the RFR models for N nutrition index estimation. Climatic factors were important for the estimation of the aboveground biomass, while management variables were more important to N status estimation in lower-latitude areas. It is concluded that integrating multi-source data using RFR models can significantly improve the estimation of winter wheat N status indicators across AZs compared to models only using one vegetation index. However, more studies are needed to develop unmanned aerial vehicles and satellite remote sensing-based machine learning models incorporating multi-source data for more efficient monitoring of crop N status under more diverse soil, climatic, and management conditions across large regions.

In this regard, detection of diseases at an early stage and quantification of the severity has acquired the urgent attention of researchers worldwide. One emerging and popular approach for this task is the utilization of machine learning techniques. In this work, we have identified the most common and damaging diseases affecting cereal crop production, and we also reviewed 45 works performed on the detection and classification of various diseases that occur on six cereal crops within the past five years. In addition, we identified and summarised numerous publicly available datasets for each cereal crop, which the lack thereof we identified as the main challenges faced for researching the application of machine learning in cereal crop detection.

Hence, the estimation of within-field variability of GY is pivotal for the agricultural management, especially in the current global change context. In this sense, Earth Observation Systems (EOS) are key technologies that use satellite data to monitor crop yield, which can guide the application of precision farming. Yet, novel research is required to improve the multiplatform integration of data, including data processing, and the application of this discipline in agricultural management. This article provides a novel methodological analysis and assessment of its applications in precision farming. It presents an integration of wheat GY, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), combine harvester data, and EOS Sentinel-2 multispectral bands. Moreover, it compares several indices and machine learning (ML) approaches to map within-field wheat GY. It also analyses the importance of multi-date remote sensing imagery and explores its potential applications in precision agriculture. The study was conducted in Spain, a major European wheat producer. Within-field GY data was obtained from a GPS combine harvester machine for 8 fields over three seasons (2017–2019) and consecutively processed to match Sentinel-2 10 m pixel size. Seven vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, EVI, RVI, TGI, CVI and NGRDI) as well as the biophysical parameter LAI (leaf area index) retrieved with radiative transfer models (RTM) were calculated from Sentinel-2 bands. Sentinel-2 10 m resolution bands alone were also used as variables. Random forest, support vector machine and boosted regressions were used as modelling approaches, and multilinear regression was calculated as baseline. Different combinations of dates of measurement were tested to find the most suitable model feeding data. LAI retrieved from RTM had a slightly improved performance in estimating within-field GY in comparison with vegetation indices or Sentinel-2 bands alone. At validation, the use of multi-date Sentinel-2 data was found to be the most suitable in comparison with single date images. Thus, the model developed with random forest regression (e.g. R2 = 0.89, and RSME = 0.74 t/ha when using LAI) outperformed support vector machine (R2 = 0.84 and RSME = 0.92 t/ha), boosting regression (R2 = 0.85 and RSME = 0.88 t/ha) and multilinear regression (R2 = 0.69 and RSME = 1.29 t/ha). However, single date images at specific phenological stages (e.g. R2 = 0.84, and RSME = 0.88 t/ha using random forest at stem elongation) also posed relatively high R2 and low RMSE, with potential for precision farming management before harvest. © 2022 The Author(s)","Grain yield; Machine learning; Precision farming; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Wheat","agricultural production; crop production; crop yield; estimation method; precision agriculture; remote sensing; Sentinel; wheat",Article,Scopus

Here we aim to develop a robust methodology for estimation/prediction of sunflower yield at pilot field scale using Sentinel-2 remote sensing satellite imagery. We conducted the study in Mezőhegyes, south-eastern Hungary. The Random Forest Regression (RFR), a machine learning technique was used in this research to translate the Sentinel-2 spectral bands to sunflower yield based on crop yield data provided by a combine harvester equipped with a yield-monitoring system. Sentinel-2 images obtained from April to September were used to find the best image for prediction. The satellite image acquired on June 28 was found best and considered further for prediction sunflower yield. A developed training model was tested and validated in 10 different parcels to evaluate the performance of the prediction. We examined the results of the prediction model (predicted) against the actual yield data (observed) collected by a combine harvester. The results demonstrated that using 10 spectral bands from Sentinel-2 imagery the best time to predict sunflower yields was between 85 and 105 d into the growing season during the flowering stage. This model achieved high accuracy with low normalized root means square error (RMSE) ranging from 121.9 to 284.5 kg/ha for different test fields.

Tree response to combined water and salt stress are critical consideration on management decisions but there is no appropriate information currently. That’s why, it was investigated the water and salt stress and combined water-salt stress on two almond varieties in a two year (2015 and 2016) outdoor experiment with young trees. Trees were 1 year old at the beginning of the experiment. The experiment was conducted USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) Salinity Laboratory, Riverside, California, USA. Drought treatments consisted of 100%, 80% and 60% of tree evapotranspiration (ET) and salt treatments of Electrical Conductivity (EC= 0.55, 1.20, 2.40 and 3.0 dS m-1), for a total of 120 trees in twelve treatments with two varieties and five replicates. We examined water use, trunk diameter and physiological parameters (leaf net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and leaf water potential). Photosynthetic rate values (Pn) ranged between 3.53 and 11.08 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1 for Nonpareil and 4.58 and 9.48 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1 for Aldridge. Stomatal conductance values ranged between 0.076 and 0.283 mol H2O m-2 s-1 for Nonpareil and 0.097 and 0.302 for Aldridge. All parameters showed significant decline starting at 80% water application and EC 1.2 dS m-1. In terms of growth rather than survival, almond was sensitive to water as well as salt stress. We evaluated combined stress using three stress response models: additive stress, dominant stress model and a multiplicative stress model where the predicted growth loss is obtained by multiplying the relative growth response for the individual stresses. Equation (2) for reduction in trunk growth were developed for treatments with either salinity only or water only stress. Both varieties grafted to Nemaguard rootstock were very sensitive to salinity with growth loss starting at EC 1.2 dS m-1. The results indicate that the Nonpareil is more sensitive to drought and salt stress than Aldridge. Aldridge almond variety can be recommended for areas where water supplies are scarce and salinized. © 2023, Ankara University.

We collected the multi-model ensemble (MME) tercile hindcasts of 3-month (September to November, SON) and 5-month (July to November, JASON) rainfall for 1991–2010 from the international collaborative archive of the APEC Climate Center (APCC). The monthly probabilistic hindcasts were temporally downscaled by a stochastic weather generator to daily meteorological inputs for the CERES-Rice crop model. Then, the lowland rainfed rice yields at the field scale were simulated by the process-based crop model with different nitrogen (N) fertilizing strategies, and compared the outcomes against the observed rice yields. The results showed that the simulated rice yields from the 3-month hindcasts with the N-fertilizer application rate of level 1 (60 kg ha-1) were closer to the observed than those from the 5-month hindcasts. About 3.05Mg ha-1 of rice yields were estimated under the 3-month seasonal forecasts in 2020 with the N-fertilizer application rate. We found that additional 40 kg ha-1 of N-fertilizer rate may be required to achieve the national target rice yield (5.0Mg ha-1) under climatic uncertainty conditioned by the seasonal forecasts.

In this work, a study is presented of semantic segmentation for vine detection in real-world vineyards by exploring state-of-the-art deep segmentation networks and conventional unsupervised methods. Camera data have been collected on vineyards using an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) equipped with a dual imaging sensor payload, namely a high-definition RGB camera and a five-band multispectral and thermal camera. Extensive experiments using deep-segmentation networks and unsupervised methods have been performed on multimodal datasets representing four distinct vineyards located in the central region of Portugal. The reported results indicate that SegNet, U-Net, and ModSegNet have equivalent overall performance in vine segmentation. The results also show that multimodality slightly improves the performance of vine segmentation, but the NIR spectrum alone generally is sufficient on most of the datasets. Furthermore, results suggest that high-definition RGB images produce equivalent or higher performance than any lower resolution multispectral band combination.

Or else, traditional sequential pattern-mining algorithms cannot be applied efficiently or directly to remote sensing images. Here a new technique is proposed for enhancing the mining efficacy of spatial sequential patterns from raster serial remote sensing images (SRSI) based on pixel grouping approach. The modified extrema pattern is employed to offering grey-scale invariant transform of intensity values unlike previously employed local ternary pattern. The pattern features are computed by transformation process from which the multilinear matrix decomposition of the image is made by computing the covariance estimation on recognizing their orthogonal component. The matrix decomposition is then attained based on run length encoding process (RLC). The two rows of RLC vectors are intersected to attain pixel groupmatrix. Finally, the compressed image is attained in an efficient manner with effective mining time. The performance outcome reveals that the technique offered in this paper is capable of extracting spatial sequential patterns from SRSI effectively.

However, the development of high-rate feedback systems is a complex task because these dynamic systems are uniquely characterized by (1) large uncertainties in their external loads, (2) high levels of non-stationarity and heavy disturbance, and (3) unmodeled dynamics from changes in system configuration. In this paper, we present a deep learning algorithm specifically engineered for HRSHM applications. It consists of an ensemble of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) constructed with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells with transfer learning capabilities to cope with the highly limited availability of training data as it is typical for high-rate systems. The use of an ensemble of RNNs empowers multi-rate sampling capability to capture multi-temporal features of the time series, thus enabling modeling of non-stationarities. Also, because the RNNs use short-sequence LSTMs and are arranged in parallel, the computation time is substantially reduced to the sub-millisecond range. The performance of the algorithm is investigated on experimental high-rate dynamic data produced from accelerated drop tower tests and benchmarked against results from a prior investigation using a purely on-the-edge algorithm termed variable input space observer (VIO) and its hybrid architecture (hybrid VIO) that incorporated physical knowledge and is considered as an upper bound on the algorithm performance. Numerical results show that the ensemble of RNNs, composed of five RNNs, significantly outperformed the VIO, with performance close to that of the hybrid VIO when it comes to the estimation error metrics, with an average computation time of 25μs per prediction step. Yet, the ensemble of RNNs exhibits chattering for low-amplitude excitations, likely attributable to the behavior of RNNs sampling at small time delays. An examination of the RNN weights and hidden states confirms that the algorithm can capture multi-temporal features, and an investigation with respect to noise in the training dataset showed that the algorithm is robust for signal-to-noise ratios up to 20 dB. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; High-rate systems; Long short-term memory; Nonlinear time series; Recurrent neural network; Structural health monitoring; Transfer learning","Brain; Deep neural networks; Hypersonic vehicles; Learning algorithms; Signal to noise ratio; Structural health monitoring; Deep learning; Health monitoring; High rate; High-rate systems; Input space; Neural-networks; Nonlinear time series; Short term memory; Structural health; Transfer learning; Long short-term memory",Article,Scopus

Studies conducted in this area are not at the level that is desirable due to the diversity of plant species and the regional characteristics of many of these species. Although numerous researchers have studied diseases on plant leaves, it is undeniable that timely diagnosis of diseases on olive leaves remains a difficult task. It is estimated that people have been cultivating olive trees for 6000 years, making it one of the most useful and profitable fruit trees in history. Symptoms that appear on infected leaves can vary from one plant to another or even between individual leaves on the same plant. Because olive groves are susceptible to a variety of pathogens, including bacterial blight, olive knot, Aculus olearius, and olive peacock spot, it has been difficult to develop an effective olive disease detection algorithm. For this reason, we developed a unique deep ensemble learning strategy that combines the convolutional neural network model with vision transformer model. The goal of this method is to detect and classify diseases that can affect olive leaves. In addition, binary and multiclassification systems based on deep convolutional models were used to categorize olive leaf disease. The results are encouraging and show how effectively CNN and vision transformer models can be used together.

In this study, agronomic trait data of rice and climate data in eastern China were collected, and rice yields were predicted using a variety of algorithms, including the non-linear tool of feed-forward backpropagation neural networks (FFBN) and the linear model of partial least squares regression (PLSR). The results showed that both the agronomic traits and the climate data were significantly related with rice yield. The PLSR model showed that covariates occurred among the parameters, and modifications should be considered for climate data-based modelling. The FFBN model demonstrated better prediction performance than that of PLSR, in which the relation coefficient (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) were 0.611 vs. 0.374 and 0.578 vs. 0.865 ton/ha using climate data, respectively; and 0.742 vs. 0.689 and 0.556 vs. 0.608 using agronomic trait data, respectively.

Based on the wavelet transform, a combined prediction approach for crop water requirement is proposed. Firstly, the Mallat wavelet transform algorithm is used to decompose and reconstruct the crop water requirement series. The approximate and detail components of the original series can be obtained. The characteristics of approximate components and detail components are analyzed by Hurst index. Then, according to the different characteristics of the components, the particle swarm optimization algorithm optimized support vector machine is used to predict the approximate component, and the autoregressive moving average model is used to predict the detail components. Three-fold cross-validation is used to improve the generalization ability of the forecasting model. Finally, combined with the prediction value of each prediction model, the final prediction value of crop water requirement is obtained. The crop water requirement data from 1983 to 2018 in Liaoning Province of China are collected as the research object. The simulation results indicate that the proposed combined prediction approach has high prediction accuracy for crop water requirement. The comparison of performance indicators shows that the root mean square error of the proposed prediction approach reduced by 45.40% to 57.16%, mean absolute error reduced by 32.96% to 52.07%, mean absolute percentile error reduced by 33.02% to 52.37%, relative root mean square error reduced by 45.26% to 57.38%, square sum error reduced by 70.18% to 80.42%, and the Theil inequality coefficient reduced by 59.02% to 80.77%. R square increased by 16.46% to 54.77%, and the index of agreement increased by 3.82% to 23.37%. The results of Pearson's test and the DM test show that the association strength between the actual value and the prediction value of the crop water requirement is stronger. Moreover, the proposed prediction approach in this paper has higher reliability under the same confidence level. The effectiveness of the proposed prediction approach for crop water requirement is verified. The proposed prediction approach has great significance for the rational use of water resources, planning and management, promoting social and economic sustainable development. © IWA Publishing 2020.","autoregressive moving average; combined prediction; crop water requirement; particle swarm optimization; support vector machine; wavelet transform","Agricultural robots; Crops; Errors; Mean square error; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machines; Water resources; Wavelet transforms; Comparison of performance; Crop water requirements; Economic sustainable development; Generalization ability; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Root mean square errors; Three fold cross validation; Wavelet transform algorithms; Forecasting; ground water; surface water; algorithm; model validation; sustainable development; water management; water mass; water resource; water use; wavelet; wavelet analysis; Article; artificial neural network; back propagation neural network; convolutional neural network; crop; crop water consumption; cross validation; particle swarm optimization; radial basis function; simulation; support vector machine; time series analysis; water management; water supply; wavelet transform; China; Liaoning",Article,Scopus

For training and testing of intelligence models meteorological data such as air temperature, relative moisture, wind speed, sunshine hours with a ten-year statistical period during 2007-2017 related to the meteorological station of Van in Turkey were used. The results showed for nominated scenario that the MLP-IWO performed best with lowest root mean square error (RMSE) at 2.057 C when compared with original MLP model with RMSE at 2.426 C, the MLP-IWO model ranked first.

Overall, new hybrid MLP-IWO methods showed the potential to estimate soil temperature from freely available meteorological data, which may help reduce costs and labour in the field and this model has provided as a high accurate model for estimation soil temperature. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Mean square error; Meteorology; Multilayers; Optimization; Seed; Soils; Wind; Invasive Weed Optimization algorithms; Meteorological data; Meteorological parameters; Meteorological station; Multi layer perceptron; Root mean square errors; Soil temperature models; Training and testing; Parameter estimation",Conference Paper,Scopus

It is even more important for IoT networks given the number of connected elements and the real-time nature of many connections. This work presents a novel deep learning architecture applicable to this supervised regression problem. It is based on an additive network model formed by ‘learning blocks’ that are stacked iteratively following, in part, the principles of gradient boosting models. The resulting architecture is trained end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent. This new architecture has connections with residual, stacked and boosted networks, being different from any of them. Like residual networks, it shows excellent convergence behavior during training and allows for deeper models. It has a regularization effect similar to stacked models and presents excellent prediction results as gradient boosting models do. The building elements of the architecture are neural network blocks or learning blocks, that can be constituted by a sequence of simple fully connected layers or by more elaborate dispositions of recurrent and convolutional layers. The resulting architecture is a generic additive network (gaNet) applicable to any supervised regression problem. To obtain experimental results on a hard prediction problem, the model is applied to the forecasting of network traffic using IoT traffic volume real data from a mobile operator.

By analysing this type of data, the pattern of the changes in the object of concern can be explored. The natural change in the Earth's surface is relatively slow and exhibits a pronounced pattern. Some natural events (for example, fires, floods, plant diseases, and insect pests) and human activities (for example, deforestation and urbanisation) will disturb this pattern and cause a relatively profound change on the Earth's surface. These events are usually referred to as disturbances. However, disturbances in ecosystems are not easy to detect from SITS data, because SITS contain combined information on disturbances, phenological variations and noise in remote sensing data. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed for online disturbance detection from SITS. The framework is based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. First, LSTM networks are trained by historical SITS. The trained LSTM networks are then used to predict new time series data. Last, the predicted data are compared with real data, and the noticeable deviations reveal disturbances. Experimental results using 16-day compositions of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MOD13Q1) illustrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed approach for online disturbance detection. © 2018 by the authors.","Long short-term memory; LSTM; Online disturbance detection; Recurrent neural network; RNN; Satellite image time series; SITS","Brain; Deforestation; Radiometers; Recurrent neural networks; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Time series; Combined informations; Disturbance detection; LSTM; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Remote sensing data; Satellite images; SITS; Temporal information; Long short-term memory",Article,Scopus

Therefore, a better understanding of the response to photoperiod is needed in order to improve production and ultimately increase yield. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of the adaptive capability of local varieties, especially in coping with environmental stress conditions. The objective of this study was to determine the photoperiod sensitivity (PS) characteristics of the most common local varieties of millet and sorghum in Burkina Faso, West Africa. Planting date experiments consisting of 5 or 6 planting dates with complementary irrigation and fertilizer to avoid water and nitrogen stress effect on phenology were conducted at the experiment station of Di in northwestern Burkina Faso during the rainy seasons of 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007. The study included 7 millet and 11 sorghum varieties from the three main agroecological zones in Burkina Faso to determine their sensitivity to photoperiod. In addition to the various key phenological parameters, panicle initiation date was measured in 2007. Therefore, thermal time from emergence to PI and photoperiod at PI could be experimentally determined. After evaluation of the relation between the PI stage and the other stages that could easily be observed, thermal time from emergence to flag leaf expansion was used to determine the date of panicle initiation (PI) as well as the photoperiod at PI for the experiments conducted from 2003 to 2006. Then, a graphical analysis was conducted to define the critical threshold photoperiod and photoperiod sensitivity for each variety. For both millet and sorghum, the photoperiod sensitivity ranged from 142 to 6184 growing degree days (GDD h -1) per hour of photoperiod extension. The critical photoperiod (Pc) ranged from a daylength of 13.00 to 13.35 h. Although these experiments were only conducted at one location, this study showed that photoperiod response is not only related to latitude, but depends also on the capability of lowlands to maintain soil moisture. There was a positive correlation between the critical photoperiod (Pc) and the latitude of origin of the local varieties and a negative correlation between photoperiod sensitivity and the latitude of origin.

We used an extensive field-level data set of on-farm yields from 134 irrigated and 94 rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) fields in Nebraska during a 4-yr period to evaluate three methods that do not require ground-based calibration. The first method is based on summing estimates of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, the second on using either MODIS or Landsat data to calibrate a crop model (Hybrid-Maize), and the third using Hybrid-Maize simulations to train a simple regression, which is then applied to MODIS or Landsat data. For MODIS, all three methods performed similarly poorly at predicting maize yields, with an R2 between observed and predicted yields of roughly 0.10 for rainfed and 0.20 for irrigated fields. Estimates from Landsat were considerably more accurate, with up to 20% of rainfed and 50% of irrigated yield variation captured by the predictions. Across all methods and sensors, irrigated yield variations were more successfully captured than rainfed yields because of relatively smaller rainfed field sizes and the added difficulty of modeling crop water stress in rainfed fields. Agreement between observed and predicted yields was highest for the third approach, which is attractive because it leverages a crop model's ability to synthesize knowledge on crop physiology and year-to-year differences in weather throughout the season, yet produces a simple regression that can be rapidly applied to Landsat imagery. © 2014 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

Vegetation Indices(VIs) involving visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared bands were calculated from the L8 and S2A sensor observations, and seasonal cumulative values were computed for the period June to October in the 9th month and June to November in the 10th month of the year for 2016/17 to 2018/19 cropping seasons. Sugarcane yield was predicted using the SVR, Multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), and Multiple linear regression (MLR) methods. Then, a tenfold cross-validation approach was implemented for the performance evaluation. The results showed significant correlations between sugarcane yield and cumulative values of VIs computed during the 10th month in the growing season. The results also revealed that the estimation accuracy of sugarcane was better using the combined L8 and S2A (RMSE = 12.95 t/ha, and MAE = 10.14 t/ha) than using the S2A data alone (RMSE = 14.71 t/ha, and MAE = 12.18 t/ha). Comparing SVR results with MLPNN and MLR disclosed that SVR outperforms the other two models in terms of prediction accuracy.

The food system, in turn, is a critical component in sustainable development, with direct linkages to the social, economic, and ecological systems. Weeds are one of the major factors responsible for the crop yield gap in the different regions of the world. In this work, a plant and weed identifier tool was conceptualized, developed, and trained based on artificial deep neural networks to be used for the purpose of weeding the inter‐row space in crop fields. A high‐level design of the weeding robot is conceptualized and proposed as a solution to the problem of weed infestation in farming systems. The implementation process includes data collection, data pre‐processing, training and optimizing a neural network model. A selective pre‐trained neural network model was considered for implementing the task of plant and weed identification. The faster R‐CNN (Region based Convolution Neural Network) method achieved an overall mean Average Precision (mAP) of around 31% while considering the learning rate hyperparameter of 0.0002. In the plant and weed prediction tests, prediction values in the range of 88–98% were observed in comparison to the ground truth. While as on a completely unknown dataset of plants and weeds, predictions were observed in the range of 67–95% for plants, and 84% to 99% in the case of weeds.

We develop a copula-based postprocessing (CPP) method to overcome this mismatch problem. The CPP forecasts are ensemble based and are generated from the predictive distribution conditioned on raw climate forecasts. CPP performs univariate postprocessing procedures at each station, lead time, and variable separately and then applies the Schaake shuffle to reorder ensemble sequence for a more realistic spatial, temporal, and cross-variable dependence structure. The use of copulas makes CPP free of strong distributional assumptions and flexible enough to describe complex dependence structures. In a case study, we apply CPP to postprocess rainfall, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and radiation forecasts at a monthly level from the Australian Community Climate and Earth-System Simulator Seasonal model (ACCESS-S) to three representative stations in Australia. We evaluate forecast skill at lead times of 0–5 months on a cross-validation theme in the context of both univariate and multivariate forecast verification. When compared with forecasts that use climatological values as the predictor, the CPP forecast has positive skills, although the skills diminish with increasing lead times and finally become comparable at long lead times. When compared with the bias-corrected forecasts and the quantile-mapped forecasts, the CPP forecast is the overall best, with the smallest bias and greatest univariate forecast skill. As a result of the skill gain from univariate forecasts and the effect of the Schaake shuffle, CPP leads to the most skillful multivariate forecast as well. Further results investigate whether using ensemble mean or additional predictors can enhance forecast skill for CPP. © 2020, American Meteorological Society.

Counting pods manually is slow and laborious. For crop counting, using object detection network is a common practice, but the scattered and overlapped pods make the detection and counting of the pods difficult. Results: We propose an approach that we named YOLO POD, based on the YOLO X framework. On top of YOLO X, we added a block for predicting the number of pods, modified the loss function, thus constructing a multi-task model, and introduced the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). We achieve accurate identification and counting of pods without reducing the speed of inference. The results showed that the R2 between the number predicted by YOLO POD and the ground truth reached 0.967, which is improved by 0.049 compared to YOLO X, while the inference time only increased by 0.08 s. Moreover, MAE, MAPE, RMSE are only 4.18, 10.0%, 6.48 respectively, the deviation is very small.

Plants of the family Lemnaceae (duckweeds) are the smallest flowering plants in the world, and biometric measurements of single plants and their growth rate are highly challenging. Although the use of software for digital image analysis has changed the way scientists extract phenomenological data (also for studies on duckweeds), the procedure is often not wholly automated and sometimes relies on the intervention of a human operator. Such a constraint can limit the objectivity of the measurements and generally slows down the time required to produce scientific data. Herein lies the need to implement image analysis software with artificial intelligence that can substitute the human operator. In this paper, we present a new method to study the growth rates of the plants of the Lemnaceae family based on the application of machine-learning procedures to digital image analysis. The method is compared to existing analogical and computer-operated procedures. The results showed that our method drastically reduces the time consumption of the human operator while retaining a high correlation in the growth rates measured with other procedures. As expected, machine-learning methods applied to digital image analysis can overcome the constraints of measuring growth rates of very small plants and might help duckweeds gain worldwide attention thanks to their strong nutritional qualities and biological plasticity. © 2022 by the authors.","aquatic plants; duckweed; image analysis; Lemna; Lemnaceae; machine learning; machine training",,Article,Scopus

In this study, we applied machine learning to 16S rRNA sequence and nitrification potential data from an experiment examining interactions between cropping systems and rhizosphere on microbial community assembly and nitrogen cycling processes. Given the high dimensionality of microbiome datasets, we only included nitrifers since only a few taxa are capable of ammonia and nitrite oxidation. We compared the performance of linear and nonlinear algorithms with and without qPCR measures of bacterial and archaea ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) gene abundance. Our feature selection process facilitated the identification of taxons that are most predictive of nitrification and to compare habitats. We found that Nitrosomonas and Nitrospirae were more frequently identified as important predictors of nitrification in conventional systems, whereas Thaumarchaeota were more important predictors in diversified systems. Our results suggest that model performance was not substantively improved by incorporating additional time-consuming and expensive qPCR data on amoA gene abundance. We also identified several clades of nitrifiers important for nitrification in different cropping systems, though we were unable to detect system- or rhizosphere-specific patterns in OTU-level biomarkers for nitrification. Finally, our results highlight the inherent risk of combining data from disparate habitats with the goal of increasing sample size to avoid overfitting models. This study represents a step toward developing machine learning approaches for microbiome research to identify nitrifier ecotypes that may be important for distinguishing ecotypes with defining roles in different habitats.

This is because the yield record is not long enough, and/or the data are only available at a local farm level. A data-driven approach is developed here to 1) identify how sensitive Vietnamese robusta coffee is to weather on district and provincial levels, 2) during which key moments weather is most influential for yield, and 3) how long before harvest, yield could potentially be forecasted. Robusta coffee yield time series were available from 2000 to 2018 for the Central Highlands, where 40% of global robusta coffee is produced. Multiple linear regression has been used to assess the effect of weather on coffee yield, with regularization techniques such as PCA and leave-one-out to avoid over-fitting the regression models. The data suggest that robusta coffee in Vietnam is most sensitive to two key moments: a prolonged rainy season of the previous year favoring vegetative growth, thereby increasing the potential yield (i.e., number of fruiting nodes), while low rainfall during bean formation decreases yield. Depending on location, these moments could be used to forecast the yield anomaly with 3–6 months’ anticipation. The sensitivity of yield anomalies to weather varied substantially between provinces and even districts. In Dak Lak and some Lam Dong districts, weather explained up to 36% of the robusta coffee yield anomalies variation, while low sensitivities were identified in Dak Nong and Gia Lai districts. Our statistical model can be used as a seasonal forecasting tool for the management of coffee production. It can also be applied to climate change studies, i.e., using this statistical model in climate simulations to see the tendency of coffee in the following decades.

First, the ResNet101 structure is adopted as the backbone network to achieve feature extraction of the green object fruit. Then, the C5 feature maps are expanded with receptive fields and the decoder is used for classification and regression. Besides, the center point in the regression box is employed to get a diamond-shaped structure and fed into an additional Deep-snake network, which is adjusted to the contours of the target fruit to achieve fast and accurate segmentation of green fruit. The experimental results show that YOLOF-snake is sensitive to the green fruit, and the segmentation accuracy and efficiency are significantly improved.

A high-quality data improves the efficiency of intelligent algorithms and helps reduce the costs of data collection and transmission. However, the current image quality assessment research focuses on visual quality, while ignoring the crucial information aspect. In this work, taking the crop pest recognition task as an example, we proposed an effective indicator of distance-entropy to distinguish the good and bad data from the perspective of information. Many comparative experiments, considering the mapping feature dimensions and base data sizes, were conducted to testify the validity and robustness of this indicator. Both the numerical and the visual results demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed distance-entropy method. In general, this study is a relatively cutting-edge work in smart agriculture, which calls for attention to the quality assessment of the data information and provides some inspiration for the subsequent research on data mining, as well as for the dataset optimization for practical applications.

Regardless of their strength, the CP-ANNs still have some limitations in pattern recognition tasks when they encounter ambiguities during the learning process, which leads to the inaccurate classification of the Kohonen-Self-Organizing-Map (K-SOM). This problem has an impact on the performance of the CP-ANNs. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel strategy to improve the CP-ANNs by the Gram-Schmidt algorithm (GSHM) as a pre-processing step of the original data without changing their architecture. Three datasets examples from various domains, such as correlation, crop, and fertilizer, were employed for experimental validation. To obtain the results, we relied on two simulations. The first simulation uses CP-ANNs, and the datasets are inputted into the network without any prior pre-processing. The second simulation uses MCP-ANNs, and the datasets are pre-processed through the GSHM block. Experiment results show that the proposed MCP-ANNs recognize all patterns with a classification accuracy of 100% versus 62.5% for CP-ANNs in the Correlation Dataset. Furthermore, the proposed MCP-ANNs reduce the execution time and training parameter values in all datasets versus CP-ANNs. Thus, the proposed approach based on the GSHM algorithm significantly improves the performance of the CP-ANNs. © 2022 CCIS.","Classification performance; Counter propagation artificial neural networks (CP-ANNs); Data preprocessing; Gram-Schmidt algorithm (GSHM); Kohonen-self organizing-map (K-SOM); Modified counter propagation artificial neural networks (MCP-ANNs)",,Article,Scopus

Results showed the largest irrigation depth led to reductions in irrigation and crop evapotranspiration (ETc) with slightly increased cotton yields compared to the baseline scenarios under different hydroclimatic regimes. However, soil water content and surface runoff values were increased when using the largest irrigation depth. The opposite results were observed for the small irrigation depth. Early planting of cotton resulted in decreased irrigation and ETc, and increased cotton yields under both irrigated and dryland conditions, particularly in normal and wet years. By contrast, the late planting scenarios indicated the opposite for those variables. Simulated hydrologic variables were relatively stable using various maturity cultivars. Nevertheless, greater than 10% reductions in irrigated cotton yield under diverse hydroclimatic years and dryland yields during normal and wet years were identified in the long-season cotton. The opposite was determined for the short-season cotton.

Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are beneficial in building a good model to detect fraudulent transactions. Dealing with high-dimensional and imbalanced dataset becomes a hinder in real-world applications like credit card fraud detection. To overcome this issue, feature selection a pre-processing technique is adopted considering the classification performance and computational efficiency. This paper proposes a new two-phase feature selection approach that integrates filter and wrapper methods to identify the significant feature subsets. In the first phase, Mutual Information (MI) has been adopted due to its computational efficiency to rank the features based on their feature importance. However, they cannot drop the less important features. Thus, a second phase is added to eliminate the redundant features using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) a wrapper method employed by 5-fold cross-validation. eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is adopted as the estimator for RFE by adjusting the class weights. The optimal features obtained from the proposed method were used in four boosting algorithms such as XGBoost, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Classic Gradient Boosting (CatBoost) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) to analyse the performance of classification. The proposed approach has been applied to the credit card fraud detection dataset obtained from the IEEE-CIS, which consists of imbalance in the binary class target. The experimental outcome shows promising results in terms of Geometric mean (G-Mean) for XGBoost (84.8%) and LGBM (83.7%), the Area Under a Receiver Operating Character (ROC) Curve (AUC) has increased from 79.8% to 85.5% for XGBoost and also the computation time are reduced in training the classifiers. © 2021 C.

Index insurance contracts inevitably make errors, failing to detect losses that occur and issuing payments when no losses occur. The quality of these contracts and the indices on which they are based, need to be evaluated to assess their fitness as insurance, and to provide a guide to choosing the index that best protects the insured. In the remote sensing literature, indices are often evaluated with generic model evaluation statistics such as R2 or Root Mean Square Error that do not directly consider the effect of errors on the quality of the insurance contract. Economic analysis suggests using measures that capture the impact of insurance on the expected economic well-being of the insured. To bridge the gap between the remote sensing and economic perspectives, we adopt a standard economic measure of expected well-being and transform it into a Relative Insurance Benefit (RIB) metric. RIB expresses the welfare benefits derived from an index insurance contract relative to a hypothetical contract that perfectly measures losses. RIB takes on its maximal value of one when the index contract offers the same economic benefits as the perfect contract. When it achieves none of the benefits of insurance it takes on a value of zero, and becomes negative if the contract leaves the insured worse off than having no insurance. Part of our contribution is to decompose this economic well-being measure into an asymmetric loss function. We also argue that the expected well-being measure we use has advantages over other economic measures for the normative purpose of insurance quality ascertainment. Finally, we illustrate the use of the RIB measure with a case study of potential livestock insurance contracts in Northern Kenya. We compared 24 indices that were made with 4 different statistical models and 3 remote sensing data sources. RIB for these indices ranged from 0.09 to 0.5, and R2 ranged from 0.2 to 0.51. While RIB and R2 were correlated, the model with the highest RIB did not have the highest R2. Our findings suggest that, when designing and evaluating an index insurance program, it is useful to separately consider the quality of a remote sensing-based index with a metric like the RIB instead of a generic goodness-of-fit metric.

(steadily supported by the Hellenic Agricultural Organization—Demeter) towards offering precision farming services to rice growers. Within this framework, a new methodology for topdressing nitrogen prediction was developed based on machine learning. Nitrogen is a key element in rice culture and its rational management can increase productivity, reduce costs, and prevent environmental impacts. A multi-source, multi-temporal, and multi-scale dataset was collected, including optical and radar imagery, soil data, and yield maps by monitoring a 110 ha pilot rice farm in Thessaloniki Plain, Greece, for four consecutive years. RapidEye imagery underwent image segmentation to delineate management zones (ancillary, visual interpretation of unmanned aerial system scenes was employed, too); Sentinel-1 (SAR) imagery was modelled with Computer Vision to detect inundated fields and (through this) indicate the exact growth stage of the crop; and Sentinel-2 image data were used to map leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) exactly before topdressing applications. Several machine learning algorithms were configured to predict yield for various nitrogen levels, with the XGBoost model resulting in the highest accuracy. Finally, yield curves were used to select the nitrogen dose maximizing yield, which was thus recommended to the grower. Inundation mapping proved to be critical in the prediction process. Currently, Ecodevelopment S.A. is expanding the application of the new method in different study areas, with a view to further empower its generality and operationality. © 2021 by the authors.

In areas where such data are not readily available, an independent seasonal monitoring method is needed. Remote sensing is a widely used tool to map land use types, although there are some limitations that can partly be circumvented by using, among others, multiple observations, careful feature selection and appropriate analysis methods. Here, we used Sentinel-2 satellite image time series (SITS) over the land area of Norway to map three agricultural land use classes: cereal crops, fodder crops (grass) and unused areas. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and two variants of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are implemented on SITS data of four different temporal resolutions. These enabled us to compare twelve model-dataset combinations to identify the model-dataset combination that results in the most accurate predictions. The CNN is implemented in the spectral and temporal dimensions instead of the conventional spatial dimension. Rather than using existing deep learning architectures, an autotuning procedure is implemented so that the model hyperparameters are empirically optimized during the training. The results obtained on held-out test data show that up to 94% overall accuracy and 90% Cohen’s Kappa can be obtained when the 2D CNN is applied on the SITS data with a temporal resolution of 7 days. This is closely followed by the 1D CNN on the same dataset. However, the latter performs better than the former in predicting data outside the training set. It is further observed that cereal is predicted with the highest accuracy, followed by grass. Predicting the unused areas has been found to be difficult as there is no distinct surface condition that is common for all unused areas. © 2021 by the authors.

Water scarcity due to climate change, together with the increasing demand of food, is leading experts from around the world find appropriate indicators for water-use efficiency. In this paper we propose and test different indicators for service delivery performance, productive efficiency, and economic efficiency. Since the characteristics of the studied area and the citrus cropping system in the East of Spain are particular, we include in our analysis two other variables which are key to understanding the changes in the indicators: the obtained productivity, and the applied irrigation. The indicators and these two variables are tested with the information provided by farmers of citrus orchards belonging to an irrigation community from the East of Spain. The effect of different factors, such as cultivated varieties, type of farmer (professional or non-professional), or plantations’ size, are evaluated against the productivity and irrigation performance of the evaluated orchards. The effect of excess of irrigation on the indicators is also studied with the previous factors. Finally, an artificial intelligence system is used to predict productive efficiency of an orchard, based on the size and the water supply. Among the proposed indicators, the service delivery performance indicators came out to be the least useful and might provoke overirrigation due to the lack of accuracy of the data used for its calculation. The productive and economic efficiency indicators have been useful to illustrate the remarkable effect that excess of irrigation has on water efficiency, since a reduction of 66% of productive efficiency is found for some of the analysed varieties. On other cases, a reduction of 50% in economic efficiency is detected due to the excess of irrigation. Moreover, the excess of irrigation implied higher economic efficiency in only one of the evaluated varieties. © 2020 by the authors.

Only few instances, called primary instances, contribute to the bag labels. The remaining ones are noisy observations. The goal in MIR is to identify the primary instances within each bag and learn a regression model that can predict the label of a previously unseen bag. In this paper, we show that regression models can be identified as clusters when appropriate features and distances are used. We introduce an algorithm, called Robust Fuzzy Clustering for Multiple Instance Regression (RFC-MIR), that can learn multiple linear models simultaneously. First, RFC-MIR uses constrained fuzzy memberships to obtain an initial partition where instances can belong to multiple models with various degrees. Then, it uses unconstrained possibilistic memberships to allow the initial local models to expand and converge to the global model. These memberships are also used to identify the primary instances within each bag. After clustering, the possibilistic memberships are used to identify the optimal number of regression models. We evaluate our approach on synthetic data sets generated by varying the dimensionality of the feature space, the number of instances per bag, and the noise level. We also validate the RFC-MIR using two real applications: prediction of the yearly average yield of a crop using remote sensing data; and drug activity prediction. These applications have been used consistently to validate existing MIR algorithms. We show that our approach achieves higher accuracy than existing methods. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Fuzzy clustering; Multiple instance regression; Multiple model regression; Possibilistic clustering","Forecasting; Fuzzy clustering; Remote sensing; Multiple instance regressions (MIR); Multiple instances; Multiple linear models; Multiple-modeling; Noisy observations; Possibilistic clustering; Remote sensing data; Robust fuzzy clustering; Regression analysis",Article,Scopus

In this study, we assess the spatio-temporal seasonal LAI dynamics (dry and wet seasons) as a proxy for rangeland condition and productivity in the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. The 30 m Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) spectral bands, derived vegetation indices and a non-parametric approach (i.e., random forest, RF) were used to assess dry and wet season LAI condition and variability in the KNP. The results showed that RF optimization enhanced the model performance in estimating LAI. Moderately high accuracies were observed for the dry season (R2 of 0.63-0.72 and average RMSE of 0.60 m2/m2) and wet season (0.62-0.63 and 0.79 m2/m2). Derived thematic maps demonstrated that the park had high LAI estimates during the wet season when compared to the dry season. On average, LAI estimates ranged between 3 and 7 m2/m2 during the wet season, whereas for the dry season most parts of the park had LAI estimates ranging between 0.00 and 3.5 m2/m2. The findings indicate that Kruger National Park had high levels of productivity during the wet season monitoring period. Overall, this work shows the unique potential of Landsat 8-derived metrics in assessing LAI as a proxy for tropical savanna rangelands productivity. The result is relevant for wildlife management and habitat assessment and monitoring. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate variability; Natural capital; Rangeland productivity; Seasonal variability; Wildlife","Animals; Climate change; Decision trees; Drought; Ecosystems; Maps; Number theory; Tropics; Assessment and monitoring; Climate variability; Dry and wet seasons; Natural capital; Nonparametric approaches; Operational land imager; Seasonal variability; Wildlife; Productivity",Article,Scopus

The overarching goal of this study was to develop a higher-spatial-resolution vegetation outlook (VegOut-UBN) model that integrates multiple satellite, climatic, and biophysical input variables for the Upper Blue Nile (UBN) basin. VegOut-UBN uses current and historical observations in predicting the vegetation condition at multiple leading time steps of 1, 3, 6, and 9 dekades. VegOut-UBN was developed to predict the vegetation condition during the main crop-growing season locally called ""Kiremt"" (June to September) using historical input data from 2001 to 2016. The rule-based regression tree approach was used to develop the relationship between the predictand and predictor variables. The results for the recent historic drought (2009 and 2015) and non-drought (2007) years are presented to evaluate the model accuracy during extreme weather conditions. The result, in general, shows that the predictive accuracy of the model decreases as the prediction interval increases for the cross-validation years. The coefficient of determination (R2) of the predictive and observed vegetation condition shows a higher value (R2 &gt; 0.8) for one-month prediction and a relatively lower value (R2 ≅= 0.70) for three-month prediction. The result also reveals strong spatial integrity and similarity of the observed and predicted maps. VegOut-UBN was evaluated and compared with the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) (derived from independent rainfall datasets from meteorological stations) at different aggregate periods and with a food security status map. The result was encouraging and indicative of the potential application of VegOut-UBN for drought monitoring and prediction. The VegOut-UBN model could be informative in decision-making processes and could contribute to the development of operational drought monitoring and predictive models for the UBN basin. © 2019 by the authors.","Drought; Regression model; Upper Blue Nile; VegOut-UBN","Cultivation; Decision making; Developing countries; Food supply; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Vegetation; Blue Nile; Coefficient of determination; Decision making process; Extreme weather conditions; Historical observation; Regression model; Standardized precipitation index; VegOut-UBN; Drought",Article,Scopus

Each of the models was constructed in such a way that the yield prediction can be carried out on three dates: April 15th, May 31st, and June 30th. For model building, artificial neural networks with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) topology were used, on the basis of meteorological data (temperature and precipitation) and information about mineral fertilisation. The data were collected from the years, 2008-2015, from 328 production fields located in Greater Poland, Poland. An assessment of the quality of forecasts produced based on neural models was verified by determination of forecast errors using RAE (relative approximation error), RMS (root mean square error), MAE (mean absolute error) error indicators, and MAPE (mean absolute percentage error). An important feature of the produced prediction models is the ability to realize the forecast in the current agrotechnical year on the basis of the current weather and fertiliser information. The lowest MAPE error values were obtained for the neural model WR15_04 (April 15th) based on the MLP network with structure 15:15-18-11-1:1, which reached 7.51%. Other models reached MAPE errors of 7.85% for model WR31_05 (May 31st) and 8.12% for model WR30_06 (June 30th). The performed sensitivity analysis gave information about the factors that have the greatest impact on winter rapeseed yields. The highest rank of 1 was obtained by two networks for the same independent variable in the form of the sum of precipitation within a period from September 1st to December 31st of the previous year. However, in model WR15_04, the highest rank obtained a feature in the form of a sum of molybdenum fertilization in the current year (MO_CY). The models of winter rapeseed yield produced in the work will be the basis for the construction of new forecasting tools, which may be an important element of precision agriculture and the main element of decision support systems. © 2018 by the authors.","MLP network; Neural model; Precision agriculture; Sensitivity analysis; Winter rapeseed; Yield prediction","agricultural technology; artificial neural network; crop yield; fertilizer application; molybdenum; precision agriculture; sensitivity analysis; topology; Poland [Central Europe]; Brassica napus",Article,Scopus

When applying ecohydrologic models to study climate impacts on crop yield, especially interannual yield responses to climate stresses, the model simulation of plant available soil moisture must be constrained in order to reproduce plant production variation via moisture related bio-climate variables. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to investigate the relationship between climate variability and crop yield at four sites (Boone, Woodbury, Madison, and Mason) in the Midwestern USA. The model was first calibrated for soil moisture at the plot scale. The calibrated model was then used to extend the observational records between 1991 and 2010 to better capture the effect of climate variability on crop yield over a longer period (1941-2010). We also explored the relative yield reduction due to individual stresses. Our results indicated that annual observed yield from 1991 to 2010 is correlated with drought stress intensity in the early and middle reproductive stage at most sites. The early and middle reproductive periods were thought more critical than other stages, because severe drought stress in those periods is substantially correlated with low observed yields. No significant relationship between crop yield and aeration stress was found at any of the four sites, due to their different impacts under different spatial scales, as well as low frequency of events in the historical record. Long term simulation of yield reduction indicates that drought stress was the dominant factor affecting yield in the historical period when compared with aeration stress both at short and long return periods (high/low probability of exceedance). For a 70-year period, the total yield reduction due to drought stress is 8.1%, 17.5%, 15.2% and 9.7% respectively for Boone, Woodbury, Madison and Mason. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Aeration stress; Climate variability; Crop yield; Drought stress; Soil moisture; SWAT","aeration; agrometeorology; climate change; climate effect; crop production; crop yield; drought stress; estimation method; historical record; soil moisture; Madison; Midwest; United States; Wisconsin",Article,Scopus

Usually such assessments apply statistically postprocessed output of climate model projections to force impact models. Increasingly, time series with daily resolution are used, which require high consistency, for instance with respect to transition probabilities (TPs) between wet and dry days and spell durations. However, both climate models and commonly applied statistical tools have considerable uncertainties and drawbacks. This paper compares the ability of 1) raw regional climate model (RCM) output, 2) bias-corrected RCM output, and 3) a conventional weather generator (WG) that has been calibrated to match observed TPs to simulate the sequence of dry, wet, and very wet days at a set of long-term weather stations across Switzerland. The study finds systematic biases in TPs and spell lengths for raw RCM output, but a substantial improvement after bias correction using the deterministic quantile mapping technique. For the region considered, bias-corrected climate model output agrees well with observations in terms of TPs as well as dry and wet spell durations. For the majority of cases (models and stations) bias-corrected climate model output is similar in skill to a simple Markov chain stochastic weather generator. There is strong evidence that bias-corrected climate model simulations capture the atmospheric event sequence more realistically than a simple WG. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","Climate models; Mathematical and statistical techniques; Model comparison; Model errors; Model evaluation/performance; Model output statistics; Models and modeling; Statistical techniques","Mapping; Markov processes; Statistical mechanics; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Model comparison; Model errors; Model evaluation/performance; Model output statistics; Statistical techniques; Climate models; climate modeling; climate prediction; Markov chain; probability; regional climate; stochasticity; uncertainty analysis; weather forecasting",Article,Scopus

However, the accuracy of phenological parameters extracted by remote sensing data cannot be guaranteed because of the influence of climate, e.g. the monsoon season, and limited available remote sensing data. In this study, we integrate the data of HJ-1 CCD and Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) by using the ordinary least-squares (OLS), and construct higher temporal resolution vegetation indices (VIs) time-series data to extract the phenological parameters of single-cropped rice. Two widely used VIs, namely the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and 2-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2), were adopted to minimize the influence of environmental factors and the intrinsic difference between the two sensors. Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filters were applied to construct continuous VI profiles per pixel. The results showed that, compared with NDVI, EVI2 was more stable and comparable between the two sensors. Compared with the observed phenological data of the single-cropped rice, the integrated VI time-series had a relatively low root mean square error (RMSE), and EVI2 showed higher accuracy compared with NDVI. We also demonstrate the application of phenology extraction of the single-cropped rice in a spatial scale in the study area.

A version of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, calibrated in a previous study to estimate annual runoff, sediment and total phosphorus (TP) fluxes from the Castor subwatershed into the Pike River watershed, which, in turn, flows into the Missisquoi Bay, used static landscapes and single land uses to arrive at its predictions. However, in reality, farmers do rotate crops. Therefore, the present study’s objective was to quantify the impact of soil heterogeneities on land use change patterns in the Castor subwatershed from 1999 to 2011. Data from a 24-point soil survey within the Castor subwatershed were partitioned and regionalized into 5, 10, 15, 20 and 24 heterogeneous regions or configurations. Using the standard soils map (with mean properties) employed in several prior studies in the subwatershed, a sixth configuration termed “Reference,” was also developed. All 6 configurations were factorially combined with either 1999 or 2011 land use data to yield 12 different versions of the SWAT model and quantify the heterogeneities and uncertainty of soil properties on land use change. For hydrology, it was discovered that there were no marked differences in the predictions, which was attributable to the use the SCS-CN subroutine which masks the physical properties of soil parameters within the same hydrologic group. We evaluated all the models for two periods i.e. 1991-1999 and 2000-2007. All the 1999 land use SWAT configurations underestimated runoff, sediment and TP whereas all the 2011 land use SWAT set ups gave higher and more accurate values. For both land use periods, the 5 Region models both showed higher and more accurate estimates, than those set ups with a greater number of regions, but were similar in accuracy to the Reference model set-ups. Since the 5-region configurations showed the highest within-zone heterogeneity, it can be concluded that having many regions (many sampling points as regions) does not necessarily increase SWAT’s prediction accuracy. © 2015 ISEIS All rights reserved","Curve number; Land use; Partitioning; Total phosphorus","algal bloom; calibration; discharge; flux measurement; heterogeneity; land use change; mapping method; nutrient enrichment; phosphorus; regionalization; runoff; soil property; soil quality; spatiotemporal analysis; uncertainty analysis; watershed; Canada; Castor River; Lake Champlain; Missisquoi Bay; Quebec [Canada]; algae",Article,Scopus

The core of the framework is an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) used to control crop model runs, assimilate remote sensing (RS) data and update model state variables. We modified the Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer - Cropping System Model (DSSAT-CSM)-Maize model (Jones et al., 2003) to be able to stop and start simulations at any given time in the growing season, such that the EnKF can update model state variables as RS data become available. The data assimilation-crop modeling framework was evaluated against 2003-2009 maize yields in Story County, Iowa, USA, assimilating AMSR-E soil moisture and MODIS-LAI data independently and simultaneously. Assimilating LAI or soil moisture independently slightly improved the correlation of observed and simulated yields (R=0.51 and 0.50) compared to no data assimilation (open-loop; R=0.47) but prediction errors improved with reductions in MBE and RMSE by 0.5 and 0.5Mgha-1 respectively for LAI assimilation while these were reduced by 1.8 and 1.1Mgha-1 for soil moisture assimilation. Yield correlation improved more when both soil moisture and LAI were assimilated (R=0.65) suggesting a cause-effect interaction between soil moisture and LAI, prediction errors (MBE and RMSE) were also reduced by 1.7 and 1.8Mgha-1 with respect to open-loop simulations. Results suggest that assimilation of LAI independently might be preferable when conditions are extremely wet while assimilation of soil moisture+LAI might be more suitable when conditions are more nominal. AMSR-E soil moisture tends to be more biased under the presence of high vegetation (i.e., when crops are fully developed) and that updating rootzone soil moisture by near-surface soil moisture assimilation under very wet conditions could increase the modeled percolation causing excessive nitrogen (N) leaching hence reducing crop yields even with water stress reduced at a minimum due to soil moisture assimilation. However, applying the data assimilation-crop modeling framework strategically by considering a-priori information on climate condition expected during the growing season may improve yield prediction performance substantially, in our case with higher correlation (R=0.80) and more reductions in MBE and RMSE (2.5 and 3.3Mgha-1) compared to when there is no data assimilation. Scaling AMSR-E soil moisture to the climatology of the model did not improve our data assimilation results because the model is also biased. Better soil moisture products e.g., from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, may solve the soil moisture data issue in the near future. © 2013.","Crop model; Data assimilation; Leaf area index; Soil moisture; Yield forecasting","Crop model; Data assimilation; Ensemble Kalman Filter; Leaf Area Index; Open-loop simulations; Remotely sensed soil moisture; Soil moisture active passive (SMAP); Yield forecasting; Artificial intelligence; Computer simulation; Crops; Data processing; Decision support systems; Errors; Forecasting; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Solvents; Technology transfer; Vegetation; Soil surveys; agricultural management; agricultural technology; correlation; crop yield; data acquisition; decision support system; growing season; Kalman filter; maize; MODIS; remote sensing; simulation; soil moisture; water stress; Iowa; Story County; United States",Article,Scopus

First, we fitted nine machine learning algorithms with various pre-processing scenarios using variables from July, August and September based on the red, red-edge and infra-red bands of the spectrum. Second, we selected the best performing models and evaluated them against independent test data. Finally, we repeated the previous two steps using only variables corresponding to July and August.

Model performance was evaluated by cross-validation against (a) simulated yields and (b) independent yields from ground surveys aggregated at village level. The results showed that the RF (Random Forest) model outperformed the MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) model for year-on-year yield estimation at the end of the season when compared to simulated yields. Surface soil moisture (SSM) information, as a proxy for soil water available for plant growth, together with information on the temperature of the canopy cover, helped to improve the RF maize yield model, impacting more particularly the estimation of crop water stress. Lastly, two months before harvest the RF model predicted 46% of the observed end-of-season maize grain yield variability. The combined remote sensing, crop model and machine learning method is thus an effective approach for estimating and forecasting inter-annual maize crop yields in environments where field data are scarce, such as in most parts of the African continent. However, more research is needed to better retrieve the spatial variability of yields in order to strengthen current agricultural monitoring systems, and to address societal challenges, such as declining food security. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Crop yield estimation and forecast; Food security; MODIS NDVI and LST; SARRA-O crop model; SMOS SSM; Statistical model; Uncalibrated approach","aboveground biomass; agricultural modeling; crop plant; crop yield; drought; food security; maize; remote sensing; soil moisture; soil water; statistical analysis; water stress; Burkina Faso; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

For objective and time-efficient estimation of legume proportion, convolutional neural network (CNN) models were trained by fine-tuning the GoogLeNet to estimate the coverage of timothy (TY), white clover (WC), and background (Bg) on the unmanned aerial vehicle-based images. The accuracies of the CNN models trained on different datasets were compared using the mean bias error and the mean average error. The models predicted the coverage with small errors when the plots in the training datasets were similar to the target plots in terms of coverage rate. The models that are trained on datasets of multiple plots had smaller errors than those trained on datasets of a single plot. The CNN models estimated the WC coverage more precisely than they did to the TY and the Bg coverages. The correlation coefficients (r) of the measured coverage for aerial images vs. estimated coverage were 0.92–0.96, whereas those of the scored coverage by a breeder vs. estimated coverage were 0.76–0.93.

Inspired by video prediction and exploiting the availability of Copernicus Sentinel-2 images, recent studies have attempted to forecast the land surface evolution as a function of past land surface evolution, elevation, and weather. Further extending this paradigm, we propose a model based on convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) that is computationally efficient (lightweight), however obtains superior results to the previous baselines. By introducing a ConvLSTM-based architecture to this problem, we can not only ingest the heterogeneous data sources (Sentinel-2 time-series, weather data, and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM)) but also explicitly condition the future predictions on the weather. Our experiments confirm the importance of weather parameters in understanding the land cover dynamics and show that weather maps are significantly more important than the DEM in this task. Furthermore, we perform generative simulations to investigate how varying a single weather parameter can alter the evolution of the land surface.

Using network devices in agriculture has the potential to enhance the production process. One of the key challenges WSN faces is energy efficiency. A model based on the water pipeline method is proposed in order to efficiently utilize sensor nodes in agricultural production and water distribution. A water pipeline serves as an important structure for transporting potable water across a distance for consumption or irrigation. In contrast, the biggest transportation problems of water pipelines are leaks. So, water resources may be lost as a result. These pipes need real-time monitoring to prevent such problems. The wireless sensor network technique, however, is considered one of the best solutions available today for monitoring water pipelines. A detailed analysis of agriculture is provided by the model. Aspects of WSN are discussed and their agricultural use is expounded. Moreover, this paper describes the various types of applicability of existing sensor networks in the field of agriculture, along with some technical perspectives. To achieve the best power consumption and communication for the two types of range, ZigBee wireless protocols are utilized. As such, high-performance information that provides a platform for WSNs to better support agricultural production is also included in our proposed model in order to address the shortcomings of existing WSNs regarding energy efficiency.

MIF provides a key performance shop floor metric called the value of information flow (VIF). Previous methods have been used to analyze VIF in developed countries. However, these methods are sometimes limited when applied to developing countries where the shop floor is disorganized. It then renders the MIF with the imported software inefficient because of the gap between the user environments. Taking Cameroon as a case study, this study proposes a new method of modeling and analyzing the information flow and its value based on the characteristics of information flow (CIF) for developing countries. In addition, a predictive analysis of the VIF based on CIF using an artificial neural network (ANN) on one hand and optimized ANN with particle swarm optimizer (PSO) and genetic algorithms (GA) on the other is performed. The ANN model of regression developed has the following performance: coefficient of determination: 0.99 and mean squared error (MSE): 0.00043. For the PSO-ANN, the MSE decreased to 0.00011, and this model result was similar to that of the deep learning model used for regression.

Accordingly, we compiled plant compositional traits from chrysanthemum and gerbera plants in four treatments: non-infested, or infested with mites, thrips or whiteflies, and we acquired hyperspectral leaf reflectance data from the same plants over time (0–14 days). RESULTS: Plant compositional traits changed significantly in response to arthropod infestations, and individual chrysanthemum and gerbera plants were classified with 78% and 80% accuracy, respectively. Based on leaf reflectance, individual plants from the four treatments were classified with moderate accuracy levels of 76% (gerbera) and 73% (chrysanthemum) but with a clear distinction between non-infested and infested plants. Accurate and consistent diagnosis of biotic stressors was not achieved. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study in which infestations by multiple economically important arthropod pests are directly compared and associated with leaf reflectance responses and changes in plant compositional traits. It is important to highlight that imposed stress levels were low, period of infestation was short, and hyperspectral remote-sensing data were acquired at four time points with analyses based on large data sets (3826 leaf reflectance profiles for chrysanthemum and 4041 for gerbera). This study provides novel insight into crop responses to different biotic stressors and into possible associations between plant compositional traits and hyperspectral leaf reflectance data acquired from crop leaves. © 2021 The Authors.

Here we present a novel approach investigating the effect of compaction due to in-field traffic by continuously monitoring crop canopy temperature and soil profile moisture and measuring crop yield in individual crop rows to determine the economic impact on cotton farming systems. Traffic by a tractor weighing 19.2 Mg either side of the plant row reduced lint yield by 27 % due to lower crop height, leaf area, biomass and fruit number. Elevated canopy temperature (Tc) in the compacted plots resulted in 30 % higher stress time (i.e. cumulative time when Tc is higher than the optimum Tc for cotton growth) compared with the non-compacted plots. Higher stress time in compacted plots was correlated with a 72 % and 27 % reduction in crop water use (estimated from change in soil water) at 0.3−0.5 m and 0.5 – 0.7 m depths, respectively. Water recharge in the soil profile from irrigation and rainfall was reduced by 16 % due to compaction with the highest reduction being 86 % at 0.3 – 0.5 m depth. These results demonstrate that compaction likely reduced root access to water below 0.3 m inducing water stress resulting in yield reduction. Tractors used for farm operations only compact one side of the bed, however, both sides are compacted in the absence of permanent wheel tracks. By comparison a dual tyre round module cotton picker weighing ∼32 Mg compacts 67 % of the rows on both sides and 33 % on one side suggesting greater economic loss in the following season compared to that estimated from the current study. Reductions in soil water recharge following irrigation and rainfall events due to compaction will further decrease farm efficiency and profitability. To our knowledge this is the first study related to soil compaction in any crop to show the direct relationship between yield, plant stress time and soil water dynamics at specific depths in profile. It is suggested that short term agronomic decisions (eg irrigation scheduling) need to be considered differently where compaction has been identified as limiting productivity. We recommend case studies be conducted to monitor the effect of compaction on commercial farm productivity and to demonstrate the cost of compaction across agricultural industries to drive practice change. Demonstrating the potential economic consequences of soil compaction by the integrated approach used in this study may encourage practice change to minimize compaction on farms. © 2021 The Author(s)","Canopy temperature; Crop water use; Soil strength; Soil water recharge; Water stress","Compaction; Cotton; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Irrigation; Losses; Plants (botany); Productivity; Rain; Soil mechanics; Soil moisture; Tractors (agricultural); Tractors (truck); Water supply; Weighing; % reductions; Canopy temperature; Case-studies; Crop water use; Soil compaction; Soil strength; Soil water; Stress time; Water recharges; Water stress; Crops; compaction; cotton; economic impact; soil profile; soil water; water stress; water use; Gossypium hirsutum; Varanidae",Article,Scopus

This study focuses on the land cover classification and change detection with multitemporal and multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite data. To address the challenging land cover change detection task, we rely on two different deep learning architectures and selected pre-processing steps. For example, we define an excluded class and deal with temporal water shoreline changes in the pre-processing. We employ a fully convolutional neural network (FCN), and we combine the FCN with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The FCN can only handle monotemporal input data, while the FCN combined with LSTM can use sequential information (multitemporal). Besides, we provided fixed and variable sequences as training sequences for the combined FCN and LSTM approach. The former refers to using six defined satellite images, while the latter consists of image sequences from an extended training pool of ten images. Further, we propose measures for the robustness concerning the selection of Sentinel-2 image data as evaluation metrics. We can distinguish between actual land cover changes and misclassifications of the deep learning approaches with these metrics. According to the provided metrics, both multitemporal LSTM approaches outperform the monotemporal FCN approach, about 3 to 5 percentage points (p.p.). The LSTM approach trained on the variable sequences detects 3 p.p. more land cover changes than the LSTM approach trained on the fixed sequences. Besides, applying our selected pre-processing improves the water classification and avoids reducing the dataset effectively by 17.6%. The presented LSTM approaches can be modified to provide applicability for a variable number of image sequences since we published the code of the deep learning models.

A mass mechanical harvesting of apples offers an alternative and promising solution. In addition to harvester design elements, it is important to understand the key canopy parameters of apple trees as they are closely integrated and interact with each other during the harvest process. In this study, the impact of eleven canopy parameters on mechanical harvesting were investigated for vertically-trained “Scifresh” and V-trellis grown “Envy” trees during harvesting trials. A supervised machine learning algorithm with weighted k-nearest neighbours (kNN) was adopted to analyse our canopy datasets. Overall, 2678 ground-truth data points (apples) were classified into two binary classes of fruit removal status: “mechanically harvested” and “mechanically unharvested” apples. For the training dataset (85%), the adopted algorithm achieved overall prediction accuracies of 76–92% and 62–74% for “Scifresh” and “Envy”. With the remaining 15% dataset, the overall test accuracies were 81–91% on “Scifresh” but only 36–79% on “Envy”. The principal components analysis (PCA) was adopted to determine the key canopy parameters by calculating the coefficients of principal components (PCs). The PC1–PC5 explained at least 80% of the data variance. By assuming a coefficient greater than 0.5 as being highly relevant, fruit load per branch, branch basal diameter, and shoot length were the most relevant among all. These results provide guidance for growers in canopy management that could improve efficiency of a mechanical harvesting system. © 2020 IAgrE","Canopy decisive factor; Formally trained trees; k-nearest-neighbours; Principal components; Tree-machine interaction","Forestry; Fruits; Harvesting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine components; Nearest neighbor search; Statistical tests; Supervised learning; Canopy decisive factor; Formally trained trees; K-nearest neighbours; Principal Components; Tree machines; Principal component analysis",Article,Scopus

To generate an NDVI map, a relatively high-cost multispectral sensor is required; but currently, most UAVs are equipped with low-cost RGB cameras. For that reason, other indices that utilize RGB data have been developed to generate maps similar to NDVI and minimize the data acquisition cost, such as the triangular greenness index (TGI) and the visible atmospheric resistant index (VARI). However, several studies found that these indices cannot be recommended as reliable general-purpose crop health indicators. This study utilizes a genetic algorithm to develop a new visible index (visible NDVI; vNDVI) that estimates NDVI values of vegetation from uncalibrated RGB cameras mounted on UAVs (or other remote sensing platforms). Three experiments were conducted to create and validate the proposed index. First, the NDVI values generated from a multispectral camera were compared with the NDVI values generated by a hyperspectral camera. In the second experiment, the vNDVI formula was created using a genetic algorithm. The third experiment validates the proposed vNDVI, generated from two uncalibrated RGB cameras, in three different crops (citrus, grapes, and sugarcane). The proposed vNDVI proved to be highly accurate on estimating NDVI values by just using RGB cameras, with an overall mean percentage error of 6.89% and a mean average error of 0.052 in all three crops, providing a low-cost alternative for remote sensing and plant phenotyping. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Big data; Genetic algorithm; Hyperspectral; Multispectral; NDVI; RGB; Vegetation index","Big data; Cameras; Costs; Crops; Data acquisition; Genetic algorithms; Vegetation; Hyper-spectral cameras; HyperSpectral; Multi-spectral; Multi-spectral cameras; NDVI; Normalized difference vegetation index; Remote sensing platforms; Vegetation index; Remote sensing; data acquisition; estimation method; experimental study; genetic algorithm; index method; NDVI; sensor; visible spectrum; Citrus; Vitaceae",Article,Scopus

The productivity of tree crops such as almond orchards, is particularly complex. To understand and mitigate these threats requires a collection of multi-layer large data sets, and advanced analytics is also critical to integrate these highly heterogeneous datasets to generate insights about the key constraints on the yields at tree and field scales. Here we used a machine learning approach to investigate the determinants of almond yield variation in California’s almond orchards, based on a unique 10-year dataset of field measurements of light interception and almond yield along with meteorological data. We found that overall the maximum almond yield was highly dependent on light interception, e.g., with each one percent increase in light interception resulting in an increase of 57.9 lbs/acre in the potential yield. Light interception was highest for mature sites with higher long term mean spring incoming solar radiation (SRAD), and lowest for younger orchards when March maximum temperature was lower than 19°C. However, at any given level of light interception, actual yield often falls significantly below full yield potential, driven mostly by tree age, temperature profiles in June and winter, summer mean daily maximum vapor pressure deficit (VPDmax), and SRAD. Utilizing a full random forest model, 82% (±1%) of yield variation could be explained when using a sixfold cross validation, with a RMSE of 480 ± 9 lbs/acre. When excluding light interception from the predictors, overall orchard characteristics (such as age, location, and tree density) and inclusive meteorological variables could still explain 78% of yield variation. The model analysis also showed that warmer winter conditions often limited mature orchards from reaching maximum yield potential and summer VPDmax beyond 40 hPa significantly limited the yield. Our findings through the machine learning approach improved our understanding of the complex interaction between climate, canopy light interception, and almond nut production, and demonstrated a relatively robust predictability of almond yield. This will ultimately benefit data-driven climate adaptation and orchard nutrient management approaches. © Copyright © 2020 Jin, Chen, Lampinen and Brown.","artificial intelligence; big data; light interceptioon; nutrient management; Prunus dulcis; yield gap",,Article,Scopus

Pakistan has its GDP based on agriculture, however it relies on manual monitoring of crops, which is a labour intensive and ineffective method. In contrast to this, several cutting edge technology-based solutions are being employed in the developed countries to enhance the crop yield with the optimal use of resources. To this end, we have proposed an integrated approach for monitoring crop health using IoT, machine learning and drone technology. The integration of these sensing modalities generate heterogeneous data which not only varies in nature (i.e. observed parameter) but also has different temporal fidelity. The spatial resolution of these methods is also different, hence, the optimal integration of these sensing modalities and their implementation in practice are addressed in the proposed system. In our proposed solution, the IoT sensors provide the real-time status of environmental parameters impacting the crop, and the drone platform provide the multispectral data used for generating Vegetation Indices (VIs) such as Normalized Difference vegetation Index (NDVI) for analyzing the crop health. The NDVI provides information about the crop based on the chlorophyll content, which offers limited information regarding the crop health. In order to obtain a rich and detailed knowledge about crop health, the variable length time series data of IoT sensors and multispectral images were converted to a fixed-sized representation to generate crop health maps. A number of machine and deep learning algorithms were applied on the collected data wherein deep neural network with two hidden layers was found to be the most optimal model among all the selected models, providing an accuracy of (98.4%). Further, the health maps were validated through ground surveys and by agriculture experts due to the absence of reference data. The proposed research is basically an indigenous, technology based agriculture solution capable of providing important insights into the crop health by extracting complementary features from multi-modal data set, and minimizing the crop ground survey effort, particularly useful when the agriculture land is large in size. © 2013 IEEE.","crop health; Internet of Things (IoT); NDVI; precision agriculture","Agricultural robots; Crops; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Drones; Health; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Modal analysis; Multilayer neural networks; Remote sensing; Surveys; Vegetation; Chlorophyll contents; Complementary features; Cutting edge technology; Environmental parameter; Internet of Things (IOT); Multi-modal approach; Multispectral images; Normalized difference vegetation index; Internet of things",Article,Scopus

These discrepancies have an economic cost for the company (e.g. waste disposal), as well as an environmental impact (food waste and increased carbon footprint). This research aims to develop tools based on data analytics to predict the magnitude of these discrepancies, improving enterprise profitability while, at the same time, reducing environmental impact aiding food waste management. A food company that produces liquid products based on fruits and vegetables was analyzed. Data was gathered on 1,795 batches, including the characteristics of the product (recipe, components used…) and the difference between the input and the output weight. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were used to predict deviations in production, reducing uncertainties related to the amount of waste produced. The ML models had greater predictive capacity than a linear model with stepwise parameter selection. Then, uncertainty is included in the predictions using a normal distribution based on the residuals of the model. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that ML models can be used as a tool to identify possible production anomalies. This research shows innovative ways to deal with uncertainty in production planning using modern methods in the field of operation research. These tools improve classical methods and provide production managers with valuable information to assess the economic benefits of improved machinery or process controls. As a consequence, accurate predictive models can potentially improve the profitability of food companies, also reducing their environmental impact. © 2020 The Authors","Empirical study; Output uncertainty; Production planning; Sustainability; Waste management",,Article,Scopus

Therefore, alternative options are needed to be developed to mitigate the dangers associated with crop failure due to prevalence of disease and changing weather conditions that causes drought and loss of fertility in arable lands. Furthermore, It is also important to identify commercialisation potential of underutilised crops apart from biophysical and land qualities. The economic and demographic characteristics of an area which is conducive for normal commercial crops can be used to benchmark commercialisation potentials for underutilised crops. Hence, this project aims to assess the commercialisation possibility of underutilised crops on a large scale for under-developed areas with currently no possibility of growing commercial crops probably due to climate, soil characteristics. Support Vector Machine (SVM) method was implemented in conjunction with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and associated fitness functions to generate training data from approximate models which was developed for normal cash crops. The results showed that accurate classifications are obtainable even when the training is done with data from approximate and artificially generated data through implementation of a Genetic algorithm which includes constraints that reflect physical conditions found in rural villages. The simulation results showed that SVM is capable of acting as a filter for the inaccuracy in training data which is inherently present in the approximate models, thus allowing for better classification to be done on training data.

Traditional approaches separately evaluate variable performance, which may lead to an inappropriate selection of physics parameterization combinations. Besides traditional approaches, we suggest an additional selection approach by considering the joint dependence structure (covariance structure) between key meteorological variables, i.e., precipitation P and temperature T. This is accomplished by empirical P and T copula functions and the X2-test, and is demonstrated in two locations in Kenya with different major precipitation processes. It is shown that the selection based on traditional approaches alone may lead to nonoptimal decisions in terms of joint dependence structure between P and T. It was found that the copula-based approach may reduce the need for complex multivariate bias correction, as demonstrated using local intensity scaling for P and linear scaling for T. The new approach may contribute to improving RCM and ESM simulations and climate-impact studies worldwide. © 2019 by the authors.

Accurate tracking and quantification of wildfires are important for climate modeling and ecological studies in this region. Remote sensing platforms (e.g., MODIS, Landsat) are valuable tools for mapping wildfire events (burned or burning areas) in Alaska. Deep neural networks (DNN) have exhibited superior performance in many classification problems, such as high-dimensional remote sensing data. Detection of wildfires is an imbalanced classification problem where one class contains a much smaller or larger sample size, and performance of DNNs can decline. We take a known weight-selection strategy during DNN training and apply those weights to MODIS variables (e.g., NDVI, surface reflectance) for binary classification (i.e., wildfire or no-wildfire) across Alaska during the 2004 wildfire year, when Alaska experienced a record number of large wildfires. The method splits the input training data into subsets, one for training the DNN to update weights and the other for performance validation to select the weights based on the best validation-loss score. This approach was applied to two sampled datasets, such as where the no-wildfire class can significantly outweigh the wildfire class. The normal DNN training strategy was unable to map wildfires for the highly imbalanced dataset; however, the weight-selection strategy was able to map wildfires very accurately (0.96 recall score for 78,702 wildfire pixels (500 × 500 m)). © 2018 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Imbalanced Classification; MODIS; Wildfire","Climate change; Data mining; Deep learning; Fires; Mapping; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Binary classification; Imbalanced classification; Imbalanced Data-sets; MODIS; Performance validation; Remote sensing data; Remote sensing platforms; Wildfire; Deep neural networks",Conference Paper,Scopus

In Sahelian countries, irregular spatial and temporal rainfall distribution remains a threat for rainfed agriculture despite the use of a wide range of techniques for soil conservation. Objectives. To analyze several irrigation strategies for rainfed crops and to assess the likely economic incentives to support the adoption of supplemental irrigation from farm ponds in response to dry spells. Method. The supplemental irrigation strategies and economic incentives were analyzed using an applied bio-economic model in a typical farm. Results. The simulations showed that supplemental irrigation from small individual ponds would increase farmers’ income compared to the situation without irrigation. Maize, sorghum and millet production under supplemental irrigation in a dry year would increase expected income by 26.49% (133,030 CFA francs equivalent to 202.80 euros) compared to the situation without irrigation. Simulations with incentives to promote supplemental irrigation focused on four subsidy modalities and the introduction of a credit system for agricultural households. Conclusions. Of the incentives studied, the food-for-work subsidy to mobilize labor for basin building seems particularly suitable for scaling-up supplemental irrigation. © 2019 FAC UNIV SCIENCES AGRONOMIQUES GEMBLOUX.

This dataset was obtained using the cumulative distribution function transform (CDF-t) method, a method that has been applied to several regions and contexts but never to Africa. Here CDF-t has been applied over the period 1950-2099 combining Historical runs and climate change scenarios for six variables: precipitation, mean near-surface air temperature, near-surface maximum air temperature, near-surface minimum air temperature, surface downwelling shortwave radiation, and wind speed, which are critical variables for agricultural purposes. WFDEI has been used as the reference dataset to correct the GCMs. Evaluation of the results over West Africa has been carried out on a list of priority user-based metrics that were discussed and selected with stakeholders. It includes simulated yield using a crop model simulating maize growth. These bias-corrected GCM data have been compared with another available dataset of bias-corrected GCMs using WATCH Forcing Data as the reference dataset. The impact of WFD, WFDEI, and also EWEMBI reference datasets has been also examined in detail. It is shown that CDF-t is very effective at removing the biases and reducing the high inter-GCM scattering. Differences with other bias-corrected GCM data are mainly due to the differences among the reference datasets. This is particularly true for surface downwelling shortwave radiation, which has a significant impact in terms of simulated maize yields. Projections of future yields over West Africa are quite different, depending on the bias-correction method used. However all these projections show a similar relative decreasing trend over the 21st century. © Author(s) 2018.",,"Agriculture; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Distribution functions; Wind; Agricultural impacts; Agricultural purpose; Bias-correction methods; Climate change scenarios; Cumulative distribution function; Global climate model; Near surface air temperature; Short-wave radiation; Climate models; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

A vegetation index (VI) derived from an aerially observed multispectral image (MSI) can quantify crop health, moisture and nutrient content. However, due to the high cost of multispectral sensors, alternate, low-cost solutions have lately received great interest. We present a novel method for model-based estimation of a VI using RGB color images. The non-linear spatio-spectral relationship between the RGB image of vegetation and the index computed by its corresponding MSI is learned through deep neural networks. The learned models can be used to estimate VI of a crop segment. Results: Analysis of images obtained in wheat breeding trials show that the aerially observed VI was highly correlated with ground-measured VI. In addition, VI estimates based on RGB images were highly correlated with VI deduced from MSIs. Spatial, spectral and temporal information of images contributed to estimation of VI. Both intra-variety and inter-variety differences were preserved by estimated VI. However, VI estimates were reliable until just before significant appearance of senescence. Conclusion: The proposed approach validates that it is reasonable to accurately estimate VI using deep neural networks. The results prove that RGB images contain sufficient information for VI estimation. It demonstrates that low-cost VI measurement is possible with standard RGB cameras. © 2018 The Author(s).","Deep learning; Phenotyping; Precision agriculture; Wheat",,Article,Scopus

In this study, freshwater provisioning was quantified annually from 1995 to 2013 for 13 watersheds in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). Results showed that the annual freshwater provision indices for all watersheds were less than one indicating that freshwater provisioning is diminished in the UMRB. The concentrations of sediment and nutrients (total nitrogen, and total phosphorus) are the most sensitive factors that impact freshwater provisioning in the UMRB. A significant linear relationship was observed between precipitation and freshwater provisioning index. During wet periods freshwater provisioning generally decreased in the study watersheds, primarily because of relatively high concentrations and loads of sediment and nutrients delivered from nonpoint sources.

In many countries, but particularly in developing countries such as South Africa, standardized methodological frameworks that deliver comparable results across large areas as a baseline for regional scale monitoring are absent. Due to limitations of scale at which techniques can be applied and erosion processes assessed, this study describes a multi-process and multi-scale approach for soil erosion risk assessment under South African conditions. The framework includes assessment of sheet-rill erosion at a national scale based on the principles and components defined in the Universal Soil Loss Equation; gully erosion in a large catchment located in the Eastern Cape Province by integrating 11 important factors into a GIS; and sediment migration for a research catchment near Wartburg in KwaZulu-Natal by means of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool. Three hierarchical levels are presented in the framework, illustrating the most feasible erosion assessment techniques and input datasets that are required for application at a regional scale with proper incorporation of the most important erosion contributing factors. The methodological framework is not interpreted as a single assessment technique but rather as an approach that guides the selection of appropriate techniques and datasets according to scale dependency and modelled complexity of the erosion processes. © 2013 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography.","Methodological framework; Risk assessment; South Africa; Water erosion","agricultural intensification; anthropogenic effect; catchment; climate change; developing world; GIS; gully erosion; hierarchical system; methodology; risk assessment; sediment transport; soil erosion; Universal Soil Loss Equation; water erosion; Eastern Cape; South Africa",Article,Scopus

Here, we have applied the process-based crop model SARRA-H calibrated and validated over multi-year field trials and surveys at eight contrasting sites in terms of climate and agricultural practices in Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. The model gives a reasonable correlation with observed yields of sorghum and millet under a range of cultivars and traditional crop management practices. We applied the model to more than 7000 simulations of yields of sorghum and millet for 35 stations across West Africa and under very different future climate conditions. We took into account 35 possible climate scenarios by combining precipitation anomalies from -20% to 20% and temperature anomalies from +0 to +6 °C. We found that most of the 35 scenarios (31/35) showed a negative impact on yields, up to -41% for +6 °C/ - 20% rainfall. Moreover, the potential future climate impacts on yields are very different from those recorded in the recent past. This is because of the increasingly adverse role of higher temperatures in reducing crop yields, irrespective of rainfall changes. When warming exceeds +2 °C, negative impacts caused by temperature rise cannot be counteracted by any rainfall change. The probability of a yield reduction appears to be greater in the Sudanian region (southern Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, northern Togo and Benin), because of an exacerbated sensitivity to temperature changes compared to the Sahelian region (Niger, Mali, northern parts of Senegal and Burkina Faso), where crop yields are more sensitive to rainfall change. Finally, our simulations show that the photoperiod-sensitive traditional cultivars of millet and sorghum used by local farmers for centuries seem more resilient to future climate conditions than modern cultivars bred for their high yield potential (-28% versus -40% for the +4 °C/ - 20% scenario). Photoperiod-sensitive cultivars counteract the effect of temperature increase on shortening cultivar duration and thus would likely avoid the need to shift to cultivars with a greater thermal time requirement. However, given the large difference in mean yields of the modern versus traditional varieties, the modern varieties would still yield more under optimal fertility conditions in a warmer world, even if they are more affected by climate change. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.","agriculture; climate change; impacts; West Africa","Agriculture; Climate models; Computer simulation; Crops; Plants (botany); Rain; Agricultural practices; Climate change impact; Crop management practices; Effect of temperature; impacts; Precipitation anomalies; Sensitivity to temperatures; West Africa; Climate change; agricultural management; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; cultivar; management practice; millet; model validation; savanna; sorghum; West Africa",Article,Scopus

Both increased corn growth for ethanol production and perennial dedicated energy crop growth for cellulosic feedstocks are potential sources to meet the rising demand for biofuels. However, these measures may cause adverse environmental consequences that are not yet fully understood. This study 1) evaluates the long-term impacts of increased frequency of corn in the crop rotation system on water quantity and quality as well as soil fertility in the James River Basin and 2) identifies potential grasslands for cultivating bioenergy crops (e.g. switchgrass), estimating the water quality impacts. We selected the soil and water assessment tool, a physically based multidisciplinary model, as the modeling approach to simulate a series of biofuel production scenarios involving crop rotation and land cover changes. The model simulations with different crop rotation scenarios indicate that decreases in water yield and soil nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration along with an increase in NO3-N load to stream water could justify serious concerns regarding increased corn rotations in this basin. Simulations with land cover change scenarios helped us spatially classify the grasslands in terms of biomass productivity and nitrogen loads, and we further derived the relationship of biomass production targets and the resulting nitrogen loads against switchgrass planting acreages. The suggested economically efficient (planting acreage) and environmentally friendly (water quality) planting locations and acreages can be a valuable guide for cultivating switchgrass in this basin.

However, different stakeholders in the agri-food sector require different levels of accuracy and lead times in which a yield prediction should be available. For the producers, predictions during the growing season are essential to ensure that information is available early enough for the timely implementation of agronomic decisions, while industries can wait until later in the season to optimize their production process and increase their production traceability. In this study, we used machine learning algorithms, dynamic and static predictors, and a phenology approach to determine the time for issuing the yield prediction. In addition, the effect of data reduction was evaluated by comparing results obtained with and without principal component analysis (PCA). Gaussian process regression (GPR) was the best for predicting maize yield. Its best performance (nRMSE of 13.31%) was obtained late in the season and with the full set of predictors (vegetation indices, meteorological and soil predictors). In contrast, neural network (NNET) and support vector machines linear basis function (SVMl) achieved their best accuracy with only vegetation indices and at the tasseling phenological stage. Only slight differences in performance were observed between the algorithms considered, highlighting that the main factors influencing performance are the timing of the yield prediction and the predictors with which the machine learning algorithms are fed. Interestingly, PCA was instrumental in increasing the performances of NNET after this stage. An additional benefit of the application of PCA was the overall reduction between 12 and 30.20% in the standard deviation of the maize yield prediction performance from the leave one-year outer-loop cross-validation, depending on the feature set. © 2022 by the authors.","dimensionality reduction; machine learning; multi-source data; phenology; Sentinel-2; yield prediction","Data reduction; Food supply; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Supply chains; Support vector machines; Vegetation; Dimensionality reduction; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Maize yield; Multisource data; Performance; Phenology; Principal-component analysis; Sentinel-2; Yield prediction; Principal component analysis",Article,Scopus

Merr.) is a leguminous and oil crop with rapidly growing importance and demand in Africa following the increasing demand for oil and livestock and poultry feed in sub-Saharan Africa. However, soybean productivity is low in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa, especially in West Africa, where productivity is below one ton per ha. Hence, concerted soybean varietal development and testing efforts have been underway by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), collaborating with the various African and US-based soybean breeding programs. Integrating new varietal evaluation approaches based on advanced phenotyping techniques into IITA's soybean breeding program is crucial for designing efficient crop genetic improvement techniques. Hence, this work aims to investigate machine learning (ML) models and Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAVs) to aid rapid high throughput phenotypic workflow for soybean yield estimation. We acquired multispectral images through a Sequoia® camera aboard a senseFly eBee X UAV from five variety trials during the 2020 growing season in Nigeria. UAV-based spectral bands, canopy height, vegetation indices (VI), and texture features were generated by gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and integrated to predict crop grain yield using five machine learning (ML) regression models, including Cubist, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Stochastic Gradient Boosting (GBM), Support vector machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). The main findings are the textural information generated using gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) slightly outperformed predictors based mainly on vegetation indices (VI) and provided a promising alternative to the conventional use of VI in crop yield estimation. All the five ML models performed moderately well in predicting grain yield for all the soybean trials investigated, though the Cubist and RF model stood out, with R2 reaching 0.89. The study provides a framework to perform crop breeding trial assessments more effectively and consistently at high spatial scales that African crop breeding programs did not commonly apply. The workflow can also be successfully modified and applied for high throughput phenotyping of breeding platforms in other crops. © 2022 The Authors","Gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM); Machine learning models; Soybean; Vegetation indices; Yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

The mechanisms of action are complex and interwoven, making it difficult to identify relevant management and adaptation options. The present study uses random forests to investigate such highly non-linear systems for predicting yield anomalies in winter wheat at district levels in Germany. In order to take into account sub-seasonality, monthly features are used that explicitly take soil moisture into account in addition to extreme meteorological events. Clustering is used to show spatially different damage potentials, such as a higher susceptibility to drought damage from May to July in eastern Germany compared to the rest of the country. In addition, relevant heat effects are not detected if the clusters are not sufficiently defined. The variable with the highest importance is soil moisture in March, where higher soil moisture has a detrimental effect on crop yields. In general, soil moisture explains more yield variations than the meteorological variables. The approach has proven to be suitable for explaining historical extreme yield anomalies for years with exceptionally high losses (2003, 2018) and gains (2014) and the spatial distribution of these anomalies. The highest test R-squared (R2) is about 0.68. Furthermore, the sensitivity of yield variations to soil moisture and extreme meteorological conditions, as shown by the visualization of average marginal effects, contributes to the promotion of targeted decision support systems. © 2021 Michael Peichl et al.",,"Crops; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Linear systems; Machine learning; Sensitivity analysis; Agricultural productions; Clusterings; Machine learning methods; Mechanism of action; Non linear system; Non-linear damages; Seasonality; Spectra's; Winter wheat; Winter wheat yields; Soil moisture; assessment method; crop yield; machine learning; soil moisture; soil water; wheat; Germany",Article,Scopus

Abstract: Predicting phenotypes from genetic (G), environmental (E), and management (M) conditions is a long-standing challenge with implications to agriculture, medicine, and conservation. Most methods reduce the factors in a dataset (feature engineering) in a subjective and potentially oversimplified manner. Deep neural networks such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MPL) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can overcome this by allowing the data itself to determine which factors are most important. CNN models were developed for predicting agronomic yield from a combination of replicated trials and historical yield survey data. The results were more accurate than standard methods when tested on held-out G, E, and M data (r = 0.50 vs. r = 0.43), and performed slightly worse than standard methods when only G was held out (r = 0.74 vs. r = 0.80). Pre-training on historical data increased accuracy compared to trial data alone.

Parameter estimation is challenging, especially for time-dependent parameters such as cultivar parameters with 2–3 years of lifespan. Manual calibration of the parameters is time-consuming, requires expertise, and is prone to error. This research develops a new automated framework to estimate time-dependent parameters for crop models using a parallel Bayesian optimization algorithm. This approach integrates the power of optimization and machine learning with prior agronomic knowledge. To test the proposed time-dependent parameter estimation method, we simulated historical yield increase (from 1985 to 2018) in 25 environments in the US Corn Belt with APSIM. Then we compared yield simulation results and nine parameter estimates from our proposed parallel Bayesian framework, with Bayesian optimization and manual calibration. Results indicated that parameters calibrated using the proposed framework achieved an 11.6% reduction in the prediction error over Bayesian optimization and a 52.1% reduction over manual calibration. We also trained nine machine learning models for yield prediction and found that none of them was able to outperform the proposed method in terms of root mean square error and R2. The most significant contribution of the new automated framework for time-dependent parameter estimation is its capability to find close-to-optimal parameters for the crop model. The proposed approach also produced explainable insight into cultivar traits’ trends over 34 years (1985–2018). © 2021, The Author(s).",,"algorithm; article; calibration; crop; cultivar; machine learning; nonhuman; prediction; simulation",Article,Scopus

Crop phenotyping may assist in identifying cultivars tolerant to soil sodicity. However, studies to identify the most appropriate traits and reliable tools to assist crop phenotyping on sodic soil are limited. Hence, this study evaluated the ability of multispectral, hyperspectral, 3D point cloud, and machine learning techniques to improve estimation of biomass and grain yield of wheat genotypes grown on a moderately sodic (MS) and highly sodic (HS) soil sites in northeastern Australia. While a number of studies have reported using different remote sensing approaches and crop traits to quantify crop growth, stress, and yield variation, studies are limited using the combination of these techniques including machine learning to improve estimation of genotypic biomass and yield, especially in constrained sodic soil environments. At close to flowering, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and ground-based proximal sensing was used to obtain remote and/or proximal sensing data, while biomass yield and crop heights were also manually measured in the field. Grain yield was machine-harvested at maturity. UAV remote and/or proximal sensing-derived spectral vegetation indices (VIs), such as normalized difference vegetation index, optimized soil adjusted vegetation index, and enhanced vegetation index and crop height were closely corresponded to wheat genotypic biomass and grain yields. UAV multispectral VIs more closely associated with biomass and grain yields compared to proximal sensing data. The red-green-blue (RGB) 3D point cloud technique was effective in determining crop height, which was slightly better correlated with genotypic biomass and grain yield than ground-measured crop height data. These remote sensing-derived crop traits (VIs and crop height) and wheat biomass and grain yields were further simulated using machine learning algorithms (multitarget linear regression, support vector machine regression, Gaussian process regression, and artificial neural network) with different kernels to improve estimation of biomass and grain yield. The artificial neural network predicted biomass yield (R2 = 0.89; RMSE = 34.8 g/m2 for the MS and R2 = 0.82; RMSE = 26.4 g/m2 for the HS site) and grain yield (R2 = 0.88; RMSE = 11.8 g/m2 for the MS and R2 = 0.74; RMSE = 16.1 g/m2 for the HS site) with slightly less error than the others. Wheat genotypes Mitch, Corack, Mace, Trojan, Lancer, and Bremer were identified as more tolerant to sodic soil constraints than Emu Rock, Janz, Flanker, and Gladius.

The combination of their high temporal frequency with their extended geographical coverage generally associated with low costs per area unit makes these images a convenient choice at both national and regional scales. Several qualitative and quantitative approaches can be clearly distinguished, going from the use of low resolution satellite imagery as the main predictor of final crop yield to complex crop growth models where remote sensing-derived indicators play different roles, depending on the nature of the model and on the availability of data measured on the ground. Vegetation performance anomaly detection with low resolution images continues to be a fundamental component of early warning and drought monitoring systems at the regional scale.

Experimental results on datasets of different plant species demonstrate the potential of the proposed self-supervised framework in achieving effective and generalizable leaf segmentation. © 2022","Cannabis; Color correction; Convolutional neural networks; Image-based plant phenotyping; Leaf segmentation; Self-supervised learning","Color; Color image processing; Complex networks; Convolutional neural networks; Iterative methods; Semantics; Superpixels; Supervised learning; Cannabis; Colour corrections; Convolutional neural network; Image-based; Image-based plant phenotyping; Leaf segmentation; Plant phenotyping; Segmentation models; Self-supervised learning; Semantic segmentation; Semantic Segmentation",Article,Scopus

The results of traditional detection methods are accurate, but the sampling cost is high and has a hysteresis, which makes it difficult to measure cotton fiber quality parameters in real time and at a large scale. The purpose of this study is to use time-series UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) multispectral and RGB remote sensing images combined with machine learning to model four main quality indicators of cotton fibers. A deep learning algorithm is used to identify and extract cotton boll pixels in remote sensing images and improve the accuracy of quantitative extraction of spectral features. In order to simplify the input parameters of the model, the stepwise sensitivity analysis method is used to eliminate redundant variables and obtain the optimal input feature set. The results of this study show that the R2 of the prediction model established by a neural network is improved by 29.67% compared with the model established by linear regression. When the spectral index is calculated after removing the soil pixels used for prediction, R2 is improved by 4.01% compared with the ordinary method. The prediction model can well predict the average length, uniformity index, and micronaire value of the upper half. R2 is 0.8250, 0.8014, and 0.7722, respectively. This study provides a method to predict the cotton fiber quality in a large area without manual sampling, which provides a new idea for variety breeding and commercial decision-making in the cotton industry. © 2023 by the authors.","cotton fiber quality; inversion; semantic segmentation; UAV remote sensing","Antennas; Decision making; Deep learning; Forecasting; Image enhancement; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Pixels; Remote sensing; Semantics; Sensitivity analysis; Time series; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Cotton fiber quality; Inversion; Machine-learning; Prediction modelling; Remote sensing images; Remote-sensing; Semantic segmentation; Times series; Unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing; Cotton",Article,Scopus

The comprehensive capabilities of Big Data (BD) can help in tackling the uncertainty of food supply occurs due to several factors such as soil erosion, water pollution, climate change, socio-cultural growth, governmental regulations, and market fluctuations. Crop identification and monitoring plays a vital role in modern agriculture. Although several machine learning models have been utilized in identifying crops, the performance of ensemble learning has not been investigated extensively. The massive volume of satellite imageries has been established as a big data problem forcing to deploy the proposed solution using big data technologies to manage, store, analyze, and visualize satellite data.

The exploration of key growth phases and features is beneficial to improving the efficiency and accuracy of yield prediction. In this study, a hybrid approach using the WOFOST model and deep learning was developed to forecast corn yield, which analysed yield prediction potential at different growth phases and features. The World Food Studies (WOFOST) model was used to build a comprehensive simulated dataset by inputting meteorological, soil, crop and management data. Different feature combinations at various growth phases were designed to forecast yield using machine learning and deep learning methods. The results show that the key features of corn’s vegetative growth stage and reproductive growth stage were growth state features and water-related features, respectively. With the continuous advancement of the crop growth stage, the ability to predict yield continued to improve. Especially after entering the reproductive growth stage, corn kernels begin to form, and the yield prediction performance is significantly improved. The performance of the optimal yield prediction model in flowering (R2 = 0.53, RMSE = 554.84 kg/ha, MRE = 8.27%), in milk maturity (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 268.76 kg/ha, MRE = 4.01%), and in maturity (R2 = 0.98, RMSE = 102.65 kg/ha, MRE = 1.53%) were given. Thus, our method improves the accuracy of yield prediction, and provides reliable analysis results for predicting yield at various growth phases, which is helpful for farmers and governments in agricultural decision making. This can also be applied to yield prediction for other crops, which is of great value to guide agricultural production. © 2023 by the authors.","corn yield prediction; deep learning; growth phase; WOFOST",,Article,Scopus

Exploiting agricultural Big Data will help to extract valuable information. However, designing and implementing a large scale agricultural data warehouse are very challenging. The data warehouse is a key module to build a smart crop system to make proficient agronomy recommendations.

However, it is quite difficult to build such systems owing to the lack of data imbalance problems and large number of classes. To solve these issues, we propose a transfer learning-based technique in which we use Efficient-Net, which is pre-trained on ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on QuT Fish Database, which is a large scale dataset. Furthermore, prior to the activation layer, we use Global Average Pooling (GAP) instead of dense layer with the aim of averaging the results of predictions along with having more information compared to the dense layer. To check the validity of our model, we validate our model on the validation set which achieves satisfactory results. Also, for the localization task, we propose an architecture that consists of localization aware block, which captures localization information for better prediction and residual connections to handle the over-fitting problem. Actually, the residual connections help the layer to combine missing information with the relevant one. In addition, we use class weights and Focal Loss (FL) to handle class imbalance problems along with reducing false predictions. Actually, class weights assign less weights to classes having fewer instances and large weights to classes having more number of instances.

Thus, seasonal forecasts of precipitation and temperature are an essential tool for stakeholders to make timely choices regarding the strategies required to maximize their expected cereal yield outcomes. The availability of state-of-the-art seasonal forecasts such as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) system 5 (SEAS5) may be an asset to help decision making. However, uncertainties and reduced skill may hamper the use of seasonal forecasts in several applications. Hence, in this work, we aim to understand the added value of such dynamical forecasts when compared to persistent anomalies of climate conditions used to predict the production of wheat and barley yields. With that in mind, empirical models relating annual wheat and barley yields in Spain to monthly values of precipitation and temperature are developed by taking advantage of ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis. Then, dynamical and persistence forecasts are issued at different lead times, and the skill of the subsequent forecasted yield is verified through probabilistic metrics. The results presented in this study demonstrate two different outcomes: (1) wheat and barley yield anomaly forecasts (dynamical and persistent) start to gain skill later in the season (typically from April onwards); and (2) the added value of using the SEAS5 forecast as an alternative to persistence ranges from 6 to 16%, with better results in the southern Spanish regions. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"article; cereal; climate; harvest; human; nonhuman; plant yield; precipitation; season; skill; Spain; uncertainty; weather; wheat; food grain; forecasting; temperature; weather; Edible Grain; Forecasting; Seasons; Temperature; Triticum; Weather",Article,Scopus

Thus, it is an important and urgent task for crop breeders to find the freezing-tolerant rapeseed materials in the process of breeding. Existing large-scale freezing-tolerant rapeseed material recognition methods mainly rely on the field investigation conducted by the agricultural experts using some professional equipments. These methods are time-consuming, inefficient and laborious. In addition, the accuracy of these traditional methods depends heavily on the knowledge and experience of the experts. Methods: To solve these problems of existing methods, we propose a low-cost freezing-tolerant rapeseed material recognition approach using deep learning and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images captured by a consumer UAV. We formulate the problem of freezing-tolerant material recognition as a binary classification problem, which can be solved well using deep learning. The proposed method can automatically and efficiently recognize the freezing-tolerant rapeseed materials from a large number of crop candidates. To train the deep learning network, we first manually construct the real dataset using the UAV images of rapeseed materials captured by the DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2.0. Then, five classic deep learning networks (AlexNet, VGGNet16, ResNet18, ResNet50 and GoogLeNet) are selected to perform the freezing-tolerant rapeseed material recognition. Result and conclusion: The accuracy of the five deep learning networks used in our work is all over 92%. Especially, ResNet50 provides the best accuracy (93.33%) in this task. In addition, we also compare deep learning networks with traditional machine learning methods. The comparison results show that the deep learning-based methods significantly outperform the traditional machine learning-based methods in our task.

With an expanding base of dynamic customer demands and the adoption of multiple technological advancements, there is a high possibility that human-centric sales management will be transformed into a fully automated form aimed at increasing productivity and being able to cater to effectively a broader customer base. A review of the relevant literature demonstrates that machine learning is one of the most prevalent techniques in analytics for predicting sales behaviour. However, SESaaS includes many features beyond the sales component. Internet-of-Things (IoT) can additionally be used for networking and data analytics to enrich sales data. Therefore, the proposed scheme introduces a novel SESaaS model capable of balancing the sales team’s needs with those of the customers to maximise profits. The proposed model also presents a novel learning scheme in the IoT environment that aids in projecting the service quality score to the final customer, thereby positively influencing the customer to pay a service fee for a superior and desired quality of experience. Unlike any existing sales management scheme, the proposed scheme offers a novel research methodology for improving sales enablement practices, emphasising service scalability, and forecasting company profit. In contrast to any existing system for sales management, the proposed scheme provides greater accuracy, higher service quality, and faster response time in its predictive strategy for projecting the cost of the adoption of SESaaS, which is not reported in any existing studies. In an extensive testing environment, it is determined that the proposed scheme achieves accuracy and service quality of approximately 98.75% and 92.91%, respectively.

First, the features were retrieved using the Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2, and Landsat-8 imagery. Then, training data and various feature selection algorithms including recursive feature elimination (RFE), random forest (RF), and Boruta were used for optimal feature selection. Various classifiers, including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and RF, were implemented to create maps of land crops relying on optimal features and training data. After that, in order to increase the result accuracy, maps of land crops derived from several scenarios were fused using a fusion-based voting strategy at the level of decision, and new maps of land crops and classification uncertainty maps were prepared. Subsequently, the performance of different scenarios was evaluated and compared. Among the feature selection algorithms, RF accuracy was higher than RFE and Boruta.

Out of those techniques, non-invasive yield prediction techniques using computer vision have been proved to be the most efficient and trusted platform. This study developed a novel methodology, called SlypNet, using advanced deep learning networks, i.e., Mask R-CNN and U-Net, which can extract various plant morphological features like spike and spikelet from the visual image of the wheat plant and provide a high-throughput yield estimate with great precision. Mask R-CNN outperformed previous networks in spike detection by its precise detection performance with a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.57%, a F1 score of 0.67, and an MCC of 0.91 by overcoming several natural field constraints like overlapping and background interference, variable resolution, and high bushiness of plants. The spikelet detection module’s accuracy and consistency were tested with about 99% validation accuracy of the model and the least error, i.e., a mean square error of 1.3 from a set of typical and complex views of wheat spikes. Spikelet yield cumulatively showed the probable production capability of each plant.

With the vigorous emergence of remote sensing land surface observations in recent decades, data assimilation methodology has become an effective means to promote the accuracy and efficiency of yield estimation by integrating regional data and point-scale crop models. This paper focuses on the black soil area of Northeast China, a national strategic grain production base, applying the AquaCrop crop growth model to simulate the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and maize yield from 2000 to 2020 and then forming a reliable FVC optimization dataset based on an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) assimilation algorithm with remote sensing products. Using the random forest model, the regression relationship between FVC and yield was established from the long-term time series data, which is crucial to achieve better yield estimation through the optimized FVC. The major findings include the following: (1) The R2 of the assimilated FVC and maize yield can reach 0.557. (2) When compared with the local statistical yield, our method reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) from 1.164 ton/ha (based on GLASS FVC products) to 1.004 ton/ha (based on the calibrated AquaCrop model) and then to 0.888 ton/ha (the result after assimilation). The above results show that we have proposed a yield estimation method to provide accurate yield estimations by combining data assimilation and machine learning. This study provided deep insights into understanding the variations in FVC and revealed the spatially explicit yield prediction ability from the time series land surface parameters, which has significant potential for optimizing water and soil resource management.

Analysis of UAV-derived data with advanced machine learning models could improve real-time management in agricultural systems, but guidance for this integration is currently limited. Here we compare two deep learning-based strategies for early warning detection of crop stress, using multitemporal imagery throughout the growing season to predict field-scale yield in irrigated rice in eastern Arkansas. Both deep learning strategies showed improvements upon traditional statistical learning approaches including linear regression and gradient boosted decision trees. First, we explicitly accounted for variation across developmental stages using a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that captures both spatial and temporal dimensions of UAV images from multiple time points throughout one growing season. 3D-CNNs achieved low prediction error on the test set, with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 8.8% of the mean yield. For the second strategy, a 2D-CNN, we considered only spatial relationships among pixels for image features acquired during a single flyover. 2D-CNNs trained on images from a single day were most accurate when images were taken during booting stage or later, with RMSE ranging from 7.4 to 8.2% of the mean yield. A primary benefit of convolutional autoencoder-like models (based on analyses of prediction maps and feature importance) is the spatial denoising effect that corrects yield predictions for individual pixels based on the values of vegetation index and thermal features for nearby pixels. Our results highlight the promise of convolutional autoencoders for UAV-based yield prediction in rice.

Inadequate application increases the risk of quality and yield losses as well as environmental pollution. Accurate determination of both crops' water and N supply status is essential for an effective management strategy that couples N and water supply, thus accounting for the water–N interaction. In a field experiment with spinach as model crop, hyperspectral reflectance was measured and related to the relative water content (RWC), nitrogen and chlorophyll (Chl) content of leaves indicating plants' supply status. Three statistical methods were applied to estimate plants’ water and N status by reflectance spectroscopy: i) Published Vegetation Indices (VI) for N and water status, ii) Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling - Partial Least Squares Regression (CARS-PLSR) to identify key wavelengths and to build a simple robust model based on full spectra, and iii) inflection points (IP) based on the first and second derivatives. The best model fit for Chl was obtained for VI REIP and IP1. For N, best results were found for mrNDVI and IP1. The estimation of RWC was not significant. Higher Chl content was found in stressed plants due to smaller and thicker leaves. At full water supply, REIP and IP1 as well as CARS-PLSR differentiated N status levels. In water-deficient plants, VIs and IPs successfully detected water stress levels.

The earlier the prediction during the growing season the better. Accurate soybean yield prediction is important for germplasm innovation and planting environment factor improvement. But until now, soybean yield has been determined by weight measurement manually after soybean plant harvest which is time-consuming, has high cost and low precision. This paper proposed a soybean yield in-field prediction method based on bean pods and leaves image recognition using a deep learning algorithm combined with a generalized regression neural network (GRNN). A faster region-convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN), feature pyramid network (FPN), single shot multibox detector (SSD), and You Only Look Once (YOLOv3) were employed for bean pods recognition in which recognition precision and speed were 86.2, 89.8, 80.1, 87.4%, and 13 frames per second (FPS), 7 FPS, 24 FPS, and 39 FPS, respectively. Therefore, YOLOv3 was selected considering both recognition precision and speed. For enhancing detection performance, YOLOv3 was improved by changing IoU loss function, using the anchor frame clustering algorithm, and utilizing the partial neural network structure with which recognition precision increased to 90.3%. In order to improve soybean yield prediction precision, leaves were identified and counted, moreover, pods were further classified as single, double, treble, four, and five seeds types by improved YOLOv3 because each type seed weight varies. In addition, soybean seed number prediction models of each soybean planter were built using PLSR, BP, and GRNN with the input of different type pod numbers and leaf numbers with which prediction results were 96.24, 96.97, and 97.5%, respectively. Finally, the soybean yield of each planter was obtained by accumulating the weight of all soybean pod types and the average accuracy was up to 97.43%. The results show that it is feasible to predict the soybean yield of plants in situ with high precision by fusing the number of leaves and different type soybean pods recognized by a deep neural network combined with GRNN which can speed up germplasm innovation and planting environmental factor optimization.

With the advent of visual media such as images, videos, and GIFs, research on the subject of sentiment analysis has expanded to encompass the study of social interaction and opinion prediction via the use of visuals. Researchers have focused their efforts on understanding social interaction and opinion prediction via the use of images, such as photographs, films, and animated GIFs (graphics interchange formats). The results of various individual studies have resulted in important advancements being achieved in the disciplines of text sentiment analysis and image sentiment analysis. It is recommended that future studies investigate the combination of picture sentiment analysis and text captions in more depth, and further research is necessary for this field. An intermodal analysis technique known as deep learning-based intermodal (DLBI) analysis is discussed in this suggested study, which may be used to show the link between words and pictures in a variety of scenarios. It is feasible to gather opinion information in numerical vector form by using the VGG network. Afterward, the information is transformed into a mapping procedure. It is necessary to predict future views based on the information vectors that have been obtained thus far, and this is accomplished through the use of active deep learning. A series of simulation tests are being conducted to put the proposed mode of operation to the test.

Therefore, developing corn production and accurately estimating corn biomass yield are of great significance to improving people's lives, developing rural economy and climate issues. In this paper, a 3-layer BP neural network model is constructed by using the LM algorithm as the training algorithm of the corn biomass BP network model. From the three aspects of elevation, slope, and aspect, combined with the BP neural network model of corn biomass, the spatial distribution of corn biomass in the study area is analyzed. The results showed that the average biomass per unit area of maize increased with the increase in altitude below 1000 m. There are relatively more human activities in low altitude areas, which are more active in forestry production. The best planting altitude of corn is 0 ∼ 1000 m. When the altitude is higher than 1000 m, the corn biomass gradually decreases. In terms of slope, if the slope is lower than 15°, the biomass of maize increases with the increase in slope. If the slope is lower than 15°, the biomass of maize decreases gradually with the increase in slope. The biomass of maize on sunny slope was higher than that on shady slope. © 2022 Jianjian Chen et al.",,"Neural networks; Remote sensing; Biomass yield; BP neural networks model; Climate issue; Corn production; Higher yield; LM algorithm; Neural-networks; Remote sensing models; Rural economy; Training algorithms; Biomass; biomass; China; human; maize; remote sensing; soil; Biomass; China; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Remote Sensing Technology; Soil; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

From 2003 to 2019, cropland area increased by 9% and cropland NPP by 25%, primarily due to agricultural expansion in Africa and South America. Global cropland expansion accelerated over the past two decades, with a near doubling of the annual expansion rate, most notably in Africa. Half of the new cropland area (49%) replaced natural vegetation and tree cover, indicating a conflict with the sustainability goal of protecting terrestrial ecosystems. From 2003 to 2019, global per-capita cropland area decreased by 10% due to population growth. However, the per-capita annual cropland NPP increased by 3.5% as a result of intensified agricultural land use.

Therefore, the Dubai Emirate began relying on new technology to increase productivity and efficiency. Agriculture applications also depend on accurate land monitoring for timely food security control and support actions. However, traditional monitoring requires field surveys to be performed by experts, which is costly, slow, and rare. Agriculture monitoring systems must be furnished with sustainable land use monitoring solutions, starting with remote sensing using drone surveys for affordable, efficient, and time-sensitive agriculture mapping. Hence, the Dubai Municipality is currently using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to map the farming areas all over the Emirate, support locating lands conducive to cultivation, and create an accurate agriculture database contributing to the decision-making process in determining areas suitable for crop growth. This study used a novel object detection method coupled with geospatial analysis as an integrated workflow to detect individual crops. The UAV flights were executed using a Trimble UX5 (HP) over twelve communities across the Dubai Emirate for six months. Detection methods were applied to high-resolution drone images, consisting of RGB and near-infrared (NIR) bands.

The affected forest area and damage severity exhibited large spatial variations, which were affected by elevation, slope, precipitation and forest type. Our study indicated a larger uncertainty for affected forest area and a smaller uncertainty for the proportion of damage severity, based on multiple assessment approaches.

To accomplish this goal, numerous areas are required for Napier grass plantations. Before introducing crops, the land potential of the country and the impact of crops on the environment should be assessed. The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model is very useful in investigating crop impacts and land potential. Unfortunately, the crop growth parameters of Napier grass are yet to be identified and, thus, conducting effective analysis has not been possible. Accordingly, in this study, parameter calibration and SWAT model validation of Napier grass production in Thailand was carried out using datasets from eight sites with 93 samples. Parameter sensitivity analysis was performed prior to parameter calibration, the results of which suggest that the radiation use efficiency and potential harvested index are both highly sensitive. The crop growth parameters were calibrated in order of their sensitivity index ranking, and the final values were obtained by reducing the root mean square error from 10.77 to 1.38 t·ha−1 . The validation provides satisfactory results with coefficient of determination of 0.951 and a mean error of 0.321 t·ha−1 . Using the developed model and calibrated parameters, local Napier grass dry matter yield can be evaluated accurately. The results reveal that, if only abandoned area in Thailand is used, then Napier grass can provide roughly 33,600–44,900 GWh of annual electricity, and power plant carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions can be reduced by approximately 21.2–28.3 Mt-CO2 . The spatial distribution of estimated yield obtained in this work can be further utilized for land suitability analysis to help identify locations for Napier grass plantations, anaerobic digesters, and biogas power plants. © 2021 by the authors.

Accurate evaluation of weed density is of great significance for field management, especially precision weeding. In this paper, a weed density calculating and mapping method in the field is proposed. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to capture field images. The excess green minus excess red index, combined with the minimum error threshold segmentation method, was used to segment green plants and bare land. A modified U-net was used to segment crops from images. After removing the bare land and crops from the field, images of weeds were obtained. The weed density was evaluated by the ratio of weed area to total area on the segmented image. The accuracy of the green plant segmentation was 93.5%. In terms of crop segmentation, the intersection over union (IoU) was 93.40%, and the segmentation time of a single image was 35.90 ms. Finally, the determination coefficient of the UAV evaluated weed density and the manually observed weed density was 0.94, and the root mean square error was 0.03. With the proposed method, the weed density of a field can be effectively evaluated from UAV images, hence providing critical information for precision weeding. © 2021 by the authors.

The study area is located in the Little Hungarian Plain, including the former swamp basins of Hanság and Tóköz in Hungary. The vegetation survey data were evaluated by statistical methods (TWINSPAN method), and vegetation maps of the areas were prepared. Topsoil samples near the relevés were gathered for further laboratory tests. Soil profiles were opened by a Pürckhauer soil sampler for on-site description of the soil horizons and classification. Surface models provided a base for the preparation of contour maps that could be compared with the vegetation pattern. We found that of the two dominant vegetation types, mesotrophic wet meadows were associated with Mollic Gleysols, while non-tussock sedge beds were associated with Histic Gleysols. At the transitions of the two soil classes, the subgroup of non-tussock sedge beds is the dominant type. The soil class only determined the plant association on a habitat level, but it could not reason the fine pattern of the plant communities on the same soil class. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed to investigate the relationship between the distribution of dominant species and soil parameters. Several soil parameters combined have a significant effect on the distribution of dominant species. In conclusion, we found that the formation of association types strongly depends on the soil characteristics of the area, and that it is closely related to it. However, in the formation of the fine mosaic pattern, the driving ecological factors are the microrelief and the length of the saturated or flooded soil conditions. © 2021 Sciendo.

This work provides a comparative analysis through the model implementation of the two renowned machine learning models, the support vector machine (SVM) and deep learning (DL), for plant disease detection using leaf image data. Until recently, most of these image processing techniques had been, and some still are, exploiting what some considered as ""shallow"" machine learning architectures. The DL network is fast becoming the benchmark for research in the field of image recognition and pattern analysis. Regardless, there is a lack of studies concerning its application in plant leaves disease detection. Thus, both models have been implemented in this research on a large plant leaf disease image dataset using standard settings and in consideration of the three crucial factors of architecture, computational power, and amount of training data to compare the duos. Results obtained indicated scenarios by which each model best performs in this context, and within a particular domain of factors suggests improvements and which model would be more preferred.

This study hypothesized that canopy reflectance (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) measured at tillering (Feekes 2–3) and expressed as a sufficiency index (SI), can estimate the likelihood of a site-specific response to in-season N fertilizer in malting barley. Canopy reflectance was measured from plots at tillering with a GreenSeeker and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) borne multispectral cameras in trials across heterogeneous California agroecosystems. Field experiments included a range of N fertilizer application rates (0–168 kg N ha−1) and timings (pre-plant, tillering, or evenly split), and resulted in a range of crop N sufficiency/deficiency. NDVI-based SI measurements were categorized into one of three quantitative categories (low, medium, and high) without additional experimental context using Gaussian mixture modeling. Despite that 85% of variation in protein yield was due to site-year, the reflectance-based categories indicated whether N fertilizer applied in-season would increase protein yield (p &lt;.01). Nitrogen application at tillering increased yield and protein for plots in the “low” and “medium” SI categories (45 and 4% for yield and 16 and 12% for protein, respectively) (p &lt;.05), while “high” SI plots had neither yield (p =.23) nor protein (p =.26) increases.

Tea yield, however, has stagnated in recent years, due to changes in temperature, precipitation, the age of the tea bushes, and diseases. Developing an approach for monitoring tea bushes by remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) might be a way to alleviate this problem. Using multi-temporal remote sensing data, the paper details an investigation of the changes in tea health and yield forecasting through the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In this study, we used NDVI as a support tool to demonstrate the temporal and spatial changes in NDVI through the extract tea NDVI value and calculate the mean NDVI value. The results of the study showed that the minimum NDVI value was 0.42 during January 2013 and February 2015 and 2016. The maximum NDVI value was in August 2015 and June 2017. We indicate that the linear relationship between NDVI value and mean temperature was strong with R2 = 0.79 Our results confirm that the combination of meteorological data and NDVI data can achieve a high performance of yield prediction. Three models to predict tea yield were conducted: support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and the traditional linear regression model (TLRM). For period 2009 to 2018, the prediction tea yield by the RF model was the best with a R2 = 0.73, by SVM it was 0.66, and 0.57 with the TLRM. Three evaluation indicators were used to consider accuracy: the coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and percentage error of tea yield (PETY). The highest accuracy for the three models was in 2015 with a R2 ≥ 0.87, RMSE &lt; 50 kg/ha, and PETY less 3% error. In the other years, the prediction accuracy was higher in the SVM and RF models. Meanwhile, the RF algorithm was better than PETY (≤10%) and the root mean square error for this algorithm was significantly less (≤80 kg/ha).

It helps to effectively use the agricultural resources and management tools and monitors different parameters to attain better quality yield and production. WSN makes use of Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), a wireless technology to transmit data over long distances with minimal power consumption. LoRaWAN is one of the most successful LPWAN technologies despite its low data rate and because of its low deployment and management costs. Greenhouses are susceptible to different types of interference and diversification, demanding an improved WSN design scheme. In this paper, we contemplate the viable challenges for PA in greenhouses and propose the successive steps essential for effectual WSN deployment and facilitation. We performed a real-time, end-to-end deployment of a LoRaWAN-based sensor network in a greenhouse of the ’Proefcentrum Hoogstraten’ research center in Belgium. We have designed a dashboard for better visualization and analysis of the data, analyzed the power consumption for the LoRaWAN communication, and tried three different enclosure types (commercial, simple box and airflow box, respectively). We validated the implications of real-word challenges on the end-to-end deployment and air circulation for the correct sensor readings. We found that temperature and humidity have a larger impact on the sensor readings inside the greenhouse than we initially thought, which we successfully solved through the airflow box design. © 2020 by the authors.

Remote sensing, as a non-destructive measurement technology, has been proved to be useful for estimating vegetation growth parameters, especially at large scale. With the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), this novel remote sensing platform has been widely used to provide remote sensing images which have much higher spatial resolution. Previous reports have shown that the spectral feature of remote sensing images could be an effective indicator to estimate vegetation growth parameters. However, the texture feature of high-resolution remote sensing images is rarely employed for this purpose. Besides, the physical mechanism between the texture feature and vegetation growth parameters is still unclear. Results: In this study, a Fourier spectrum texture based on the UAV Image was developed to estimate rice LAI. And the relationship between Fourier spectrum texture and rice LAI was also analyzed. The results showed that Fourier spectrum texture could improve the accuracy of rice LAI estimation. Conclusions: In conclusion, the texture feature of high-resolution remote sensing images may be more effective in rice LAI estimation than the spectral feature. © 2019 The Author(s).","Fourier spectrum texture; Remote sensing; Rice LAI; UAV; Vegetation index",,Article,Scopus

Optimal solutions tended to prioritize conversion of land in eastern AWR subbasins where yield and water quality objective improvements were greatest. A small number of subbasins contributed to basin-wide water quality improvements, whereas subbasins contributing to economic benefits were more spatially dispersed, indicating that water quality responses are more likely to constrain feedstock placement.

Mapping the spatial variability of yield, protein content, and total grain N uptake (Ng) can be a useful tool for post-harvest evaluation of N sufficiency that, in turn, can guide precision N fertilization. We evaluated the applicability of combining RapidEye satellite imagery-derived vegetation indices with topographic variables derived from high-resolution data obtained from proximal sensors to estimate winter wheat yield, protein content, and Ng. Results indicate that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference red edge index (NDRE), terrain curvature, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index, and solar radiation are the most relevant co-variables that contribute to spatial variability of yield and Ng. Yield and Ng exhibited strong relationships with NDVI and NDRE from late June through early July during grain filling stage, with nearly all R2 &gt; 0.6. We found greater yield and Ng values in concave-shaped terrain; 0-5° and 10-20° slopes; and flat, eastern, or northern aspects.

Understanding the spatial and temporal variabilities of water security can play a pivotal role in sustainable management of fresh water resources. In this study, a long-term water security analysis of the Grand River watershed (GRW), Ontario, Canada, was carried out using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). Analyses on blue and green water availability and water security were carried out by dividing the GRW into eight drainage zones. As such, both anthropogenic as well as environmental demand were considered. In particular, while calculating blue water scarcity, three different methods were used in determining the environmental flow requirement, namely, the presumptive standards method, the modified low stream-flow method, and the variable monthly flow method. Model results showed that the SWAT model could simulate streamflow dynamics of the GRW with 'good' to 'very good' accuracy with an average Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.75, R2 value of 0.78, and percentage of bias (PBIAS) of 8.23%. Sen's slope calculated using data from over 60 years confirmed that the blue water flow, green water flow, and storage had increasing trends. The presumptive standards method and the modified low stream-flow method, respectively, were found to be the most and least restrictive method in calculating environmental flow requirements. While both green (0.4-1.1) and blue (0.25-2.0) water scarcity values showed marked temporal and spatial variabilities, blue water scarcity was found to be the highest in urban areas on account of higher water usage and less blue water availability. Similarly, green water scarcity was found to be highest in zones with higher temperatures and intensive agricultural practices. We believe that knowledge of the green and blue water security situation would be helpful in sustainable water resources management of the GRW and help to identify hotspots that need immediate attention. © 2019 by the authors.","Blue water; Grand River watershed; Green water; Soil and water assessment tool (SWAT); Water security","agricultural practice; assessment method; soil and water assessment tool; spatiotemporal analysis; streamflow; water availability; water management; water resource; watershed; Canada; Grand River [Ontario]; Ontario [Canada]",Article,Scopus

We fuse the RGB feature information obtained from a deep learning framework with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) features to obtain semantic labeling. Specifically, we propose a decision-level multisensor fusion technique for semantic labeling of the very-high-resolution optical imagery and LiDAR data. Our approach first obtains initial probabilistic predictions from two different sources: one from a pretrained neural network fine-tuned on a three-band optical image, and another from a probabilistic classifier trained on LiDAR data. These two predictions are then combined as the unary potential using a higher-order conditional random field (CRF) framework, which resolves fusion ambiguities by exploiting the spatialcontextual information.

One step further is then the maximization of the agricultural economic benefits, by properly adjusting the irrigated crop area pattern to optimally use the limited amount of water available. To that avail, a sequential hydro-economic model has been developed and applied to the agriculturally intensively used Zarrine River Basin (ZRB), Iran. In the first step, the surface and groundwater resources, especially, the inflow to the Boukan Dam, as well as the potential crop yields are simulated using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model, driven by GCM/QM-downscaled climate predictions for three future 21th-century periods under three climate RCPs. While in all nine combinations consistently higher temperatures are predicted, the precipitation pattern are much more versatile, leading to corresponding changes in the future water yields. Using the basin-wide water management tool MODSIM, the SWAT-simulated water available is then optimally distributed across the different irrigation plots in the ZRB, while adhering to various environmental/demand priority constraints. MODSIM is subsequently coupled with CSPSO to optimize (maximize) the agro-economic water productivity (AEWP) of the various crops and, subsequently, the net economic benefit (NEB), using crop areas as decision variables, while respecting various crop cultivation constraints. Adhering to political food security recommendations for the country, three variants of cereal cultivation area constraints are investigated. The results indicate considerably-augmented AEWPs, resulting in a future increase of the annual NEB of ~16% to 37.4 Million USD for the 65%-cereal acreage variant, while, at the same time, the irrigation water required is reduced by ~38%. This NEB-rise is achieved by augmenting the total future crop area in the ZRB by about 47%-indicating some deficit irrigation-wherefore most of this extension will be cultivated by the high AEWP-yielding crops wheat and barley, at the expense of a tremendous reduction of alfalfa acreage. Though presently making up only small base acreages, depending on the future period/RCP, tomato- and, less so, potato- and sugar beet-cultivation areas will also be increased significantly. © 2018 by the authors.","Agro-economic water productivity; Climate change; CSPSO-MODSIM; Hydro-economic modeling; Iran; Net economic benefits; Optimal crop pattern; Zarrine River Basin","agricultural economics; agricultural production; alfalfa; climate change; crop yield; cultivation; food security; high temperature; twenty first century; water availability; water resource; water use; water use efficiency; wheat; Iran; Zarrineh River; Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Hordeum; Lycopersicon esculentum; Medicago sativa; Solanum tuberosum; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

The objective of this study was to investigate the potential impacts of land-use changes on the hydrological behavior of the Upper Grande River Basin, southern Minas Gerais state, Brazil, based on different land-use scenarios using the SWAT model. For this purpose, daily streamfl ow records from the Macaia gauge station were calibrated and validated under the current land-use. To assess land-use change impacts four land-use scenarios were developed following offi cial environmental planning reports: S1 and S2 - conversion of forest into pasture of 20 and 50%, respectively; S3 and S4 - conversion of pasture into forest of 20 and 50%, respectively. The results have showed that, in general, the deforestation scenarios (S1 and S2) presented an increase in total runoff and peak fl ow and a decrease in the basefl ow and evapotranspiration, whereas the reforestation scenarios (S3 and S4) have showed the opposite. The results showed that the land-use changes can generate positive impacts, such as reduction of surface runoff and increase in the basefl ow, as well as negative ones, like the increase of soil erosion and fl ood risks. © 2018, Federal University of Lavras.

The increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles in recent times opens up new possibilities for remotely sensing crop status and yields even on complex smallholder farms. This study demonstrates the applicability of a vegetation index derived from UAV imagery to assess maize (Zea mays L.) crop vigor and yields at various stages of crop growth. The study employs a quadcopter flown at 100 m over farm plots and equipped with two consumer-grade cameras, one of which is modified to capture images in the near infrared. We find that UAV-derived GNDVI is a better indicator of crop vigor and a better estimator of yields—r = 0.372 and r = 0.393 for mean and maximum GNDVI respectively at about five weeks after planting compared to in-field methods like SPAD readings at the same stage (r = 0.259). Our study therefore demonstrates that GNDVI derived from UAV imagery is a reliable and timeous predictor of crop vigor and yields and that this is applicable even in complex smallholder farms in SSA. © 2018 by the authors.

To this aim, proximal and remote spectral vegetation indices are increasingly replacing soil analysis. In this study the spatial variation of soil properties, proximal and remote spectral vegetation indices were compared in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop grown in a 4.15 ha field in northern Italy. Soil analysis (particle size distribution, pH, carbonates, C, total N, available P, exchangeable cations and electrical conductivity) was geo-referentially carried out; the proximal indices chlorophyll content by N-Tester and normalised difference vegetation index through GreenSeeker were determined in three dates during stem elongation; the remote indices PurePixel ™ chlorophyll index and PurePixel™ vegetation index were determined through the Landsat 8 satellite in three dates during the same wheat stage. Dry biomass yield (DBY), grain yield (GY) and yield components were determined at harvest. Soil, proximal and remote data were submitted to principal component analysis (PCA), and the retained PCs were clustered to delineate areas at low, intermediate and high yield potential, based on soil parameters (CLUsp), proximal (CLUpi), and remote vegetation indices (CLUri). DBY and GY were significantly correlated with several soil parameters and vegetation indices. Spatiabl distribution of soil and crop data consistently depicted a low performing area (GY&lt;3 Mg ha-1) and a high performing one (GY&gt;8 Mg ha-1). CLUsp determined a lower GY difference between low and high performing area (+60%), compared to CLUpi and CLUri (almost +100%). In CLUsp and CLUpi the low and high performing area were of similar size (25 and 29% for the two respective areas in CLUsp; 25 and 33% in CLUpi), whereas in CLUri they were quite different (16 and 46%). Lastly, yield potential levels determined by vegetation indices (CLUpi and CLUri) exhibited a better degree of agreement with DBY and GY levels, than soil parameters (CLUsp). In exchange for this, the above referred soil parameters are quite consistent in time, allowing soil data to be used for more years. On concluding, PCA followed by clustering resulted in a robust delineation of field areas at different yield potential. This is the premise for developing research driven strategies of practical use. © L.

We extracted the knowledge about 174 varieties from the dataset, which contained information about weather, soil, yield and regional statistical parameters. Next, we predicted the yield of each variety in each of 6,490 observed subregions of the Midwest. Furthermore, yield was predicted for all the possible weather scenarios approximated by 15 historical weather instances contained in the dataset. Using predicted yields and covariance between varieties through different weather scenarios, we performed portfolio optimisation. In this way, for each subregion, we obtained a selection of varieties, that proved superior to others in terms of the amount and stability of yield. According to the rules of Syngenta Crop Challenge, for which this research was conducted, we aggregated the results across all subregions and selected up to five soybean varieties that should be distributed across the network of seed retailers.

The InVEST and SWAT models provide similar estimates of the spatial distribution of water yield in Wildcat Creek, but very different estimates of the spatial distribution of water yield in Upper Upatoi Creek. The InVEST model may do a poor job estimating the spatial distribution of water yield in the Upper Upatoi Creek Watershed because baseflow provides a significant portion of the site's total water yield, which means that storage dynamics which are not modeled by InVEST may be important. We also compare the ability of these two models, as well as one newly developed set of ecosystem service indices, to deliver useful guidance for land management decisions focused on providing hydrologic ecosystem services in three particular decision contexts: environmental flow ecosystem services, ecosystem services for potable water supply, and ecosystem services for rainfed irrigation.

In this study empirical relationships suitable for Taiwan were established for GSR retrieval from geostationary satellite images using the Heliosat method for the period from 2011-2013. The derived GSR data has been used to generate consecutive maps of 10-day averaged pan evaporation (Epan) as the basis to produce regional ET estimation using a strategy that does not require remote sensed land surface temperatures (LST). The retrieved daily GSR and the derived 10-day averaged Epan were validated against pyranometer and class-A pan measurements at selected Central Weather Bureau (CWB) stations spread across various climatic regions in Taiwan. Compared with the CWB observed data the overall relative mean bias deviations (MBD%) and root mean square differences (RMSD%) in daily solar irradiance retrieval were about 5 and 15%, respectively. Seasonally, the largest MBD% and RMSD% of retrieved daily solar irradiance occur in spring (9.5 and 21.3% on average), while the least MBD% (-0.3% on average) and RMSD% (9.7% on average) occur in autumn and winter, respectively. For 10-day averaged Epan estimation, the mean MBD% and RMSD% for stations located in the coastal plain areas were 0.1 and 16.9%, respectively. However, in mountainous areas the mean MBD% and RMSD% increased to 30.2 and 34.5%, respectively. This overestimation was due mainly to the large differences in surrounding micro-environments between the mountainous and plain areas.","Evapotranspiration; Geostationary satellite; Solar radiation; Water resources","evaporation; evapotranspiration; geostationary satellite; irradiance; mountain region; satellite data; solar radiation; spatial variation; temporal variation; Taiwan",Article,Scopus

The high resolution of output provided by Regional Climate Models (RCMs) is expected to be a suitable tool to describe regional and local climatic features, although their simulation results may still present biases. For these reasons, we compared several post-processing methods to correct or reduce the biases of RCM simulations from the ENSEMBLES project for the IP. The bias-corrected datasets were also evaluated in terms of their applicability and consequences in improving the results of a crop model to simulate maize growth and development at two IP locations, using this crop as a reference for summer cropping systems in the region. The use of bias-corrected climate runs improved crop phenology and yield simulation overall and reduced the inter-model variability and thus the uncertainty. The number of observational stations underlying each reference observational dataset used to correct the bias affected the correction performance. Although no single technique showed to be the best one, some methods proved to be more adequate for small initial biases, while others were useful when initial biases were so large as to prevent data application for impact studies.

These watersheds were small, fairly flat, extensively agricultural, and heavily subsurface tile-drained. The targeting approach was also used to evaluate the model's representation of conservation practices in cost and water quality improvement, defined as export of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and sediment from cropped fields. FS, GW, and habitats were the most effective at improving water quality, while CC and wetlands made the greatest water quality improvement in lands with multiple existing conservation practices.

Wetlands are constantly affected by anthropogenic factors such as engineering projects and landscaping. Therefore, simulation of hydrologic processes and modeling the factors involved are important. In this study, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to simulate the hydrologic process in the Karkheh River Basin (KRB) in southwest Iran and to evaluate the impacts of engineering projects on its wetland (Al Hawizeh) located in the Iran-Iraq border. Calibration, validation, and uncertainty analysis were performed using Sequential Uncertainty Fitting Ver. 2 (SUFI2), which is one of the program interfaces with SWAT, in the Package SWAT Calibration Uncertainty Programs (SWAT-CUP). To assess the goodness of calibration and validation, four measures were applied: (i) percentage of data bracketed by 95% prediction uncertainty or P-factor (95PPU) calculated at 2.5% and 97.5% intervals of the simulated variables, (ii) R-factor, which is the ratio of average thickness of the PPU, (iii) Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE), and (iv) determination of coefficient (R2). Stream flows from four gauge stations combined with 14 synoptic stations were used for calibration (1987-1990) and validation (1991-1994). The P-factor values for these stations ranged from 0.64 to 0.84 and from 0.65 to 0.79 for calibration and validation, respectively. These results showed reasonable accuracy according to literature. NSE values were also acceptable, ranging from 0.52 to 0.8 and from 0.62 to 0.72 for calibration and validation, respectively. R2 values were also within an acceptable range. The calibration and validation results were then used to simulate two watershed scenarios (with and without a dam). In addition, annual flow volumes (AFVs) for two downstream stations (Hamidiyeh and Pay e Pol) were computed. AFV is defined as the volume of water that discharges from catchment at the desired output during a year. The results showed that the flows during 1987-2000 (before dam construction) and 2001 to 2010 (after dam construction) were significantly reduced after the Karkheh dam construction. The corresponding AFVs for the Hamidiyeh and Pay e Pol stations were 8.92×1011 and 1.04×1012m3 in 1987-2000 and 2.57×1011 to 3.94×1011m3 in 2001-2010. Thus, the AFVs before and after dam construction were reduced to 6.34×1011 and 6.53×1011m3 for the Hamidiyeh and Pay e Pol gauges, respectively. Consequently, flow reduction affected the wetland area, in which the surface area of the wetland was reduced and dust emission was increased. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.","Engineering projects; KRB; Simulation; SUFI-2; SWAT model; Uncertainty analysis","accuracy assessment; anthropogenic effect; calibration; land use; nature-society relations; numerical model; river basin; river engineering; river flow; uncertainty analysis; wetland; Iran; Karkheh Basin; Khuzestan",Article,Scopus

Consequently, water quality is a significant concern associated with conversion of lands to bioenergy production. This study focused on the Arkansas-White-Red river basin (AWR), one of five major river basins draining to the Mississippi River. The AWR has a strong precipitation gradient from east to west, and advanced cellulosic feedstocks are projected to become economically feasible within normal-to-wet areas of the region. In this study, we used large-scale watershed modeling to identify areas along this precipitation gradient with potential for improving water quality. We compared simulated water quality in rivers draining projected future landscapes with and without cellulosic bioenergy for two future years, 2022 and 2030 with an assumed farmgate price of $50 per dry ton. Changes in simulated water quantity and quality under future bioenergy scenarios varied among subbasins and years. Median water yield, nutrient loadings, and sediment yield decreased by 2030. Median concentrations of nutrients also decreased, but suspended sediment, which is influenced by decreased flow and in-stream processes, increased. Spatially, decreased loadings prevailed in the transitional ecotone between 97° and 100° longitude, where switchgrass, Panicum virgatum L., is projected to compete against alternative crops and land uses at $50 per dry ton.

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a semi distributed physically based model, was chosen and set up in the KRB for hydrologic modeling. SWAT-CUP (SWAT-Calibration and Uncertainty Programs) was used for model calibration, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, following the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) technique. The model calibration was performed for the period (1987-1999), with initial 3 years of warm up (1987-89); then, the model was validated for the subsequent 6 years of data (2000-2005). To assess the competence of model calibration and uncertainty, two indices, the p-factor (observations bracketed by the prediction uncertainty) and the r-factor (achievement of small uncertainty band), were taken into account. The results of SWAT simulations indicated that during the calibration the p-factor and the r-factor were reported as 0.82 and 0.76, respectively, while during the validation the p-factor and the r-factor were obtained as 0.71 and 0.72, respectively. After a rigorous calibration and validation, the goodness of fit was further assessed through the use of the coefficient of determination (R2) and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NS) between the observed and the final simulated values.

The Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) was applied to Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images to obtain evapotranspiration (ET) for assessing WP and irrigation performance (IP) of crops. Crop productivity (CP) was estimated using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) crop productivity models. The predicted CP (CPP) for corn varied from 12 690 to 14 060 kg/ha and from 6000 to 7370 kg/ha for wheat. The CP P for alfalfa and Rhodes grass was 42 450 and 58 210 (kg/ha/year), respectively. The highest predicted WP was observed in wheat (0.80-2.01 kg/m3) and the lowest was in alfalfa (0.38-0.46kg/m3). The deviation between SEBAL predicted ET (ETP) and weather station recorded ET (ETW) was 10%. The performance of the prediction models was assessed against the measured data. The overall mean bias/error of the predictions of CP, ET, and WP was 9.4%,-2.68%, and 9.65%, respectively; the root mean square error (RMSE) was 1996 (kg/ha), 2107 (m3/ha), and 0.09 (kg-3) for CP, ET, and WP, respectively.

The objective of this research was to narrow the range of values characterizing the limits within which estimates are expected to fall in the diagnostics of agroclimatic risks. Assessments were made by analyzing historical observations and evaluating the influence of heat stress and rainfall variability on crop water demand, biomass and grain yields of short-cycle cultivars of pearl millet and maize. We used a wide range of consistent and practical sets of crop model ensemble analyses (based on crop management practices such as plant density, fertilization levels, early/late sowing dates and soil types) and climate model ensembles from 2 climate change hypothesis (A1b and RCP8.5) over the West African Sudan-Sahel. Recent rainfall developments show that hazardous intra-seasonal rainfall distribution affects crop productivity, with increased frequency and intensity of daily rainfall, false start and early cessation of the rainy season and decreasing diurnal temperature range. In 2011-2050 perspectives, relative to the 1981-2010 baseline, a slight in - crease in temperature (i.e. +0.6 to +0.8°C) combined with a stationary to moderate decrease in precipitation leads to a 10 to 15% (8 to 15%) decrease in aboveground biomass production (grain yield). When the warming is moderate (i.e. +1.4 to 1.8°C), the decline in grain yield worsens (10 to 20%), despite a slight increase in rainfall projections. At these rates of loss in crop production, resilience can be reinforced. However, it will require that climate-smart crop management practices be embedded in sub-seasonal and interannual monitoring and early warning systems. © Inter-Research 2015.","Agroclimatic risks; Ensemble scenarios; Maize; Pearl millet; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty management; West African Sudan-Sahel","baseline conditions; biomass; climate change; crop production; crop yield; early warning system; ecosystem resilience; environmental impact; hypothesis testing; millet; precipitation intensity; water demand; Eritrea; Northern Red Sea; Sahel [Northern Red Sea]; Sudan; Pennisetum glaucum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The intervariable, spatial, and temporal dependencies of the corrected data are usually poor compared to observations.Here, the authors propose a novel method for multivariate BC. The empirical copula-bias correction (EC-BC) combines a one-dimensional BC with a shuffling technique that restores an empirical multidimensional copula. Several BC methods are investigated and compared to high-resolution reference data over the FrenchMediterranean basin: notably, (i) a 1D BC method applied independently to precipitation and temperature fields, (ii) a recent conditional correction approach developed for producing correct two-dimensional intervariable structures, and (iii) the EC-BC method. Assessments are realized in terms of intervariable, spatial, and temporal dependencies, and an objective evaluation using the integrated quadratic distance (IQD) is presented. As expected, the 1D methods cannot produce correct multidimensional properties. The conditional technique appears efficient for intervariable properties but not for spatial and temporal dependencies. EC-BC provides realistic dependencies in all respects: intervariable, spatial, and temporal. The IQD results are clearly in favor of EC-BC. As many BC methods, EC-BC relies on a stationarity assumption and is only able to reproduce patterns inherited from historical data. However, because of its ease of coding, its speed of application, and the quality of its results, the EC-BC method is a very good candidate for all needs in multivariate bias correction. © 2015 American Meteorological Society.","Bias; Precipitation; Statistical techniques; Temperature","Climatology; Precipitation (chemical); Temperature; Bias; Correction approaches; High resolution; Historical data; Objective evaluation; Shuffling technique; Statistical techniques; Temporal structures; Climate models; air temperature; atmospheric correction; atmospheric modeling; climate modeling; data quality; multivariate analysis; precipitation (climatology); spatiotemporal analysis",Article,Scopus

A point of crucial importance in this region is therefore how intensive corn (Zed mays L.)-based cropping systems for food and fuel production can be sustainable and coexist with a healthy water environment, not only under existing climate conditions but also under a changed climate in the future. To address this issue, a UMRB integrated modeling system has been built with a greatly refined 12-digit subbasin structure based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) water quality model, which is capable of estimating landscape and in-stream water and pollutant yields in response to a wide array of alternative cropping and/or management strategies and climatic conditions. The effects of the following four agricultural management scenarios on crop production and pollutant loads exported from the cropland of the UMRB to streams and rivers were evaluated: (1) expansion of continuous corn across the entire basin, (2) adoption of no-till on all corn and soybean ( Glycine max L.) fields in the region, (3) substitution of the traditional continuous corn and corn-soybean rotations with an extended five-year rotation consisting of corn, soybean, and three years of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), and (4) implementation of a winter cover crop within the baseline rotations. The effects of each management scenario were evaluated both for current climate and a projected midcentury (2046 to 2065) climate from a General Circulation Model (GCM). All four scenarios behaved similarly under the historical and future climate, generally resulting in reduced erosion and nutrient loadings to surface water bodies compared to the baseline agricultural management. Continuous corn was the only scenario which resulted in increased N pollution while no-till was the most environmentally effective and able to sustain production at almost the same levels. Rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop within the fallow period was also effective in reducing erosion and both sediment-bound and soluble forms of nutrients. The results indicated that alternative management practices could reduce sediment, N, and P exports from UMRB cropland by up to 50% without significantly affecting yields. Results for the climate change scenario showed that the effectiveness of the management scenarios was strongly linked to the reduced water availability predicted under the future climate, which assisted in mitigating pollutant transport, although with a small loss of production.","Agricultural management scenarios-; Climate change-corn based systems-; Nonpoint pollution-; Soil and water assessment tool-; Upper mississippi river basin","climate change; cropping practice; environmental management; river basin; surface water; water management; water quality; Mississippi Basin; United States; Glycine max; Medicago sativa; Secale cereale; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The aim of the paper is to study whether satellite observation of plant phenology are consistent with ground knowledge of crop cycles as expressed in agro-simulations. We used phenological variables from a MODIS Land Cover Dynamics (MCD12Q2) product and examined whether they reproduced the spatio-temporal variability of crop phenological stages in Southern Mali. Furthermore, a validated cereal crop growth model for this region, SARRA-H (System for Regional Analysis of Agro-Climatic Risks), provided precise agronomic information. Remotely-sensed green-up, maturity, senescence and dormancy MODIS dates were extracted for areas previously identified as crops and were compared with simulated leaf area indices (LAI) temporal profiles generated using the SARRA-H crop model, which considered the main cropping practices. We studied both spatial (eight sites throughout South Mali during 2007) and temporal (two sites from 2002 to 2008) differences between simulated crop cycles and determined how the differences were indicated in satellite-derived phenometrics. The spatial comparison of the phenological indicator observations and simulations showed mainly that (i) the satellite-derived start-of-season (SOS) was detected approximately 30 days before the model-derived SOS; and (ii) the satellite-derived end-of-season (EOS) was typically detected 40 days after the model-derived EOS. Studying the inter-annual difference, we verified that the mean bias was globally consistent for different climatic conditions. Therefore, the land cover dynamics derived from the MODIS time series can reproduce the spatial and temporal variability of different start-of-season and end-of-season crop species. In particular, we recommend simultaneously using start-of-season phenometrics with crop models for yield forecasting to complement commonly used climate data and provide a better estimate of vegetation phenological changes that integrate rainfall variability, land cover diversity, and the main farmer practices.","Crops; Mali; MODIS; Phenology; Practices; SARRA-H model",,Article,Scopus

Improvements in the timeliness and accuracy of yield forecasting by incorporating near real-time remote sensing data and the use of sophisticated statistical methods can improve our capacity to respond effectively to these challenges. The objectives of this study were (i) to investigate the use of derived vegetation indices for the yield forecasting of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) from the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at the ecodistrict scale across Western Canada with the Integrated Canadian Crop Yield Forecaster (ICCYF); and (ii) to compare the ICCYF-model based forecasts and their accuracy across two spatial scales-the ecodistrict and Census Agricultural Region (CAR), namely in CAR with previously reported ICCYF weak performance. Ecodistricts are areas with distinct climate, soil, landscape and ecological aspects, whereas CARs are census-based/statistically-delineated areas. Agroclimate variables combined respectively with MODIS-NDVI and MODIS-EVI indices were used as inputs for the in-season yield forecasting of spring wheat during the 2000-2010 period. Regression models were built based on a procedure of a leave-one-year-out. The results showed that both agroclimate + MODIS-NDVI and agroclimate + MODIS-EVI performed equally well predicting spring wheat yield at the ECD scale. The mean absolute error percentages (MAPE) of the models selected from both the two data sets ranged from 2% to 33% over the study period. The model efficiency index (MEI) varied between ??1.1 and 0.99 and ??1.8 and 0.99, respectively for the agroclimate + MODIS-NDVI and agroclimate + MODIS-EVI data sets. Moreover, significant improvement in forecasting skill (with decreasing MAPE of 40% and 5 times increasing MEI, on average) was obtained at the finer, ecodistrict spatial scale, compared to the coarser CAR scale. Forecast models need to consider the distribution of extreme values of predictor variables to improve the selection of remote sensing indices. Our findings indicate that statistical-based forecastingerror could be significantly reduced by making use of MODIS-EVI and NDVI indices at different times in the crop growing season and within different sub-regions. © 2014 by the authors.","Ecodistrict; ICCYF; MODIS; Spring wheat; Yield forecasting","Agriculture; Climate change; Crops; Cultivation; Forecasting; Image reconstruction; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Surveys; Ecodistrict; ICCYF; MODIS; Spring wheat; Yield forecasting; Radiometers",Article,Scopus

To provide spatially distributed rainfall data, point measurements are interpolated. However, in low density measurement networks, the use of different interpolation methods may result in large differences and hence in deviations from the actual spatial distribution of rainfall. Our study aims at analyzing different rainfall interpolation schemes with regard to their suitability to produce spatial rainfall estimates in a monsoon dominated region with scarce rainfall measurements. The study was carried out in the meso-scale catchment of the Mula and the Mutha Rivers (2036km 2) upstream of the city of Pune, India. Rainfall data from 16 rain gauges were spatially interpolated using seven different methods, including Thiessen polygons, statistical, and geostatistical approaches. The two most suitable covariates for rainfall interpolation were identified as (i) distance in wind direction from the main orographic barrier and as (ii) a 0.05° pattern of mean annual rainfall derived from satellite data acquired by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Consequently, these two covariates were used in the regression-based interpolation approaches. The quality of the different methods was assessed using a two step validation approach: (i) Cross-validation was used to evaluate the capability to reproduce measured data. (ii) Spatially integrated interpolation performance was assessed by using a hydrologic model to calculate runoff and compare modeled to measured runoff. By this assessment, the regression-based methods showed the best performance. We found that the choice of the covariate had a significant impact on precipitation and runoff amounts, as well as on the temporal course of runoff events. Our results show, that the decision on the suitable interpolation scheme should not only be based on the comparison with point measurements, but should also take the representativeness of the given measurement network as well as of the interpolated spatial rainfall distribution into account. The successful application of regression-based interpolation methods using a high resolution TRMM pattern as covariate is very promising as it is transferable to other data scarce regions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","India; Interpolation; Kriging; Rainfall; SWAT; TRMM","Annual rainfall; Covariates; Cross validation; Daily rainfall; Environmental applications; Geostatistical approach; High resolution; Hydrologic models; India; Interpolation method; Interpolation schemes; Kriging; Mesoscale; Orographic barriers; Point measurement; Precipitation and runoff; Rain gauges; Rainfall data; Rainfall interpolation; Rainfall measurements; Satellite data; Significant impacts; Spatial interpolation; Spatial rainfall; SWAT; TRMM; Tropical rainfall measuring missions; Validation approach; Wind directions; Catchments; Interpolation; Quality control; Rain gages; Regression analysis; Runoff; Spatial distribution; Rain; comparative study; data set; interpolation; kriging; rainfall; rainfall-runoff modeling; raingauge; regression analysis; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; TRMM; India; Maharashtra; Mula Basin; Mutha Basin; Pune",Article,Scopus

Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer, responsible for one third of the world production. A coffee plot exhibits high and low production in alternated years, a characteristic so called biennial yield. High yield is generally a result of suitable conditions of foliar biomass. Moreover, in high production years one plot tends to lose more leaves than it does in low production years. In both cases some correlation between coffee yield and leaf biomass can be deduced which can be monitored through time series of vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery. In Brazil, a comprehensive, spatially distributed study assessing this relationship has not yet been done. The objective of this study was to assess possible correlations between coffee yield and MODIS derived vegetation indices in the Brazilian largest coffee-exporting province. We assessed EVI and NDVI MODIS products over the period between 2002 and 2009 in the south of Minas Gerais State whose production accounts for about one third of the Brazilian coffee production. Landsat images were used to obtain a reference map of coffee areas and to identify MODIS 250 m pure pixels overlapping homogeneous coffee crops. Only MODIS pixels with 100% coffee were included in the analysis. A wavelet-based filter was used to smooth EVI and NDVI time profiles. Correlations were observedbetween variations on yield of coffee plots and variations on vegetation indices for pixels overlapping the same coffee plots. The vegetation index metrics best correlated to yield were the amplitude and the minimum values over the growing season. The best correlations were obtained between variation on yield and variation on vegetation indices the previous year (R = 0.74 for minEVI metric and R = 0.68 for minNDVI metric). Although correlations were not enough to estimate coffee yield exclusively from vegetation indices, trends properly reflect the biennial bearing effect on coffee yield. © 2012 by the authors.","Coffee yield; Remote sensing; Vegetation indices; Wavelet filtering","Foliar biomass; Growing season; High yield; Landsat images; Leaf biomass; Minas Gerais; Minimum value; Previous year; Pure pixel; Reference map; Remote sensing imagery; Vegetation index; Wavelet filtering; Pixels; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Satellite imagery",Article,Scopus

The study focused mainly on three fundamental aspects, namely descriptive modelling, predictive modelling, and spatial modelling of expected risks and vulnerability to drought. Thus, out of 417 articles across all studies on drought, 226 articles published from 2010 to 2022 were analyzed to provide a global overview of the current state of knowledge on multivariate drought modelling using the inclusion criteria. The main objective is to review the recent available scientific evidence regarding multivariate drought modelling based on the joint use of geospatial technologies and artificial intelligence. The analysis focused on the different methods used, the choice of algorithms and the most relevant variables depending on whether they are descriptive or predictive models. Criteria such as the skill score, the given game complexity used, and the nature of validation data were considered to draw the main conclusions. The results highlight the very heterogeneous nature of studies on multivariate modelling of agricultural drought, and the very original nature of studies on multivariate modelling of agricultural drought in the recent literature. For future studies, in addition to scientific advances in prospects, case studies and comparative studies appear necessary for an in-depth analysis of the reproducibility and operational applicability of the different approaches proposed for spatial and temporal modelling of agricultural drought. HIGHLIGHTS The components and fundamentals of multivariate modelling of agricultural drought were discussed. The importance of hybrid artificial intelligence models is widely discussed in improving the performance of traditional machine learning models. Quantum machine learning algorithms are weakly explored in multivariate drought modelling. Therefore, future studies should explore this approach.

South America (SA) is one of the main grain and protein producers in the world but the status of DA in the region is unknown. A systematic review and case studies from Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile were conducted to address the following objectives: (1) quantify adoption of existing DA technologies, (2) identify limitations for DA adoption; and (3) summarise existing metrics to benchmark DA benefits. Level of DA adoption was led by Brazil and Argentina followed by Uruguay and at a slower rate, Chile. GPS guidance systems, mapping tools, mobile apps and remote sensing were the most adopted DA technologies in SA. The most reported limitations to adoption were technology cost, lack of training, limited number of companies providing services, and unclear benefits from DA. Across the case studies, there was no clear definition of DA. To mitigate some of these limitations, our findings suggest the need for a DA educational curriculum that can fulfill the demand for job skills such as data processing, analysis and interpretation. Regional efforts are needed to standardise these metrics. This will allow stakeholders to design targeted initiatives to promote DA towards sustainability of food production in the region. © 2022 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

Karst comprises exposed carbonate bedrock over approximately 1.30×106 km2 of this area, which suffers from soil degradation and poor crop yield. This paper aims to gain a better understanding of the environmental controls on crop yield in order to enable more sustainable use of natural resources for food production and development. More precisely, four kinds of artificial neural network were used to analyse and simulate the spatial patterns of crop yield for seven crop species grown in Guizhou Province, exploring the relationships with meteorological, soil, irrigation and fertilization factors. The results of spatial classification showed that most regions of high-level crop yield per area and total crop yield are located in the central-north area of Guizhou. Moreover, the three artificial neural networks used to simulate the spatial patterns of crop yield all demonstrated a good correlation coefficient between simulated and true yield. However, the Back Propagation network had the best performance based on both accuracy and runtime. Among the 13 influencing factors investigated, temperature (16.4%), radiation (15.3%), soil moisture (13.5%), fertilization of N (13.5%) and P (12.4%) had the largest contribution to crop yield spatial distribution. These results suggest that neural networks have potential application in identifying environmental controls on crop yield and in modelling spatial patterns of crop yield, which could enable local stakeholders to realize sustainable development and crop production goals. © The Author(s) 2020.","artificial neural network; critical zone; crop model; crop yield; Guizhou; Karst","artificial neural network; back propagation; crop yield; environmental factor; fertilizer application; karst; radiation exposure; soil moisture; spatial distribution; temperature effect; China; Guizhou",Article,Scopus

Nevertheless, the implementation of large datasets generated by high-throughput phenotyping tools such as hyperspectral reflectance in cultivar development programs is still challenging due to the essential need for intensive knowledge in computational and statistical analyses. In this study, the robustness of three common machine learning (ML) algorithms, multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF), were evaluated for predicting soybean (Glycine max) seed yield using hyperspectral reflectance. For this aim, the hyperspectral reflectance data for the whole spectra ranged from 395 to 1005 nm, which were collected at the R4 and R5 growth stages on 250 soybean genotypes grown in four environments. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) approach was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the hyperspectral reflectance data and select variables with the largest importance values. The results indicated that R5 is more informative stage for measuring hyperspectral reflectance to predict seed yields. The 395 nm reflectance band was also identified as the high ranked band in predicting the soybean seed yield. By considering either full or selected variables as the input variables, the ML algorithms were evaluated individually and combined-version using the ensemble–stacking (E–S) method to predict the soybean yield. The RF algorithm had the highest performance with a value of 84% yield classification accuracy among all the individual tested algorithms. Therefore, by selecting RF as the metaClassifier for E–S method, the prediction accuracy increased to 0.93, using all variables, and 0.87, using selected variables showing the success of using E–S as one of the ensemble techniques. This study demonstrated that soybean breeders could implement E–S algorithm using either the full or selected spectra reflectance to select the high-yielding soybean genotypes, among a large number of genotypes, at early growth stages. © Copyright © 2021 Yoosefzadeh-Najafabadi, Earl, Tulpan, Sulik and Eskandari.","artificial intelligence; data-driven model; ensemble methods; high-throughput phenotyping; random forest; recursive feature elimination",,Article,Scopus

In this study, we simulate US maize yield using process-based models, traditional regression model and a machine-learning algorithm, and importantly, identify the weakness and strength of each method in simulating the average, variability and extremes of maize yield across the country. We show that both regression and machine learning models can well reproduce the observed pattern of yield averages, while large bias is found for process-based crop models even fed with harmonized parameters. As for the probability distribution of yields, machine learning shows the best skill, followed by regression model and process-based models. For the country as a whole, machine learning can explain 93% of observed yield variability, followed by regression model (51%) and process-based models (42%). Based on the improved capability of the machine learning algorithm, we estimate that US maize yield is projected to decrease by 13.5% under the 2 C global warming scenario (by ∼2050 s). Yields less than or equal to the 10th percentile in the yield distribution for the baseline period are predicted to occur in 19% and 25% of years in 1.5 C (by ∼2040 s) and 2 C global warming scenarios, with potentially significant implications for food supply, prices and trade.

They are vital for identifying a person’s behaviour and mental condition. Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is extracting a speaker’s emotional state from their speech signal. SER is a growing discipline in human–computer interaction, and it has recently attracted more significant interest. This is because there are not so many universal emotions; therefore, any intelligent system with enough computational capacity can educate itself to recognise them. However, the issue is that human speech is immensely diverse, making it difficult to create a single, standardised recipe for detecting hidden emotions. This work attempted to solve this research difficulty by combining a multilingual emotional dataset with building a more generalised and effective model for recognising human emotions. A two-step process was used to develop the model. The first stage involved the extraction of features, and the second stage involved the classification of the features that were extracted. ZCR, RMSE, and the renowned MFC coefficients were retrieved as features. Two proposed models, 1D CNN combined with LSTM and attention and a proprietary 2D CNN architecture, were used for classification. The outcomes demonstrated that the suggested 1D CNN with LSTM and attention performed better than the 2D CNN. For the EMO-DB, SAVEE, ANAD, and BAVED datasets, the model’s accuracy was 96.72%, 97.13%, 96.72%, and 88.39%, respectively. The model beat several earlier efforts on the same datasets, demonstrating the generality and efficacy of recognising multiple emotions from various languages. © 2023 by the author.","1D and 2D Convolution Neural Networks (CNN); ANAD; BAVED datasets; EMO-DB; ensembling techniques; human–computer Interaction; LSTM; SAVEE; speech emotion recognition (SER)","Convolution; Emotion Recognition; Human computer interaction; Long short-term memory; Speech recognition; 1d and 2d convolution neural network; 2-D convolution; ANAD; BAVED dataset; Convolution neural network; EMO-DB; Ensembling technique; LSTM; SAVEE; Speech emotion recognition; Intelligent systems; attention; computer; emotion; human; speech; Attention; Computers; Emotions; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Speech",Article,Scopus

Aiming at the damage identification of the SCR, the acceleration time series signals at multiple locations are taken as the damage characteristics. The damage characteristics include spatial information of the measurement point location and time information of the acquisition signal. Therefore, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed to obtain spatial information. Considering the variable period characteristics of the acceleration time series of the SCR, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network is utilized to study these characteristics. However, neither a single CNN nor GRU model can simultaneously obtain temporal and spatial data information. Therefore, by combining a CNN with a GRU, the CNN-GRU model is established. Moreover, the hyperparameters of deep learning models have a significant influence on their performance. Therefore, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied to solve the hyperparameter optimization problem of the CNN-GRU. Thus, the PSO-CNN-GRU (PCG) model is established. Subsequently, an SCR damage identification method based on the PCG model is presented to predict the damage location and degree by SCR acceleration time series. By analyzing the SCR acceleration data, the prediction performances of the PCG model and the PSO optimization capacity are verified. The experimental results indicate that the identification result of the proposed PCG model is better than that of several existing models (CNN, GRU, and CNN-GRU). © 2023 by the authors.","convolutional neural network; damage identification; gated recurrent unit; hyperparameters; particle swarm optimization; steel catenary riser",,Article,Scopus

Data analysis was performed using the Artificial Neural Networks, decision tree algorithms REPTree and M5P, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. In predicting seed quality, the combination of the input variables temperature and storage time for REPTree and Random Forest algorithms outperformed the linear regression, providing higher accuracy indices.

We aim to design a series of forecasting models and find the factors that affect the incidence of TB, thereby improving the accuracy of the incidence prediction. Results: In this paper, we developed a new interpretable prediction system based on the multivariate multi-step Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method. Four accuracy measures are introduced into the system: Root Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Absolute Percentage Error, and symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error. The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and seasonal ARIMA model are established. The multi-step ARIMA–LSTM model is proposed for the first time to examine the performance of each model in the short, medium, and long term, respectively. Compared with the ARIMA model, each error of the multivariate 2-step LSTM model is reduced by 12.92%, 15.94%, 15.97%, and 14.81% in the short term. The 3-step ARIMA–LSTM model achieved excellent performance, with each error decreased to 15.19%, 33.14%, 36.79%, and 29.76% in the medium and long term. We provide the local and global explanation of the multivariate single-step LSTM model in the field of incidence prediction, pioneering. Conclusions: The multivariate 2-step LSTM model is suitable for short-term prediction and obtained a similar performance as previous studies. The 3-step ARIMA–LSTM model is appropriate for medium-to-long-term prediction and outperforms these models. The SHAP results indicate that the five most crucial features are maximum temperature, average relative humidity, local financial budget, monthly sunshine percentage, and sunshine hours. © 2022, The Author(s).","Hybrid forecasting model; Machine learning; Model explanation; Multivariate multi-step LSTM model; SHAP; Tuberculosis","Article; China; environmental temperature; financial management; high temperature; human; humidity; incidence; long short term memory network; machine learning; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; prediction; tuberculosis; forecasting; incidence; statistical model; temperature; tuberculosis; China; Forecasting; Humans; Incidence; Models, Statistical; Temperature; Tuberculosis",Article,Scopus

Using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool, detailed conservation practices (conservation tillage, contour farming, no-tillage, and terracing) are simulated to determine crop yields, sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loss of three crops (winter wheat, irrigated cotton, and pasture) by each land use unit (hydrologic response units) and location in the watershed. An economic model is used to determine the cost-minimizing choice of BMP scenarios for each land-use unit that meets 50%, 75%, and 90% reduction of sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loads and the impact of climate change on the net return to farmers. Results indicate that the effective spatial placement of BMP scenarios is not the same under different climatic conditions. The average optimal net return to farmers ranges from 170.39 to 316.32 $/acre for all the scenarios. The shadow prices vary from 2.36 to 17.78 $/ton/acre of sediment abated. Although individual BMP scenario is effective in reducing sediment loads, combined BMP scenarios achieve higher performance.

Infrared radiation distance demonstrated similar results, other than for VCC and color. The shortest drying time was obtained at 70 °C, air velocity of 3 m/s and infrared radiation distance of 10 cm.

Despite these improvements, the adoption of such approaches in the domain of satellite imagery is not straightforward. Typical vision datasets used in generative tasks are well-aligned and annotated, and exhibit limited variability. In contrast, satellite imagery exhibits great spatial and spectral variability, wide presence of fine, high-frequency details, while the tedious nature of annotating satellite imagery leads to annotation scarcity - further motivating developments in unsupervised learning. In this light, we present the first pre-trained style- and wavelet-based GAN model1 that can readily synthesize a wide gamut of realistic satellite images in a variety of settings and conditions - while also preserving high-frequency information. Furthermore, we show that by analyzing the intermediate activations of our network, one can discover a multitude of interpretable semantic directions that facilitate the guided synthesis of satellite images in terms of high-level concepts (e.g., urbanization) without using any form of supervision.

The most frequent malaria detection method relies mainly on the specialists who examine the samples under a microscope. Therefore, a computerized malaria diagnosis system is required. In this article, malaria cell segmentation and classification methods are proposed. The malaria cells are segmented using a color-based k-mean clustering approach on the selected number of clusters. After segmentation, deep features are extracted using pre-trained models such as efficient-net-b0 and shuffle-net, and the best features are selected using the Manta-Ray Foraging Optimization (MRFO) method. Two experiments are performed for classification using 10-fold cross-validation, the first experiment is based on the best features selected from the pre-trained models individually, while the second experiment is performed based on the selection of best features from the fusion of extracted features using both pre-trained models. The proposed method provided an accuracy of 99.2% for classification using the linear kernel of the SVM classifier.

Hyperspectral imaging can be used to obtain the physiological and biochemical parameters of maize leaves with the advantages of being rapid, non-destructive, and high throughput. This study aims to estimate the multiple amino acid contents in maize leaves using hyperspectral imaging data. Two nitrogen (N) fertilizer experiments were carried out to obtain the hyperspectral images of fresh maize leaves. The partial least squares regression (PLSR) method was used to build the estimation models of various amino acid contents by using the reflectance of all bands, sensitive band range, and sensitive bands. The models were then validated with the independent dataset. The results showed that (1) the spectral reflectance of most amino acids was more sensitive in the range of 400–717.08 nm than other bands. The estimation accuracy was better by using the reflectance of the sensitive band range than that of all bands; (2) the sensitive bands of most amino acids were in the ranges of 505.39–605 nm and 651–714 nm; and (3) among the 24 amino acids, the estimation models of the β-aminobutyric acid, ornithine, citrulline, methionine, and histidine achieved higher accuracy than those of other amino acids, with the R2, relative root mean square error (RE), and relative percent deviation (RPD) of the measured and estimated value of testing samples in the range of 0.84–0.96, 8.79%–19.77%, and 2.58–5.18, respectively.

The conventional method for rice yield-related trait evaluation faces the problems of rice threshing difficulties, measurement process complexity, and low efficiency. To solve these problems, a novel intelligent system, which includes an integrated threshing unit, grain conveyor-imaging units, threshed panicle conveyor-imaging unit, and specialized image analysis software has been proposed to achieve rice yield trait evaluation with high throughput and high accuracy. To improve the threshed panicle detection accuracy, the Region of Interest Align, Convolution Batch normalization activation with Leaky Relu module, Squeeze-and-Excitation unit, and optimal anchor size have been adopted to optimize the Faster-RCNN architecture, termed ‘TPanicle-RCNN,’ and the new model achieved F1 score 0.929 with an increase of 0.044, which was robust to indica and japonica varieties. Additionally, AI cloud computing was adopted, which dramatically reduced the system cost and improved flexibility. To evaluate the system accuracy and efficiency, 504 panicle samples were tested, and the total spikelet measurement error decreased from 11.44 to 2.99% with threshed panicle compensation. The average measuring efficiency was approximately 40 s per sample, which was approximately twenty times more efficient than manual measurement. In this study, an automatic and intelligent system for rice yield-related trait evaluation was developed, which would provide an efficient and reliable tool for rice breeding and genetic research.

To investigate the effects of depth and input dimensions of the proposed model, careful validations are performed by extensive numerical simulation. The results give an optimal depth (19) and recommend a limited input dimension (under 200). Furthermore, compared with the baseline models, including support vector regression, decision tree regression, and residual regression, our proposed model with the optimal depth performs best. Ultimately, DenseNet regression is applied to predict relative humidity, and the outcome shows a high correlation with observations, which indicates that our model could advance environmental data science. © 2022 by the authors.

Primarily, how do we produce more, but in a way that is healthier for the animals, public, and the environment? Implementing a smart agri-systems approach, utilising multiplatform precision technologies, internet of things, data analytics, machine learning, digital twinning and other emerging technologies can support a more informed decision-making and forecasting position that will allow us to move towards greater sustainability in future. If we look to precision agronomy, there are a wide range of technologies available and examples of how digitalisation and integration of platform outputs can lead to advances in understanding the agricultural system and forecasting upcoming events and performance that have hitherto been impossible to achieve. There is much for the livestock sector and animal scientists to learn from the developments of precision technologies and smart agri-system approaches in the arable and horticultural contexts. However, there are several barriers the livestock sector must overcome: (i) the development and implementation of precision livestock farming technologies that can be easily integrated and analysed without the support of a dedicated data analyst in house; (ii) the lack of extensive validation of many developed and available precision livestock farming technologies means that reliability and accuracy are likely to be compromised when applied in commercial practice; (iii) the best smart agri-systems approaches are reliant on large quantities of data from across a wide variety of conditions, but at present the complications of data sharing, commercial sensitivities, data ownership, and permissions make it challenging to obtain or knit together data from different parts of the system into a comprehensive picture; and (iv) the high level of investment needed to develop and scale these technologies is substantial and represents significant risk for companies when a technology is emerging. Using a case study of the National Pig Centre (a flagship pig research facility in the UK) we discuss how a smart agri-systems approach can be applied in practice to investigate alternative future systems for production, and enable monitoring of these systems as a commercial demonstrator site for future pork production. © 2022 The Author(s)","Digital farming; Pork; Precision Livestock Farming; Production; Systems approach","agricultural land; agriculture; animal; livestock; meat; pig; reproducibility; Agriculture; Animals; Farms; Livestock; Meat; Reproducibility of Results; Swine",Article,Scopus

However, there are few studies quantitatively predicting the internal thermal and moisture environment of duck houses. In this study, high-accuracy recurrent neural network (RNN) models were used to predict the internal air temperature and relative humidity of mechanically and naturally ventilated duck houses. The models were developed according to the type of duck houses, seasons, and environmental variables by learning the monitoring data of the internal and external environments. The optimal sequence length of learning data for the development of the RNN model was selected as 120 min. As a result of the validation, both air temperature and relative humidity could be accurately predicted within 1% error. In addition, simplified RNN models were additionally developed by learning only from the data of external air temperature, relative humidity, and duck weight, which are relatively easy to acquire at the farms. The accuracy of the simplified RNN models was similar to the basic model for predicting the internal air temperature and relative humidity of duck houses in real time. In the future, for the convergence of information and communications technologies (ICTs) and application of smart farms in duck houses, the RNN models of duck houses developed in this study can be applied to predict and control the internal environments of duck houses using the model predictive control (MPC) technique. © 2022 by the authors.

However, these methods are with heavy-weight architectures in nature, and hence require a higher storage and expensive training operations due to feeding a large number of training parameters. There is a necessity to explore lightweight deep learning models without compromising the classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a lightweight deep learning model using the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model and attention module. First, the convolution features are extracted to capture the high-level object-based information. Second, an attention module is used to capture the interesting semantic information. The convolution and attention modules are then combined together to fuse both the high-level object-based information and the interesting semantic information, which is followed by the fully connected layers and the softmax layer. Evaluation of our proposed method, which leverages transfer learning approach, on three public fruit-related benchmark datasets shows that our proposed method outperforms the four latest deep learning methods with a smaller number of trainable parameters and a superior classification accuracy. Our model has a great potential to be adopted by industries closely related to the fruit growing and retailing or processing chain for automatic fruit identification and classifications in the future.

Remote sensing products were generated using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 time series data and calibrated with data collected from farmers’ fields. We derived maps showing spatial variation in crop extent, crop growth stages and leaf area index (LAI), which are crucial in yield assessment. Crop classification was performed on Sentinel-2 time series data using spectral matching techniques (SMTs) and crop management information collected from field surveys along with ground data. The locations of crop cutting experiments (CCEs) was identified based on crop extent maps.

A theory-grounded, normalized measure of systemic risk, R2, is developed and made amenable to empirical analysis through the logit link. The measure is estimated on a large-scale, unit-level corn yield dataset. We find that systemic risk explains less than half of total unit yield variability on average, suggesting that the risk management effectiveness of area yield insurance is low. By relating natural resource endowments with systemic risk, we find that more excessive heat and drought events lead to larger while more excessive precipitation events lead to smaller systemic risk. We then study whether current area yield insurance subsidy rates provide farmers with sufficient subsidy transfers to compensate for the uncovered risk exposure associated with area yield insurance. A new concept, the threshold relative area subsidy rate (TRASR), quantifies a lower bound on the ratio of area yield insurance subsidy rate over individual yield insurance subsidy rate below which risk-averse farmers should always prefer individual yield insurance to area yield insurance. The calibrated TRASR values indicate that current area yield insurance subsidy rates discourage farmers from choosing area yield insurance over individual yield insurance, especially at low area yield insurance coverage levels. We also find that TRASR is positively correlated with systemic risk at the unit-level of analysis, suggesting that farmers who like area yield insurance's risk management features will dislike its transfer implications and vice versa. © 2022 The Authors.

The goal of this work was to develop a new algorithm for early yield prediction in different grapevine varieties using computer vision and machine learning. Vines from six grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) varieties were photographed using a mobile platform in a commercial vineyard at pea-size berry stage. A SegNet architecture was employed to detect the visible berries and canopy features. All features were used to train support vector regression (SVR) models for predicting number of actual berries and yield. Regarding the berries’ detection step, a F1-score average of 0.72 and coefficients of determination (R2) above 0.92 were achieved for all varieties between the number of estimated and the number of actual visible berries. The method yielded average values for root mean squared error (RMSE) of 195 berries, normalized RMSE (NRMSE) of 23.83% and R2 of 0.79 between the number of estimated and the number of actual berries per vine using the leave-one-out cross validation method. In terms of yield forecast, the correlation between the actual yield and its estimated value yielded R2 between 0.54 and 0.87 among different varieties and NRMSE between 16.47% and 39.17% while the global model (including all varieties) had a R2 equal to 0.83 and NRMSE of 29.77%.

Potential Evapotranspiration was estimated by the Thornthwaite method. The model performed good agreement in predicting paddy’s water balance for the period of 2017-18. Also, Projections of the future climate in the Kunshan region, showed that there will be a decrease in the annual precipitation during rice-growing seasons for both Near Future (2021-2060) and Far Future (2061-2099). The DRAINMOD model was utilized to evaluate the impact of such a future decrease in precipitation on ground Water Tables Depth. Compared to the rice-growing season of 2018, DRAINMOD simulations showed that future Water Table Depths will drop by 38% to 40% for both the Near Future and Far Future under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Such future remarkable drop in Water Table Depths may affect rice yield in the study region. The future water balance in the study area was re-simulated after replacing conventional drainage with Controlled Drainage and an increase in the drain spacing. Simulations revealed that practicing Controlled Drainage and an increase in drain spacing mitigated the future drop in Water Table Depths, thus ensuring better soil moisture conditions for rice.

We focus on the six climatic factors that affect crops growth, including temperature, humidity, illumination, carbon dioxide concentration, soil temperature and soil humidity, and propose a GCP_lstm model for greenhouse climate prediction. The climate change in greenhouse is nonlinear, so we use long short-term memory (LSTM) model to capture the dependence between historical climate data. Moreover, the short-term climate has a greater impact on the future trend of greenhouse climate change. Therefore, we added a 5-min time sliding window through the analysis experiment. In addition, sensors sometimes collect wrong climate data. Based on the existence of abnormal data, our model still has good robustness.

Improving the reliability and accuracy of wind and solar energy predictions can enhance the power system stability. This study aims to contribute to the issues of wind and solar energy fluctuation and intermittence by proposing a high-quality prediction model based on neural networks (NNs). The most efficient technology for analyzing the future performance of wind speed and solar irradiance is recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Bidirectional RNNs (BRNNs) have the advantages of manipulating the information in two opposing directions and providing feedback to the same outputs via two different hidden layers. A BRNN’s output layer concurrently receives information from both the backward layers and the forward layers. The bidirectional long short-term memory (BI-LSTM) prediction model was designed to predict wind speed, solar irradiance, and ambient temperature for the next 169 h. The solar irradiance data include global horizontal irradiance (GHI), direct normal irradiance (DNI), and diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI). The historical data collected from Dumat al-Jandal City covers the period from 1 January 1985 to 26 June 2021, as hourly intervals. The findings demonstrate that the BI-LSTM model has promising performance in terms of evaluation, with considerable accuracy for all five types of historical data, particularly for wind speed and ambient temperature values.

The trials were performed in two years (Y) (Y1 = 2016 and Y2 = 2017) and in two locations (L) (L1 and L2) under four ecological conditions of the year-location interaction (E1-E4) and in two densities (D1 and D2) (50,000 and 65,000 plants ha−1). Prior to tasselling, the following five treatments of detasseling and defoliation (T) were applied: T1-control, no leaf removal only detasseling, T2-T5-removal of tassels and top leaves (from one to four top leaves). The defoliation treatments had the most pronounced effect on the yield reduction in G1 (T1-Tn+1… T5), p < 0.05.

We investigated how effective crop canopy properties, including leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content, and canopy height, are as predictors of winter wheat yield over various lead times. Models were calibrated and validated on fertiliser trials over two years in fields in the UK. Correlations of LAI and plant height with yield were stronger than for yield and chlorophyll con-tent. Yield prediction models calibrated in one year and tested on another suggested that LAI and height provided the most robust outcomes. Linear models had equal or smaller validation errors than machine learning. The information content of data for yield prediction degraded strongly with time before harvest, and in application to years not included in the calibration. Thus, impact of soil and weather variation between years on crop phenotypes was critical in changing the interactions between crop variables and yield (i.e., slopes and intercepts of regression models) and was a key contributor to predictive error. These results show that canopy property data provide valuable information on crop status for yield assessment, but with important limitations. © 2021 by the author.

The objective of this article is to identify, assess, and synthesize the papers that discuss the application of machine learning in the dairy farm management context. Using a systematic literature review (SLR) protocol, we retrieved 427 papers, of which 38 papers were determined as primary studies and thus were analysed in detail. More than half of the papers (55 %) addressed disease detection. The other two categories of problems addressed were milk production and milk quality. Seventy-one independent variables were identified and grouped into seven categories. The two prominent categories that were used in more than half of the papers were milking parameters and milk properties. The other categories of independent variables were milk content, pregnancy/calving information, cow characteristics, lactation, and farm characteristics. Twenty-three algorithms were identified, which we grouped into four categories. Decision tree-based algorithms are by far the most used followed by artificial neural network-based algorithms. Regression-based algorithms and other algorithms that do not belong to the previous categories were used in 13 papers. Twenty-three evaluation parameters were identified of which 7 were used 3 or more times. The three evaluation parameters that were used by more than half of the papers are sensitivity, specificity, RMSE. The challenges most encountered were feature selection and unbalanced data and together with problem size, overfitting/estimating, and parameter tuning account for three-quarters of the challenges identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SLR study on the use of machine learning to improve dairy farm management, and to this end, this study will be valuable not only for researchers but also practitioners in dairy farms. © 2020 The Author(s)","Dairy cows; Decision support; Disease detection; Machine learning; Systematic literature review","artificial neural network; dairying; decision tree; dependent variable; disease classification; evaluation study; feature selection; food quality; human; independent variable; machine learning; milk production; priority journal; Review; sensitivity and specificity; systematic review; animal; bovine; dairying; female; machine learning; procedures; Animals; Cattle; Dairying; Female; Machine Learning",Review,Scopus

It argues that while fully or partially automating discretionary EIA decisions is legally and technically problematic, there is significant potential for data-driven decision-making tools to provide superior analysis and predictions to better inform EIA processes. Discretionary decision-making is desirable for EIA decisions given the inherent complexity associated with environmental regulation and the prediction of future impacts. This article demonstrates that current ADM tools cannot adequately replicate human discretionary processes for EIAs—even if there is human oversight and review of automated outputs. Instead of fully or partially automating EIA decisions, data-driven decision-making can be more appropriately deployed to enhance data analysis and predictions to optimise EIA decision-making processes. This latter type of ADM can augment decision-making processes without displacing the critical role of human discretion in weighing the complex environmental, social and economic considerations inherent in EIA determinations. © The Author/s 2021","automated decision making; data-driven decision making; discretionary decisions; Environmental impact assessments",,Article,Scopus

This research proposes two machine learning models for the prediction of food production. The adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) methods are used to advance the prediction models. In the present study, two variables of livestock production and agricultural production were considered as the source of food production. Three variables were used to evaluate livestock production, namely livestock yield, live animals, and animal slaughtered, and two variables were used to assess agricultural production, namely agricultural production yields and losses. Iran was selected as the case study of the current study. Therefore, time-series data related to livestock and agricultural productions in Iran from 1961 to 2017 have been collected from the FAOSTAT database. First, 70% of this data was used to train ANFIS and MLP, and the remaining 30% of the data was used to test the models. The results disclosed that the ANFIS model with generalized bell-shaped (Gbell) built-in membership functions has the lowest error level in predicting food production. The findings of this study provide a suitable tool for policymakers who can use this model and predict the future of food production to provide a proper plan for the future of food security and food supply for the next generations. © 2021 by the authors.

In simple terms, it is a mood disturbance that can persist for an individual for more than a few weeks to months. In MDD, in most cases, the individuals do not consult a professional, and even if being consulted, the results are not significant as the individuals find it challenging to identify whether they are depressed or not. Depression, most of the time, cooccurs with anxiety and leads to suicide in few cases, among the employees, who are about to handle the pressure at work and home and mostly unnoticing such problems. This is why this work aims to analyze the IT employees who are mostly working with targets. The artificial neural network, which is modeled loosely like the brain, has proved in recent days that it can perform better than most of the classification algorithms. This study has implemented the multilayered neural perceptron and experimented with the backpropagation technique over the data samples collected from IT professionals. This study aims to develop a model that can classify depressed individuals from those who are not depressed effectively with the data collected from them manually and through sensors.

In this study, we investigate the development of a CNN to automate the classification of agriculture from medium-resolution satellite imagery as an alternative to manual interpretation. The residual network (ResNet50) CNN architecture was trained and validated for delineating the agricultural area using labelled multi-seasonal Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) satellite imagery (32 m) of Helmand and Kandahar provinces. The effect of input image chip size, training sampling strategy, elevation data, and multi-seasonal imagery were investigated. The best-performing single-year classification used an input chip size of 33 × 33 pixels, a targeted sampling strategy and transfer learning, resulting in high overall accuracy (94%). The inclusion of elevation data marginally lowered performance (93%). Multi-seasonal classification achieved an overall accuracy of 89% using the previous two years’ data. Only 25% of the target year’s training samples were necessary to update the model to achieve >94% overall accuracy. A data-driven approach to automate agricultural mask production using CNNs is proposed to reduce the burden of human interpretation.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of projected temperature and precipitation changes on crop yields in the Monocacy River Watershed in the Mid-Atlantic United States based on climate change scenarios. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to simulate watershed hydrology and crop yield. To evaluate the effect of future climate projections, four global climate models (GCMs) and three representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5, 6, and 8.5) were used in the SWAT model. According to all GCMs and RCPs, a warmer climate with a wetter Autumn and Spring and a drier late Summer season is anticipated by mid and late century in this region. To evaluate future management strategies, water budget and crop yields were assessed for two scenarios: current rainfed and adaptive irrigated conditions. Irrigation would improve corn yields during mid-century across all scenarios. However, prolonged irrigation would have a negative impact due to nutrients runoff on both corn and soybean yields compared to rainfed condition. Decision tree analysis indicated that corn and soybean yields are most influenced by soil moisture, temperature, and precipitation as well as the water management practice used (i.e., rainfed or irrigated). The computed values from the SWAT modeling can be used as guidelines for water resource managers in this watershed to plan for projected water shortages and manage crop yields based on projected climate change conditions. © 2020 by the authors.

Modern bioenergy using resources such as agricultural wastes and residues and through growing energy crops can provide alternative low carbon renewable energy opportunities. This research applies the Biomass Resource Model to explore potential bioenergy opportunities in Kenya. Attributional LCA analyses is undertaken to evaluate the potential GHG savings that may be achieved if briquettes produced from Kenyan biomass are used to replace fossil and traditional bioenergy fuels for household cooking and for industry.

New datasets on bicycling incidents are available via crowdsourcing applications, with opportunity for analyses that characterize reporting patterns. Our goal was to characterize patterns of injury in crowdsourced bicycle incident reports from BikeMaps.org. We extracted 281 incidents reported on the BikeMaps.org global mapping platform and analyzed 21 explanatory variables representing personal, trip, route, and crash characteristics. We used a balanced random forest classifier to classify three outcomes: (i) collisions resulting in injury requiring medical treatment; (ii) collisions resulting in injury but the bicyclist did not seek medical treatment; and (iii) collisions that did not result in injury. Results indicate the ranked importance and direction of relationship for explanatory variables. By knowing conditions that are most associated with injury we can target interventions to reduce future risk. The most important reporting pattern overall was the type of object the bicyclist collided with. Increased probability of injury requiring medical treatment was associated with collisions with animals, train tracks, transient hazards, and left-turning motor vehicles. Falls, right hooks, and doorings were associated with incidents where the bicyclist was injured but did not seek medical treatment, and conflicts with pedestrians and passing motor vehicles were associated with minor collisions with no injuries. In Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, bicycling safety would be improved by additional infrastructure to support safe left turns and around train tracks. Our findings support previous research using hospital admissions data that demonstrate how non-motor vehicle crashes can lead to bicyclist injury and that route characteristics and conditions are factors in bicycling collisions.

Even though superior bias correction methods can correct the distribution of daily precipitation amounts, as well as the wet-day frequency, they usually fail to correct the temporal sequence or structure of precipitation occurrence. To solve this problem, we presented a hybrid bias correction method for simulating the temporal sequence of daily precipitation occurrence. We did this by combining a first-order two-state Markov chain with a quantile-mapping (QM) based bias correction method. Specifically, a QM-based method was used to correct the distributional attributes of daily precipitation amounts and the wet-day frequency simulated by climate models. Then, the sequence of precipitation occurrence was simulated using the first-order two-state Markov chain with its parameters adjusted based on linear relationships between QM-corrected mean monthly precipitation and the transition probabilities of precipitation occurrence. The proposed Markov chain-based bias correction (MCBC) method was compared with the QM-based method with respect to reproducing the temporal structure of precipitation occurrence over 10 meteorological stations across China. The results showed that the QM-based method was unable to correct the temporal sequence, with the cumulative frequency of wet-and dry-spell length being considerably underestimated for most stations. The MCBC method can could reproduce the temporal sequence of precipitation occurrence, with the generated cumulative frequency of wet-and dry-spell lengths fitting that of the observation well. The proposed method also performed reasonably well with respect to reproducing the mean, standard deviation, and the longest length of observed wet-and dry-spells. Overall, the MCBC method can simulate the temporal sequence of precipitation occurrence, along with correcting the distributional attributes of precipitation amounts. This method can be used with crop and hydrological models in climate change impact studies at the field and small watershed scales. © 2020 by the authors.

This topic is currently relevant, as in the context of the rapid technological development and various innovations in the digital sphere; there is still considerable uncertainty about using AI in agricultural production. During the preparatory phase, an analysis of publications in the Web of Science (WoS) allowed to identify the nature and scope of the application of AI technologies in agriculture. Relying on a survey of managers from 55 agricultural organizations, the study determines the problems and prospects of using AI technologies in the regional agriculture. The respondents claim it is appropriate to use AI technologies for producing livestock products (26.0 %) and ensuring animal welfare (18.5 %). Considering the application of such technologies, the respondents expect an increase in production (23.2 %) and a decrease in costs (20.3 %). More than half of the respondents express their belief that AI technologists will significantly change agricultural production, reducing low-skilled labour employment while creating new jobs in the intellectual sphere. However, a positive perception of AI technologies may be the reason for somewhat unrealistic expectations from their use. A large part of the surveyed managers (65.5 %) presumes that these technologies will increase the production profitability, even though only 9.8 % of the respondents are currently using them. The application of AI technologies in the regional agriculture is limited due to their high cost and the lack of funds. In order to overcome these constraints, it is necessary to increase state support and train staff. AI technologies will enable forecast accuracy in various areas of agriculture that will attract additional investments in the regional agriculture.

When modeling yield, the difference between potential and actual yield consistently changes because of advances in technology. Considering historical yield potential would help determine spatiotemporal trends in agricultural development. Comparing current and historical yields in Denmark is possible because yield potential has been documented throughout history. However, the current national winter wheat yield map solely uses soil properties within the model. The aim of this study was to generate a new Danish winter wheat yield map and compare the results to historical yield potential. Utilizing random forest with soil, climate, and topography variables, a winter wheat yield map was generated from 876 field trials carried out from 1992 to 2018. The random forest model performed better than the model based only on soil. The updated national yield map was then compared to yield potential maps from 1688 and 1844. While historical time periods are characterized by numerous low yield potential areas and few highly productive areas, current yield is evenly distributed between low and high yields. Advances in technology and farm practices have exceeded historical yield predictions, mainly due to the use of fertilizer, irrigation, and drainage. Thus, modeling yield projections could be unreliable in the future as technology progresses. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

This study aimed to quantify and map the dry matter yield (DMY) and nitrogen yield (NY) of French grasslands resulting from cutting and grazing practices, based on the existing diversity of grassland vegetation, management, soil and climate conditions, using a research version of the STICS crop model called PâturSTICS. This model simulates daily dry matter (DM), nitrogen (N) and water fluxes involved in the functioning of grasslands and crops in response to management and environmental conditions. It was improved to represent deposition of animal waste on grassland soils during grazing and to simulate DM production and N content of grasses and legumes more accurately. Simulations were performed for locations across France on a high-resolution grid composed of pedoclimatic units (PCU) obtained by combining the spatial resolutions of climate and soil. The main grassland types and associated management types were determined for each PCU and then simulated over 30 years (1984–2013). Using the simulated values, predictive metamodels of annual grassland DMY and NY were developed from easily accessible explanatory variables using a random forest approach. Annual model predictions were aggregated and averaged at the PCU scale, then compared to regional observations. Predicted DMY agreed with available observations, except in semi-mountainous and mountainous regions, where PâturSTICS tended to overpredict DMY, probably because it ignores effects of snow, frost and slope, and due to how it represents effects of temperature and water stress on plant growth. According to results, three-quarters of French grasslands produce and export at least 7.6 t DM ha−1 yr−1 and 172 kg N ha−1 yr−1, respectively. One-quarter of French grasslands produce and export at least 10.7 t DM ha−1 yr−1 and 254 kg N ha−1 yr−1, respectively. The latter are located mainly in north-western France, the north-western Massif Central, the French Alps and the western Pyrénées, all of which have environmental conditions favourable for grass growth. The metamodels developed are interesting proxies for PâturSTICS’ predictions of grassland DMY and NY. Our results provided valuable knowledge that promotes better use of the potential forage production of French and European grasslands to improve protein self-sufficiency and N fertilisation management in ruminant livestock systems. © 2019","Dry matter yield; France; Grassland; Modelling; Nitrogen yield; STICS","agricultural modeling; crop yield; dry matter; environmental conditions; grassland; nitrogen; resolution; water stress; Alps; France; Massif Central; Pyrenees; Animalia; Poaceae",Article,Scopus

The ability of thermal remote sensing to detect nitrogen deficiency in corn may enable precision agriculture to modify nitrogen rates according to field conditions. This study applies the exergy destruction principle as a theory to explain the inverse relationship between surface temperature and nitrogen rate. Two hypotheses were developed. First, it was hypothesized that agricultural crops experiencing greater growth and providing greater yield will have lower surface temperature. The second hypothesis was that corn grown under optimum levels of nitrogen will have lower surface temperatures compared to corn grown under nitrogen stressed conditions. Field studies were conducted during two summer seasons (2016 and 2017) on an established long-term field trial of corn yield response to varying rates of nitrogen. It was found that corn surface temperature decreased as the rate of nitrogen increased. A shallow but statistically significant (P < 0.05) negative slope was observed consistently with increasing rates of nitrogen. Surface temperature measurements, however, were variable. This variability was the result of external and weather dependent variables that influenced leaf surface temperature. Despite this variability, the exergy destruction principle provides a theory from which thermal remote sensing can be applied through the use of surface temperature measurements to detect physiological stress in crop plants. © 2019 The author(s)publisher.",,,Article,Scopus

Here, we describe the theoretical foundations of DL and provide a generic code that can be easily modified to suit specific needs. DL comprises a wide variety of algorithms which depend on numerous hyperparameters. Careful optimization of hyperparameter values is critical to avoid overfitting. Among the DL architectures currently tested in genomic prediction, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) seem more promising than multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). A limitation of DL is in interpreting the results. This may not be relevant for genomic prediction in plant or animal breeding but can be critical when deciding the genetic risk to a disease. Although DL technologies are not ”plug-and-play”, they are easily implemented using Keras and TensorFlow public software.

In this paper, crop models are distilled by CNN to evaluate the ability of deep learning to identify the plant physiology knowledge behind such crop models simply by learning. Due to difficulty in collecting big data on crop growth, a crop model was used to generate datasets. The generated datasets were fed into CNN for distillation of the crop model. The models trained by CNN were evaluated by the visualization of saliency maps. In this study, three saliency maps were calculated using all datasets (case 1) and using datasets with spikelet sterility due to either high temperature at anthesis (case 2) or cool summer damage (case 3). The results of case 1 indicated that CNN determined the developmental index of paddy rice, which was implemented in the crop model, simply by learning. Moreover, CNN identified the important individual environmental factors affecting the grain yield. Although CNN had no prior knowledge of spikelet sterility, cases 2 and 3 indicated that CNN realized about paddy rice becoming sensitive to daily mean and maximum temperatures during specific periods. Such deep learning approaches can be used to accelerate the understanding of crop models and make the models more portable. Moreover, the results indicated that CNN can be used to develop new plant physiology theories simply by learning. © 2019 Kyosuke Yamamoto.

The objective of this study was to investigate if Sentinel-2 satellite images could be used to predict within-season biomass sorghum yields in the Mediterranean region. Thirteen machine learning algorithms were tested on fortnightly Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B estimates of the fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR) in combination with in situ aboveground biomass yields from demonstrative fields in Italy. A gradient boosting algorithm implementing the xgbtree method was the best predictive model as it was satisfactorily implemented anywhere from May to July. The best prediction time was the month of May followed by May–June and May–July. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first time Sentinel-2-derived fAPAR is used in sorghum biomass predictive modeling.

This heterogeneity often arises from landscape elements like forests, hedges, or single trees and shrubs that cast shadows. Shading from forested areas or shrubs has effects on transpiration, temperature, and soil moisture, all of which affect the crop yield in the adjacent arable land. Transitional gradients of solar irradiance can be described as a function of the distance to the zero line (edge), the cardinal direction, and the height of trees. The magnitude of yield reduction in transition zones is highly influenced by solar irradiance—a factor that is not yet implemented in crop growth models on a landscape level. We present a spatially explicit model for shading caused by forested areas, in agricultural landscapes. With increasing distance to forest, solar irradiance and yield increase. Our model predicts that the shading effect from the forested areas occurs up to 15 m from the forest edge, for the simulated wheat yields, and up to 30 m, for simulated maize. Moreover, we estimated the spatial extent of transition zones, to calculate the regional yield reduction caused by shading of the forest edges, which amounted to 5% to 8% in an exemplary region. © 2019 by the authors.

A neural network classifier approach is tested over the Eastern United States (time series of 35 years) to detect extreme yield losses for corn from weather-related information. We first developed a methodology to rank a series of climate-based predictors according to the accuracy with which they classify extreme from nonextreme yield losses. The classification methodology is adapted in order to be trained with a limited number of extreme cases. Using four weather predictors—the average temperature in July and August, and the SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index) in June and July—71% of the extreme cases are well classified by this statistical model.

Data analysis was divided into four steps: i) data acquisition and preparation; ii) selection of training data; iii) building of forecasting models; and iv) spatial and temporal validation. Analysis was performed using yield data collected from 19 maize fields located in Brazil (2016 and 2017) and in the United States (2016), and normalised vegetation indices (NDVI, green NDVI and red edge NDVI) derived from Sentinel-2.

The dependence of two canopy traits, height and vigour, on fertilizer treatment was observed in a field trial comprised of ten varieties of spring wheat. A custom-built mobile ground platform (MGP) and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were deployed at the experimental site for standard red, green and blue (RGB) image collection on five occasions. Meanwhile, reference field measurements of canopy height and vigour were manually recorded during the growing season. Canopy level estimates of height and vigour for each variety and treatment were computed by image analysis. The agreement between estimates from each platform and reference measurements was statistically analysed. Estimates of canopy height derived from MGP imagery were more accurate (RMSE = 3.95 cm, R2 = 0.94) than estimates derived from UAV imagery (RMSE = 6.64 cm, R2 = 0.85). In contrast, vigour was better estimated using the UAV imagery (RMSE = 0.057, R2 = 0.57), compared to MGP imagery (RMSE = 0.063, R2 = 0.42), albeit with a significant fixed and proportional bias. The ability of the platforms to capture differential development of traits as a function of fertilizer treatment was also investigated. Both imaging methodologies observed a higher median canopy height of treated plots compared with untreated plots throughout the season, and a greater median vigour of treated plots compared with untreated plots exhibited in the early growth stages. While the UAV imaging provides a high-throughput method for canopy-level trait determination, the MGP imaging captures subtle canopy structures, potentially useful for fine-grained analyses of plants. © 2018 by the authors.","Canopy imaging; Canopy traits; Field phenotyping; Height; Mobile ground platform; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vigour; Wheat","Aerial photography; Fertilizers; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Canopy traits; Height; Mobile ground platform; Phenotyping; Vigour; Wheat; Antennas",Article,Scopus

An accurate estimation of PET requires many input climate variables which are, in most cases, not available prior to the 1960s for the UK, nor indeed most parts of the world. Therefore, when applying hydrological models to earlier periods, modellers have to rely on PET estimations derived from simplified methods. Given that only monthly observed temperature data is readily available for the late 19th and early 20th century at a national scale for the UK, the objective of this work was to derive the best possible UK-wide gridded PET dataset from the limited data available.To that end, firstly, a combination of (i) seven temperature-based PET equations, (ii) four different calibration approaches and (iii) seven input temperature data were evaluated. For this evaluation, a gridded daily PET product based on the physically based Penman-Monteith equation (the CHESS PET dataset) was used, the rationale being that this provides a reliable ""ground truth"" PET dataset for evaluation purposes, given that no directly observed, distributed PET datasets exist. The performance of the models was also compared to a ""naïve method"", which is defined as the simplest possible estimation of PET in the absence of any available climate data. The ""naïve method"" used in this study is the CHESS PET daily long-term average (the period from 1961 to 1990 was chosen), or CHESS-PET daily climatology.The analysis revealed that the type of calibration and the input temperature dataset had only a minor effect on the accuracy of the PET estimations at catchment scale. From the seven equations tested, only the calibrated version of the McGuinness-Bordne equation was able to outperform the ""naïve method"" and was therefore used to derive the gridded, reconstructed dataset. The equation was calibrated using 43 catchments across Great Britain.The dataset produced is a 5km gridded PET dataset for the period 1891 to 2015, using the Met Office 5km monthly gridded temperature data available for that time period as input data for the PET equation. The dataset includes daily and monthly PET grids and is complemented with a suite of mapped performance metrics to help users assess the quality of the data spatially.This dataset is expected to be particularly valuable as input to hydrological models for any catchment in the UK. © Author(s) 2018.",,,Article,Scopus

Most wheat production studies use the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to estimate the production and yield of wheat and other crops. On the one hand, few studies use the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) to determine crop yield and production on a regional level. This is possibly due to a lack of continuity of MERIS. On the other hand, the emergence of Sentinel 2 open new possibilities for the research and application of MTCI. This study has built two empirical models to estimate wheat production and yield in Andalusia. To this end, the study used the complete times series (weekly images from 2006–2011) of the MTCI vegetation index from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) sensor associated with the Andalusian yearbook for agricultural and fishing statistics (AEAP—Anuario de estadísticas agrarias y pesqueras de Andalucía).

However, the selection of the most accurate method to estimate MAP can be daunting because there are numerous methods to choose from (e.g., proximate gauge, direct weighted average, surface-fitting, and remotely sensed methods). Multiple methods (n = 19) were used to estimate MAP with precipitation data from 11 distributed monitoring sites, and 4 remotely sensed data sets. Each method was validated against the hydrologic model simulated stream flow using the Soil andWater Assessment Tool (SWAT). SWAT was validated using a split-site method and the observed stream flow data from five nested-scale gauging sites in a mixed-land-use watershed of the central USA. Cross-validation results showed the error associated with surface-fitting and remotely sensed methods ranging from -4.5% to -5.1%, and -9.8% to -14.7%, respectively. Split-site validation results showed the percent bias (PBIAS) values that ranged from -4.5% to -160%. Second order polynomial functions especially overestimated precipitation and subsequent stream flow simulations (PBIAS = -160) in the headwaters. The results indicated that using an inverse-distance weighted, linear polynomial interpolation or multiquadric function method to estimate MAP may improve SWAT model simulations. Collectively, the results highlight the importance of spatially distributed observed hydroclimate data for precipitation and subsequent steam flow estimations. The MAP methods demonstrated in the current work can be used to reduce hydrologic model uncertainty caused by watershed physiographic differences. © 2017 by the authors.","CHIRPS; MAP; Mixed-land-use hydrology; Precipitation; PRISM; SWAT; TRMM","Land use; Maps; Precipitation (chemical); Prisms; Remote sensing; Stream flow; Uncertainty analysis; Watersheds; CHIRPS; Distributed monitoring; Inverse distance weighted; Mixed land use; Multiquadric function; Second-order polynomial; SWAT; TRMM; Inverse problems; interpolation; land use change; performance assessment; precipitation intensity; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; TRMM; watershed; United States",Article,Scopus

Given the interconnectedness between freshwater availability and many ecosystem services, including food provisioning, it is important to evaluate the drought implications on freshwater provisioning and food provisioning services. Studies about drought implications on streamflow, nutrient loads, and crop yields have been increased and these variables are all process-based model outputs that could represent ecosystem functions that contribute to the ecosystem services. However, few studies evaluate drought effects on ecosystem services such as freshwater and food provisioning and quantify these services using an index-based ecosystem service approach. In this study, the drought implications on freshwater and food provisioning services were evaluated for 14 four-digit HUC (Hydrological Unit Codes) subbasins in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB), using three drought indices: standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized soil water content index (SSWI), and standardized streamflow index (SSI). The results showed that the seasonal freshwater provisioning was highly affected by the precipitation deficits and/or surpluses in summer and autumn. A greater importance of hydrological drought than meteorological drought implications on freshwater provisioning was evident for the majority of the subbasins, as evidenced by higher correlations between freshwater provisioning and SSI12 than SPI12. Food provisioning was substantially affected by the precipitation and soil water deficits during summer and early autumn, with relatively less effect observed in winter. A greater importance of agricultural drought effects on food provisioning was evident for most of the subbasins during crop reproductive stages. Results from this study may provide insights to help make effective land management decisions in responding to extreme climate conditions in order to protect and restore freshwater provisioning and food provisioning services in the UMRB. © 2017 by the authors.

This study evaluated crop sub-model parameters of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a widely used, physically based, hydrological model. Baseline SWAT crop parameters were calibrated at the model hydrologic-response-unit-scale using 10 years of replicated field-scale data at one site and validated using 5 years at a second site for corn and grain sorghum, and new parameters were developed and tested for sweet sorghum (bioenergy crop) using 4 years of unreplicated field data. Calibration of crop yields focused on four parameters: lower harvest index (WYSF), harvest index for optimal growing condition (HVSTI), radiation use efficiency (BIO_E), and maximum leaf area index (BLAI). Calibration improved model performance and resulted in slight changes to SWAT default values for four parameters for corn and sorghum. These results provide important preliminary parameters for modeling sweet sorghum in SWAT; both BIO_E and BLAI were greater than default values for grain sorghum. Calibrated parameters improved model performance in validation of corn but not grain sorghum, which was heavily influenced by drought conditions and possibly other management differences at the validation site. Results of this study support use of site-specific, rather than default or off-site, calibration of crop-model parameters to minimize effects on model performance of different soil, water, and nutrient management conditions. Watershed-specific, field-scale crop-yield calibration methods demonstrated in this study are recommended to reduce the plant-growth-related systematic error component of larger-scale hydrological processes (such as streamflow). © 2016","Corn; Crop model; Grain sorghum; Hydrologic modeling; SWAT; Sweet sorghum","Agriculture; Biofuels; Calibration; Grain (agricultural product); Hydrology; Plants (botany); Rain; Soils; Watersheds; Corn; Crop model; Grain sorghum; Hydrologic modeling; SWAT; Sweet sorghum; Crops; accuracy assessment; agricultural management; crop yield; growth rate; hydrological modeling; leaf area index; light use efficiency; maize; model validation; performance assessment; soil management; sorghum; water management; watershed; Sorghum bicolor bicolor; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The MOD09A1 data, which are eight-day interval surface reflectance data, were obtained from day of the year (DOY) 89 to 337 to calculate the leaf area index (LAI). The sum of the LAI from early in the season to a given date in the season (end of DOY (EOD)) was well fitted to a logistic function and represented seasonal changes in leaf area duration (LAD). A simple phenology model was derived to estimate the dates of emergence and maturity using the LAD-logistic function parameters b1 and b2, which represented the rate of increase in LAI and the date of maximum LAI, respectively. The phenology model predicted emergence and maturity dates fairly well, with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 6.3 and 4.9 days for the validation dataset, respectively. Two simple linear regression models (YP and YF) were established using LAD as the variable to predict corn yield. The yield model YP used LAD from predicted emergence to maturity, and the yield model Yf used LAD for a predetermined period from DOY 89 to a particular EOD. When state/province corn yields for the validation dataset were predicted at DOY 321, near completion of the corn harvest, the YP model, including the predicted phenology, performed much better than the Yf model, with RMSE values of 0.68 t/ha and 0.66 t/ha for Illinois and Heilongjiang, respectively. The Yp model showed similar or better performance, even for the much earlier pre-harvest yield prediction at DOY 257. In addition, the model performance showed no difference between the two study regions with very different climates and cultivation methods, including cultivar and irrigation management. These results suggested that the approach described in this paper has potential for application to relatively wide agroclimatic regions with different cultivation methods and for extension to the other crops. However, it needs to be examined further in tropical and sub-tropical regions, which are very different from the two study regions with respect to agroclimatic constraints and agrotechnologies. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","LAD; Logistic function; MODIS; Phenology; Yield","Biology; Crops; Cultivation; Forecasting; Image reconstruction; Mean square error; Radiometers; Regression analysis; Satellite imagery; Irrigation management; Logistic functions; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer datum; MODIS; Phenology; Root mean square errors; Simple linear regression; Yield; Climate models",Article,Scopus

The land surface scheme of RegCM4 was modified to incorporate an East-West reforested zone (15°N and 20°N). Two runs were performed using the standard version of RegCM4 and the modified one of the same model taking into account the incorporated forest. The reforestation significantly modifies rainfall signal over West Africa by increasing it over the reforested zone and the Fouta Jallon highlands (FJH). This rainfall increase is associated with a strengthening of the atmospheric moisture over the reforested area. This atmospheric moisture content increase associated with the wind dynamic may explain the spatiotemporal change of the rainfall and extreme precipitation events. The analysis of the impacts of the reforestation on some rainfall indices shows an increase of the 90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles over the reforested zone and off the FJH. This reforestation also causes an increase of the maximum length of the consecutive wet days over and off FJH and a decrease of the maximum length of the consecutive dry days over the northern Sahel and the reforested zone. © 2016 Ibrahima Diba et al.",,,Article,Scopus

The CWSI varied diurnally with peaks appeared at noon, and soil water deficit led to higher CWSI values during noon. Transpiration rate (Tr), stomatal conductance (gs) and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) were high at low CWSI, and reduced with increasing CWSI. The relationship between CWSI and Pn, Tr or gs at noon was described by quadratic polynomial equations. At critical noon, CWSI values for the decline trend in Pn (0.303, 0.385 and 0.446 at tillering, panicle initiation to booting, milk to soft dough stage) were higher than for decline in Tr and gs. Assuming a 5% reduction in Pn from maximum is moderate water deficit, the critical CWSI values were 0.420, 0.472 and 0.536 at tillering, panicle initiation to booting and milk to soft dough stages. CWSI at 14:00 decreased significantly with increasing relative soil moisture contents. There was a slight difference between the linear relations under different vapor pressure deficit (VPD) conditions. The critical relative soil moisture contents for a 5% reduction in Pn were 1.57%, 1.18% and 1.27% higher under high VPD than low VPD conditions. It implied that rice water status was determined in conjunction with field soil moisture content and air aridity.

Many studies have been devoted to addressing this issue. The similarity regionalization approach, a commonly used strategy, is usually limited by subjective selection of similarity measures. This paper presents an application of a partitioned update scheme based on the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to reduce the prediction uncertainties. This scheme performs real-time updating for states and parameters of a distributed hydrological model by assimilating gauged streamflow. The streamflow predictions are constrained by the physical rainfall-runoff processes defined in the distributed hydrological model and by the correlation information transferred from gauged to ungauged basins. This scheme is successfully demonstrated in a nested basin with real-world hydrological data where the subbasins have immediate upstream and downstream neighbours. The results suggest that the assimilated observed data from downstream neighbours have more important roles in reducing the streamflow prediction errors at ungauged locations. The real-time updated model parameters remain stable with reasonable spreads after short-period assimilation, while their estimation trajectories have slow variations, which may be attributable to climate and land surface changes. Although this real-time updating scheme is intended for streamflow predictions in nested basins, it can be a valuable tool in separate basins to improve hydrological predictions by assimilating multi-source data sets, including ground-based and remote-sensing observations. © 2014 Author(s).",,"Real-time updating; State parameter estimation; Streamflow prediction; data set; Kalman filter; parameterization; prediction; rainfall-runoff modeling; real time; streamflow",Article,Scopus

Here we describe and demonstrate multiple methods for 'calibrating' climate projections using an ensemble of AOGCM simulations in a 'perfect sibling' framework. Crucially, this type of analysis assesses the ability of each calibration methodology to produce reliable estimates of future climate, which is not possible just using historical observations. This type of approach could be more widely adopted for assessing calibration methodologies for crop modelling. The calibration methods assessed include the commonly used 'delta' (change factor) and 'nudging' (bias correction) approaches. We focus on daily maximum temperature in summer over Europe for this idealised case study, but the methods can be generalised to other variables and other regions. The calibration methods, which are relatively easy to implement given appropriate observations, produce more robust projections of future daily maximum temperatures and heat stress than using raw model output. The choice over which calibration method to use will likely depend on the situation, but change factor approaches tend to perform best in our examples. Finally, we demonstrate that the uncertainty due to the choice of calibration methodology is a significant contributor to the total uncertainty in future climate projections for impact studies. We conclude that utilising a variety of calibration methods on output from a wide range of AOGCMs is essential to produce climate data that will ensure robust and reliable crop yield projections. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Bias correction; Calibration; Climate model; Climate projections; Crop model; Delta method; Weather generator","air-sea interaction; assessment method; calibration; climate modeling; crop yield; environmental stress; numerical model; observational method; temperature effect; Europe",Article,Scopus

Shorter-term analysis of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) reveals that the current impact per 1°C of growing season (Apr to Oct) warming is an increase in water demands in the region by 6 to 14 %. These observations, combined with climate projections, indicate potential disruption of climate-variety balance, increasing water stress, and challenges in producing quality wines without the adoption of appropriate adaptive measures. © Inter-Research 2008..","Bioclimatic indices; Climate change; Precipitation; Temperature; Wine; Winegrapes","Forestry; Groundwater; Soil moisture; Water analysis; Water supply; Wine; Bioclimatic indices; Climate parameters; Climate projection; Critical growth; Crop evapotranspiration; Diurnal temperature ranges; Extreme temperatures; Growing season; Growth stages; Heat accumulation; Maximum temperature; Northeast Spain; Potential impacts; Precipitation; Precipitation characteristics; Reduced production; Temperature parameters; Term analysis; Water demand; Water stress; Wine quality; Winegrapes; Climate change; bioclimatology; climate change; climate effect; crop production; evapotranspiration; growing season; phenology; precipitation intensity; soil moisture; temperature effect; vine; warming; water demand; water stress; Eurasia; Europe; Southern Europe; Spain; Vitaceae; Vitis vinifera",Article,Scopus

In the recent two decades, the number of models has grown rapidly, but the increase in their quality does not match the growth in number. Often, an ensemble of multiple models is required to make a useful prediction. This ensemble approach does not facilitate the improvement of models as a tool to understand crop physiological mechanisms. On the other hand, following a bottom-up approach that tries to assemble all elements along different scales of biological organisation may result in numerically clumsy models that are not necessarily more robust than existing models in simulating phenotypes at the crop scale. We argue that to model complex crop phenotypes in a simple yet accurate manner, crop modellers should be inspired by experiences in some fundamental sciences. For example, physicists used sound theories and solid mathematics in thought experiments, and came up with seemingly simple equations to explain the behaviour of very diverse systems, from sub-atomic particles to the largest clusters of galaxies. We review examples, where biological insights and mathematics are combined to derive simple equations that apply to different processes of crop growth. The essence of this modelling approach is a combination of simplicity, elegance and robustness. Models integrating those equations can predict crop phenotypes as well as generate hypotheses or emerging properties to assist in knowing the unknowns. Thus, crop models should not only provide practical predictions, but should especially be considered as a research tool for data interpretation, system design, and heuristic understanding. © 2021 The Author(s)","Algorithm simplicity; Crop model improvement; Model heuristics; Systems behaviour","crop performance; mathematics; numerical model; phenotype; physiology",Review,Scopus

Despite this, plant diseases and unfavorable weather patterns continue to threaten the delicate balance between vegetable production and consumption. It is critical to utilize machine learning (ML) in this setting because it provides context for decision-making related to breeding goals. Cutting-edge technologies for crop genome sequencing and phenotyping, combined with advances in computer science, are currently fueling a revolution in vegetable science and technology. Additionally, various ML techniques such as prediction, classification, and clustering are frequently used to forecast vegetable crop production in the field. In the vegetable seed industry, machine learning algorithms are used to assess seed quality before germination and have the potential to improve vegetable production with desired features significantly; whereas, in plant disease detection and management, the ML approaches can improve decision-support systems that assist in converting massive amounts of data into valuable recommendations. On similar lines, in vegetable breeding, ML approaches are helpful in predicting treatment results, such as what will happen if a gene is silenced. Furthermore, ML approaches can be a saviour to insufficient coverage and noisy data generated using various omics platforms.

Limited hydroclimate and yield data, however, hamper drought impact monitoring and assessment at the farm field scale. This study demonstrates the potential of using field-scale soil moisture simulations to support highresolution agricultural yield prediction and drought monitoring at the smallholder farm field scale. We present a multiscale modeling approach that combines HydroBlocks a physically based hyper-resolution land surface model (LSM) with machine learning. We used HydroBlocks to simulate root zone soil moisture and soil temperature in Zambia at 3 h 30 m resolution. These simulations, along with remotely sensed vegetation indices, meteorological data, and descriptors of the physical landscape (related to topography, land cover, and soils) were combined with district-level maize data to train a random forest (RF) model to predict maize yields at district and field scales (250 m). Our model predicted yields with an average testing coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.57 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 310 kgha-1 using year-based cross-validation. Our predicted maize losses due to the 2015 2016 El Niño drought agreed well with losses reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Our results reveal that soil moisture is the strongest and most reliable predictor of maize yield, driving its spatial and temporal variability. Soil moisture was also a more effective indicator of drought impacts on crops than precipitation, soil and air temperatures, and remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based drought indices. This study demonstrates how field-scale modeling can help bridge the spatial-scale gap between drought monitoring and agricultural impacts. © 2021 Author(s).",,"Agricultural robots; Crops; Decision trees; Drought; Remote sensing; Topography; Vegetation; Agricultural impacts; Coefficient of determination; Field-scale soil moisture; Food and agriculture organizations; Multi-scale Modeling; Normalized difference vegetation index; Root zone soil moistures; Spatial and temporal variability; Soil moisture; agricultural land; drought; field method; soil moisture; spatial analysis; Indicator indicator",Article,Scopus

To better quantify the responses of crop yield to hydrological variability in the rainfed Corn Belt of the United States (U.S.), we analyzed the relationships between corn/soybean yield and hydrological cycle metrics, as well as their spatio-temporal dynamic at the agricultural district and interannual scale between 2003 and 2014. We used Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) to optimally integrate different hydrological metrics and drought indices to define a crop-specific new drought index that uses crop yield as the target, and investigated the contributions of those hydrological cycle components to the new drought index. We used both observed and modeled hydrological cycle metrics, as well as several drought indices in this study, including evapotranspiration (ET) and potential ET (PET), terrestrial water storage change (ΔS), surface soil moisture (SSM), river discharge (Q), Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), fET (the ratio of ET to PET), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Our results revealed that: (1) VPD, SSM, and fET showed the strongest correlations with crop yield, among the observation-based hydrological cycle metrics and drought indices considered here. Most of the hydrological cycle metrics and drought indices showed similar seasonal correlation patterns with crop yield, and this pattern revealed that the sensitivity of crop growth to water stress peaked in July for corn and in August for soybean in the rainfed U.S. Corn Belt. (2) The drought in 2012 started with higher water demand (reflected in abnormally high ET, PET, and VPD) and lower water supply (reflected in abnormally low P), followed by soil water depletion (as revealed in SSM and ΔS), leading to massive crop yield losses due to increased constraints on both water supply and demand. (3) The R2 of the PLSR-based crop yield model reached 0.76 and 0.70 for corn and soybean, respectively. For both corn and soybean, the first PLSR component was mainly composed of information from VPD, fET, ΔS and SSM, indicating atmospheric water deficit and soil water storage both play critical roles in quantifying corn and soybean yield loss due to water stress. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Crop yield; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Groundwater; Soil moisture; U.S. Corn Belt; VPD","Agricultural robots; Drought; Economics; Evapotranspiration; Plants (botany); Soil moisture; Water supply; Hydrological variability; Palmer drought severity indices; Partial least square regression; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Surface soil moisture; Terrestrial water storage; Vapor pressure deficit; Water supply and demands; Crops; agrometeorology; connectivity; crop yield; drought stress; evapotranspiration; hydrological cycle; least squares method; precipitation assessment; rainfed agriculture; seasonality; soil water; soybean; water storage; Corn Belt; United States; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

New hydrological insights for the regions: This study indicates that the implementation of the local land-use policies, along with extensive anthropogenic activities, has had significant effects on the downstream aquatic environment as compared with the period before the implementation of the land-use policies. Higher annual sediment, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) loadings were found upstream from the Poko Watershed, where range land predominated, and in southern and southwestern Dakbla Watershed, where arable land and permanent cropland predominated. Arable land had the highest proportion of sediment and nutrient loadings into the reach, especially in the 2005–2009 period (conducting afforestation, agricultural expansion, and urbanization) and in the 2010–2014 period (applying crop conversion policy involving a shift from mixed forests to rubber forests).

Since changes in morphological traits to drought and salinity stress are influenced by multiple factors, advanced computational analysis has great potential for computing nonlinear and multivariate data. In this work, the effect of four input variables including GABA concentration, pomegranate cultivars, days of treatment, and drought and salinity stress evaluated to predict and modeling of morphological traits using artificial neural network (ANN) models including multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF). Image processing technique was used to measure the LLI, LWI, and LAI parameters. Among the ANNs applied, the MLP algorithm was chosen as the best model based on the highest accuracy.

We develop a method for accurate, scalable field delineation in smallholder systems. Fields are delineated with state-of-the-art deep learning and watershed segmentation. What is the implication of the main finding? Transfer learning and weak supervision reduce training labels needed by 5× to 10× 10,000 new crop field boundaries are generated in India and publicly released. Crop field boundaries aid in mapping crop types, predicting yields, and delivering field-scale analytics to farmers. Recent years have seen the successful application of deep learning to delineating field boundaries in industrial agricultural systems, but field boundary datasets remain missing in smallholder systems due to (1) small fields that require high resolution satellite imagery to delineate and (2) a lack of ground labels for model training and validation. In this work, we use newly-accessible high-resolution satellite imagery and combine transfer learning with weak supervision to address these challenges in India. Our best model uses 1.5 m resolution Airbus SPOT imagery as input, pre-trains a state-of-the-art neural network on France field boundaries, and fine-tunes on India labels to achieve a median Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.85 in India. When we decouple field delineation from cropland classification, a model trained in France and applied as-is to India Airbus SPOT imagery delineates fields with a mIoU of 0.74. If using 4.8 m resolution PlanetScope imagery instead, high average performance (mIoU > 0.8) is only achievable for fields larger than 1 hectare. Experiments also show that pre-training in France reduces the number of India field labels needed to achieve a given performance level by as much as 10× when datasets are small. These findings suggest our method is a scalable approach for delineating crop fields in regions of the world that currently lack field boundary datasets. We publicly release 10,000 Indian field boundary labels and our delineation model to facilitate the creation of field boundary maps and new methods by the community. © 2022 by the authors.","agriculture; deep learning; field delineation; remote sensing; segmentation; smallholders; transfer learning; weak supervision","Crops; Deep learning; Learning systems; Satellite imagery; Transfer learning; Crop fields; Deep learning; Field boundaries; Field delineation; Remote-sensing; Segmentation; Smallholder; State of the art; Transfer learning; Weak supervision; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

Lowering the groundwater in natural and man-made slopes can help to mitigate the hazards. Subsurface drainage systems equipped with pumps have traditionally been regarded as a temporary remedy for lowering the groundwater in geosystems, whereas long-term usage of pumping-based techniques is uncommon due to the associated high operational costs in labor and energy. This study investigates the intelligent control of groundwater in slopes enabled by deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a subfield of machine learning for automated decision-making. The purpose is to develop an autonomous geosystem that can minimize the operating cost and enhance the system’s safety without introducing human errors and interventions. To prove the concept, a seepage analysis model was implemented using a partial differential equation solver, FEniCS, to simulate the geosystem (i.e., a slope equipped with a pump and subjected to rainfall events). A Deep Q-Network (i.e., a DRL learning agent) was trained to learn the optimal control policy for regulating the pump’s flow rate. The objective is to enable intermittent control of the pump’s flow rate (i.e., 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the pumping capacity) to keep the groundwater close to the target level during rainfall events and consequently help to prevent slope failure. A comparison of the results with traditional proportional-integral-derivative-controlled and uncontrolled water tables showed that the geosystem integrated with DRL can dynamically adapt its response to diverse weather events by adjusting the pump’s flow rate and improve the adopted control policy by gaining more experience over time. In addition, it was observed that the DRL control helped to mitigate slope failure during rainfall events. © 2022 by the authors.","Deep Q-Network; deep reinforcement learning; intelligent control; landslide; seepage analysis; slope stability analysis","Decision making; Deep learning; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Pumps; Rain; Reinforcement learning; Seepage; Two term control systems; Deep Q-network; Deep reinforcement learning; Energy; Geosystems; Rainfall event; Reinforcement learnings; Seepage analysis; Slope failure; Slope stability analysis; Subsurface drainage system; Landslides; ground water; human; machine learning; Groundwater; Humans; Machine Learning",Article,Scopus

Due to advances in technology, the amount and variety of available data have been increasing over the years. However, compared to other economic sectors, there is not always enough quality data for one particular domain (crops, plantations, plots) to obtain acceptable forecasting results with machine learning algorithms. In this context, transfer learning can help extract knowledge from different but related domains with enough data to transfer it to a target domain with scarce data. This process can overcome forecasting accuracy compared to training models uniquely with data from the target domain. In this work, a novel instance weighting-based transfer learning algorithm is proposed and applied to the phenology forecasting problem. A new metric named DIAFAN is proposed to weight samples from different source domains according to their relationship with the target domain, promoting the diversity of the information and avoiding inconsistent samples. Additionally, a set of validation schemes is specifically designed to ensure fair comparisons in terms of data volume with other benchmark transfer learning algorithms. The proposed algorithm, DIAFAN-TL, is tested with a proposed dataset of 16 plots of olive groves from different places, including information fusion from satellite images, meteorological stations and human field sampling of crop phenology. DIAFAN-TL achieves a remarkable improvement with respect to 15 other well-known transfer learning algorithms and three nontransfer learning scenarios.

High spatial and temporal resolution spectral data acquired by multispectral and conventional cameras (or red, green, blue (RGB) sensors) onboard UAVs can be useful for plant water status determination and, as a consequence, for irrigation management. A study in a vineyard located in south-eastern Spain was carried out during the 2018, 2019, and 2020 seasons to assess the potential uses of these techniques. Different water qualities and irrigation application start throughout the growth cycle were imposed. Flights with RGB and multispectral cameras mounted on a UAV were performed throughout the growth cycle, and orthoimages were generated. These orthoimages were segmented to include only vegetation and calculate the green canopy cover (GCC). The stem water potential was measured, and the water stress integral (Sψ) was obtained during each irrigation season. Multiple linear regression techniques and artificial neural networks (ANNs) models with multispectral and RGB bands, as well as GCC, as inputs, were trained and tested to simulate the Sψ. The results showed that the information in the visible domain was highly related to the Sψ in the 2018 season. For all the other years and combinations of years, multispectral ANNs performed slightly better. Differences in the spatial resolution and radiometric quality of the RGB and multispectral geomatic products explain the good model performances with each type of data. Additionally, RGB cameras cost less and are easier to use than multispectral cameras, and RGB images are simpler to process than multispectral images. Therefore, RGB sensors are a good option for use in predicting entire vineyard water status. In any case, field punctual measurements are still required to generate a general model to estimate the water status in any season and vineyard. © 2022 by the authors.","ANN; machine learning; multispectral images; RGB images; UAV; vineyard; water stress",,Article,Scopus

In 2019, chronically malnourished people numbered nearly 240 million, or 20% of the population in SSA. Globally, numerous efforts have been made to anticipate potential droughts, crop conditions, and food shortages in order to improve early warning and risk management for food insecurity. To support this goal, we develop an Earth Observation (EO) and machine-learning-based operational, subnational maize yield forecast system and evaluate its out-of-sample forecast skills during the growing seasons for Kenya, Somalia, Malawi, and Burkina Faso. In general, forecast skills improve substantially during the vegetative growth period (VP) and gradually during the reproductive development period (RP). Thus, mid-season assessment can provide effective early warning months before harvest. Skillful forecasts (Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) > 0.6 and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) < 20%) appear approximately two dekads after the VP; for example, skillful forecasts appear in May in Kenya and Somalia, January in Malawi, and July in Burkina Faso. During model development, effective EO features are also identified, such as precipitation and available water during VP, and dry days and extreme temperatures in early VP. Compared to monthly standard EO features, sub-monthly (dekadal), non-standard, and serial EO features significantly improve forecast skills by ＋ 0.3 NSE and -10% of MAPE, demonstrating the ability to precisely and effectively capture favorable or detrimental crop development conditions. Finally, skillful forecasts and practical utility are demonstrated in the recent normal and dry years in each region. Overall, the developed yield forecasting system can provide skillful predictions during the growing season, supporting regional and international agricultural decision-making processes, including informing food-security planning and management, thereby helping to mitigate food shortages caused by unfavorable climate conditions. © 2022 The Author(s)","Earth observation; Food security; Machine learning; Maize yield; Operational forecast; Sub-Saharan Africa",,Article,Scopus

The goal of this work was to estimate the number of actual berries per grapevine using computer vision and deep learning in commercial vineyards. Images from the visible range (RGB) were acquired from a set of 96 grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.) at pea-size berry stage using a red, green and blue camera (RGB). At harvest, the number of berries and per vine was manually assessed as the ground-truth values. The algorithm involved computer vision to detect berries in the images and to extract canopy features, in order to gain information about canopy occlusion. These were used by the machine learning regression models built to estimate the number of actual berries per vine. A SegNet architecture was used to segment individual berries and several canopy related features. Four datasets were created combining the number of estimated visible berries and different canopy features. Three different regression models were tested on the four datasets.

Finding rare diversity requires a deep understanding of biological interactions between the genetic makeup of one genotype and its environmental conditions. Most modern breeding programs still rely on linear regression models to solve this problem, generalizing the complex genotype by phenotype interactions through manually constructed linear features. However, the identification of positive alleles vs. background can be addressed using deep learning approaches that have the capacity to learn complex nonlinear functions for the inputs. Machine learning (ML) is an artificial intelligence (AI) approach involving a range of algorithms to learn from input data sets and predict outcomes in other related samples. This paper describes a variety of techniques that include supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms to improve our understanding of nonlinear interactions from plant breeding data sets. Feature selection (FS) methods are combined with linear and nonlinear predictors and compared to traditional prediction methods used in plant breeding. Recent advances in ML allowed the construction of complex models that have the capacity to better differentiate between positive alleles and the genetic background. Using real plant breeding program data, we show that ML methods have the ability to outperform current approaches, increase prediction accuracies, decrease the computing time drastically, and improve the detection of important alleles involved in qualitative or quantitative traits.

This study applied the Soil and Water Assessment Tool and the threshold drainage area (TDA) technique to evaluate the impacts of watershed subdivision on hydrological simulations at a 5,913-km2 Arctic watershed, Målselv. The watershed was discretized according to four TDA scheme scales including 200, 2,000, 5,000, and 10,000 ha. The impacts of different TDA schemes on hydrological simulations in water balance components, snowmelt runoff, and stream-flow were investigated. The study revealed that the complexity of terrain and topographic attributes altered significantly in the coarse discretizations: (1) total stream length (47.2 to 74.6%); (2) average stream slope (68 to 83%); and (3) drainage density (24.2 to 51.5%). The spatial density of weather grid integration reduced from 5 to 33.33% in the coarse schemes. The annual mean potential evapo-transpiration, evapotranspiration, and lateral flow slightly decreased, while areal rainfall, surface runoff, and water yield slightly increased with the increases of TDAs. It was concluded that the fine TDAs produced finer and higher ranges of snowmelt runoff volume across the watershed. All TDAs had similar capacities to replicate the observed tendency of monthly mean streamflow hydrograph, except overestimated/underestimated peak flows. Spatial variation of streamflow was well analyzed in the fine schemes with high density of stream networks, while the coarse schemes simplified this. Watershed subdivisions affected model performances, in the way of decreasing the accuracy of monthly streamflow simulation, at 60% of investigated hydro-gauging stations (3/5 stations) and in the upstream. Furthermore, watershed subdivisions strongly affected the calibration process regarding the changes in sensitivity ranking of 18 calibrated model parameters and time it took to calibrate. © 2021 The Authors.","Arctic watershed Målselv; Hydrological simulations; Snowmelt runoff; SWAT; Threshold drainage area (TDA); Watershed subdivisions","Evapotranspiration; Rivers; Runoff; Snow melting systems; Stream flow; Arctic watershed malselv; Drainage area; Hydrological simulations; Norwegian Arctic; Snowmelt runoff; Spatial densities; SWAT; Threshold drainage area; Watershed subdivision; Weather inputs; Watersheds; drainage basin; hydrological modeling; quantitative analysis; runoff; snowmelt; soil and water assessment tool; spatial variation; watershed; weather; Arctic; Norway",Article,Scopus

First, ascertain the important variables that predict tomato yields from plant height (PH) and vegetation index (VI) maps. The maps were derived from images taken by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Second, examine the accuracy of predictions of tomato fresh shoot masses (SM), fruit weights (FW), and the number of fruits (FN) from multiple machine learning algorithms using selected variable sets. To realize our objective, ultra-high-resolution RGB and multispectral images were collected by a UAV on ten days in 2020’s tomato growing season. From these images, 756 total variables, including first- (e.g., average, standard deviation, skewness, range, and maximum) and second-order (e.g., gray-level co-occurrence matrix features and growth rates of PH and VIs) statistics for each plant, were extracted. Several selection algorithms (i.e., Boruta, DALEX, genetic algorithm, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and recursive feature elimination) were used to select the variable sets useful for predicting SM, FW, and FN. Random forests, ridge regressions, and support vector machines were used to predict the yield using the top five selected variable sets. Results: First-order statistics of PH and VIs collected during the early to mid-fruit formation periods, about one month prior to harvest, were important variables for predicting SM. Similar to the case for SM, variables collected approximately one month prior to harvest were important for predicting FW and FN. Furthermore, variables related to PH were unimportant for prediction. Compared with predictions obtained using only first-order statistics, those obtained using the second-order statistics of VIs were more accurate for FW and FN. The prediction accuracy of SM, FW, and FN by models constructed from all variables (rRMSE = 8.8–28.1%) was better than that from first-order statistics (rRMSE = 10.0–50.1%). Conclusions: In addition to basic statistics (e.g., average and standard deviation), we derived second-order statistics of PH and VIs at the plant level using the ultra-high resolution UAV images. Our findings indicated that our variable selection method reduced the number variables needed for tomato yield prediction, improving the efficiency of phenotypic data collection and assisting with the selection of high-yield lines within breeding programs. © 2021, The Author(s).","Gray-level co-occurrence matrix; Machine learning; Plant-level; Tomato yield prediction; Unmanned aerial vehicle",,Article,Scopus

A high-throughput phenotyping platform (HTPP) generates the data of the complete life cycle of a plant. However, the data are rarely used for yield prediction because of the lack of quality image analysis methods, yield data associated with HTPP, and the time-series analysis method for yield prediction. To overcome limitations, this study employed multiple deep learning (DL) networks to extract high-quality HTTP data, establish an association between HTTP data and the yield performance of crops, and select essential time intervals using machine learning (ML). The images of Arabidopsis were taken 12 times under environmentally controlled HTPP over 23 days after sowing (DAS). First, the features from images were extracted using DL network U-Net with SE-ResXt101 encoder and divided into early (15–21 DAS) and late (∼21–23 DAS) pre-flowering developmental stages using the physiological characteristics of the Arabidopsis plant. Second, the late pre-flowering stage at 23 DAS can be predicted using the ML algorithm XGBoost, based only on a portion of the early pre-flowering stage (17–21 DAS). This was confirmed using an additional biological experiment (P < 0.01). Finally, the projected area (PA) was estimated into fresh weight (FW), and the correlation coefficient between FW and predicted FW was calculated as 0.85. This was the first study that analyzed time-series data to predict the FW of related but different developmental stages and predict the PA. The results of this study were informative and enabled the understanding of the FW of Arabidopsis or yield of leafy plants and total biomass consumed in vertical farming. Moreover, this study highlighted the reduction of time-series data for examining interesting traits and future application of time-series analysis in various HTPPs.

The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) system on board the International Space Station (ISS) is the latest FW spaceborne LiDAR instrument for the continuous observation of Earth's forests. FW systems rely on very sophisticated pre-processing steps to generate a priori metrics in order to leverage their capabilities for the accurate estimation of the aforementioned forest characteristics. The ever-expanding volume of acquired GEDI data, which to date comprises more than 25 billion acquired unfiltered shots, and along with the pre-processed data, amounting to more than 90 TB of data, raises new challenges in terms of adapted preprocessing methods for the suitable exploitation of such a huge and complex amount of LiDAR data. To overcome the issues related to the generation of relevant metrics from GEDI data, we propose a new metric-free approach to estimate canopy dominant heights (Hdom) and wood volume (V) of Eucalyptus plantations over five different regions in Brazil. To avoid metric computation, we leverage deep learning techniques and, more in detail, convolutional neural networks with the aim to analyze the GEDI Level 1B geolocated waveforms. Performance comparisons were conducted between four convolutional neural network (CNN) variants using GEDI waveform data (either untouched, or subsetted) and a metric based Random Forest regressor (RF). Additionally, we tested if our framework can improve the generalization of the models to different distant regions. First, the models were trained using data from all the study regions. Cross validated results showed that the CNN based models compared well against their RF counterpart for both Hdom and V. The RMSE on the estimation of Hdom from the CNN based models varied between 1.54 and 1.94 m with a coefficient of determination (R2) between 0.86 and 0.91, while the RF model produced an accuracy on Hdom estimates of 1.45 m (R2 = 0.92). For V, CNN based estimations ranged from 27.76 to 33.33 m3.ha−1 (R2 between 0.82 and 0.88), while for RF, the RMSE was 27.61 m3.ha−1 (R2 = 0.88). Next, model generalization was assessed by means of a spatial transfer experiment. For Hdom, both the CNN and RF approaches showed similar performances to a global model, however, the CNN based approach showed higher variability on the estimation accuracy, and the variability was related to the forest structure between the trained and tested data (similar tree heights yield better accuracies). For the estimation of V, considering both approaches, the accuracy was dependent on the allometric relationship between Hdom and V in the training and testing regions while lower accuracies on V were obtained when the testing and training regions exhibited a different allometric relationship. © 2021","Brazil; Convolutional neural networks; Dominant height; Eucalyptus; GEDI; Lidar; Wood volume","Convolution; Decision trees; Deep learning; Earth (planet); Neural networks; Wood; Brazil; Convolutional neural network; Dominant height; Ecosystem dynamics; Eucalypti; Full-waveforms; Global ecosystem dynamic investigation; Network-based approach; Random forests; Wood volume; Optical radar; accuracy assessment; allometry; biophysics; canopy architecture; data processing; ecosystem dynamics; estimation method; lidar; vertical profile; waveform analysis; wood; Brazil; Eucalyptus",Article,Scopus

The insufficient knowledge of the whole agricultural production system and conventional ways of irrigation have limited agricultural yields in the past. The remote sensing innovations recently implemented in agriculture have dramatically revolutionized production efficiency by offering unparalleled opportunities for convenient, versatile, and quick collection of land images to collect critical details on the crop’s conditions. These innovations have enabled automated data collection, simulation, and interpretation based on crop analytics facilitated by deep learning techniques. This paper aims to reveal the transformative patterns of old Chinese agrarian development and fruit production by focusing on the major crop production (from 1980 to 2050) taking into account various forms of data from fruit production (e.g., apples, bananas, citrus fruits, pears, and grapes). In this study, we used production data for different fruits grown in China to predict the future production of these fruits. The study employs deep neural networks to project future fruit production based on the statistics issued by China’s National Bureau of Statistics on the total fruit growth output for this period. The proposed method exhibits encouraging results with an accuracy of 95.56% calculating by accuracy formula based on fruit production variation. Authors further provide recommendations on the AGR-DL (agricultural deep learning) method being helpful for developing countries. The results suggest that the agricultural development in China is acceptable but demands more improvement and government needs to prioritize expanding the fruit production by establishing new strategies for cultivators to boost their performance. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we used a systematic quantitative approach to classify plant community types in the subtropical forests of Hubei Province (central China), and then quantified the relative contribution of drivers responsible for variation in species composition and diversity. We classified the subtropical forests in the study area into 12 community types. Of these, species diversity indices of three communities were significantly higher than those of others. In each community type, species richness, abundance, basal area and importance values of evergreen and deciduous species were different. In most community types, deciduous species richness was higher than that of evergreen species. Linear regression analysis showed that the dominant factors that affect species composition in each community type are elevation, slope, aspect, soil nitrogen content, and soil phosphorus content. Furthermore, structural equation modeling analysis showed that the majority of variance in species composition of plant communities can be explained by elevation, aspect, soil water content, litterfall, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus. Thus, the major factors that affect evergreen and deciduous species distribution across the 12 community types in subtropical evergreen-deciduous broadleaved mixed forests include elevation, slope and aspect, soil total nitrogen content, soil total phosphorus content, soil available nitrogen content and soil available phosphorus content. © 2021 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences","Detrended correspondence analysis; Environmental factors; Evergreen-deciduous broadleaved mixed forests; Northwestern of Hubei; Plant community; Two-way indicator species analysis",,Article,Scopus

This study investigates the use of Landsat NDVI sequences for estimating wheat yields in fields in Western Australia (WA). By fitting statistical crop growth curves, identifying the timing and intensity of phenological events, the best single integrated NDVI metric in any year was used to estimate yield. The hypotheses were that: (1) yield estimation could be improved by incorporating additional information about sowing date or break of season in statistical curve fitting for phenology detection; (2) the integrated NDVI metrics derived from phenology detection can estimate yield with greater accuracy than the observed NDVI values at one or two time points only. We tested the hypotheses using one field (~235 ha) in the WA grain belt for training and another field (~143 ha) for testing. Integrated NDVI metrics were obtained using: (1) traditional curve fitting (SPD); (2) curve fitting that incorporates sowing date information (+SD); and (3) curve fitting that incorporates rainfall-based break of season information (+BOS). Yield estimation accuracy using integrated NDVI metrics was further compared to the results using a scalable crop yield mapper (SCYM) model. We found that: (1) relationships between integrated NDVI metrics using the three curve fitting models and yield varied from year to year; (2) overall, +SD marginally improved yield estimation (r = 0.81, RMSE = 0.56 tonnes/ha compared to r = 0.80, RMSE = 0.61 tonnes/ha using SPD), but +BOS did not show obvious improvement (r = 0.80, RMSE = 0.60 tonnes/ha); (3) use of integrated NDVI metrics was more accurate than SCYM (r = 0.70, RMSE = 0.62 tonnes/ha) on average and had higher spatial and yearly consistency with actual yield than using SCYM model. We conclude that sequences of Landsat NDVI have the potential for estimation of wheat yield variation in fields in WA but they need to be combined with additional sources of data to distinguish different relationships between integrated NDVI metrics and yield in different years and locations. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, knowing the exact location of fields and their boundaries is a prerequisite. Unlike property boundaries, which are recorded in local council or title records, field boundaries are not historically recorded. As a result, digital services currently ask their users to manually draw their field, which is time-consuming and creates disincentives. Here, we present a generalized method, hereafter referred to as DECODE (DEtect, COnsolidate, and DElinetate), that automatically extracts accurate field boundary data from satellite imagery using deep learning based on spatial, spectral, and temporal cues. We introduce a new convolutional neural network (FracTAL ResUNet) as well as two uncertainty metrics to characterize the confidence of the field detection and field delineation processes. We finally propose a new methodology to compare and summarize field-based accuracy metrics. To demonstrate the performance and scalability of our method, we extracted fields across the Australian grains zone with a pixel-based accuracy of 0.87 and a field-based accuracy of up to 0.88 depending on the metric. We also trained a model on data from South Africa instead of Australia and found it transferred well to unseen Australian landscapes. We conclude that the accuracy, scalability and transferability of DECODE shows that large-scale field boundary extraction based on deep learning has reached operational maturity. This opens the door to new agricultural services that provide routine, near-real time field-based analytics. © 2021 by the authors.

It is therefore economically significant to specify the period as precisely as possible. The harvest maturity of silage corn is currently determined from the targeted sampling of plants cultivated over large areas. In this context, the paper presents an alternative, more detail-oriented approach for estimating the correct harvest time; the method focuses on the relationship between the ripeness data obtained via photogrammetry and the parameters produced by the chemical analysis of corn. The relevant imaging methodology utilizing a spectral camera-equipped unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) allows the user to acquire the spectral reflectance values and to compute the vegetation indices. Furthermore, the authors discuss the statistical data analysis centered on both the nutritional values found in the laboratory corn samples and on the information obtained from the multispectral images. This discussion is associated with a detailed insight into the computation of correlation coefficients. Statistically significant linear relationships between the vegetation indices, the normalized difference red edge index (NDRE) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in particular, and nutritional values such as dry matter, starch, and crude protein are evaluated to indicate different aspects of and paths toward predicting the optimum harvest time.

This article explores a CNN-based approach leveraging Landsat 8 imagery to predict locations of conflict-related deaths. Using Nigeria as a case study, we use the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) dataset to identify locations of conflict events that did or did not result in a death. Imagery for each location is used as an input to train a CNN to distinguish fatal from non-fatal events. Using 2014 imagery, we are able to predict the result of conflict events in the following year (2015) with 80% accuracy. While our approach does not replace the need for causal studies into the drivers of conflict death, it provides a low-cost solution to prediction that requires only publicly available imagery to implement. Findings suggest that the information contained in moderate-resolution imagery can be used to predict the likelihood of a death due to conflict at a given location in Nigeria the following year, and that CNN-based methods of estimating development-related indicators may be effective in applications beyond those explored in the literature. © 2020 The Authors.

Yet, on-board yield monitoring for sugarcane can be challenging. At the same time, orbital images have been widely used for indirect crop yield estimation for many crops like wheat, corn, and rice, but not for sugarcane. Due to this, the objective of this study is to explore the potential of multi-temporal imagery data as an alternative for sugarcane yield mapping. The study was based on developing predictive sugarcane yield models integrating time-series orbital imaging and a machine learning technique. A commercial sugarcane site was selected, and Sentinel-2 images were acquired from the beginning of the ratoon sprouting until harvesting of two consecutive cropping seasons. The predictive yield models RF (Random forest) and MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) were developed using orbital images and yield maps generated by a commercial sensor-system on harvesting. Original yield data were filtered and interpolated with the same spatial resolution of the orbital images. The entire dataset was divided into training and testing datasets. Spectral bands, especially the near-infrared at tillering crop stage showed greater contribution to predicting sugarcane yield than the use of derived spectral vegetation indices. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) obtained for the RF regression based on multiple spectral bands was 4.63 Mg ha−1 with an R2 of 0.70 for the testing dataset. Overall, the RF regression had better performance than the MLR to predict sugarcane yield. © 2021 by the authors.

Agroforestry may improve food security by increasing soil fertility, crop production, and livelihoods. Agroforestry simulation models can be useful for predicting the effects of tree management on crop growth when designing modifications to these systems. The Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) agroforestry tree-proxy model was used to simulate the response of maize yield to N fertilizer applications and tree pruning practices in the parkland agroforestry system in the Central Rift Valley, Ethiopia. The model was parameterized and tested using data collected from an experiment conducted under trees and in crop-only plots during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons. The treatments contained three levels of tree pruning (100% pruned, 50% pruned, and unpruned) as the main plots, and N fertilizers were applied to maize at two rates (9 or 78 kg N ha−1) as sub-plots. Maize yield predictions across two years in response to tree pruning and N applications under tree canopies were satisfactorily simulated (NSE = 0.72, RSR = 0.51, R2 = 0.8). Virtual experiments for different rates of N, pruning levels, sowing dates, and cultivars suggest that maize yield could be improved by applying fertilizers (particularly on crop-only plots) and by at least 50% pruning of trees. Optimal maize yield can be obtained at a higher rate of fertilization under trees than away from them due to better water relations, and there is scope for improving the sowing date and cultivar. Across a 34-year range of recent climate, small increases in yields due to optimum N-fertilizing and pruning were probably limited by nutrient limitations other than N, but the highest yields were consistently in the 2–4 m zone under trees. These virtual experiments helped to form hypotheses regarding fertilizers, pruning, and the effects of trees on soil that warrant further field evaluation. © 2020 by the authors.

We examined responses of nitrate loading to climate change in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) with an enhanced Soil and Water Assessment Tool with physically based Freeze-Thaw cycle representation (SWAT-FT), as compared with the original SWAT model that employs an empirical equation. Driven by future climate projections from five General Circulation Models (GCMs) from 1960 to 2099 under the Representative Concentrations Pathways (RCP) 8.5 scenario, we analyzed changes in riverine nitrate loadings, as well as terrestrial surface and subsurface contributions of the UMRB in the 21st century relative to the baseline period of 1960–1999. By the end of the 21st century, the original SWAT model predicted about a 50% increase in riverine nitrate loadings which is nearly twice as much as that estimated by SWAT-FT (ca. 25%). Such a large difference in projected nitrate changes can potentially mislead mitigation strategies that aim to reduce nitrogen runoff from the UMRB. Further analysis shows that the difference between the original SWAT model and SWAT-FT led to substantial discrepancies in the spatial distribution of surface and subsurface nitrate loadings in the UMRB. In general, SWAT-FT predicted more nitrate leaching for northwestern parts of the UMRB which are more sensitive to freeze-thaw cycle, mainly because SWAT-FT simulated less frequent frozen soils. This study highlights the importance of using physically based freeze-thaw cycle representation in water quality modeling.

In recent decades, GS have increased in groups of varieties of various interspecies origin, and WS have not changed. Regression models revealed that the reason for GS improvement was in the growth of average temperature above 15 _C, while WS varied depending on the sum of precipitation for the period with temperatures above 20 °C, which did not have a reliable trend.

A hyperspectral camera was mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle to collect aerial imagery with high spatial and spectral resolution in a fast, cost-effective manner. Aerial images were captured in two consecutive growing seasons from three experimental yield fields composed of hundreds experimental wheat lines.

It is also the primary agricultural production area in the country. Groundwater levels in some regions of the valley have decreased by &gt;15 m in the last five years. Water use estimates at the regional and the field scale for this valley are crucial for enhancing resilience and for managing competing sectorial water demands. In this research, we derive a novel time series of field-scale actual evapotranspiration for the Bekaa Valley using two one-source energy balance models for the period 1984–2017, utilizing local weather data and all available original Level 1 Landsat thermal imagery and Level 2 surface reflectance products. We compare a modified METRIC model with an automated hot and cold pixel identification procedure run in batch mode to pySEBAL, a new version of SEBAL, which also has its automated anchors pixel selection algorithm. Analysis of 1200 cloud-masked and gap-filled Landsat-derived ET products show that the two models give comparable water use estimates at the seasonal and annual time steps. We estimate an average annual ET of 652 ± 53 mm (or 800 mcm) over the heavily cultivated valley in the last 34 years (with high agreement between both METRIC and pySEBAL models). Most (64%) of the ET is consumed from blue water in the dry season of May–October. ET in the wet season of November–April consumes &gt;70% of the precipitation in the Bekaa valley. Annual analysis shows no discernable trend in ET across the valley, but there is an increase in irrigated agriculture in the Orontes Basin in the last five years. METRIC yields 15% higher ET than pySEBAL for the non-agricultural lands in summer. A water balance analysis shows that groundwater storage in the Litani basin is decreasing at a rate of 330 ± 50 mm yr−1. The outcome of this research also offers unique opportunities for estimating past and future trends of groundwater withdrawals.

Our approach is applied to state-scale maize yield and meteorological data for the US Corn Belt from 1981 to 2014 as an exemplar, but would be readily transferable to other crops, locations and spatial scales. Experimentation with a number of models shows that maize growth rates can be characterised by a two-dimensional Gaussian function of temperature and precipitation with monthly contributions accumulated over the growing period. This approach accounts for non-linear growth responses to the individual meteorological variables, and allows for interactions between them. Our models correctly identify that temperature and precipitation have the largest impact on yield in the six months prior to the harvest, in agreement with the typical growing season for US maize (April to September). Maximal growth rates occur for monthly mean temperature 18 °C–19 °C, corresponding to a daily maximum temperature of 24 °C– 25 °C (in broad agreement with previous work) and monthly total precipitation 115 mm. Our approach also provides a self-consistent way of investigating climate change impacts on current US maize varieties in the absence of adaptation measures. Keeping precipitation and growing area fixed, a temperature increase of 2 °C, relative to 1981–2014, results in the mean yield decreasing by 8%, while the yield variance increases by a factor of around 3. We thus provide a flexible, data-driven framework for exploring the impacts of natural climate variability and climate change on globally significant crops based on their observed behaviour. In concert with other approaches, this can help inform the development of adaptation strategies that will ensure food security under a changing climate. © 2020 The Author(s).

GCM forecasts typically require postprocessing to reduce biases and improve reliability; however, current seasonal postprocessing methods often ignore multivariate dependence. In low-dimensional settings, fully parametric methods may sufficiently model intervariable covariance. On the other hand, empirical ensemble reordering techniques can inject desired multivariate dependence in ensembles from template data after univariate postprocessing. To investigate the best approach for seasonal forecasting, this study develops and tests several strategies for calibrating seasonal GCM forecasts of rainfall, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature with intervariable dependence: 1) simultaneous calibration of multiple climate variables using the Bayesian joint probability modeling approach; 2) univariate BJP calibration coupled with an ensemble reordering method (the Schaake shuffle); and 3) transformation-based quantile mapping, which borrows intervariable dependence from the raw forecasts. Applied to Australian seasonal forecasts from the ECMWF System4 model, univariate calibration paired with empirical ensemble reordering performs best in terms of univariate and multivariate forecast verification metrics, including the energy and variogram scores. However, the performance of empirical ensemble reordering using the Schaake shuffle is influenced by the selection of historical data in constructing a dependence template. Direct multivariate calibration is the second-best method, with its far superior performance in in-sample testing vanishing in cross validation, likely because of insufficient data relative to the number of parameters. The continued development of multivariate forecast calibration methods will support the uptake of seasonal climate forecasts in complex application domains such as agriculture and hydrology. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.",,"Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Calibration; Natural resources management; Statistical tests; Forecast calibrations; Forecast verifications; Multivariate calibration; Postprocessing methods; Quantitative modeling; Seasonal climate forecast; Simultaneous calibration; Transformation based; Forecasting; air temperature; calibration; climate modeling; climate prediction; climate variation; general circulation model; multivariate analysis; quantitative analysis; rainfall; seasonal variation; Australia",Article,Scopus

Improving our understanding of their impacts on crop yields is crucial to enhance the resilience of the global food system. This study analyses, to our knowledge for the first time, the impacts of climate extremes on yield anomalies of maize, soybeans, rice and spring wheat at the global scale using sub-national yield data and applying a machine-learning algorithm. We find that growing season climate factors - including mean climate as well as climate extremes - explain 20%-49% of the variance of yield anomalies (the range describes the differences between crop types), with 18%-43% of the explained variance attributable to climate extremes, depending on crop type. Temperature-related extremes show a stronger association with yield anomalies than precipitation-related factors, while irrigation partly mitigates negative effects of high temperature extremes. We developed a composite indicator to identify hotspot regions that are critical for global production and particularly susceptible to the effects of climate extremes. These regions include North America for maize, spring wheat and soy production, Asia in the case of maize and rice production as well as Europe for spring wheat production. Our study highlights the importance of considering climate extremes for agricultural predictions and adaptation planning and provides an overview of critical regions that are most susceptible to variations in growing season climate and climate extremes. © 2019 The Author(s).

For large-scale watershed modeling, weather data are either generated by using interpolation methods or derived from assimilated datasets. In the present study, we compared model performances of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), as driven by interpolation weather data, and NASA North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase Two (NLDAS2) weather dataset in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). The SWAT model fed with different weather datasets were used to simulate monthly stream flow at 11 United States Geological Survey (USGS) monitoring stations in the UMRB. Model performances were evaluated based on three metrics: coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS), and percent bias (Pbias). The results show that, after calibration, the SWAT model compared well at all monitoring stations for monthly stream flow using different weather datasets indicating that the SWAT model can adequately produce long-term water yield in UMRB. The results also show that using NLDAS2 weather dataset can improve SWAT prediction of monthly stream flow with less prediction uncertainty in the UMRB. We concluded that NLDAS2 dataset could be used by the SWAT model for large-scale watersheds like UMRB as a surrogate of the interpolation weather data. Further analyses results show that NLDAS2 daily solar radiation data was about 2.5 MJ m-2 higher than the interpolation data. As such, the SWAT model driven by NLDAS2 dataset tended to underestimate stream flow in the UMRB due to the overestimation in evapotranspiration in uncalibrated conditions. Thus, the implication of overestimated solar radiation by NLDAS2 dataset should be considered before using NLDAS2 dataset to drive the hydrological model. © 2019 by the authors.","Reanalysis climate data; Stream flow; SWAT; Watershed modeling","Interpolation; Large dataset; Meteorology; NASA; Rivers; Solar radiation; Stream flow; Watersheds; Climate data; Coefficient of determination; Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient; North american land data assimilation systems; Soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; United states geological surveys; Watershed modeling; Digital storage; data set; evapotranspiration; hydrological modeling; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; water yield; watershed; Mississippi River; United States",Article,Scopus

Currently, a number of machine learning methods would resort to using averaged spectral information over wide bandwidths resulting in loss of crucial information available in those contiguous bands. The loss of information could mean a drop in the discriminative power when it comes to land cover classes with comparable spectral responses, as in the case of cultivated fields versus fallow lands. In this study, we proposed and tested three new optimized novel algorithms based on Moment Distance Index (MDI) that characterizes the whole shape of the spectral curve. The image classification tests conducted on two publicly available hyperspectral data sets (AVIRIS 1992 Indian Pine and HYDICE Washington DC Mall images) showed the robustness of the optimized algorithms in terms of classification accuracy. We achieved an overall accuracy of 98% and 99% for AVIRIS and HYDICE, respectively. The optimized indices were also time efficient as it avoided the process of band dimension reduction, such as those implemented by several well-known classifiers. Our results showed the potential of optimized shape indices, specifically the Moment Distance Ratio Right/Left (MDRRL), to discriminate between types of tillage (corn-min and corn-notill) and between grass/pasture and grass/trees, tree and grass under object-based random forest approach. © 2019 Salas, Subburayalu.

The use of remote sensing to measure crop production at high latitudes is hindered by intrinsic challenges, such as a low sun elevation angle and a coastal climate with high humidity, which influences the spectral signatures of the sampled vegetation. We used a portable spectrometer (ASD FieldSpec 3) to assess spectra of grass crops and found that when applying multivariate models to the hyperspectral datasets, results show significant predictability of yields (R2 &gt; 0.55, root mean squared error (RMSE) &lt; 180), even when captured under sub-optimal conditions. These results are consistent both in the full spectral range of the spectrometer (350-2500 nm) and in the 350-900 nm spectral range, which is a region more robust against air moisture. Sentinel-2A simulations resulted in moderately robust models that could be used in qualitative assessments of field productivity. In addition, simulation of the upcoming hyperspectral EnMap satellite bands showed its potential applicability to measure yields in northern latitudes both in the full spectral range of the satellite (420-2450 nm) with similar performance as the Sentinel-2A satellite and in the 420-900 nm range with a comparable reliability to the portable spectrometer. The combination of EnMap and Sentinel-2A to detect fields with low productivity and portable spectrometers to identify the fields or specific regions of fields with the lowest production can help optimize the management of fodder production in high latitudes. © 2019 by the authors.","Arctic agriculture; Crop; EnMap; Grass; Partial least squares (PLS); Remote sensing; Yield","Crops; Cultivation; Least squares approximations; Mean square error; Productivity; Satellites; Spectrometers; EnMap; Grass; Low growth temperature; Multivariate models; Partial least square (PLS); Qualitative assessments; Root mean squared errors; Yield; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

In this study, a high-resolution portable spectral sensor was used to investigate the feasibility of detecting multi-diseased tomato leaves in different stages, including early or asymptomatic stages. One healthy leaf and three diseased tomato leaves (late blight, target and bacterial spots) were defined into four stages (healthy, asymptomatic, early stage and late stage) and collected from a field. Fifty-seven spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) were calculated in accordance with methods published in previous studies and established in this study. Principal component analysis was conducted to evaluate SVIs. Results revealed six principal components (PCs) whose eigenvalues were greater than 1. SVIs with weight coefficients ranking from 1 to 30 in each selected PC were applied to a K-nearest neighbour for classification. Amongst the examined leaves, the healthy ones had the highest accuracy (100%) and the lowest error rate (0) because of their uniform tissues. Late stage leaves could be distinguished more easily than the two other disease categories caused by similar symptoms on the multi-diseased leaves. Further work may incorporate the proposed technique into an image system that can be operated to monitor multi-diseased tomato plants in fields. © 2018, The Author(s).",,"metabolism; microbiology; plant disease; plant leaf; principal component analysis; procedures; spectroscopy; tomato; Lycopersicon esculentum; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Principal Component Analysis; Spectrum Analysis",Article,Scopus

However, preprocessing of critical data such as soils information can be laborious and time-consuming. The objective of this work was to preprocess the Soil Landscapes of Canada (SLC) database to offer a country-level soils dataset in a format ready to be used in SWAT simulations. A twolevel screening process was used to identify critical information required by SWAT and to remove records with information that could not be calculated or estimated. Out of the 14 063 unique soil records in the SLC, 11 838 records with complete information were included in the dataset presented here. Important variables for SWAT simulations that are not reported in the SLC database (e.g., hydrologic soils groups (HSGs) and erodibility factor (K)) were calculated from information contained within the SLC database. These calculations, in fact, represent a major contribution to enabling the present dataset to be used for hydrological simulations in Canada using SWAT and other comparable models. Analysis of those variables indicated that 21.3 %, 24.6 %, 39.0 %, and 15.1% of the soil records in Canada belong to HSGs 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. This suggests that almost twothirds of the soil records have a high (i.e., HSG 4) or relatively high (i.e., HSG 3) runoff generation potential. A spatial analysis indicated that 20.0 %, 26.8 %, 36.7 %, and 16.5% of soil records belonged to HSG 1, HSG 2, HSG 3, and HSG 4, respectively. Erosion potential, which is inherently linked to the erodibility factor (K), was associated with runoff potential in important agricultural areas such as southern Ontario and Nova Scotia. However, contrary to initial expectations, low or moderate erosion potential was found in areas with high runoff potential, such as regions in southern Manitoba (e.g., Red River Valley) and British Columbia (e.g., Peace River watershed).

Loading targets were calculated for each major element of a pre-development loading regime. Simulated pre-development conditions were associated with increased retention and decreased export of sediment and nutrients when compared to observed developed conditions. Differences between simulated pre-development and observed developed maximum daily yields (loads per unit area) of suspended sediment (SS), total phosphorus (TP), and total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) ranged from 35.7 to 59.6 Mg km-2 (SS); 23.3 to 52.5 kg km-2 (TP); and, 113.2 to 200.8 kg km-2 (TIN), respectively.

To get a better understanding of the distribution of plants in wetlands and analyze their associations with environmental soil factors, the structure and types of plant communities in the eastern shore area of Lake Taihu were analyzed by two-way indicator species analysis and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) ordination. The spatial distribution patterns of vegetation and the main factors affecting the distributions were investigated.Outcomes: Sixty-six sampling sites were selected to obtain vegetation species and soil environmental factor data. Results showed that 22 species from the 66 sites could be divided into seven communities: I: Arundo donax; II: A. donax + Phragmites australis; III: Zizania latifolia + Typha orientalis; IV: P. australis + Alternanthera philoxeroides + Polygonum hydropiper; V: P. australis; VI: P. australis + Humulus scandens; and VII: Erigeron acer + Ipomoea batatas + Rumex acetosa. Plant species and soil factors in the CCA analysis showed that I. batatas, E. acer, Chenopodium album, Polygonum lapathifolium, and Acalypha australis were mainly affected by pH, whereas Echinochloa crus-galli, Setaria viridis, and H. scandens were mainly affected by soil total phosphorus. Mentha canadensis and A. donax were mainly affected by soil conductivity, A. philoxeroides was mainly affected by soil organic matter and, Z. latifolia, Metaplexis japonica and P. hydropiper were mainly affected by available phosphorus.Conclusion:These results indicated that different plants adapted to different soil environmental factors and provided basic information on the diversity of Lake Taihu wetland vegetation. . © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

Both existing grasslands and marginal croplands have been suggested as targets for conversion to switchgrass, but the resulting production potentials and hydrologic impacts are not clear. The objectives of this study were to model switchgrass production on existing grasslands (scenario-I) and on marginal croplands that have severe to very severe limitations for crop production (scenario-II) and to evaluate the effects on evapotranspiration (ET) and streamflow. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to the 1063 km2 Skeleton Creek watershed in north-central Oklahoma, a watershed dominated by grasslands (35%) and winter wheat cropland (47%). The simulated average annual yield (2002–2011) for rainfed Alamo switchgrass for both scenarios was 12 Mg ha-1. Yield varied spatially under scenario-I from 6.1 to 15.3 Mg ha-1, while under scenario-II the range was from 8.2 to 13.8 Mg ha-1. Comparison of average annual ET and streamflow between the baseline simulation (existing land use) and scenario-I showed that scenario-I had 5.6% (37 mm) higher average annual ET and 27.7% lower streamflow, representing a 40.7 million m3 yr-1 streamflow reduction. Compared to the baseline, scenario-II had only 0.5% higher ET and 3.2% lower streamflow, but some monthly impacts were larger. In this watershed, the water yield reduction per ton of biomass production (i.e. hydrologic cost-effectiveness ratio) was more than 5X greater under scenario-I than under scenario-II. These results suggest that, from a hydrologic perspective, it may be preferable to convert marginal cropland to switchgrass production rather than converting existing grasslands. © 2017, Public Library of Science.

Under a historical climate scenario, suspended sediment (SS), total nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) at the outlet point of the SFIR watershed could decrease by up to 56.7%, 32.0%, and 16.5%, respectively, compared with current land use when a portion of the cropland is converted to switchgrass and a cover crop is in place. Climate change could cause increases of 9.7% in SS, 4.1% in N, and 7.2% in P compared to current land use. Under future climate scenarios, nutrients including SS, N, and P were reduced through land management and practices and BMPs by up to 54.0% (SS), 30.4% (N), and 7.1% (P). Water footprint analysis further revealed changes in green water that are highly dependent on land management scenarios. The study highlights the versatile approaches in landscape management that are available to address climate change adaptation and acknowledged the complex nature of different perspectives in water sustainability. Further study involving implementing landscape design and management by using long-term monitoring data from field to watershed is necessary to verify the findings and move toward watershed-specific regional programs for climate adaptation. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","bioenergy production; BMPs; climate change; cover crops; land use and management; riparian buffer; switchgrass","Biomass; Crops; Forestry; Land use; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Plants (botany); Suspended sediments; Water quality; Watersheds; Bioenergy productions; BMPs; Cover crops; Land use and managements; Riparian buffers; Switchgrass; Climate change; adaptive management; basin management; biomass; buffer zone; climate change; cover crop; crop production; grass; land management; nitrogen; phosphorus; streamflow; suspended sediment; sustainability; water footprint; water quality; Corn Belt; Iowa; South Fork Iowa River; United States; Glycine max; Panicum virgatum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Energy crops such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and miscanthus (Miscanthus X giganteus) can grow well throughout the continental United States; however, most studies on the water quality impacts of land-use change from bioenergy policy are based in the Midwest. Insufficient research has been conducted to determine whether the results from the Midwest are applicable to other regions in the United States. This study compares water quality impacts of converting from corn to switchgrass in the Midwest (Upper Cedar watershed) and Southeast (Lumber watershed) with nitrogen loading to surface water as a proxy metric for overall water quality impacts using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The analysis shows that the fraction of nitrogen runoff compared to the fertilizer applied is 36% in Upper Cedar as compared to 6% in Lumber. Existing management practices like tile-drainage and land-cover like riparian wetlands contribute to this difference in the baseline nitrate export from each watershed. The potential reduction in nitrogen loading per potential liter of ethanol to surface waters, which account for both nitrate export and productivities, from the baseline corn-soy to switchgrass is about 40% for the Upper Cedar watershed and around 80% for the Lumber watershed. Although, the trend in reduction is similar in both watersheds, this study shows that results extrapolated from the Midwest may not be representative of other bioenergy producing regions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Land-use change; Nitrogen; Panicum virgatum L.; Switchgrass; Water quality","Crops; Cultivation; Land use; Lumber; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Plants (botany); Water quality; Watersheds; Bio-energy; Land-use change; Management practices; Miscanthus x giganteus; Panicum virgatum l; Regional differences; Soil and water assessment tool; Switchgrass; Surface waters; bioenergy; biomass power; energy crop; environmental impact assessment; grass; land use change; management practice; nitrate; nitrogen; runoff; soil and water assessment tool; water quality; wetland; Midwest; United States; Miscanthus; Miscanthus x giganteus; Panicum virgatum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Agricultural researchers use ground-based observations to identify, select and develop crops with favourable genotypes and phenotypes; however, the ability to collect rapid, high quality and high volume phenotypic data in open fields is restricting this. This study develops and assesses a method for deriving crop height and growth rate rapidly from multi-temporal, very high spatial resolution (1 cm/pixel), 3D digital surface models of crop field trials produced via Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry using aerial imagery collected through repeated campaigns flying an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with a mounted Red Green Blue (RGB) camera. We compare UAV SfM modelled crop heights to those derived from terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) and to the standard field measurement of crop height conducted using a 2 m rule. The most accurate UAV-derived surface model and the TLS both achieve a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.03 m compared to the existing manual 2 m rule method. The optimised UAV method was then applied to the growing season of a winter wheat field phenotyping experiment containing 25 different varieties grown in 27 m2 plots and subject to four different nitrogen fertiliser treatments. Accuracy assessments at different stages of crop growth produced consistently low RMSE values (0.07, 0.02 and 0.03 m for May, June and July, respectively), enabling crop growth rate to be derived from differencing of the multi-temporal surface models. We find growth rates range from -13 mm/day to 17 mm/day. Our results clearly display the impact of variable nitrogen fertiliser rates on crop growth. Digital surface models produced provide a novel spatial mapping of crop height variation both at the field scale and also within individual plots. This study proves UAV based SfM has the potential to become a new standard for high-throughput phenotyping of in-field crop heights. © 2016 by the authors.","Crop height; Phenotyping; Photogrammetry; Structure from Motion; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","Aerial photography; Agriculture; Crashworthiness; Fertilizers; Growth rate; Mean square error; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Photogrammetry; Remote sensing; Surveying instruments; Throughput; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Crop height; Ground-based observations; High-throughput phenotyping; Phenotyping; Root mean squared errors; Structure from motion; Terrestrial laser scanners; Very high spatial resolutions; Crops",Article,Scopus

For the application of dynamic mapping of rice growth parameters, leaf area index (LAI) and aboveground biomass (AGB) were considered as plant growth indicators. The HJ-1 CCD-derived vegetation indices (VIs) showed robust relationships with rice growth parameters. Cumulative VIs showed strong performance for the estimation of total dry AGB. The cross-validation coefficient of determination (RCV2) was increased by using two machine learning methods, i.e., a back propagation neural network (BPNN) and a support vector machine (SVM) compared with traditional regression equations of LAI retrieval. The LAI inversion accuracy was further improved by dividing the rice growth period into before and after heading stages.

Projected climate is subject to uncertainties related to climate change scenarios and Global Circulation Models (GCMs). This paper discusses the consequences of climate change on discharge. Historical climatic and gauging data were collected from different stations within a watershed. Bias correction was performed on GCMs temperature and precipitation data. After successful development of the hydrological modeling system (SWAT) for the basin, streamflow was simulated for three future periods (2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100) and compared with the baseline data (1981-2010) to explore the changes in different flow indicators such as mean flow, low flow, median flow, high flow, flow duration curves, temporal shift in peaks, and temporal shifts in center-of-volume dates. From the results obtained, an overall increase in mean annual flow was projected in the basin under both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. Winter and spring showed a noticeable increase in streamflow, while summer and autumn showed a decrease in streamflow. High flows were predicted to increase, but median flow was projected to decrease in the future under both scenarios. Flow duration curves showed that the probability of occurrence of high flow is likely to be more in the future. It was also noted that peaks were predicted to shift from May to July in the future, and the center-of-volume date of the annual flow may vary from ??11 to 23 days in the basin, under both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. As a whole, the Mangla basin will face more floods and less droughts in the future due to the projected increase in high and low flows, decrease in median flows and greater temporal and magnitudinal variations in peak flows. These outcomes suggest that it is important to consider the influence of climate change on water resources to frame appropriate guidelines for planning and management. © 2016 by the authors.","Bias correction; Climate change; Discharge; GCMs; Precipitation; RCPs; SWAT; Temperature","Climate models; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Precipitation (chemical); Reservoirs (water); Stream flow; Temperature; Water resources; Bias correction; Climate change scenarios; GCMs; Global circulation model; Hydrological modeling; Probability of occurrence; RCPs; SWAT; Climate change; air temperature; baseline conditions; climate change; climate modeling; environmental assessment; historical record; hydrological modeling; inflow; precipitation (climatology); profitability; reservoir; streamflow; temporal variation; uncertainty analysis; water resource; Azad Kashmir; Mangla Dam; Pakistan",Article,Scopus

Passive optical remote sensing and active microwave remote sensing both play an important role in the monitoring of forest biomass. However, optical spectral reflectance is saturated in relatively dense vegetation areas, and microwave backscattering is significantly influenced by the underlying soil when the vegetation coverage is low. Both of these conditions decrease the estimation accuracy of forest biomass. A new optical and microwave integrated vegetation index (VI) was proposed based on observations from both field experiments and satellite (Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and RADARSAT-2) data. According to the difference in interaction between the multispectral reflectance and microwave backscattering signatures with biomass, the combined VI (COVI) was designed using the weighted optical optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) and microwave horizontally transmitted and vertically received signal (HV) to overcome the disadvantages of both data types. The performance of the COVI was evaluated by comparison with those of the sole optical data, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, and the simple combination of independent optical and SAR variables. The most accurate performance was obtained by the models based on the COVI and optical and microwave optimal variables excluding OSAVI and HV, in combination with a random forest algorithm and the largest number of reference samples. The results also revealed that the predictive accuracy depended highly on the statistical method and the number of sample units. The validation indicated that this integrated method of determining the new VI is a good synergistic way to combine both optical and microwave information for the accurate estimation of forest biomass. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Biomass estimation; Combined vegetation index; Landsat 8 OLI; Prediction method; RADARSAT-2; Sample size","Backscattering; Biomass; Carbon; Decision trees; Electromagnetic wave backscattering; Forestry; Microwaves; Reflection; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Biomass estimation; LANDSAT; Prediction methods; Radarsat-2; Sample sizes; Vegetation index; Space-based radar",Article,Scopus

These parameters can be derived from MODIS with high accuracy, but their temporal resolution is too low to obtain high-temporal-resolution SSR retrievals. In order to obtain hourly cloud parameters, an artificial neural network (ANN) is applied in this study to directly construct a functional relationship between MODIS cloud products and Multifunctional Transport Satellite (MTSAT) geostationary satellite signals. In addition, an efficient parameterization model for SSR retrieval is introduced and, when driven with MODIS atmospheric and land products, its root mean square error (RMSE) is about 100 W m-2 for 44 Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) stations. Once the estimated cloud parameters and other information (such as aerosol, precipitable water, ozone) are input to the model, we can derive SSR at high spatiotemporal resolution. The retrieved SSR is first evaluated against hourly radiation data at three experimental stations in the Haihe River basin of China. The mean bias error (MBE) and RMSE in hourly SSR estimate are 12.0 W m-2 (or 3.5 %) and 98.5 W m-2 (or 28.9 %), respectively. The retrieved SSR is also evaluated against daily radiation data at 90 China Meteorological Administration (CMA) stations. The MBEs are 9.8 W m-2 (or 5.4 %); the RMSEs in daily and monthly mean SSR estimates are 34.2 W m-2 (or 19.1 %) and 22.1 W m-2 (or 12.3 %), respectively. The accuracy is comparable to or even higher than two other radiation products (GLASS and ISCCP-FD), and the present method is more computationally efficient and can produce hourly SSR data at a spatial resolution of 5 km. © Author(s) 2016.",,"accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; cloud; error analysis; MODIS; MTSAT; solar radiation; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Hai Basin",Article,Scopus

In this study, we assess the skill and the reliability of the Integrated Canadian Crop Yield Forecaster (ICCYF), a regional crop yield forecasting tool, at different temporal (i.e. 1-3 months before harvest) and spatial (i.e. census agricultural region - CAR, provincial and national) scales across Canada. A distinct feature of the ICCYF is that it generates in-season yield forecasts well before the end of the growing season and provides a probability distribution of the forecasted yields. The ICCYF integrates climate, remote sensing derived vegetation indices, soil and crop information through a physical process-based soil water budget model and statistical algorithms. The model was evaluated against yield survey data of spring wheat, barley and canola during the 1987-2012 period. Our results showed that the ICCYF performance exhibited a strong spatial pattern at both CAR and provincial scales. Model performance was better from regions with a good coverage of climate stations and a high percentage of cropped area. On average, the model coefficient of determination at CAR level was 66%, 51% and 67%, for spring wheat, barley and canola, respectively. Skilful forecasts (i.e. model efficiency index. >. 0) were achieved in 70% of the CARs for spring wheat and canola, and 43% for barley (low values observed in CAR with small harvested area). At the provincial scale, the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of the September forecasts ranged from 7% to 16%, 7% to14%, and 6% to 14% for spring wheat, barley and canola, respectively. For forecasts at the national scale, MAPE values (i.e. 8%, 5% and 9% for the three respective crops) were considerably smaller than the corresponding historical coefficients of variation (i.e. 17%, 10% and 17% for the three crops). Overall, the ICCYF performed better for spring wheat than for canola and barley at all the three spatial scales. Skilful forecasts were achieved by mid-August, giving a lead time of about 1 month before harvest and about 3-4 months before the final release of official survey results. As such, the ICCYF could be used as a complementary tool for the traditional survey method, especially in areas where it is not practical to conduct such surveys. © 2015 .","Barley; Canada; Canola; ICCYF; Probabilistic yield forecast; Spring wheat","agricultural land; agricultural modeling; climate change; crop yield; decision making; early warning system; growing season; prediction; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; statistical analysis; survey method; vegetation index; water budget; Canada; Brassica napus var. napus; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Development, control and maintenance of these strategies are highly dependent on temporally and spatially continuous information on crop status at the field scale. This paper introduces the application of a process-based, coupled hydro-agroecological model (PROMET) for the simulation of temporally and spatially dynamic crop growth on agriculturally managed fields. By assimilating optical remote sensing data into the model, the simulation of spatial crop dynamics is improved to a point where site-specific farming measures can be supported. Radiative transfer modeling (SLC) is used to provide maps of leaf area index from Earth Observation (EO). These maps are used in an assimilation scheme that selects closest matches between EO and PROMET ensemble runs. Validation is provided for winter wheat (years 2004, 2010 and 2011). Field samples validate the temporal dynamics of the simulations (avg. R2 = 0.93) and > 700 ha of calibrated combine harvester data are used for accuracy assessment of the spatial yield simulations (avg. RMSE = 1.15 t·ha-1). The study shows that precise simulation of field-scale crop growth and yield is possible, if spatial remotely sensed information is combined with temporal dynamics provided by land surface process models.

We evaluate here whether this computationally intensive approach significantly alters projections of agricultural yield, one of the greatest concerns under climate change. Our results suggest that it does not. We simulate US maize yields under current and future CO2 concentrations with the widely used Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer crop model, driven by a variety of climate inputs including two GCMs, each in turn downscaled by two RCMs. We find that no climate model output can reproduce yields driven by observed climate unless a bias correction is first applied. Once a bias correction is applied, GCM- and RCM-driven US maize yields are essentially indistinguishable in all scenarios (&lt;10% discrepancy, equivalent to error from observations). Although RCMs correct some GCM biases related to fine-scale geographic features, errors in yield are dominated by broad-scale (100s of kilometers) GCM systematic errors that RCMs cannot compensate for. These results support previous suggestions that the benefits for impacts assessments of dynamically downscaling raw GCM output may not be sufficient to justify its computational demands. Progress on fidelity of yield projections may benefit more from continuing efforts to understand and minimize systematic error in underlying climate projections.","Agriculture; CORDEX; Food security; NARCCAP","agriculture; article; climate change; decision support system; environmental impact; general circulation model; harvest; maize; measurement error; model; priority journal; simulation; agriculture; CORDEX; food security; NARCCAP; Agriculture; Algorithms; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Conservation of Natural Resources; Crops, Agricultural; Food Supply; Forecasting; Geography; Models, Theoretical; North America; Probability; Reproducibility of Results; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

However, many of them do not reproduce the small-scale spatial variability of precipitation exhibited by the observed meteorological data, which is an important factor for predicting hydrologic response to climatic forcing. In this study a new downscaling technique (Bias-Correction and Stochastic Analog method; BCSA) was developed to produce stochastic realizations of bias-corrected daily GCM precipitation fields that preserve both the spatial autocorrelation structure of observed daily precipitation sequences and the observed temporal frequency distribution of daily rainfall over space. We used the BCSA method to downscale 4 different daily GCM precipitation predictions from 1961 to 1999 over the state of Florida, and compared the skill of the method to results obtained with the commonly used bias-correction and spatial disaggregation (BCSD) approach, a modified version of BCSD which reverses the order of spatial disaggregation and bias-correction (SDBC), and the bias-correction and constructed analog (BCCA) method. Spatial and temporal statistics, transition probabilities, wet/dry spell lengths, spatial correlation indices, and variograms for wet (June through September) and dry (October through May) seasons were calculated for each method. Results showed that (1) BCCA underestimated mean daily precipitation for both wet and dry seasons while the BCSD, SDBC and BCSA methods accurately reproduced these characteristics, (2) the BCSD and BCCA methods underestimated temporal variability of daily precipitation and thus did not reproduce daily precipitation standard deviations, transition probabilities or wet/dry spell lengths as well as the SDBC and BCSA methods, and (3) the BCSD, BCCA and SDBC methods underestimated spatial variability in daily precipitation resulting in underprediction of spatial variance and overprediction of spatial correlation, whereas the new stochastic technique (BCSA) replicated observed spatial statistics for both the wet and dry seasons. This study underscores the need to carefully select a downscaling method that reproduces all precipitation characteristics important for the hydrologic system under consideration if local hydrologic impacts of climate variability and change are going to be reasonably predicted. For low-relief, rainfall-dominated watersheds, where reproducing small-scale spatiotemporal precipitation variability is important, the BCSA method is recommended for use over the BCSD, BCCA, or SDBC methods. © Author(s) 2013.

However, it is still challenging to model crop yields based on remotely sensed data due to the variation in radiation use efficiency (RUE) across crop types and the effects of spatial heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a production efficiency model-based method to estimate corn and soybean yields with MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data by explicitly handling the following two issues: (1) field-measured RUE values for corn and soybean are applied to relatively pure pixels instead of the biome-wide RUE value prescribed in the MODIS vegetation productivity product (MOD17); and (2) contributions to productivity from vegetation other than crops in mixed pixels are deducted at the level of MODIS resolution. Our estimated yields statistically correlate with the national survey data for rainfed counties in the Midwestern US with low errors for both corn (R2 = 0.77; RMSE = 0.89 MT/ha) and soybeans (R2 = 0.66; RMSE = 0.38 MT/ha). Because the proposed algorithm does not require any retrospective analysis that constructs empirical relationships between the reported yields and remotely sensed data, it could monitor crop yields over large areas. © 2013 by the authors.","Crop yield; Modis gpp; Radiation use efficiency; Remote sensing; Spatial heterogeneity","Crops; Efficiency; Pixels; Productivity; Radiation effects; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Vegetation; Crop yield; Empirical relationships; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer datum; Modis gpp; Radiation use efficiency; Remote sensing techniques; Spatial heterogeneity; Vegetation productivity; Data handling",Article,Scopus

Elevated greenhouse gases (GHG), as well as land cover/land use change (LCLUC), can influence regional climate dynamics. Biophysical factors such as topography, soil type, and seasonal rainfall can strongly affect crop yields. We used a regional climate model derived from the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) to compare the effects of projected future GHG and future LCLUC on spatial variability of crop yields in East Africa. Crop yields were estimated with a process-based simulation model. The results suggest that: (1) GHG-influenced and LCLUC-influenced yield changes are highly heterogeneous across this region; (2) LCLUC effects are significant drivers of yield change; and (3) high spatial variability in yield is indicated for several key agricultural sub-regions of East Africa. Food production risk when considered at the household scale is largely dependent on the occurrence of extremes, so mean yield in some cases may be an incomplete predictor of risk. The broad range of projected crop yields reflects enormous variability in key parameters that underlie regional food security; hence, donor institutions' strategies and investments might benefit from considering the spatial distribution around mean impacts for a given region. Ultimately, global assessments of food security risk would benefit from including regional and local assessments of climate impacts on food production. This may be less of a consideration in other regions. This study supports the concept that LCLUC is a first-order factor in assessing food production risk. © 2011 The Author(s).",,"Biophysical factors; Climate change impact; Climate impacts; Crop yield; East Africa; East africans; First-order; Food production; Food production systems; Food security; Future climate; Key parameters; Land-cover/land-use change; Land-use change; Regional atmospheric modeling systems; Regional climate; Regional climate models; Regional scale; Seasonal rainfall; Simulation model; Soil types; Spatial variability; Sub-regions; Climate models; Computer simulation; Crops; Economics; Food supply; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Climate change; assessment method; atmospheric modeling; climate change; climate modeling; crop yield; environmental factor; food production; food security; greenhouse gas; heterogeneity; land cover; land use change; numerical model; rainfall; regional climate; risk factor; seasonal variation; soil type; spatial distribution; spatial variation; topography; vulnerability; East Africa",Article,Scopus

Consequently, there is an emphasis on upgrading farming practices by shifting toward smart farming (SF) - utilizing advanced information and communication technologies to improve the quantity and quality of the crop with minimal labor interference. SF has gained lots of interest in recent years utilizing a variety of technological innovations in the field, which imposes a challenge on farmers and technology integrators to identify suitable technologies and best practices for a particular application. This article provides a survey of the most recent SF scientific literature to identify common practices toward technology integration, challenges, and solutions. The survey was conducted on 588 papers published on the IEEE database following Cochrane methods to ensure appropriate analysis and interpretation of results. The papers' contributions were analyzed to identify necessary technologies that constitute SF, and consequently, research themes were identified.

MELA is capable of extending temporally limited local hydroclimatic measurements at fine spatial resolution to longer periods, using remotely-sensed hydroclimatic data readily available for longer periods but at coarse spatial resolution. We demonstrate the implementation of MELA to extrapolate the monthly local soil moisture measurements at multiple depths from 2015–2021 to 1958–2021 in a semi-arid region. Such data extrapolators are imperative to generate longer historical data needed to adequately train and test AI models while enhancing the chance of capturing the effects of extreme climates on spatially variable soil moisture. The MELA-extrapolated local soil moisture subsequently allowed the construction of monthly time-series of field-scale soil moisture distributions with a normalized accuracy of 72% and prediction of countywide annual winter wheat yields – using MELA-extrapolated soil moisture data and eXplainable AI (XAI) – with a normalized accuracy of 81%. Furthermore, the XAI model ranked the predictors based on their importance in estimating winter wheat yields, in which the soil moisture near the surface and in the root zone and precipitation totals were found to be more influential than temperature on crop yields in the semi-arid region. The XAI model also unveiled the inflection points of the predictors beyond which crop yields would increase or decrease. Moreover, the AI-based analyses in conjunction with climate projections from global climate models suggest potential reductions in rainfed crop yields in the study area by 2050 and 2100 in the absence of climate-resilient mitigation and adaptation plans. © 2022 The Author(s)","Artificial Intelligence; Climate change impacts; Crop yield analysis; Data generator; Soil moisture analysis","Arid regions; Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Climate models; Crops; Extrapolation; Image resolution; Soil moisture; Climate change impact; Crop yield; Crop yield analyse; Data generator; Hydroclimatic; Semi-arid region; Soil moisture analysis; Spatial resolution; Winter wheat yields; Yield analysis; Learning algorithms",Article,Scopus

A larger problem is that the level of use of digital technology varies from person to person. Therefore, a digital divide may even exist among elderly individuals. Considering the recent accelerating digital transformation in our society, it is highly likely that elderly individuals are experiencing many difficulties in their daily life. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly address and manage these difficulties. Research objective This study aims to predict the digital divide in the elderly population and provide essential insights into managing it. To this end, predictive analysis is performed using public data and machine learning techniques. Methods and materials This study used data from the ‘2020 Report on Digital Information Divide Survey’ published by the Korea National Information Society Agency. In establishing the prediction model, various independent variables were used. Ten variables with high importance for predicting the digital divide were identified and used as critical, independent variables to increase the convenience of analyzing the model. The data were divided into 70% for training and 30% for testing. The model was trained on the training set, and the model’s predictive accuracy was analyzed on the test set. The prediction accuracy was analyzed using logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). A convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to further improve the accuracy. In addition, the importance of variables was analyzed using data from 2019 before the COVID-19 outbreak, and the results were compared with the results from 2020. Results The study results showed that the variables with high importance in the 2020 data predicting the digital divide of elderly individuals were the demographic perspective, internet usage perspective, self-efficacy perspective, and social connectedness perspective. These variables, as well as the social support perspective, were highly important in 2019. The highest prediction accuracy was achieved using the CNN-based model (accuracy: 80.4%), followed by the XGBoost model (accuracy: 79%) and LR model (accuracy: 78.3%). The lowest accuracy (accuracy: 72.6%) was obtained using the DT model. Discussion The results of this analysis suggest that support that can strengthen the practical connection of elderly individuals through digital devices is becoming more critical than ever in a situation where digital transformation is accelerating in various fields. In addition, it is necessary to comprehensively use classification algorithms from various academic fields when constructing a classification model to obtain higher prediction accuracy. Conclusion The academic significance of this study is that the CNN, which is often employed in image and video processing, was extended and applied to a social science field using structured data to improve the accuracy of the prediction model. The practical significance of this study is that the prediction models and the analytical methodologies proposed in this article can be applied to classify elderly people affected by the digital divide, and the trained models can be used to predict the people of younger generations who may be affected by the digital divide. Another practical significance of this study is that, as a method for managing individuals who are affected by a digital divide, the self-efficacy perspective about acquiring and using ICTs and the socially connected perspective are suggested in addition to the demographic perspective and the internet usage perspective. © 2023 Park, Feng.

The reliability with which these variables infer on yields depends, among many other factors, also on their aggregation in the space domain, for example on the type of the crop masks utilized in the aggregation process from point to regional scale. This work investigates how the yield explanatory power of satellite-derived indicators is changing moving from time-stable arable land masks to annual crop group-specific masks. We compare in particular the linkage between time series of regional crop yield in Europe and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), when generic arable land masks or crop group-specific and year-specific information are applied to aggregate pixel values at regional level. Regional (Eurostat level NUTS-2) crop yield statistics were collected from official databases for the period 2003–2019, while NDVI data were derived from MODIS daily products at 250 m spatial resolution for the same reference period. Regional NDVI profiles were retrieved by averaging single pixels time series according to the information of five crop masks, including generic arable land masks, crop group-specific static masks (separating winter and spring crops from summer crops), and annual crop group-specific masks (distinguishing between the two crop groups and varying in time). A compared correlation analysis between yield data and regional temporal NDVI profiles was performed assuming a linear regression model. Coefficient of determination R2 and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were computed to assess the models’ errors and to analyze the effect of the aggregation on the different crop masks. Results indicated an improvement in yield estimation when using annual crop group-specific indicators with respect to generic and static products. Although not homogeneously distributed throughout Europe, advantages have been highlighted both in terms of accuracy and timeliness of the prediction. In most regions, the introduction of annual masks allowed to reduce RMSE values by 0.3 t/ha and advanced forecast times by up to 30 days. The added value in the use of annual crop group-specific masks concerned the two European most cultivated crops, namely soft wheat and grain maize. © 2023 The Author(s)","Crop masks; Crop monitoring; Crop yield forecasting; NDVI; Regional forecast; Remote Sensing","Forecasting; Land use; Linear regression; Mean square error; Meteorology; Pixels; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Time series; Arable land; Crop mask; Crop monitoring; Crop yield; Crop yield forecasting; Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometers; Normalized difference vegetation index; Regional forecast; Remote-sensing; Times series; Crops; arable land; crop yield; MODIS; NDVI; spatial resolution; Europe",Article,Scopus

Developments in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms and sensor technology help to estimate yields efficiency. Previous studies have been based on less cultivars (&lt;10) and ideal experimental environments, it is not available in practical production. Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate the yield parameters of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) under lodging conditions using RGB information. In this study, 17 time point data throughout the soybean growing season in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, China, were collected, and the vegetation index, texture information, canopy cover, and crop height were obtained by UAV-image processing. After that, partial least squares regression (PLSR), logistic regression (Logistic), random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine regression (SVM), and deep learning neural network (DNN) were used to estimate the yield parameters. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) The most suitable time point to estimate the yield was flowering stage (48 days), which was when most of the soybean cultivars flowered. (2) The multiple data fusion improved the accuracy of estimating the yield parameters, and the texture information has a high potential to contribute to the estimation of yields, and (3) The DNN model showed the best accuracy of training (R2=0.66 rRMSE=32.62%) and validation (R2=0.50, rRMSE=43.71%) datasets.

In pistachio trees, as in other woody crops, the volume of the canopy is a key factor that affects the pistachio crop load, water requirements, and quality. However, canopy/crown monitoring is time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it is traditionally carried out by measuring tree dimensions in the field. Therefore, methods for rapid tree canopy characterization are needed for providing accurate information that can be used for management decisions. The present study focuses on developing a new, fast, and low-cost technique, based on two main steps, for estimating the canopy volume in pistachio trees. The first step is based on adequately planning the UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) flight according to light conditions and segmenting the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) imagery using machine learning methods. The second step is based on measuring vegetation planar area and ground shadows using two methodological approaches: a pixel-based classification approach and an OBIA (object-based image analysis) approach. The results show statistically significant linear relationships (p &lt; 0.05) between the ground-truth data and the estimated volume of pistachio tree crowns, with R2 &gt; 0.8 (pixel-based classification) and R2 &gt; 0.9 (OBIA). The proposed methodologies show potential benefits for accurately monitoring the vegetation of the trees. Moreover, the method is compatible with other remote sensing techniques, usually performed at solar noon, so UAV operators can plan a flexible working day. Further research is needed to verify whether these results can be extrapolated to other woody crops. © 2022 by the authors.","aerial; drone; image analysis; leaf area; machine learning; pistachio; precision agriculture; random forest; spatial variability","Agricultural robots; Antennas; Crops; Forestry; Image analysis; Machine learning; Pixels; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Vegetation mapping; Aerial vehicle; Image-analysis; Leaf area; Machine-learning; Pistachio; Precision Agriculture; Random forests; Red green blues; Spatial variability; Woody crop; Drones",Article,Scopus

The objective of this research was to estimate soil pH from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 satellite-derived indices; data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 satellite missions were used to generate indices and as proxies in a statistical model to estimate soil pH. Step-wise multiple regression (SWMR), artificial neural networks (ANN), and random forest (RF) regression were used to develop predictive models for soil pH, SWMR, ANN, and RF regression models. The SWMR greedy method of variable selection was used to select the appropriate independent variables that were highly correlated with soil pH. Variables that were retained in the SWMR are B2, B11, Brightness index, Salinity index 2, Salinity index 5 of Sentinel-2 data; VH/VV index of Sentinel 1 and TIR1 (thermal infrared band1) Landsat-8 with p-value < 0.05. Among the four statistical models developed, the class-wise RF model performed better than other models with a cumulative correlation coefficient of 0.87 and RMSE of 0.35. The better performance of class-wise RF models can be attributed to different spectral characteristics of different soil pH groups. More than 70% of the soils in Angul and Balangir districts are acidic soils, and therefore, the training of the dataset was affected by that leading to misclassification of neutral and alkaline soils hindering the performance of single class models. Our results showed that the spectral bands and indices can be used as proxies to soil pH with individual classes of acidic, neutral, and alkaline soils.

The leave-one-out cross-validation method, or simply leave one out (LOO), is often used to assess model performance or to select among competing models when the sample size is small. However, the model choice is typically made using only the testing dataset, which can be misleading by favouring unnecessarily complex models. The nested cross-validation approach was introduced in machine learning to avoid this problem by truly utilizing three datasets even with limited databases. In this study, we propose one particular implementation of the nested cross-validation, called the nested leave-two-out cross-validation method or simply the leave two out (LTO), to choose the best model with an optimal model selection (using the validation dataset) and estimate the true model quality (using the testing dataset). Two applications are considered: robusta coffee in Cu M'gar (Dak Lak, Vietnam) and grain maize over 96 French departments. In both cases, LOO is misleading by choosing models that are too complex; LTO indicates that simpler models actually perform better when a reliable generalization test is considered. The simple models obtained using the LTO approach have improved yield anomaly forecasting skills in both study crops. This LTO approach can also be used in seasonal forecasting applications. We suggest that the LTO method should become a standard procedure for statistical crop modelling.

Understanding plant genomics may facilitate the identification, cloning, and sequencing of genes involved in resistance to adverse environmental influences. Numerous techniques for crop improvement have emerged over the last few decades, including tissue culture transformation and mutagenesis. Recently, artificial intelligence and machine learning have been integrated as a potential multidisciplinary approach to enhancing and improving the agriculture sector, including food, and this field is rapidly evolving.

Hyperspectral narrowbands are more sensitive spectrally to changes in crop growth than multispectral broadbands but few studies quantified the gains in the former over the later. The PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) mission offers narrow (≤10 nm) band capability across the full optical range. The multispectral broadband Sentinel-2 mission carries four experimental red-edge and near infrared (NIR) hyperspectral narrow (≤20 nm) bands. We compared the performance of PRISMA and Sentinel-2 spectral bands at important phases of crop development (vegetative, reproductive, maturity) in estimating field-level biomass and yield for corn, rice, soybean, and wheat. We selected three data-driven methods: two-band vegetation indices (TBVIs), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and random forest (RF). The PRISMA and Sentinel-2 models on average explained approximately 20% more variability in biomass and yield with RF than TBVIs and PLSR. The mean RMSE of the PRISMA RF models was 0.42 and 0.17 kg m−2, which was lower than the Sentinel-2 RF models (0.48 and 0.18 kg m−2). Multidate image (seasonal) model performance was generally higher than single-date image model performance. PRISMA shortwave infrared narrowbands and Sentinel-2 red-edge and near infrared bands were among the top-performing spectral regions. The results highlight potential complementarity between the PRISMA and Sentinel-2 missions for predicting crop biomass and yield.

By employing comprehensive daily sales data for a major high street retailer with over 2000 stores across England and adopting a random forest methodology, the study quantifies the influence of various weather conditions on daily retail sales. Results indicate that weather impact is greatest in the summer and spring months and that wind is consistently found to be the most influential weather condition. The top five most weather-dependent categories cover a range of different product types, with health foods emerging as the most susceptible to the weather.

Numerous experiments have been conducted to assess the performance of CA under various local conditions, and meta-analysis has become a standard approach in agricultural sector for analysing and summarizing the experimental data. Meta-analysis provides valuable synthetic information based on mean effect size estimation. However, summarizing large amounts of information by way of a single mean effect value is not always satisfactory, especially when considering agricultural practices. Indeed, their impacts on crop yields are often non-linear, and vary widely depending on a number of factors, including soil properties and local climate conditions. To address this issue, here we present a machine learning approach to produce data-driven global maps describing the spatial distribution of the productivity of CA versus conventional tillage (CT). Our objective is to evaluate and compare several machine-learning models for their ability in estimating the productivity of CA systems, and to analyse uncertainty in the model outputs. We consider different usages, including classification, point regression and quantile regression. Our approach covers the comparison of 12 different machine learning algorithms, model training, tuning with cross-validation, testing, and global projection of results. The performances of these algorithms are compared based on a recent global dataset including more than 4,000 pairs of crop yield data for CA vs. CT. We show that random forest has the best performance in classification and regression, while quantile regression forest performs better than quantile neural networks in quantile regression. The best algorithms are used to map crop productivity of CA vs. CT at the global scale, and results reveal that the performance of CA vs. CT is characterized by a strong spatial variability, and that the probability of yield gain with CA is highly dependent on geographical locations. This result demonstrates that our approach is much more informative than simply presenting average effect sizes produced by standard meta-analyses, and paves the way for such probabilistic, spatially-explicit approaches in many other fields of research.

Remote sensing provides nondestructive and early predictions of yield and GPC, respectively. However, whether it is possible to simultaneously predict yield and GPC in one model and the accuracy and influencing factors are still unclear. In this study, we made a systematic comparison of different deep learning models in terms of data fusion, time-series feature extraction, and multitask learning. The results showed that time-series data fusion significantly improved yield and GPC prediction accuracy with R2 values of 0.817 and 0.809. Multitask learning achieved simultaneous prediction of yield and GPC with comparable accuracy to the single-task model. We further proposed a two-to-two model that combines data fusion (two kinds of data sources for input) and multitask learning (two outputs) and compared different feature extraction layers, including RNN (recurrent neural network), LSTM (long short-term memory), CNN (convolutional neural network), and attention module. The two-to-two model with the attention module achieved the best prediction accuracy for yield (R2 = 0:833) and GPC (R2 = 0:846). The temporal distribution of feature importance was visualized based on the attention feature values. Although the temporal patterns of structural traits and spectral traits were inconsistent, the overall importance of both structural traits and spectral traits at the postanthesis stage was more important than that at the preanthesis stage. This study provides new insights into the simultaneous prediction of yield and GPC using deep learning from time-series proximal sensing, which may contribute to the accurate and efficient predictions of agricultural production.

In response, the agroforestry technology intercropping of Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.)) and Maize (Zea mays L.) was developed to complement conventional soil fertility management technologies. However, diversified information on the profitability of Gliricidia‐Maize intercropping system in dryland areas is scanty. Using data from the Gliricidia and maize models of the Next Generation version of the Agriculture Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM), this study estimates the profitability of the Gliricidia‐Maize system relative to an unfertilized sole maize system. Results show significant heterogeneity in profitability indicators both in absolute and relative economic terms. Aggregated over a 20‐year cycle, Gliricidia‐Maize intercropping exhibited a higher Net Present Value (NPV = Tsh 19,238,798.43) and Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR = 4.27) than the unfertilized sole maize system. The NPV and BCR of the latter were Tsh 10,934,669.90 and 3.59, respectively. Moreover, the returns to labour per person day in the Gliricidia‐Maize system was 1.5 times those of the unfertilized sole maize system. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the profitability of the Gliricidia‐Maize system is more negatively affected by the decrease in output prices than the increase in input prices. A 30% decrease in the former leads to a decrease in NPV and BCR by 38% and 30%, respectively. Despite the higher initial costs of the agroforestry establishment, the 30% increase in input prices affects more disproportionally unfertilized sole maize than the Gliricidia‐Maize system in absolute economic terms, i.e., 11.1% versus 8.8% decrease in NPV. In relative economic terms, an equal magnitude of change in input prices exerts the same effect on the unfertilized sole maize and the Gliricidia‐maize systems. This result implies that the monetary benefits accrued after the first year of agroforestry establishment offset the initial investment costs. The Gliricidia‐Maize intercropping technology therefore is profitable with time, and it can contribute to increased household income and food security. Helping farmers to overcome initial investment costs and manage agroforestry technologies well to generate additional benefits is critical for the successful scaling of the Gliricidia‐ Maize intercropping technology in dryland areas of Dodoma, Tanzania. : © 2021 by the authors.

On-farm agroforestry systems can reduce dependency on off-farm fuel; however, the output of on-farm produced fuel is typically uncertain as production potentials are often not known. In this paper, we have developed allometric equations to model the above-ground woody biomass (AGWB) production from intercropped Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp (Gliricidia) shrubs and Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. (pigeon pea) plants. Methods: We used a destructive sampling approach, for measuring the dendrometric characteristics, such as the root collar diameter at a 20 cm stem height (RCD20) and the stem height to estimate the AGWB production. The models are based on 112 Gliricidia and 80 pigeon pea observations from annually pruned plants. Seven allometric equations were fitted to derive the best-fit models for the AGWB production. Results: We found that using a natural log-transformed linear model with RCD20 as a single predictor variable provides the highest explanatory value to estimate the AGWB production (Gliricidia: R2 = 95.7%, pigeon pea: R2 = 91.4%) while meeting Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimator requirements. Adding stem height as an additional variable to predict the AGWB production does not improve model accuracy enough to justify the extra work for including it. Conclusions: While on-farm pigeon pea plants produced a stable amount of woody biomass per annum, annual fuelwood production from Gliricidia shrubs increased over the years. Compared to the annual fuelwood consumption data from the literature, our results show that on-farm produced fuelwood can substantially offset the demand for off-farm fuel, potentially resulting in household fuelwood autarky. © 2021, The Author(s).","Agroforestry; Energy mix; Energy self-sufficiency; Food security; Intercropping; Smallholder farmer","Biomass; Deforestation; Fuels; Wood products; Above-ground woody biomass; Agroforestry; Biomass productions; Energy mix; Energy self-sufficiency; Food security; Fuelwood; Intercropping; Pigeon pea; Smallholder farmers; Food supply; allometry; crop production; estimation method; legume; semiarid region; shrub; spatiotemporal analysis; Tanzania; Cajanus cajan; Gliricidia; Gliricidia sepium",Article,Scopus

In the last decade, precision agriculture technology has become affordable in many countries; Global Positioning Systems for automatic guidance instruments and proximal sensors can be used to guide the distribution of nutrients such as nitrogen (N) fertilization using real-time applications. A two-year field experiment (2017–2018) was carried out to quantify maize yield in response to variable rate (VR) N distribution, which was determined with a proximal vigour sensor, as an alternative to a fixed rate (FR) in a cereal-livestock farm located in the Po valley (northern Italy). The amount of N distributed for the FR (140 kg N ha−1) was calculated according to the crop requirement and the regional regulation: ±30% of the FR rate was applied in the VR treatment according to the Vigour S-index calculated on-the-go from the CropSpec sensor. The two treatments of N fertilization did not result in a significant difference in yield in both years. The findings suggest that the application of VR is more economically profitable than the FR application rate, especially under the hypothesis of VR application at a farm scale. The outcome of the experiment suggests that VR is a viable and profitable technique that can be easily applied at the farm level by adopting proximal sensors to detect the actual crop N requirement prior to stem elongation. Besides the economic benefits, the VR approach can be regarded as a sustainable practice that meets the current European Common Agricultural Policy. © 2021 by the authors.

In particular, limited input data are the main obstacles to obtain reliable classification results for early crop mapping. This study investigates the potential of a hybrid classification approach, i.e., CNN-random forest (CNN-RF), in the context of early crop mapping, that combines the automatic feature extraction capability of CNN with the superior discrimination capability of an RF classifier. Two experiments on incremental crop classification with unmanned aerial vehicle images were conducted to compare the performance of CNN-RF with that of CNN and RF with respect to the length of the time-series and training data sizes. When sufficient time-series images and training data were used for the classification, the accuracy of CNN-RF was slightly higher or comparable with that of CNN. In contrast, when fewer images and the smallest training data were used at the early crop growth stage, CNN-RF was substantially beneficial and the overall accuracy increased by maximum 6.7%p and 4.6%p in the two study areas, respectively, compared to CNN. This is attributed to its ability to discriminate crops from features with insufficient information using a more sophisticated classifier. The experimental results demonstrate that CNN-RF is an effective classifier for early crop mapping when only limited input images and training samples are available. © 2021 by the authors.

It can utilize city wide availability of satellite images as well as more sparse information from street-level images where they are available leading to improvements in accuracy by 6, 10, and 11%.

In addition, the model enabled the evaluation of the spatial distribution of N in the coffee trees, as well as quantification of N deficiency in the crop for the whole area. The GNDVI and GOSAVI allowed the verification that 22% of the entire crop area had plants with N deficiency symptoms, which would result in a reduction of 78% in the amount of N applied by the producer. © 2021 by the authors.

This yield may be improved by the automatic detection of diseases and the consequent reduction in the use of pesticides. A digital processing system for images was thus developed and used to identify lesions on the leaves of cotton plants. A collection of 60,659 images of sub-metric resolution showing samples of soil and both healthy and damaged leaves was obtained and processed with an algorithm for the extraction of texture from 102x102-pixel samples. Then they analyzed with a neuro-fuzzy classifier trained to discriminate the three types of regions (soil, healthy leaf, and lesioned leaf). The algorithm developed was able to recognize the three classes. It generated a great amount of information on recognition of background which was more consistent than leaf damage areas. Therefore, it surpassed the performance of areas of healthy leaves. A similar trend was found for sensitivity. The overall accuracy of the system was 71.2%, suggesting that the unbalanced data of the different classes had skewed the results of the algorithm, as the number of false positives for the less well represented classes was greater. The analysis of unbalance (F-Score) showed that, independent of the volume of data, the attributes of texture utilized yielded better results for the images containing areas of damage in relation to overall accuracy. Therefore, given the challenges involved in the automatic identification of lesions in agricultural crops, such as variations in illumination, color, and texture, as well as obstruction, overlapping, and complexity of the region of which the image was taken, the behavior of the model was deemed satisfactory. Given the hybrid nature of the model, it should contribute to the state of the art in the use of intelligent systems in agriculture.

This can lead to structural changes in entire ecosystems, and serious, persistent environmental consequences. However, many of these changes occur in vast and poorly accessible biomes and involve myriad species. As a consequence, conventional methods of measurement and data analysis are resource-intensive, restricted in scope, and in some cases, intractable for measuring species changes in remote areas. In this article, we introduce a method for detecting flowers of tundra plant species in large data sets obtained by aerial drones, making it possible to understand ecological change at scale, in remote areas. We focus on the sedge species E. vaginatum that is dominant at the investigated tundra field site in the Canadian Arctic. Our system is a modified version of the Faster R-CNN architecture capable of real-world plant phenology analysis. Our model outperforms experienced human annotators in both detection and counting, recording much higher recall and comparable level of precision, regardless of the image quality caused by varying weather conditions during the data collection.

The National Agriculture and Food Research Organization– Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Climate Center (NARO-APCC) Crop Forecasting Service provides yield forecasts for global cropland on a monthly basis using seasonal temperature and precipitation forecasts as the main inputs, and 1 year of testing the operation of the service was recently completed. Here we evaluate the forecasts for the 2019 yields of major commodity crops by comparing with the reported yields and forecasts from the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Forecasts for maize, wheat, soybean, and rice were evaluated for 20 countries located in the Northern Hemisphere, including 39 crop-producing states in the United States, for which 2019 reported yields were already publicly available. The NARO-APCC forecasts are available several months earlier than the JRC and USDA forecasts. The skill of the NARO-APCC forecasts was good in absolute terms, but the forecast errors in the NARO-APCC forecasts were almost always larger than those of the JRC and USDA forecasts. The forecast errors in the JRC and USDA forecasts decreased as the harvest approached, whereas those in the NARO-APCC forecasts were rather stable over the season, with some exceptions. Although this feature seems to be a disadvantage, it may turn into an advantage if skillful forecasts are achievable in the earlier stages of a season. We conclude by discussing relative advantages and disadvantages and potential ways to improve global yield forecasting. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.","Agriculture; Climate prediction; Climate services; Forecast verification/skill; Regression analysis; Seasonal forecasting","Agricultural robots; Food supply; Supply chains; Weather forecasting; Climate extremes; Economic Co-operation; European Commission; Northern Hemispheres; Precipitation forecast; Research centres; Seasonal temperature; U.s. department of agricultures; Crops; agricultural development; climate prediction; crop yield; food production; forecasting method; regression analysis; seasonal variation; United States; Glycine max",Article,Scopus

We modified the DRAINMOD model to simulate macropore flow using a simple approach as part of developing the DRAINMOD-P model to simulate phosphorus dynamics in artificially drained agricultural lands. The Hagen-Poiseuille's law was used to estimate the flow capacity of macropores. When ponding depths on the soil surface are greater than Kirkham's depth, water is assumed to flow through macropores directly to tile drains without interaction with the soil matrix. In the modified model, macropore size is adjusted based on wet or dry conditions while connectivity is altered by tillage. The model was tested using a 4-year data set from a subsurface drained field in northwest Ohio. The soils at the field are classified as very poorly drained and are prone to desiccation cracking. The modified model predicted the daily and monthly subsurface drainage with average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values of 0.48 and 0.59, respectively. The cumulative drainage over the 4-year simulation period was under-predicted by 8%. The new macropore component was able to capture about 75% of 60 peak drainage flow events. However, surface runoff was over-predicted for the entire study period. Annual water budgets using measured data (precipitation, subsurface drainage, and surface runoff) and model predictions (evapotranspiration, vertical seepage, and change in storage) were not balanced with an average annual imbalance of 6.4 cm. The lack of closure in the water balance suggests that errors may have occurred in field measurements, particularly, surface runoff. Overall, incorporating macropore flow into DRAINMOD improved predictions of daily drainage peaks and enabled the model to predict subsurface drainage flux contributed by macropore flow, which is critical for expanding DRAINMOD to simulate phosphorus transport in subsurface drained agricultural land. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural drainage; Cracking soil; Hydrologic modeling; Preferential flow","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Budget control; Digital storage; Forecasting; Groundwater flow; Matrix algebra; Phosphorus; Runoff; Soils; Water pollution; Agricultural fields; Agricultural land; Hagen-Poiseuille's law; Model modification; Phosphorus dynamics; Phosphorus transport; Subsurface drainages; Subsurface drains; Drainage; agricultural land; drainage; field method; macropore; model test; phosphorus; runoff; simulation; soil surface; Ohio; United States",Article,Scopus

We conducted a retrospective study using the wheat blast outbreaks in Bangladesh, which occurred for the first time in Asia in 2016, to study a what-if scenario that if there was seasonal disease risk prediction at that time, the epidemics could be prevented or reduced through prediction-based interventions. Two factors govern the answer: the seasonal disease risk prediction is accurate enough to use, and there are effective and realistic control measures to be used upon the prediction. In this study, we focused on the former. To simulate the wheat blast risk and wheat yield in the target region, a high-resolution climate reanalysis product and spatiotemporally downscaled seasonal climate forecasts from eight global climate models were used as inputs for both models. The calibrated wheat blast model successfully simulated the spatial pattern of disease epidemics during the 2014–2018 seasons and was subsequently used to generate seasonal wheat blast risk prediction before each winter season starts. The predictability of the resulting predictions was evaluated against observation-based model simulations. The potential value of utilizing the seasonal wheat blast risk prediction was examined by comparing actual yields resulting from the risk-averse (proactive) and risk-disregarding (conservative) decisions. Overall, our results from this retrospective study showed the feasibility of seasonal forecast-based early warning system for the pre-season strategic interventions of forecasted wheat blast in Bangladesh. © Copyright © 2020 Kim and Choi.","climate reanalysis; disease epidemiological model; early warning system; global crop calendar; seasonal disease risk; winter wheat",,Article,Scopus

An analysis of variance (ANOVA), linear mixed-effects model (LMM), and MP5 regression tree model were used to evaluate the grain yield response. All the methods identified fertilizer application and environmental factors as the main variables that explained 80% of the variance in grain yields. Mineral nitrogen fertilizer (NF) application was the major factor that influenced the grain yield in all methods. Farmyard manure slightly influenced the grain yield with no NF application in the ANOVA and M5P regression tree. While sources of environmental factors were unmeasured in the ANOVA test, they were quantified in detail in the LMM and M5P model. The LMM and M5P model identified the cumulative number of freezing days in December as the main climate-based determinant of the grain yield variation. Additionally, the temperature in October, the cumulative number of freezing days in February, the yield of the preceding crop, and the total nitrogen in the soil were determinants of the grain yield in both models. Apart from the common determinants that appeared in both models, the LMM additionally showed precipitation in June and the cumulative number of days in July with temperatures above 30◦C, while the M5P model showed soil organic carbon as an influencing factor of the grain yield. The ANOVA results provide only the main factors affecting the WW yield. The LMM had a better predictive performance compared to the M5P, with smaller root mean square and mean absolute errors. However, they were richer regressors than the ANOVA. The M5P model presented an intuitive visualization of important variables and their critical thresholds, and revealed other variables that were not captured by the LMM model. Hence, the use of different methods can strengthen the statement of the analysis, and thus, the co-use of the LMM and M5P model should be considered, especially in large databases involving multiple variables. © 2020 by the authors.

There are growing interests to study the impacts of drought on crop. However, studies on the impacts of heat stress on crop photosynthesis and yield are still lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we used both statistical models and satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data to assess the impacts of heat stress on wheat yield in a major wheat growing region, the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), India. The statistical model showed that the relationships between different accumulated degree days (ADD) and reported wheat yield were significantly negative. The results confirmed that heat stress affected wheat yield across this region. Building on such information, satellite SIF observations were used to further explore the physiological basis of heat stress impacts on wheat yield. Our results showed that SIF had strong negative correlations with ADDs and was capable of monitoring heat stress. The SIF results also indicated that heat stress caused yield loss by directly impacting the photosynthetic capacity in wheat. Overall, our findings demonstrated that SIF as an effective proxy for photosynthetic activity would improve our understanding of the impacts of heat stress on wheat yield. © 2020 by the authors.

The Sentinel-3 OLCI Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (OTCI) is an indicator of canopy chlorophyll content and is intended to continue the legacy of the Envisat MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI). Despite spectral similarities, validation and verification of consistency is essential to inform the user community about the product's accuracy, uncertainty, and fitness for purpose. This paper aims to: (i) describe the theoretical basis of the Sentinel-3 OTCI and (ii) evaluate the spatiotemporal consistency between the Sentinel-3 OTCI and the Envisat MTCI. Two approaches were used to conduct the evaluation. Firstly, agreement between the Sentinel-3 OTCI and the Envisat MTCI archive was assessed over the Committee for Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Land Product Validation (LPV) core validation sites, enabling the temporal consistency of the two products to be investigated. Secondly, intercomparison of monthly Level-3 Sentinel-3 OTCI and Envisat MTCI composites was carried out to evaluate the spatial distribution of differences across the globe. In both cases, the agreement was quantified with statistical metrics (R2, NRMSD, bias) using an Envisat MTCI climatology based on the MERIS archive as the reference. Our results demonstrate strong agreement between the products. Specifically, high 1:1 correspondence (R2 >0.88), low global mean percentage difference (-1.86 to 0.61), low absolute bias (<0.1), and minimal error (NRMSD ~0.1) are observed. The temporal profiles reveal consistency in the expected range of values, amplitudes, and seasonal trajectories. Biases and discrepancies may be attributed to changes in land management practices, land cover change, and extreme climatic events occurred during the time gap between the missions; however, this requires further investigation. This research confirms that Sentinel-3 OTCI dataset can be used along with the Envisat MTCI to provide a data coverage over the last 20 years. © 2020 by the authors.","Envisat; Intercomparison; Land product; Meris; Mtci; Olci; Otci; Sentinel-3; Validation","Chlorophyll; Algorithm improvements; Earth observation satellites; Land management practices; Medium resolution imaging spectrometers; OLCI Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (OTCI); Optical characteristics; Spatio-temporal consistencies; Validation and verification; Geodetic satellites",Article,Scopus

Over last decades, Poland has faced several major droughts and at least one major soil moisture excess event leading to severe crop losses. This study aims to simulate the multi-annual variability of SM anomalies in Poland, using a process-based SWAT model and to assess the effect of climate change on future extreme SM conditions, potentially affecting crop yields in Poland. A crop-specific indicator based on simulated daily soil moisture content for the critical development stages of investigated crops (winter cereals, spring cereals, potato and maize) was designed, evaluated for past conditions against empirical crop-weather indices (CWIs), and applied for studying future climate conditions. The study used an ensemble of nine bias-corrected EURO-CORDEX projections for two future horizons: 2021–2050 and 2071–2100 under two Representative Concentration Pathways: RCP4.5 and 8.5. Historical simulation results showed that SWAT was capable of capturing major SM deficit and excess episodes for different crops in Poland. For spring cereals, potato and maize, despite a large model spread, projections generally showed increase of severity of soil moisture deficits, as well as of total area affected by them. Ensemble median fraction of land with extreme soil moisture deficits, occupied by each of these crops, is projected to at least double in size. The signals of change in soil moisture excesses for potato and maize were more dependent on selection of RCP and future horizon. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"annual variation; climate change; crop yield; modeling; moisture content; rainfed agriculture; reconstruction; soil moisture; Poland [Central Europe]; Solanum tuberosum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The 14 remote sensing variables were normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), nitrogen reflectance index (NRI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), structure intensive pigment index (SIPI), plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), difference vegetation index (DVI), ratio vegetation index (RVI), Rblue (reflectance at blue band), Rgreen (reflectance at green band), Rred (reflectance at red band) and Rnir (reflectance at near infrared band). The partial least square (PLS) algorithm was used to construct and validate the multivariate remote sensing model of predicting wheat GPC. The research showed a close relationship between wheat GPC and 12 remote sensing variables other than Rblue and Rgreen of the spectral reflectance bands. Among them, except PSRI and Rblue, Rgreen and Rred, other remote sensing vegetation indexes had significant multiple correlations. The optimal principal components of PLS model used to predict wheat GPC were: NDVI, SIPI, PSRI and EVI. All these were sensitive variables to predict wheat GPC. Through modeling set and verification set evaluation, GPC prediction models’ coefficients of determination (R2) were 0.84 and 0.8, respectively. The root mean square errors (RMSE) were 0.43% and 0.54%, respectively. It indicated that the PLS algorithm model predicted wheat GPC better than models for linear regression (LR) and principal components analysis (PCA) algorithms. The PLS algorithm model’s prediction accuracies were above 90%. The improvement was by more than 20% than the model for LR algorithm and more than 15% higher than the model for PCA algorithm.

Images of a 27-ha maize field were captured using a UAV with a consumer-grade RGB camera flying at ~100 m above ground level at three maize growth stages. The collected sequential images were stitched and the Excess Green (ExG) colour feature was extracted to develop prediction models for maize yield and to examine the effect of the variable-rate N application. Various linear regression models between ExG and maize yield were developed for three sample area sizes (21, 106, and 1058 m2). The model performance was evaluated using coefficient of determination (R2), F-test and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between estimated and actual yield. All linear regression models between ExG and yield were significant (p ≤ 0.05). The MAPE ranged from 6.2 to 15.1% at the three sample sizes, although R2 values were all &lt;0.5. Prediction error was lower at the later growth stages, as the crop approached maturity, and at the largest sample level. The ExG image feature showed potential for evaluating the effect of variable-rate N application on crop growth. Overall, the low-cost UAV imaging system provided useful information for field management. © 2019 IAgrE","Colour feature; Maize; Modelling; UAV; Variable-rate application; Yield prediction","Antennas; Crops; Decision making; Forecasting; Imaging systems; Information management; Models; Nitrogen; Regression analysis; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Coefficient of determination; Colour features; Economic decision-making; Linear regression models; Maize; Mean absolute percentage error; Variable rate application; Yield prediction; Grain (agricultural product)",Article,Scopus

This paper provides a novel demonstration of the use of freely available Sentinel-2 data to estimate within-field wheat yield variability in a single year. The impact of data resolution and availability on yield estimation is explored using different combinations of input data. This was achieved by combining Sentinel-2 with environmental data (e.g. meteorological, topographical, soil moisture) for different periods throughout the growing season. Yield was estimated using Random Forest (RF) regression models. They were trained and validated using a dataset containing over 8000 points collected by combine harvester yield monitors from 39 wheat fields in the UK. The results demonstrate that it is possible to produce accurate maps of within-field yield variation at 10 m resolution using Sentinel-2 data (RMSE 0.66 t/ha). When combined with environmental data further improvements in accuracy can be obtained (RMSE 0.61 t/ha). We demonstrate that with knowledge of crop-type distribution it is possible to use these models, trained with data from a few fields, to estimate within-field yield variability on a landscape scale.

A Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was created to determine the effectiveness of agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs) funded through the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. The model was calibrated at the monthly time-step for flow, sediment, dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), total phosphorus (TP), nitrate, and total nitrogen (TN). Field- and watershed-scale sediment and nutrient reductions were calculated due to the implementation of 74 BMP combinations on dairy and cash grain rotations. Modeling results indicated that when multiple BMPs were placed on a field, especially those including filter strips and grassed waterways, sediment and nutrient loads generally were reduced more than single BMP implementation. The most effective in-field practice at reducing DRP and TP on dairy fields was a combination of 5 different BMPs: cover crops, crop rotation, nutrient management plan, reduced tillage, and a filter strip. Conservation cover was the single most effective practice at reducing sediment and nutrient yields. Sediment and nutrient loads decreased at the watershed scale as the quantity and coverage of BMPs increased. When all contracted BMPs were simulated at the watershed scale, sediment loads were reduced 2%, while TP, DRP, TN and nitrate loads were reduced 20%, 9%, 24%, and 17%, respectively. Modeling scenarios also indicated that over-winter manure storage was important to keep soluble nutrients out of waterways. © 2019","Best management practices (BMPs); Edge-of-field (EOF); Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI); Green Bay; Nutrients; Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)","Crops; Fertilizers; Lakes; Nitrates; Restoration; Sediments; Watersheds; Best management practice (BMPs); Edge-of-field (EOF); Great lakes; Green Bay; Soil and water assessment tool; Nutrients; best management practice; calibration; environmental assessment; environmental restoration; field method; implementation process; management practice; nutrient dynamics; soil and water assessment tool; tributary; watershed; East River [New York]; Green Bay; New York [United States]; United States; Wisconsin; Wisconsin Lake",Article,Scopus

The analysis uses 30 years of datasets of rainfall, surface temperature and wind parameters (from 1980 to 2009). We performed a simulation at a spatial resolution of 50 km with the RegCM4.5 model driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis. The rainfall amount is weaker over the Sahel (western and central) and the Guinea region for the warmest years compared to the coldest ones. The analysis of heat fluxes show that the sensible (latent) heat flux is stronger (weaker) during the warmest (coldest) years. When considering the rainfall events, there is a decrease of the number of rainy days over the Guinea Coast (in the South of Cote d'Ivoire, of Ghana and of Benin) and the western and eastern Sahel during warm years. The maximum length of consecutive wet days decreases over the western and eastern Sahel, while the consecutive dry days increase mainly over the Sahel band during the warm years. The percentage of very warm days and warm nights increase mainly over the Sahel domain and the Guinea region. The model also simulates an increase of the warm spell duration index in the whole Sahel domain and over the Guinea Coast in warm years. The analysis of the wind dynamic exhibits during warm years a weakening of the monsoon flow in the lower levels, a strengthening in the magnitude of the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) in the mid-troposphere and a slight increase of the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ) in the upper levels of the atmosphere during warm years. © 2019 by the authors.","RegCM4; Warm years; West Africa","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Heat flux; Rain; Upper atmosphere; African easterly jet; RegCM4; Regional climate modeling; Surface temperatures; Tropical easterly jets; Warm years; West Africa; West African Monsoon; Climate models; climate change; climate modeling; monsoon; rainfall; regional climate; spatial resolution; upper atmosphere; warming; West Africa",Article,Scopus

Non-destructive methods, such as satellite and proximal sensing, are widely used to estimate crop yield and quality characteristics, and spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) are commonly used to present site specific information. The aim of this study was the assessment of SVIs derived from satellite and proximal sensing at different growth stages of table grapes from veraison to harvest. The study took place in a commercial table grape vineyard (Vitis vinifera cv. Thompson Seedless) during three successive cultivation years (2015–2017). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) were calculated by employing satellite imagery (Landsat 8) and proximal sensing (Crop Circle ACS 470) to assess the yield and quality characteristics of table grapes. The SVIs exhibited different degrees of correlations with different measurement dates and sensing methods. Satellite-based GNDVI at harvest presented higher correlations with crop quality characteristics (r = 0.522 for berry diameter, r = 0.537 for pH, r = 0.629 for berry deformation) compared with NDVI. Proximal-based GNDVI at the middle of veraison presented higher correlations compared with NDVI (r = –0.682 for berry diameter, r = –0.565 for berry deformation). Proximal sensing proved to be more accurate in terms of table grape yield and quality characteristics compared to satellite sensing. © 2018 by the authors.

It is therefore common to correct (or adjust) those simulations before using them as inputs into impact models. However, most bias correction (BC) methods are univariate and so do not account for the statistical dependences linking the different locations and/or physical variables of interest. In addition, they are often deterministic, and stochasticity is frequently needed to investigate climate uncertainty and to add constrained randomness to climate simulations that do not possess a realistic variability. This study presents a multivariate method of rank resampling for distributions and dependences (R2D2) bias correction allowing one to adjust not only the univariate distributions but also their inter-variable and inter-site dependence structures. Moreover, the proposed R2D2 method provides some stochasticity since it can generate as many multivariate corrected outputs as the number of statistical dimensions (i.e., number of grid cell × number of climate variables) of the simulations to be corrected. It is based on an assumption of stability in time of the dependence structure - making it possible to deal with a high number of statistical dimensions - that lets the climate model drive the temporal properties and their changes in time. R2D2 is applied on temperature and precipitation reanalysis time series with respect to high-resolution reference data over the southeast of France (1506 grid cell). Bivariate, 1506-dimensional and 3012-dimensional versions of R2D2 are tested over a historical period and compared to a univariate BC. How the different BC methods behave in a climate change context is also illustrated with an application to regional climate simulations over the 2071-2100 period. The results indicate that the 1d-BC basically reproduces the climate model multivariate properties, 2d-R2D2 is only satisfying in the inter-variable context, 1506d-R2D2 strongly improves inter-site properties and 3012d-R2D2 is able to account for both. Applications of the proposed R2D2 method to various climate datasets are relevant for many impact studies. The perspectives of improvements are numerous, such as introducing stochasticity in the dependence itself, questioning its stability assumption, and accounting for temporal properties adjustment while including more physics in the adjustment procedures. © Author(s) 2018.",,"Climate change; Digital storage; Sampling; Dependence structures; Historical periods; Multivariate methods; Physical variables; Realistic variability; Regional climate simulation; Statistical dependence; Univariate distributions; Climate models; climate change; climate modeling; multivariate analysis; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; sampling; sampling bias; simulation; temperature effect; France",Article,Scopus

In these regions, inter-annual variation in climatic factors (such as rainfall) combined with anthropogenic factors (such as civil war) pose major risks to food security. Thus, an operational crop production estimation and forecasting system is required to help decision-makers to make early estimates of potential food availability. Data from NASA's MODIS with official crop statistics were combined to develop an empirical regression-based model to forecast winter wheat and barley production in Iraq. The study explores remotely sensed indices representing crop productivity over the crop growing season to find the optimal correlation with crop production. The potential of three different remotely sensed indices, and information related to the phenology of crops, for forecasting crop production at the governorate level was tested and their results were validated using the leave-one-year-out approach. Despite testing several methodological approaches, and extensive spatio-temporal analysis, this paper depicts the difficulty in estimating crop yield on an annual base using current satellite low-resolution data. However, more precise estimates of crop production were possible. The result of the current research implies that the date of the maximum vegetation index (VI) offered the most accurate forecast of crop production with an average R2 = 0.70 compared to the date of MODIS EVI (Avg R2 = 0.68) and a NPP (Avg R2 = 0.66). When winter wheat and barley production were forecasted using NDVI, EVI and NPP and compared to official statistics, the relative error ranged from − 20 to 20%, − 45 to 28% and − 48 to 22%, respectively. The research indicated that remotely sensed indices could characterize and forecast crop production more accurately than simple cropping area, which was treated as a null model against which to evaluate the proposed approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Crop yield/production forecasting; EVI; MODIS; NDVI; NPP and Iraq; Vegetation phenology","Agriculture; Arid regions; Biology; Cultivation; Decision making; Error statistics; Food supply; Forecasting; NASA; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Crop yield; MODIS; NDVI; NPP and Iraq; Vegetation phenology; Crops; arid region; barley; crop production; crop yield; MODIS; NDVI; phenology; primary production; remote sensing; semiarid region; wheat; accuracy; Article; barley; crop production; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; food insecurity; forecasting; harvest period; Iraq; priority journal; quality control; seasonal variation; vegetation; wheat; winter; article; growing season; harvest; Iraq; nonhuman; phenology; plant yield; productivity; spatiotemporal analysis; vegetation; winter wheat; Iraq; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

To reduce the potential risk and provide support for agricultural flood management, prevention, and mitigation, it is important to account for flood damage to crop production and to understand the relationship between flood characteristics and crop losses. A quantitative and effective evaluation tool is therefore essential to explore what and how flood characteristics will affect the associated crop loss, based on accurately understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of flood evolution and crop growth. Current evaluation methods are generally integrally or qualitatively based on statistic data or ex-post survey with less diagnosis into the process and dynamics of historical flood events. Therefore, a quantitative and spatial evaluation framework is presented in this study that integrates remote sensing imagery and hydraulic model simulation to facilitate the identification of historical flood characteristics that influence crop losses. Remote sensing imagery can capture the spatial variation of crop yields and yield losses from floods on a grid scale over large areas; however, it is incapable of providing spatial information regarding flood progress. Two-dimensional hydraulic model can simulate the dynamics of surface runoff and accomplish spatial and temporal quantification of flood characteristics on a grid scale over watersheds, i.e., flow velocity and flood duration. The methodological framework developed herein includes the following: (a) Vegetation indices for the critical period of crop growth from mid-high temporal and spatial remote sensing imagery in association with agricultural statistics data were used to develop empirical models to monitor the crop yield and evaluate yield losses from flood; (b) The two-dimensional hydraulic model coupled with the SCS-CN hydrologic model was employed to simulate the flood evolution process, with the SCS-CN model as a rainfall-runoff generator and the two-dimensional hydraulic model implementing the routing scheme for surface runoff; and (c) The spatial combination between crop yield losses and flood dynamics on a grid scale can be used to investigate the relationship between the intensity of flood characteristics and associated loss extent. The modeling framework was applied for a 50-year return period flood that occurred in Jilin province, Northeast China, which caused large agricultural losses in August 2013. The modeling results indicated that (a) the flow velocity was the most influential factor that caused spring corn, rice and soybean yield losses from extreme storm event in the mountainous regions; (b) the power function archived the best results that fit the velocity-loss relationship for mountainous areas; and (c) integrated remote sensing imagery and two-dimensional hydraulic modeling approach are helpful for evaluating the influence of historical flood event on crop production and investigating the relationship between flood characteristics and crop yield losses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Flood characteristics; HJ-1A/B imagery; Remote sensing; Two-dimensional hydraulic model; Yield loss","Agricultural robots; Agricultural runoff; Crops; Cultivation; Dynamics; Flood control; Floods; Flow velocity; Food supply; Hydraulic models; Infiltration; Storms; Extreme storm events; Flood characteristics; HJ-1A/B imagery; Methodological frameworks; Remote sensing imagery; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Two-dimensional hydraulic model; Yield loss; Remote sensing; crop production; crop yield; flood; flood control; flood damage; flow velocity; food security; growth rate; maize; mountain region; rainfall-runoff modeling; remote sensing; rice; runoff; satellite imagery; soybean; two-dimensional modeling; yield response; China; Jilin; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Here we provide an assessment of near-term climate change impacts on sorghum yields in West Africa and account for uncertainties both in future climate scenarios and in crop models. Towards this goal, we use simulations of nine bias-corrected CMIP5 climate models and two crop models (SARRA-H and APSIM) to evaluate the robustness of projected crop yield impacts in this area. In broad agreement with the full CMIP5 ensemble, our subset of bias-corrected climate models projects a mean warming of +2.8 °C in the decades of 2031-2060 compared to a baseline of 1961-1990 and a robust change in rainfall in West Africa with less rain in the Western part of the Sahel (Senegal, South-West Mali) and more rain in Central Sahel (Burkina Faso, South-West Niger). Projected rainfall deficits are concentrated in early monsoon season in the Western part of the Sahel while positive rainfall changes are found in late monsoon season all over the Sahel, suggesting a shift in the seasonality of the monsoon. In response to such climate change, but without accounting for direct crop responses to CO2, mean crop yield decreases by about 16-20% and year-to-year variability increases in the Western part of the Sahel, while the eastern domain sees much milder impacts. Such differences in climate and impacts projections between the Western and Eastern parts of the Sahel are highly consistent across the climate and crop models used in this study. We investigate the robustness of impacts for different choices of cultivars, nutrient treatments, and crop responses to CO2. Adverse impacts on mean yield and yield variability are lowest for modern cultivars, as their short and nearly fixed growth cycle appears to be more resilient to the seasonality shift of the monsoon, thus suggesting shorter season varieties could be considered a potential adaptation to ongoing climate changes. Easing nitrogen stress via increasing fertilizer inputs would increase absolute yields, but also make the crops more responsive to climate stresses, thus enhancing the negative impacts of climate change in a relative sense. Finally, CO2fertilization would significantly offset the negative climate impacts on sorghum yields by about 10%, with drier regions experiencing the largest benefits, though the net impacts of climate change remain negative even after accounting for CO2. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Africa; climate change; crop","Crops; Africa; Future climate; West Africa; Climate change; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate modeling; crop yield; cultivar; ecological modeling; numerical model; seasonality; sorghum; West Africa",Article,Scopus

First, the evolution of rainfall and temperature during the twenty-first century is assessed at the local scale using 17 regional climate model (RCM) simulations. A15%-30% rainfall reduction is expected in the fall combined with a 7%-9% annual reduction by 2030-50. Based on a regression model relating yields to rainfall, residual yields (independent of the increasing trend in the present period and from the biennial fruit bearing of the olive tree) are projected to decrease by 7% and 3.5% by 2030-50 for rainfed and irrigated olive groves, respectively. Substantial uncertainties in these results are discussed. AGIS analysis shows a reduction of ground and surface water resources, which are the basis of the present adaptation to rainfall variability, and an uneven potential for adaptation to climate change in the Sierra Mágina region. Despite the important challenges faced by this rural region, there is no consensus among the local key actors regarding adaptation strategies. This is due in part to the diversity among farmers, but also to the different levels of awareness about climate change among all the stakeholders and farmers. Since the projected decline in medium-range future yields is not very high, there might be time and possibilities, especially in the northern part of the Sierra Mágina, to build a local adaptability strategy within the next 20 years that would take into account improved methods of water management and a better economic valorization of olive oil. But at longer time scales, the adaptability of the olive-growing system to yield and water resource declines seems to be threatened. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.",,"adaptive management; climate change; climate modeling; farming system; fruit; future prospect; GIS; interdisciplinary approach; Mediterranean environment; precipitation intensity; socioeconomic impact; stakeholder; timescale; water management; water resource; Andalucia; Jaen [Andalucia]; Sierra Magina Natural Park; Spain",Article,Scopus

The average annual streamflow was simulated to be roughly 124.6mm with relatively small interannual variation during 1974-2010. The seasonal distribution of streamflow was uneven with a maximum in summer and a minimum in winter. Snowmelt, which was mainly produced in April-May, accounted for 4.0% of annual streamflow. Correlations and regression analysis between the interannual variations of major climatic and hydrological variables indicated that precipitation (temperature) had positive (negative) influence on the annual streamflow variation. For the interannual streamflow variations, warmer temperature was slightly more important than the variation of winter precipitation. Comparing streamflow changes in the current years (1980-99) with the future (2030-49), streamflow variations were more sensitive to changing climate in winter and spring than in the other two seasons. Model improvement is expected to enhance the simulation efficiency of SWAT and the analyses of hydrological responses to climatic change in KRW, thus supporting the model's credibility for hydrological cycle research in alpine regions. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.",,"climate change; hydrological cycle; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; precipitation (climatology); river flow; runoff; snowmelt; streamflow; watershed; China; Xizang",Article,Scopus

To some extent, the prediction model for crop yields combining the crop mechanism model with statistical regression model (SRM) can improve the timeliness and robustness of the final yield prediction. In this study, the accumulated biomass (AB) simulated by the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model and multiple climate indices (e.g., climate suitability indices and extreme climate indices) were incorporated into SRM to predict the wheat yield in the North China Plain (NCP). The results showed that the prediction model based on the random forest (RF) algorithm outperformed the prediction models using other regression algorithms. The prediction for the wheat yield at SM (the period from the start of grain filling to the milky stage) based on RF can obtain a higher accuracy (r = 0.86, RMSE = 683 kg ha−1 and MAE = 498 kg ha−1). With the progression of wheat growth, the performances of yield prediction models improved gradually. The prediction of yield at FS (the period from flowering to the start of grain filling) can achieve higher precision and a longer lead time, which can be viewed as the optimum period providing the decent performance of the yield prediction and about one month’s lead time. In addition, the precision of the predicted yield for the irrigated sites was higher than that for the rainfed sites. The APSIM-simulated AB had an importance of above 30% for the last three prediction events, including FIF event (the period from floral initiation to flowering), FS event (the period from flowering to the start of grain filling) and SM event (the period from the start of grain filling to the milky stage), which ranked first in the prediction model. The climate suitability indices, with a higher rank for every prediction event, played an important role in the prediction model. The winter wheat yield in the NCP was seriously affected by the low temperature events before flowering, the high temperature events after flowering and water stress. We hope that the prediction model can be used to develop adaptation strategies to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on crop productivity and provide the data support for food security. © 2022 by the authors.","APSIM model; climate indices; machine learning; North China Plain; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

(Merr.)] roots and bacteria (Bradyrhizobium japonicum) lead to the development of nodules, important legume root structures where atmospheric nitrogen (N2) is fixed into bio-available ammonia (NH3) for plant growth and development. With the recent development of the Soybean Nodule Acquisition Pipeline (SNAP), nodules can more easily be quantified and evaluated for genetic diversity and growth patterns across unique soybean root system architectures. We explored six diverse soybean genotypes across three field year combinations in three early vegetative stages of development and report the unique relationships between soybean nodules in the taproot and non-taproot growth zones of diverse root system architectures of these genotypes. We found unique growth patterns in the nodules of taproots showing genotypic differences in how nodules grew in count, size, and total nodule area per genotype compared to non-taproot nodules. We propose that nodulation should be defined as a function of both nodule count and individual nodule area resulting in a total nodule area per root or growth regions of the root. We also report on the relationships between the nodules and total nitrogen in the seed at maturity, finding a strong correlation between the taproot nodules and final seed nitrogen at maturity. The applications of these findings could lead to an enhanced understanding of the plant-Bradyrhizobium relationship and exploring these relationships could lead to leveraging greater nitrogen use efficiency and nodulation carbon to nitrogen production efficiency across the soybean germplasm. © 2022 The Authors.

For this purpose, the WP and economic water productivity (WPe) were estimated using agronomic technologies. The impact of agronomic technologies on WP and WPe was carried out in two parts of field monitoring and modeling using novel intelligent approaches. Extreme learning machine (ELM), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and artificial neural network (ANN) methods were used to model WP and WPe. A dataset including 200 field data was collected from five treatment and control sections in the Malekan region, located in the southeast of Lake Urmia, Iran, for the crop year 2020–2021. Six different input combinations were introduced to estimate WP and WPe. The models used were evaluated using mean squared error (RMSE), relative mean squared error (RRMSE), and efficiency measures (NSE). Field monitoring results showed that in the treatment fields, with the application of agronomic technologies, the crop yield, WP, and WPe increased by 17.9%, 30.1%, and 19.9%, respectively. The results explained that irrigation water in farms W1, W2, W3, W4, and W5 decreased by 23.9%, 21.3%, 29.5%, 16.5%, and 2.7%, respectively. The modeling results indicated that the ANFIS model with values of RMSE = 0.016, RRMSE = 0.018, and NSE = 0.960 performed better in estimating WP and WPe than ANN and ELM models. The results confirmed that the crop variety, fertilizer, and irrigation plot dimensions are the most critical influencing parameters in improving WP and WPe. © 2022, The Author(s).","Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Crop variety; Irrigation; Yield","Agronomy; Crops; Farms; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Lakes; Learning systems; Mean square error; Three term control systems; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Crop variety; Field monitoring; Lake urmia; Learning machines; Mean squared error; Neuro-fuzzy inference systems; Water productivity; Yield; Irrigation; agronomy; artificial neural network; crop yield; fertilizer application; fuzzy mathematics; irrigation; machine learning; water use; Iran; Lake Urmia",Article,Scopus

Use of machine learning (ML) methods for fusion of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multi-sensor data can improve the prediction accuracy of crop yield. For this, five ML algorithms including Cubist, support vector machine (SVM), deep neural network (DNN), ridge regression (RR) and random forest (RF) were used for multi-sensor data fusion and ensemble learning for grain yield prediction in wheat. A set of thirty wheat cultivars and breeding lines were grown under three irrigation treatments i.e., light, moderate and high irrigation treatments to evaluate the yield prediction capabilities of a low-cost multi-sensor (RGB, multi-spectral and thermal infrared) UAV platform. Multi-sensor data fusion-based yield prediction showed higher accuracy compared to individual-sensor data in each ML model. The coefficient of determination (R2) values for Cubist, SVM, DNN and RR models regarding grain yield prediction were observed from 0.527 to 0.670. Moreover, the results of ensemble learning through integrating the above models illustrated further increase in accuracy. The predictions of ensemble learning showed high R2 values up to 0.692, which was higher as compared to individual ML models across the multi-sensor data. Root mean square error (RMSE), residual prediction deviation (RPD) and ratio of prediction performance to inter-quartile range (RPIQ) were calculated to be 0.916 t ha−1, 1.771 and 2.602, respectively. The results proved that low altitude UAV-based multi-sensor data can be used for early grain yield prediction using data fusion and an ensemble learning framework with high accuracy.

Here, we examine the causes of uncontrolled and irregular fires within farmlands in parts of the two countries in 2019–2020 and quantify their extent spatiotemporally using a combination of medium and coarse-resolution satellite imagery, land cover, precipitation, temperature data, and multiple sources of armed violence data. Our analysis reveals the extent of the deliberate arson of farmland in Iraq and Northeast Syria in 2019–2020. In comparison, only a few fires of farmland were observed in 2007–2013 in Iraq, and Al-Hassakeh, Syria, that became a stronghold of the Islamic State (IS) in 2013. In 2014–2017, we find evidence for increased farmland fires in various locations that closely tracked the military withdrawal of IS between 2015/2016 and 2017 when it lost most of its territory. We find that although the burned area in wheat-producing regions of Iraq (Ninewa and Kirkuk) and Syria have recently increased, the increase in the percentage burned area of agricultural lands in Iraq’s Ninewa and Kirkuk was not unprecedented. MODIS overestimates burned areas when in low fire activity while it underestimates it when fire activity is high, compared to a Landsat–Sentinel-2 combination. A significant positive relationship (r = 0.83) exists between the number of IS-related incidents and the percent burned agricultural area during 2019, which raises questions about the future strategy of the IS terror group and its use and targeting of the water-food complex. © 2022, The Author(s).","Conflict; dNBR; Fire; ISIS; Remote sensing; Terrorism; VIIRS",,Article,Scopus

The main aim of this work was to develop a method of detection of Xcc infection on broccoli leaves. Such method is based on the use of imaging sensors that capture information about the optical properties of leaves and provide data that can be implemented on machine learning algorithms capable of learning patterns. Based on this knowledge, the algorithms are able to classify plants into categories (healthy and infected). To ensure the robustness of the detection method upon future alterations in climate conditions, the response of broccoli plants to Xcc infection was analyzed under a range of growing environments, taking current climate conditions as reference. Two projections for years 2081–2100 were selected, according to the Assessment Report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Thus, the response of broccoli plants to Xcc infection and climate conditions has been monitored using leaf temperature and five conventional vegetation indices (VIs) derived from hyperspectral reflectance. In addition, three novel VIs, named diseased broccoli indices (DBI1-DBI3), were defined based on the spectral reflectance signature of broccoli leaves upon Xcc infection. Finally, the nine parameters were implemented on several classifying algorithms. The detection method offering the best performance of classification was a multilayer perceptron-based artificial neural network. This model identified infected plants with accuracies of 88.1, 76.9, and 83.3%, depending on the growing conditions. In this model, the three Vis described in this work proved to be very informative parameters for the disease detection. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that future climate conditions have been taken into account to develop a robust detection model using classifying algorithms.

Within the context of Russian agricultural history, the recent high growth in grain production is exceptional. This growth however is not fully replicated by the “weather-yield” crop models, which project only moderate yield increase in the twenty-first century and fail to predict the most recent record growth in grain yields. The difference between the projected climate-dependent yields and observations is especially high in two of the most important agricultural regions, the Central Black Earth and Northern Caucasus regions while the remaining agricultural zones show good agreement with the regression models. Similar differences were observed in the late 1960s, which we interpret in terms of the rapid changes in agricultural technology during the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR) agricultural reforms followed by periods of reversal. We also interpret the current period of high differentiation between weather-yield model results and collected yields as evidence of a higher than usual contribution of agricultural reforms in yield improvements, which, however, primarily benefit the large-scale producers located in the most productive areas of Russia. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Agriculture; Climate change; Grain export; Grain yields; Russia; Statistical models","Climate models; Earth (planet); Grain (agricultural product); Regression analysis; Agricultural zones; Caucasus; Crop modeling; Grain export; Grain production; Grain yield; High growth; Russia; Statistic modeling; Yield increase; Climate change; agricultural technology; differentiation; Earth; regression; Caucasus; Central Department; Northern Caucasus; Russian Federation; Russian Federation; USSR",Article,Scopus

At present, farmers often over-apply N fertilizer in some locations or at certain times because they do not have high-resolution crop N status data. N-use efficiency can be low, with the remaining N lost to the environment, resulting in higher production costs and environmental pollution. Accurate and timely estimation of N status in crops is crucial to improving cropping systems’ economic and environmental sustainability. Destructive approaches based on plant tissue analysis are time consuming and impractical over large fields. Recent advances in remote sensing and deep learning have shown promise in addressing the aforementioned challenges in a non-destructive way. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning framework: a self-supervised spectral–spatial attention-based vision transformer (SSVT). The proposed SSVT introduces a Spectral Attention Block (SAB) and a Spatial Interaction Block (SIB), which allows for simultaneous learning of both spatial and spectral features from UAV digital aerial imagery, for accurate N status prediction in wheat fields. Moreover, the proposed framework introduces local-to-global self-supervised learning to help train the model from unlabelled data. The proposed SSVT has been compared with five state-of-the-art models including: ResNet, RegNet, EfficientNet, EfficientNetV2, and the original vision transformer on both testing and independent datasets.

Low-cost genotyping technologies that support genome-assisted breeding have already been established. However, efficient collection of large amounts of high-quality phenotypic data is essential for the success of such breeding. Most of the fruit quality traits have been sensorily and visually evaluated by professional breeders. However, the fruit morphological features that serve as the basis for such sensory and visual judgments are unclear. This makes it difficult to collect efficient phenotypic data on fruit quality traits using image analysis. In this study, we developed a method to automatically measure the morphological features of citrus fruits by the image analysis of cross-sectional images of citrus fruits. We applied explainable machine learning methods and Bayesian networks to determine the relationship between fruit morphological features and two sensorily evaluated fruit quality traits: easiness of peeling (Peeling) and fruit hardness (FruH). In each of all the methods applied in this study, the degradation area of the central core of the fruit was significantly and directly associated with both Peeling and FruH, while the seed area was significantly and directly related to FruH alone. The degradation area of albedo and the area of flavedo were also significantly and directly related to Peeling and FruH, respectively, except in one or two methods. These results suggest that an approach that combines explainable machine learning methods, Bayesian networks, and image analysis can be effective in dissecting the experienced sense of a breeder. In breeding programs, collecting fruit images and efficiently measuring and documenting fruit morphological features that are related to fruit quality traits may increase the size of data for the analysis and improvement of the accuracy of GWAS and GS on the quality traits of the citrus fruits.

One popular category of SSL are distillation networks, such as Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL). This work proposes RS-BYOL, which builds on BYOL in the remote sensing (RS) domain where data are nontrivially different from natural RGB images. Since multispectral (MS) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors provide varied spectral and spatial resolution information, we utilize them as an implicit augmentation to learn invariant feature embeddings. In order to learn RS-based invariant features with SSL, we trained RS-BYOL in two ways, i.e., single channel feature learning and three channel feature learning. This work explores the usefulness of single channel feature learning from random 10 MS bands of 10-20 m resolution and VV-VH of SAR bands compared to the common notion of using three or more bands. In our linear probing evaluation, these single channel features reached a 0.92 F1 score on the EuroSAT classification task and 59.6 mIoU on the IEEE Data Fusion Contest segmentation task for certain single bands. We also compare our results with ImageNet weights and show that the RS-based SSL model outperforms the supervised ImageNet-based model. We further explore the usefulness of multimodal data compared to single modality data, and it is shown that utilizing MS and SAR data allows better invariant representations to be learnt than utilizing only MS data. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Optical-synthetic aperture radar (SAR) fusion; satellite images; self-supervised learning (SSL); unsupervised learning","Data fusion; Distillation; Image segmentation; Modal analysis; Optical remote sensing; Radar imaging; Supervised learning; Learn+; Multi-spectral; Optical imaging; Optical synthetic aperture radar; Optical-synthetic aperture radar fusion; Remote-sensing; Representation learning; Satellite images; Self-supervised learning; Task analysis; Synthetic aperture radar; classification; image processing; multispectral image; remote sensing; segmentation; supervised learning; synthetic aperture radar",Article,Scopus

Fusarium head blight is associated with trichothecene mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON), which contaminates grains, making them unfit for malting or animal feed industries. While genetically resistant cultivars offer the best economic and environmentally responsible means to mitigate disease, parent lines with adequate resistance are limited in barley. Resistance breeding based upon quantitative genetic gains has been slow to date, due to intensive labor requirements of disease nurseries. The production of a high-throughput genome-wide molecular marker assembly for barley permits use in development of genomic prediction models for traits of economic importance to this crop. A diverse panel consisting of 400 two-row spring barley lines was assembled to focus on Canadian barley breeding programs. The panel was evaluated for FHB and DON content in three environments and over 2 years. Moreover, it was genotyped using an Illumina Infinium High-Throughput Screening (HTS) iSelect custom beadchip array of single nucleotide polymorphic molecular markers (50 K SNP), where over 23 K molecular markers were polymorphic. Genomic prediction has been demonstrated to successfully reduce FHB and DON content in cereals using various statistical models. Herein, we have studied an alternative method based on machine learning and compare it with a statistical approach. The bi-allelic SNPs represented pairs of alleles and were encoded in two ways: as categorical (–1, 0, 1) or using Hardy-Weinberg probability frequencies. This was followed by selecting essential genomic markers for phenotype prediction. Subsequently, a Transformer-based deep learning algorithm was applied to predict FHB and DON. Apart from the Transformer method, a Residual Fully Connected Neural Network (RFCNN) was also applied. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to compare true vs. predicted outputs. Models which included all markers generally showed marginal improvement in prediction. Hardy-Weinberg encoding generally improved correlation for FHB (6.9%) and DON (9.6%) for the Transformer network. This study suggests the potential of the Transformer based method as an alternative to the popular BLUP model for genomic prediction of complex traits such as FHB or DON, having performed equally or better than existing machine learning and statistical methods.

We have used a computational model to infer coconut tree density from satellite images before and after the typhoon’s passage, and in this way estimate the number of damaged trees. Our area of study around the typhoon’s path covers 15.7 Mha, and includes 47 of the 87 provinces in the Philippines. In validation areas our model predicts coconut tree density with a Mean Absolute Error of 5.9 Trees/ha. In Camarines Sur we estimated that 3.5 M of the 4.6 M existing coconut trees were damaged by the typhoon. Overall we estimated that 14.1 M coconut trees were affected by the typhoon inside our area of study. Our validation images confirm that trees are rarely uprooted and damages are largely due to reduced canopy cover of standing trees. On validation areas, our model was able to detect affected coconut trees with 88.6% accuracy, 75% precision and 90% recall. Our method delivers spatially fine-grained change maps for coconut plantations in the area of study, including unchanged, damaged and new trees. Beyond immediate damage assessment, gradual changes in coconut density may serve as a proxy for future changes in yield. © 2021 by the authors.

In this paper, time-series satellite images are used to predict urban expansion. As the ground truth is not available in time-series satellite images, an unsupervised image segmentation method based on deep learning is used to generate the ground truth for training and validation. The automated annotated images are then manually validated using Google Maps to generate the ground truth. The remaining data were then manually annotated. Prediction of urban expansion is achieved by using a ConvLSTM network, which can learn the global spatio-temporal information without shrinking the size of spatial feature maps. The ConvLSTM based model is applied on the time-series satellite images and the results of prediction are compared with Pix2pix and Dual GAN networks. In this paper, experimental results are conducted using several multi-date satellite images representing the three largest cities in Saudi Arabia, namely: Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam. The evaluation results show that the proposed ConvLSTM based model produced better prediction results in terms of Mean Square Error, Root Mean Square Error, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, Structural Similarity Index, and overall classification accuracy as compared to Pix2pix and Dual GAN.

This study aimed to use bulk soil and rhizosphere microbial composition and structure to evaluate the potential effect of a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens inoculant (strain QST713) on potatoes and to explore its relationship with crop yield. We implemented next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics approaches to assess the bacterial and fungal biodiversity in 185 soil samples, distributed over four different time points—from planting to harvest—from three different geographical locations in the United States. In addition to location and sampling time (which includes the difference between bulk soil and rhizosphere) as the main variables defining the microbiome composition, the microbial inoculant applied as a treatment also had a small but significant effect in fungal communities and a marginally significant effect bacterial communities. However, treatment preserved the native communities without causing a detectable long-lasting effect on the alpha and beta-diversity patterns after harvest. Using information about the application of the microbial inoculant and considering microbiome composition and structure data, we were able to train a Random Forest model to estimate if a bulk soil or rhizosphere sample came from a low or highyield block with relatively high accuracy (84.6%), concluding that the structure of fungal communities gives us more information as an estimator of potato yield than the structure of bacterial communities. IMPORTANCE Our results reinforce the notion that each cultivar on each location recruits a unique microbial community and that these communities are modulated by the vegetative growth stage of the plant. Moreover, inoculation of a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain QST713-based product on potatoes also changed the abundance of specific taxonomic groups and the structure of local networks in those locations where the product caused an increase in the yield. The data obtained, from in-field assays, allowed training a predictive model to estimate the yield of a certain block, identifying microbiome related to microbial community structure—even with a higher predictive power than the geographical location of the block (that is, the principal determinant of microbial beta-diversity). The methods described here can be replicated to fit new models in any other crop and to evaluate the effect of any agricultural composition and structure of the soil microbiome. © 2021. Imam et al.

The ability of UAV-based sensing technologies to provide high spatial (<1 m) and temporal (on-demand) resolution data facilitates monitoring of individual plants over time and can provide essential information about health, yield, and growth in a timely and quantifiable manner. Such applications would be beneficial for cropped banana plants due to their distinctive growth characteristics. Limited studies have employed UAV data for mapping banana crops and to our knowledge only one other investigation features multi-temporal detection of banana crowns. The purpose of this study was to determine the suitability of multiple-date UAV-captured multi-spectral data for the automated detection of individual plants using convolutional neural network (CNN), template matching (TM), and local maximum filter (LMF) methods in a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) software framework coupled with basic classification refinement. The results indicate that CNN returns the highest plant detection accuracies, with the developed rule set and model providing greater transferability between dates (F-score ranging between 0.93 and 0.85) than TM (0.86–0.74) and LMF (0.86–0.73) approaches.

Although long yield time series are available in Europe, few studies have been conducted to analyze them in order to investigate the impact of adverse climate events on yield shocks under current and future climate conditions. Here we designated the lowest 10th percentile of the relative yield anomaly as yield shock and analyzed subnational wheat yield shocks across Europe during the last four decades. We applied a data-driven attribution framework to quantify primary climate drivers of wheat yield shock probability based on machine learning and game theory, and used this framework to infer the most critical climate variables that will contribute to yield shocks in the future, under two climate change scenarios. During the period 1980–2018, our attribution analysis showed that 32% of the observed wheat yield shocks were primarily driven by water limitation, making it the leading climate driver. Projection to future climate scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 suggested an increased risk of yield shock and a paradigm shift from water limitation dominated yield shock to extreme warming induced shocks over 2070–2099: 46% and 54% of areas were primarily driven by extreme warming under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. A similar analysis conducted on yields simulated by an ensemble of crop models showed that models can capture the negative impact of low water supply but missed the impact of excess water. These discrepancies between observed and simulated yield data call for improvement in crop models. © 2021. The Authors.

The current study evaluated the impacts of major hydrological interventions of the Zhikong and Pangduo hydropower dams on the Lhasa River, which was exposed in the form of break and change points during the double-mass curve analysis. The coefficient of variability (CV) for the hydro-meteorological variables revealed an enhanced climate change phenomena in the Lhasa River Basin (LRB), where the Lhasa River (LR) discharge varied at a stupendous magnitude from 2000 to 2016. The Mann-Kendall trend and Sen’s slope estimator supported aggravated hydro-meteorological changes in LRB, as the rainfall and LR discharge were found to have been significantly decreasing while temperature was increasing from 2000 to 2016. The Sen’s slope had a largest decrease for LR discharge in relation to the rainfall and temperature, revealing that along with climatic phenomena, additional phenomena are controlling the hydrological regime of the LR. Reservoir functioning in the LR is altering the LR discharge. The Soil andWater Assessment Tool (SWAT) modeling of LR discharge under the reservoir’s influence performed well in terms of coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE), and percent bias (PBIAS). Thus, simulation-based LR discharge could substitute observed LR discharge to help with hydrological data scarcity stress in the LRB. The simulated-observed approach was used to predict future LR discharge for the time span of 2017-2025 using a seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The predicted simulation-based and observation-based discharge were closely correlated and found to decrease from 2017 to 2025. This calls for an efficient water resource planning and management policy for the area. The findings of this study can be applied in similar catchments. © 2021 by the authors.

While developed countries have led the innovation and adoption of digital agriculture, the potential impact in developing countries— including in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region—is massive. This article synthesizes existing evidence to review the potential and current contribution of digital technologies to the agrifood sectors in MENA. Digital agriculture shows promise in addressing the key challenges facing the agri-food sector across MENA countries. Improvements in primary production, supply chain and logistics performance, and optimized use of scarce natural resources (notably agricultural water) could be notable, if digital technologies can be implemented as envisioned. Available evidence shows that adoption of digital agriculture is at early stages, generally led by high-value agricultural production targeting domestic markets in Gulf countries and export markets in Mashreq countries. Economic sustainability appears the strongest force for current adoption, with less focus on social or environmental sustainability. Public policies should not only foster the adoption of digital technologies in MENA but also ensure equity of access, transparency of use, data protections, and labor protections.

Whilst index insurance can help farmers cope with the financial consequences of extreme weather, a major challenge for index insurance is basis risk, where insurance payouts cor-relate poorly with actual crop losses. We analyse to what extent the use of crop simulation models and crop phenology monitoring can reduce basis risk in index insurance. Using a biophysical pro-cess-based crop model (Agricultural Production System sIMulator (APSIM)) applied for rice pro-ducers in Odisha, India, we simulate a synthetic yield dataset to train non-parametric statistical models to predict rice yields as a function of meteorological and phenological conditions. We find that the performance of statistical yield models depends on whether meteorological or phenological conditions are used as predictors and whether one aggregates these predictors by season or crop growth stage. Validating the preferred statistical model with observed yield data, we find that the model explains around 54% of the variance in rice yields at the village cluster (Gram Panchayat) level, outperforming vegetation index-based models that were trained directly on the observed yield data.

Adoption of climate-smart soil and crop management practices could buffer future extreme weather effects on maize yield. To test this hypothesis, the overarching aim of our study was to (i) calibrate and evaluation the DSSAT model for maize and parameterize the DSSAT tillage module for different tillage practices (contour ridge tillage and reduced tillage), and (ii) simulate the effects of different management options (tillage and crop residue incorporation) to buffer future extreme climate events on maize yield in four soil types (Lixisols and Plinthosols) located in two landscape positions (upslope and footslopes) of Benin and Burkina-Faso in West Africa, using two climate scenarios (baseline and 2 °C above pre-industrial period). Scenario analysis was performed using factorial combination of two tillage operations (contour ridge and reduced tillage), one crop residue treatment (with crop residue), and two N fertilizer rates (recommended N rate: 60 kg ha−1 and double recommended N rate: 120 kg ha−1) using HAPPI dataset. Model performance (calibration, evaluation and tillage model parameterization) was good as indicated by the lower normalized root mean square error (nRMSE, 12 %–18 %) and mean root absolute error (MRAE, 10 %–16 %), and higher D-index (0.78−0.93) depending on tillage practices and soil types. Long term future climate simulations and cumulative probability distribution confirmed that with both fertilization cases (recommended and double recommended), contour ridge tillage along with crop residue application could enhance maize yield (4 %–7 %) at upslope field sites under a future 2 °C warming scenario, where soil erosion and loss of water and nutrients through runoff is a serious risk. Simultaneously, reduced tillage with crop residue application under both fertilization cases could be a valuable alternative to farmer's practice in fields with deep soils at footslope position (St1 and St3), as it resulted in a higher increase of maize yield (14.5 %) under future 2 °C warming scenario compared to the baseline and could be preferred by risk-averse farmers. Maize production on gravelly soils with low water retention capacity (St1, 63−66 mm) may suffer (-11 %) from future 2 °C warming regardless of the tillage practice. However, despite the significant site-specific tillage effects, intensified N fertilizer application could reduce maize yield losses on St2, St3, and St4, irrespective of tillage practices by improving maize N uptake under elevated CO2 during future warming period. Hence, the application of site-specific tillage operations and crop residue application has the potential to buffer future warming effects on maize yield as confirmed by DSSAT simulations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CERES-Maize; Climate change adaptation; Extreme weather; Modelling","Agricultural runoff; Agricultural wastes; Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Extreme weather; Fertilizers; Mean square error; Parameter estimation; Probability distributions; Risk perception; Soils; Crop management practices; Cumulative probability distribution; Landscape positions; Management options; Model parameterization; Root mean square errors; Scenario analysis; Tillage practices; Soil surveys; buffer zone; climate change; crop production; crop residue; crop yield; fertilizer application; future prospect; maize; soil degradation; soil erosion; soil type; tillage; Benin [West Africa]; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

In this study, we analyze the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) and, in particular, local convolutional neural networks (LCNN) for genomic prediction, as a region-specific filter corresponds much better with our prior genetic knowledge on the genetic architecture of traits than traditional convolutional neural networks. Model performances are evaluated on a simulated maize data panel (n = 10,000; p = 34,595) and real Arabidopsis data (n = 2,039; p = 180,000) for a variety of traits based on their predictive ability. The baseline LCNN, containing one local convolutional layer (kernel size: 10) and two fully connected layers with 64 nodes each, is outperforming commonly proposed ANNs (multi layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks) for basically all considered traits. For traits with high heritability and large training population as present in the simulated data, LCNN are even outperforming state-of-the-art methods like genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), Bayesian models and extended GBLUP, indicated by an increase in predictive ability of up to 24%. However, for small training populations, these state-of-the-art methods outperform all considered ANNs. Nevertheless, the LCNN still outperforms all other considered ANNs by around 10%. Minor improvements to the tested baseline network architecture of the LCNN were obtained by increasing the kernel size and of reducing the stride, whereas the number of subsequent fully connected layers and their node sizes had neglectable impact. Although gains in predictive ability were obtained for large scale data sets by using LCNNs, the practical use of ANNs comes with additional problems, such as the need of genotyping all considered individuals, the lack of estimation of heritability and reliability. Furthermore, breeding values are additive by design, whereas ANN-based estimates are not. However, ANNs also comes with new opportunities, as networks can easily be extended to account for additional inputs (omics, weather etc.) and outputs (multi-trait models), and computing time increases linearly with the number of individuals. With advances in high-throughput phenotyping and cheaper genotyping, ANNs can become a valid alternative for genomic prediction. © Copyright © 2020 Pook, Freudenthal, Korte and Simianer.","breeding; deep learning; genomic selection; Keras; machine learning; phenotype prediction; selection","Arabidopsis; Article; artificial neural network; convolutional neural network; gene frequency; genetic trait; genotype; maize; nonhuman; population size; quality control; simulation; single nucleotide polymorphism; whole genome sequencing",Article,Scopus

In the current research, the weighted additive soil quality index (SQIw), factor analysis (FA), and multiple linear regression (MLR) are used to assess the soil quality of rainfed winter wheat fields with two soil orders on 53.20 km2 of agricultural land in western Iran. A total of 18 soil quality indicators were determined for 100 soil samples (0–20 cm depth) from two soil orders (Inceptisols and Entisols). The soil properties measured were: PH, soil texture, organic carbon (OC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), electrical conductivity (EC), soil microbial respiration (SMR), carbonate calcium equivalent (CCE), soil porosity (SP), bulk density (BD), exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), mean weight diameter (MWD), available potassium (AK), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), available Fe (AFe), available Zn (AZn), available Mn (AMn), and available Cu (ACu). Wheat grain yield for all of the 100 sampling sites was also gathered. The SQIw was calculated using two weighting methods (FA and MLR) and maps were created using a digital soil mapping framework. The soil indicators determined for the minimum data set (MDS) were AK, clay, CEC, AP, SMR, and sand. The correlation between the MLR weighting technique (SQIw-M) and the rainfed wheat yield (r = 0.62) was slightly larger than that the correlation of yield with the FA weighted technique (SQIw-F) (r = 0.58). Results showed that the means of both SQIw-M and SQIw-F and rainfed wheat yield for Inceptisols were higher than for Entisols, although these differences were not statistically significant. Both SQIw-M and SQIw-F showed that areas with Entisols had lower proportions of good soil quality grades (Grades I and II), and higher proportions of poor soil quality grades (Grades IV and V) compared to Inceptisols. Based on these results, soil type must be considered for soil quality assessment in future studies to maintain and enhance soil quality and sustainable production. The overall soil quality of the study region was of poor and moderate grades. To improve soil quality, it is therefore recommended that effective practices such as the implementation of scientifically integrated nutrient management involving the combined use of organic and inorganic fertilizers in rainfed wheat fields should be promoted. © 2020 by the authors.","Big data; Data science; Digital soil mapping; Internet of things (IoT); Machine learning; Multiple linear regression; Principal component analysis; Smart agriculture; Soil quality index; Susceptibility; Sustainable food production; Wheat production",,Article,Scopus

Here, we evaluate a modified version of SWAT2012 (referred to as SWAT-EC hereafter), which integrates an energy balanced soil temperature module (STM) and the CENTRUY-based soil organic matter algorithm, for simulating water quality parameters in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB), and compare it against the original SWAT2012. Model evaluation was performed for simulating streamflow, sediment, and nitrate-N (NO3-N) and total nitrogen (TN) loadings at three stations near the outlets of UMRB. The model comparison was conducted without parameter calibration in order to assess their performance under ungauged conditions. The results indicate that SWAT-EC outperformed SWAT2012 for stream flow and NO3-N and TN loading simulation on both monthly and annual scales. For sediment, SWAT-EC performed better than SWAT2012 on a monthly time step basis, but no noticeable improvement was found at the annual scale. In addition, the performance of the uncalibrated SWAT-EC was comparable to other calibrated SWAT models reported in previous publications with respect to sediment and NO3-N loadings.

In this study, pond-induced impacts on soil erosion and sediment transport were investigated at the scale of the French Claise basin. In order to determine erosion and sediment transport patterns of the Claise, the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) erosion and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models were used. The impact of ponds on the studied processes was revealed by means of land cover change scenarios, using ponded versus pondless inputs. Results show that under current conditions (pond presence), 12.48% of the basin corresponds to no-erosion risk zones (attributed to the dense pond network), while 65.66% corresponds to low-erosion risk, 21.68% to moderate-erosion risk, and only 0.18% to high-erosion risk zones. The SWAT model revealed that ponded sub-basins correspond to low sediment yields areas, in contrast to the pondless sub-basins, which yield appreciably higher erosion rates. Under the alternative pondless scenario, erosion risks shifted to 1.12%, 0.52%, 76.8%, and 21.56% for no, low, moderate, and high-erosion risks, respectively, while the sediment transport pattern completely shifted to higher sediment yield zones.

This paper is the first attempt to use machine learning approach on the prediction of field-level annual crop planting from historical crop planting maps. We present an end-to-end machine learning framework for crop planting prediction using Cropland Data Layer (CDL) time series as reference data and multi-layer artificial neural network as prediction model. The proposed framework was first tested at Lancaster County of Nebraska State, then scaled up to the U.S. Corn Belt. According to the experiment results from 53 Agricultural Statistics Districts, we found the machine-learned crop planting map was expected to reach 88% agreement with the future CDL. Meanwhile, the crop acreage estimates derived from the machine-learned prediction were highly correlated (R2 &gt; 0.9) with the crop acreage estimates of CDL and official statistics by the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service.

We tested the GIW module using observed daily water level data from four wetlands at two sites (including restored and natural wetlands with and without a low-permeability soil layer) in the Delmarva Peninsula, USA. The results show that the wetland module reasonably reproduced observed water levels for both restored and natural wetlands with and without a low-permeability soil layer. The module was also able to reasonably simulate saturated and unsaturated portions of the soil corresponding to wet and dry periods.

Precision management relies on division of a field into areas with homogeneous characteristics, management zones (MZs), which are likely affected by multiple, interrelated factors. We present a method, based on machine learning and spatial statistics, to analyze the spatial relationship between a set of variables and determine management zones in a vineyard. The method involves: (1) fitting a model that quantifies the relationship between multiple variables and yield; (2) fitting a model that quantifies the effect of the spatial variability of multiple variables on yield spatial characteristics; and (3) developing a weighted multivariate spatial clustering model as a method to determine MZs. Twelve variables were sampled for 3893 vines in the wine grape vineyard. These variables included soil properties, terrain characteristics, and environmental impact, as well as crop-condition, using indices calculated from remote sensing images. The predictor variables were spatially characterized using hot-spot analysis (Getis Ord Gi* Z-score values) to assess their spatial variability. A gradient boosted regression trees (BRT) algorithm was used to analyze the spatial multivariable effect on yield spatial characteristics. MZs were determined using multivariate K-means clustering, with relative weights given to the predictors, based on their relative influence on yield spatial variability provided by the BRT model. This method was compared to ordinary K-means clustering and K-means with spatial representation of the variables without weights using a dissimilarity index and spatial autocorrelation measures. Model performance was found to be very high and demonstrated that among the evaluated predictors, crop condition indices were the most important regressors for yield and its spatial characteristics. The weighted multivariate spatial clustering was found to perform better in terms of separability of the points and their spatial distribution than the other two clustering techniques. Quantifying yield and its within-field spatial variability, ranking the effects of the predictors and their spatial variabilities, and segmentation of MZs through multivariable spatial analysis, are expected to benefit irrigation management and agricultural decision-making processes. © 2019","Machine learning; Precision irrigation; Spatial modeling","Cluster analysis; Crops; Decision making; Environmental impact; Irrigation; K-means clustering; Learning systems; Machine learning; Multivariable systems; Remote sensing; Trees (mathematics); Boosted regression trees; Precision irrigation; Spatial and temporal variability; Spatial autocorrelations; Spatial characteristics; Spatial modeling; Spatial representations; Terrain characteristics; Spatial variables measurement; algorithm; autocorrelation; cluster analysis; crop yield; image analysis; irrigation; machine learning; management practice; multivariate analysis; numerical model; precision agriculture; remote sensing; spatial analysis; Vitis vinifera",Article,Scopus

Irrigation scheduling has the potential to incorporate real-time feedback from soil moisture and climatic sensors. However, for robust closed-loop decision support, models of the soil moisture dynamics are essential in order to predict crop water needs while adapting to external perturbation and disturbances. This paper presents a Dynamic Neural Network approach for modelling of the temporal soil moisture fluxes. The models are trained to generate a one-day-ahead prediction of the volumetric soil moisture content based on past soil moisture, precipitation, and climatic measurements. Using field data from three sites, a R2 value above 0.94 was obtained during model evaluation in all sites. The models were also able to generate robust soil moisture predictions for independent sites which were not used in training the models. The application of the Dynamic Neural Network models in a predictive irrigation scheduling system was demonstrated using AQUACROP simulations of the potato-growing season. The predictive irrigation scheduling system was evaluated against a rule-based system that applies irrigation based on predefined thresholds. Results indicate that the predictive system achieves a water saving ranging between 20 and 46% while realizing a yield and water use efficiency similar to that of the rule-based system. © 2018 by the authors.

We applied a scaling approach to capture changes in climate extremes with increase in global mean temperature in several subregions within the WAF domain: Western Sahel, Central Sahel, Eastern Sahel, Guinea Coast and Central Africa including Congo Basin. While there are several uncertainties and large ensemble spread in the projections of temperature and precipitation indices, most models show high-impact changes in climate extremes at subregional scale. At these smaller scales, temperature increases within the WAF domain are projected to be higher than the global mean temperature increase (at 1.5 °C and at 2 °C) and heat waves are expected to be more frequent and of longer duration. The most intense warming is observed over the drier regions of the Sahel, in the central Sahel and particularly in the eastern Sahel, where the precipitation and the soil moisture anomalies have the highest probability of projected increase at a global warming of 1.5 °C. Over the wetter regions of the Guinea Coast and Central Africa, models project a weak change in total precipitation and a decrease of the length of wet spells, while these two regions have the highest increase of heavy rainfall in the WAF domain at a global warming of 1.5 °C. Western Sahel is projected by 80% of the models to experience the strongest drying with a significant increase in the length of dry spells and a decrease in the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index.

Few studies have evaluated long-term impacts of DWM, and the simulation of controlled drainage (CD) with the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) is limited, while shallow drainage (SD) has not been examined. We tested RZWQM using nine years (2007-2015) of field data from southeast Iowa for CD, SD, conventional drainage (DD), and undrained (ND) systems and simulated the long-term (1971-2015) impacts. RZWQM accurately simulated N loss in subsurface drainage, and the simulations agreed with field data that CD and SD substantially reduced N loss to drainage. As indicated by the field data, the SD N concentration was predicted to be greater than DD and CD, likely due to reduced time of travel to shallower drains. The long-term simulations show that CD and SD reduced annual N lost via tile drainage by 26% and 40%, respectively. Annual reductions in N lost via tile drainage ranged from 28% in the driest years to 22% in the wettest years for CD and from 56% in the driest years to 35% in the wettest years for SD. Considering spring N loading for the purpose of addressing hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico, CD was found to be less effective than SD, and in many years CD exported more N in the spring than DD. Spring N loading (April through June) was indicated by the EPA Science Advisory Board to have the greatest impact on hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Therefore, improvement of CD systems within the months of April through June to reduce N loss via drainage across the upper Midwest landscape may be required. Limited research in the upper Midwest has addressed spring N loading under controlled drainage systems (CD). This research will help model developers, model users, and agricultural scientists more clearly understand N transport under different systems, including CD, SD, and ND, which will aid in developing the design and management of drainage systems to reduce N transport from tile-drained agriculture to surface waters. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Agricultural simulation model; Drainage water management; Nonpoint-source pollution; Northern Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone; Nutrient reduction; Subsurface drainage","Agricultural runoff; Agriculture; Cultivation; Groundwater flow; Nitrogen; Quality control; River pollution; Wastewater disposal; Water management; Water pollution; Water quality; Drainage water management; Non-point source pollution; Northern Gulf of Mexico; Nutrient reduction; Simulation model; Subsurface drainages; Drainage; agricultural modeling; drainage water; hypoxic conditions; long-term change; model; nitrogen; nonpoint source pollution; nutrient; simulation; subsurface flow; tile drain; water footprint; water management; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico; Iowa; Midwest; United States",Conference Paper,Scopus

Five erosion and SSL algorithms were applied within a common LSM framework to quantify uncertainties and evaluate predictability in two steep, forested catchments (&gt;1,000 km2). The algorithms were chosen from among widely used sediment models, including empirically based: monovariate rating curve (MRC) and the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE); stochastically based: the Load Estimator (LOADEST); conceptually based: the Hydrologic Simulation Program—Fortran (HSPF); and physically based: the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM). The algorithms were driven by the hydrologic fluxes and meteorological inputs generated from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) LSM. A multiobjective calibration was applied to each algorithm and optimized parameter sets were validated over an excluded period, as well as in a transfer experiment to a nearby catchment to explore parameter robustness. Algorithm performance showed consistent decreases when parameter sets were applied to periods with greatly differing SSL variability relative to the calibration period. Of interest was a joint calibration of all sediment algorithm and streamflow parameters simultaneously, from which trade-offs between streamflow performance and partitioning of runoff and base flow to optimize SSL timing were noted, decreasing the flexibility and robustness of the streamflow to adapt to different time periods. Parameter transferability to another catchment was most successful in more process-oriented algorithms, the HSPF and the DHSVM. This first-of-its-kind multialgorithm sediment scheme offers a unique capability to portray acute episodic loading while quantifying trade-offs and uncertainties across a range of algorithm structures. © 2017.

Climate change is likely to have an impact on the availability of water and therefore on sediment yield in catchments. In this context, quantifying the sediment response to an increased atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate change is of utmost importance to the proper management of rural catchments. However, quantitative assessment of climate change impact remains a complex task. In this study, the potential medium (2031-2060) and long-term (2069-2098) impacts of projected changes of temperature, rainfall and CO2 concentration on sediment yield in a small rural catchment located in NW Spain were evaluated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Climate change scenarios were created using future climate data projected by regional climate models from the ENSEMBLES project and two CO2 concentration scenarios (550 and 660 ppm). The results showed that climate change would have a noticeable impact on suspended sediment if the forecast temperature, rainfall and CO2 concentration changes included in this study were met. Overall, suspended sediment is expected to decrease (2031-2060: -11%, 2069-2098: -8%) compared to the baseline period (1981-2010), mainly due to decreased streamflow. However, an increase in sediment transport in winter is predicted, possibly associated with increased erosion in cultivated areas (11%-17%), suggesting that, at this time of the year, the effect of soil detachment prevails over sediment transport capacity. Consequently, management practices aimed at reducing soil erosion in cultivated areas should be carried out, because these are the main source of sediment in the study area. © 2016 by the authors.","Climate change; Rural catchment; Suspended sediment; SWAT model","Atmospheric composition; Carbon dioxide; Catchments; Climate models; Erosion; Rain; Runoff; Rural areas; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Sediments; Soils; Suspended sediments; Climate change scenarios; Quantitative assessments; Regional climate models; Rural catchments; Sediment transport capacity; Soil and water assessment tool; Suspended sediment yields; SWAT model; Climate change; carbon dioxide; catchment; climate change; concentration (composition); quantitative analysis; sediment transport; sediment yield; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; suspended sediment; water availability; Corbeira Stream; Galicia [Spain]; La Coruna [Galicia]; Spain",Article,Scopus

The method devises a multivariate statistical model to compute bias and uncertainty in forecasted yield at the Census of Agricultural Region (CAR) scale across the Canadian Prairies. The method uses robust variable-selection to select the best predictors within spatial subregions. Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and random forest-tree machine learning techniques are then integrated to generate sequential forecasts through the growing season. Cross-validation of the model was performed by hindcasting/backcasting and comparing forecasts against available historical data (1987-2011) for spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The model was also validated for the 2012 growing season by comparing forecast skill at the CAR, provincial and Canadian Prairie region scales against available statistical survey data. Mean percent departures between wheat yield forecasted were under-estimated by 1-4% in mid-season and over-estimated by 1% at the end of the growing season. This integrated methodology offers a consistent, generalizable approach for sequentially forecasting crop yield at the regional-scale. It provides a statistically robust, yet flexible way to concurrently adjust to data-rich and data-sparse situations, adaptively select different predictors of yield to changing levels of environmental uncertainty, and to update forecasts sequentially so as to incorporate new data as it becomes available. This integrated method also provides additional statistical support for assessing the accuracy and reliability of model-based crop yield forecasts in time and space. © 2014 Newlands, Zamar, Kouadio, Zhang, Chipanshi, Potgieter, Toure and Hill.","Agriculture; Bayesian; Climate; Crop yield; Forecasting; Regional; Uncertainty",,Article,Scopus

Since impact models are highly sensitive to input climate data, GCM skill is crucial for getting better short-, medium- and long-term outlooks for agricultural production and food security. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) phase 5 ensemble is likely to underpin the majority of climate impact assessments over the next few years. We assess 24 CMIP3 and 26 CMIP5 simulations of present climate against climate observations for five tropical regions, as well as regional improvements in model skill and, through literature review, the sensitivities of impact estimates to model error. Climatological means of seasonal mean temperatures depict mean errors between 1 and 18 ° C (2-130% with respect to mean), whereas seasonal precipitation and wet-day frequency depict larger errors, often offsetting observed means and variability beyond 100%. Simulated interannual climate variability in GCMs warrants particular attention, given that no single GCM matches observations in more than 30% of the areas for monthly precipitation and wet-day frequency, 50% for diurnal range and 70% for mean temperatures. We report improvements in mean climate skill of 5-15% for climatological mean temperatures, 3-5% for diurnal range and 1-2% in precipitation. At these improvement rates, we estimate that at least 5-30 years of CMIP work is required to improve regional temperature simulations and at least 30-50 years for precipitation simulations, for these to be directly input into impact models.

As a result, many laboratories have developed high-throughput SNP assays and built high-density genetic maps. However, the number of markers may, by orders of magnitude, exceed the resolution of recombination for a given population size so that only a minority of markers can accurately be ordered. Another issue attached to the so-called ‘large p, small n’ problem is that high-density genetic maps inevitably result in many markers clustering at the same position (cosegregating markers). While there are a number of related papers, none have addressed the impact of co-segregating markers on genetic maps. In the present study, we investigated the effects of co-segregating markers on high-density genetic map length and marker order using empirical data from two populations of wheat, Mohawk × Cocorit (durum wheat) and Norstar × Cappelle Desprez (bread wheat). The maps of both populations consisted of 85% co-segregating markers. Our study clearly showed that excess of co-segregating markers can lead to map expansion, but has little effect on markers order. To estimate the inflation factor (IF), we generated a total of 24,473 linkage maps (8,203 maps for Mohawk × Cocorit and 16,270 maps for Norstar × Cappelle Desprez). Using seven machine learning algorithms, we were able to predict with an accuracy of 0.7 the map expansion due to the proportion of co-segregating markers. For example in Mohawk × Cocorit, with 10 and 80% co-segregating markers the length of the map inflated by 4.5 and 16.6%, respectively. Similarly, the map of Norstar × Cappelle Desprez expanded by 3.8 and 11.7% with 10 and 80% co-segregating markers. With the increasing number of markers on SNP-chips, the proportion of co-segregating markers in high-density maps will continue to increase making map expansion unavoidable. Therefore, we suggest developers improve linkage mapping algorithms for efficient analysis of high-throughput data. This study outlines a practical strategy to estimate the IF due to the proportion of co-segregating markers and outlines a method to scale the length of the map accordingly. © 2017 N’Diaye, Haile, Fowler, Ammar and Pozniak.","Genetic map; High-density; Inflation factor; Machine learning; Map expansion; Prediction; Single nucleotide polymorphism; Wheat",,Article,Scopus

They constitute primary staple crops in drylands, where their production is known to date back over 5000 years ago. Compared to other crops, millets and sorghum have received less attention until very recently, and their production has been progressively reduced in the last 50 years. Here, we present new models that focus on the ecological factors driving finger millet, pearl millet and sorghum traditional cultivation, with a global perspective. The interaction between environment and traditional agrosystems was investigated by Redundancy Analysis of published literature and tested against novel ethnographic data. Contrary to earlier beliefs, our models show that the total annual precipitation is not the most determinant factor in shaping millet and sorghum agriculture. Instead, our results point to the importance of other variables such as the duration of the plant growing cycle, soil water-holding capacity or soil nutrient availability. This highlights the potential of finger millet, pearl millet and sorghum traditional cultivation practices as a response to recent increase of aridity levels worldwide. Ultimately, these practices can play a pivotal role for resilience and sustainability of dryland agriculture. Copyright: © 2023 Ruiz-Giralt et al.

Field experiments were conducted during 2017–18 and 2018–19 to obtain visible and thermal images of 24 wheat cultivars having different levels of WYR resistance at critical growth stages. Machine learning (ML) models were constructed using the combinations of image indices (IN) and partial least square regression (PLS) scores of image indices with disease severity (DS) and Yeo-Johnson (YJ) transformed values of disease severity. The results revealed that 26 visible and 2 thermal indices considered in this study have significant correlations with WYR. The models performances were evaluated using four possible dataset combinations of (1) disease severity + indices, (2) disease severity + PLS scores of indices, (3) YJ transformed disease severity + indices, and (4) YJ transformed disease severity + PLS scores. Disease severity with image derived indices was found to be the best dataset for the prediction of WYR severity using machine learning models with an R2 and d-index above 0.95 during calibration, while up to 0.67 and 0.87, respectively during validation. Cubist model with disease severity + indices dataset was the best to predict WYR severity, while the Gaussian process regression with YJ transformed disease severity + PLS scores dataset was the poorest predictor.

Failure to diagnose Schistosomiasis can result in various medical complications, such as ascites, portal hypertension, esophageal varices, splenomegaly, and growth retardation. Early prediction and identification of risk factors may aid in treating disease before it becomes incurable. We aimed to create a framework by incorporating the most significant features to predict Schistosomiasis using machine learning techniques. A dataset of advanced Schistosomiasis has been employed containing recovery and death cases. A total data of 4316 individuals containing recovery and death cases were included in this research. The dataset contains demographics, socioeconomic, and clinical factors with lab reports. Data preprocessing techniques (missing values imputation, outlier removal, data normalisation, and data transformation) have also been employed for better results. Feature selection techniques, including correlation-based feature selection, Information gain, gain ratio, ReliefF, and OneR, have been utilised to minimise a large number of features. Data resampling algorithms, including Random undersampling, Random oversampling, Cluster Centroid, Near miss, and SMOTE, are applied to address the data imbalance problem. We applied four machine learning algorithms to construct the model: Gradient Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting and CatBoost.

A particular challenge is monitoring and evaluation in regions with smallholder agricultural systems (∼1 ha) that are often subsistence focused, vulnerable to food insecurity and data scarce. Using multi-day moderate resolution Sentinel-2 and Random Forest models, this study shows that crop type and rice yields in Burkina Faso can be predicted with greater than ∼80% accuracy in the rainy season. Model optimization using varying spectral and vegetation index inputs can increase crop type and yield prediction accuracy in the dry season where denser cultivation is a challenge for the 10–20 m resolution of Sentinel-2. However, there is a trade-off between opting for very high-resolution imagery (<2 m) or the number of bands offered by Sentinel-2 as the bands that occupy and vegetation indices that utilize the red through NIR ranges were most important across all models. In addition, model type, linear Regression or nonlinear Random Forest, matters little when estimating yield in these landscapes, unless Harmonic regression is utilized for the linear model. This study also showed that a model trained with high quality 2019 dry season crop cut data can predict the subsequent dry season's interannual crop type with overall accuracy as high as 60%, comparable to crop type models trained with 2020 survey data and used to estimate crop type in the concurrent season, as the survey collection. This indicates some utility in leveraging the calibrated Random Forest models to make skillful predictions of interannual crop type and ultimately food availability of nearby communities for years with no training data.

The study objectives were to (i) calibrate and validate a simple crop model (Hybrid-Maize) using in-situ measured data from sixteen uniquely managed treatments as part of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Testing Ag Performance Solutions (TAPS) program in North Platte, NE, and (ii) carry out sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation using a multi-parameter optimization approach. Sixteen Arable Mark 1 sensors and thirty two Mark 2 sensors (Arable Labs Inc., San Francisco, CA) collecting hourly and daily weather and crop information in 2019 and 2020 respectively, were installed in the TAPS subsurface drip irrigation experimental plots which were planted with maize and subjected to different irrigation and nitrogen practices. Hybrid-Maize was used for simulating maize yield on the sixteen treatments in 2019 and 2020. Sensitivity analysis showed that initial light use efficiency (LUE), potential kernel filling rate (G5), potential number of kernels per ear (G2), growth respiration coefficient of grain (GRG), empirical parameter determining the relative contribution of a soil layer to water uptake (SLW), and maximum photosynthetic rate (MPR) were the most sensitive parameters to yield. A novel multi-parameter optimization (MPO) approach based on kriging was used for calibrating these six parameters, and the best parameter sets which were later used for model validation. Calibration results showed that there seemed to be strong linear relationships between total water received (WR) and some of the parameters. By using each year's MPO averages of the six parameters instead of default values, ME, MAE, RMSE, uRMSE, and nRMSE were all reduced by about 69%, 66%, 60%, 27%, and 61% respectively for validation treatments. The advantage of using in-situ sensors, coupled with the suitability of the calibrated model for simulating maize yield under different irrigation management, will make the model more useful in future field-scale research with focus on developing decision support tools for in-season crop management and yield forecasts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Hybrid-Maize; In-situ sensors; Irrigation; Multi-parameter estimation; Yield prediction","Crops; Decision support systems; Irrigation; Parameter estimation; Software testing; Soils; Crop modeling; Hybrid-maize; In-situ sensors; Irrigation management; Maize yield; Multi-parameter estimation; Multi-parameter optimizations; Multiparameters; Parameters estimation; Yield prediction; Sensitivity analysis; drip irrigation; kriging; light use efficiency; maize; modeling; yield response; Canterbury [South Island]; Lincoln; Marcq; Nebraska; New Zealand; North Platte; San Francisco [California]; South Island; United States",Article,Scopus

Added water also cools crop plants through transpiration; irrigation might thus play an important role in a warmer climate by simultaneously moderating water and high temperature stresses. Here we used satellite-derived evapotranspiration estimates, land surface temperature (LST) measurements, and crop phenological stage information from Nebraska maize to quantify how irrigation relieves both water and temperature stresses. Unlike air temperature metrics, satellite-derived LST revealed a significant irrigation-induced cooling effect, especially during the grain filling period (GFP) of crop growth. This cooling appeared to extend the maize growing season, especially for GFP, likely due to the stronger temperature sensitivity of phenological development during this stage. Our analysis also revealed that irrigation not only reduced water and temperature stress but also weakened the response of yield to these stresses. Specifically, temperature stress was significantly weakened for reproductive processes in irrigated maize. Attribution analysis further suggested that water and high temperature stress alleviation was responsible for 65±10% and 35±5.3% of the irrigation yield benefit, respectively. Our study underlines the relative importance of high temperature stress alleviation in yield improvement and the necessity of simulating crop surface temperature to better quantify heat stress effects in crop yield models. Finally, considering the potentially strong interaction between water and heat stress, future research on irrigation benefits should explore the interaction effects between heat and drought alleviation. © 2022 The Author(s).",,"Atmospheric temperature; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Satellites; Surface properties; Thermal stress; Water supply; Yield stress; Grain-filling periods; Heat stress; High temperature stress; Irrigation effects; Land surface temperature; Satellite data; Stress alleviation; Temperature stress; Water stress; Water temperatures; Crops; air temperature; climate change; crop yield; drought; evapotranspiration; food production; irrigation; land surface; maize; satellite data; stress analysis; surface temperature; water demand; Nebraska; United States",Article,Scopus

The main objective of this research is to develop an operational methodology for predicting rice yield that is utilized to assess the impacts of drought and flood disasters on agricultural productivity taking Jiangxi, China as an example. For this purpose, we first calculated the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) using monthly rainfall data of 83 stations from 1960 to 2020 to identify the disastrous years and their spatial extent of impact. Then, time-series MODIS data from 2000 to 2020, Landsat images, digital elevation model (DEM) were obtained and utilized for rice plantation mapping using decision-tree algorithm and yield estimation. The identified 3-cropping rice plantations were converted into rice masks for calculating the county-level cumulative NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) to match the reported county-level annual rice yield for building remote sensing-based rice yield models taking the averages of 2016–2019 as test. By comparing the determination coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and prediction accuracy of the models, we found that the best model for rice yield estimation is Y D = 4.899 × 10−6×NDVI 2 + 2.891 × NDVI + 98511.218 (R2 = 0.898). This model was applied to estimate the county-level annual rice production of 2014 and 2015, and provincial annual rice production of 2010–2019 for validation and prediction. The agreement with the government-reported yield reaches 97–98% at provincial level and the models were hence considered reliable. After verification, the models were applied to other remained years after 2010 for estimating the provincial annual rice production. Then, a new disaster indicator, that is, the disaster composite index (DCI) was developed for assessing the disaster impact on annual rice production in a pilot area around Nanchang City. Results show that developed models are capable of achieving rice yield estimation using both MODIS data for regional and Landsat data for local scale. In comparison with the normal or least affected year, impacts of drought and flood were successfully evaluated using DCI for pilot area and their relationship was created. We hence believe the developed methodology is extendable to South China and other rice plantation area in the world. © 2022 The Author(s).

The purpose of this study was to generate and compare management zones (MZ) based on the Sentinel-2 satellite data for variable rate application of mineral nitrogen in wheat production, calculated using different remote sensing (RS)-based models under varied soil, yield and crop data availability. Three models were applied, including (1) a modified “RS- and threshold-based clustering”, (2) a “hybrid-based, unsupervised clustering”, in which data from different sources were combined for MZ delineation, and (3) a “RS-based, unsupervised clustering”. Various data processing methods including machine learning were used in the model development. Statistical tests such as the Paired Sample T-test, Kruskal-Wallis H-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were applied to evaluate the final delineated MZ maps. Additionally, a procedure for improving models based on information about phenological phases and the occurrence of agricultural drought was implemented. The results showed that information on agronomy and climate enables improving and optimizing MZ delineation. The integration of prior knowledge on new climate conditions (drought) in image selection was tested for effective use of the models. Lack of this information led to the infeasibility of obtaining optimal results. Models that solely rely on remote sensing information are comparatively less expensive than hybrid models. Additionally, remote sensing-based models enable delineating MZ for fertilizer recommendations that are temporally closer to fertilization times. © 2021 by the authors.","Clustering; Digital agriculture; Drought; Management zones; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Winter wheat",,Article,Scopus

Cultivated in most of the world, cotton is one of the economically most important agricultural crops. Its cultivation in tropical regions has made it the target of a wide spectrum of agricultural pests and diseases, and efficient solutions are required. Moreover, the symptoms of the main pests and diseases cannot be differentiated in the initial stages, and the correct identification of a lesion can be difficult for the producer. To help resolve the problem, the present research provides a solution based on deep learning in the screening of cotton leaves which makes it possible to monitor the health of the cotton crop and make better decisions for its management. With the learning models GoogleNet and Resnet50 using convolutional neural networks, a precision of 86.6% and 89.2%, respectively, was obtained. Compared with traditional approaches for the processing of images such as support vector machines (SVM), Closest k-neighbors (KNN), artificial neural networks (ANN) and neuro-fuzzy (NFC), the convolutional neural networks proved to be up to 25% more precise, suggesting that this method can contribute to a more rapid and reliable inspection of the plants growing in the field. © 2021 by the authors.

Remote and proximal sensing offer the possibility to cut crop monitoring costs traditionally associated with surveys and censuses. Fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), chlorophyll concentration (CI) and normalized difference vegetation (NDVI) indices were used in crop monitoring, but their comparative performances in sorghum monitoring is lacking. This work aimed therefore at closing this gap by evaluating the performance of machine learning modelling of in-season sorghum biomass yields based on Sentinel-2-derived fAPAR and simpler high-throughput optical handheld meters-derived NDVI and CI calculated from sorghum plants reflectance. Bayesian ridge regression showed good cross-validated performance, and high reliability (R2 = 35%) and low bias (mean absolute prediction error, MAPE = 0.4%) during the validation step. Hand-held optical meter-derived CI and Sentinel-2- derived fAPAR showed comparable effects on machine learning performance, but CI outperformed NDVI and was therefore considered as a good alternative to Sentinel-2's fAPAR. The best times to sample the vegetation indices were the months of June (second half) and July.

In many cases, however, only information on outbreaks is collected and data from surrounding healthy crops are omitted. Use of such data to develop models that can forecast risk/no risk of disease is therefore problematic, as information relating to the no-risk status of healthy crops is missing. This study explored a novel application of anomaly detection techniques to derive models for forecasting risk of crop disease from data composed of outbreaks only. This was done in two steps. In the training phase, the algorithms were used to learn the envelope of weather conditions most associated with historic crop disease outbreaks. In the testing phase, the algorithms were used for hindcasting of historic outbreak events. Five different anomaly detection algorithms were compared according to their accuracy in forecasting outbreaks: robust covariance, one-class k-means, Gaussian mixture model, kernel density estimation, and one-class support vector machine. A case study of potato late blight survey data from across Great Britain was used for proof of concept. The results showed that Gaussian mixture model had the highest forecast accuracy at 97.0%, followed by one-class k-means at 96.9%. There was added value in combining the algorithms in an ensemble to provide a more accurate and robust forecasting tool that can be tailored to produce region-specific alerts.

The data can support to undertake life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) of food commodities in a “cradle to grave” approach. An integrated F&V supply chain LCA model is constructed, which combined three components of the supply chain: farming system, post-harvest system (processing until the consumption) and bio-waste handling system. We have used numbers of crop models to calculate the crop yields, crop nutrient uptake, and irrigation water requirements, which are largely influenced by the local agro-climatic parameters of the selected crop reporting districts (CRDs) of the United States. For the farming system, LCI information, as shown in the data are averaged from the respective CRDs. LCI data for the post-harvest stages are based on available information from the relevant processing plants and the engineering estimates. The article also briefly presents the assumptions made for evaluating future crop production scenarios. Future scenarios integrate the impact of climate change on the future productivity and evaluate the effect of adaptation measures and technological advancement on the crop yield. The provided data are important to understand the characteristics of the food supply chain, and their relationships with the life cycle environmental impacts. The data can also support to formulate potential environmental mitigation and adaptation measures in the food supply chain mainly to cope with the adverse impact of climate change. © 2020","Fruits and vegetables; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle inventory; Processed products; Sustainability",,Data Paper,Scopus

Our study quantifies the impact of climate change on food security by combining climate modelling (16 models from CMIP5), crop yield (simulated by agronomic model, SARRA-O) and demographic evolution (provided by UN projection) under two future climatic scenarios. We simulate yield for the main crops in five countries inWest Africa and estimate the population pressure on crop production to assess the number of available cereal production per capita. We found that, although uncertain, the African monsoon evolution leads to an increase of rainfall in Eastern Sahel and a decrease inWestern Sahel under the RCP8.5 (Representative Concentration Pathway) scenario from IPCC, leading to the higher temperature increase by the end of the 21st century.

The current study developed models to predict the level of P. truncatus infestation and associated damage of maize grain in smallholder farmer stores. Data were gathered from grain storage trials conducted in Hwedza and Mbire districts of Zimbabwe and correlated with weather data for each site. Insect counts of P. truncatus and other common stored grain insect pests had a strong correlation with time of year with highest recorded numbers from January to May. Correlation analysis showed insect-generated grain dust from boring and feeding activity to be the best indicator of P. truncatus presence in stores (r = 0.70), while a moderate correlation (r = 0.48) was found between P. truncatus numbers and storage insect parasitic wasps, and grain damage levels significantly correlated with the presence of Tribolium castaneum (r = 0.60). Models were developed for predicting P. truncatus infestation and grain damage using parameter selection algorithms and decision-tree machine learning algorithms with 10-fold cross-validation. The P. truncatus population size prediction model performance was weak (r = 0.43) due to the complicated sampling and detection of the pest and eight-week long period between sampling events. The grain damage prediction model had a stronger correlation coefficient (r = 0.93) and is a good estimator for in situ stored grain insect damage.

In this study, we used remote sensing data to calibrate a regional crop model (MCWLA-Rice) for yield simulation in a double-rice crop rotation system in counties of Hunan province dominated by three landforms (plain, hill, and mountain). The calibration scheme with coarse remote sensing data (Global LAnd Surface Satellite, GLASS) greatly improved model accuracy for the double-rice system and is a promising method for yield estimation in large areas. The average improvement in relative root mean square error (RRMSE) was at most 48.00% for early rice and 41.25% for late rice. The average improvement in coefficient of determination (R2) value was at most 0.54 for early rice and 0.19 for late rice. Estimation of yield in counties dominated by different landform types indicated that: (1) MCWLA-Rice tended to be unstable in areas of complex topography and resulted in unbalanced proportions of overestimations and underestimations. (2) Differences in yield simulation between early rice and late rice varied among counties; yield estimates were highest in predominantly hilly counties, followed by counties dominated by plains, and lowest in predominantly mountainous counties. The results indicated that the topography might harm the accuracy of crop model simulations. Integration of topographic factors into crop models may enable yield estimation with enhanced accuracy to promote social development. © 2019 by the authors.","Crop model; Double rice; Landform; MCWLA; Remote sensing; Topography","Chemical contamination; Crops; Food supply; Landforms; Mean square error; Topography; Calibration schemes; Coefficient of determination; Complex topographies; Crop model; Double rice; Global land surface; MCWLA; Root mean square errors; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

A simulation at 50 km grid spacing is performed with the standard version of the RegCM4.5 model (control run), followed by three vegetation change experiments at the Sahel-Sahara interface (15° N and 20° N): forest, tall grass, and short grass savanna. The impacts of land cover change are assessed by analyzing the difference between the altered runs and the control one in different sub-domains (western Sahel, central Sahel, eastern Sahel, and Guinea). Results show that the presence of forest, tall grass, and short grass savanna at the Sahel-Sahara interface tends to decrease the mean summer surface temperature in the whole domain. Nevertheless, this decrease is more pronounced over the Central Sahel when considering the forest experiment. This temperature decrease is associated with a weakening (strengthening) of the sensible (latent) heat flux in the whole domain. An analysis of the radiation field is performed to better explain the changes noted in the latent heat flux, the sensible heat flux, and the surface temperature. When considering the rainfall signal, the analysis shows that the afforestation options tend to alter the precipitation in the considered sub-domains substantially by increasing it in the whole Sahel region, with strong interannual variability. This rainfall increase is associated with an increase of the atmospheric moisture. Finally, we investigated the impacts of the afforestation options on some features of the rainfall events, and on the atmospheric dynamics during wet and dry years. All afforestation options tend to increase the frequency of the number of rainy days in regions located south of 18° N during both periods. Nevertheless, this increase is stronger over the Central and Eastern Sahel during wet years in the forest case. All afforestation experiments induce an increase (decrease) of the low-levels monsoon flux in the Eastern Sahel (western Sahel) during both periods. At the mid-levels, the three afforestation options tend to move northward and to decrease the intensity of the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) south of 13° N during wet and dry years.The intensity of the AEJ is weaker during the wet period. The vegetation change experiments also affect the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ), especially during wet years, by increasing its intensity over the southern Sahel. The analysis of the activity of African EasterlyWaves (AEWs) patterns exhibits a decrease of the intensity of these disturbances over the Sahel during both periods. This may be due to the weakening of the meridional temperature contrast between the continent and the Gulf of Guinea due to the Sahel-Sahara surface temperature cooling induced by the afforestation. In summary, this study shows that during both periods, the increase of the atmospheric moisture due to the afforestation is associated with favorable AEJ/TEJ configurations (weaker and northward position of the AEJ; stronger TEJ) which in turn may create a stronger convection and then, an increase in the Sahel rainfall. This Sahel rainfall increase is associated with a strengthening of the intense and heavy rainfall events which may impact diversely local populations. © 2018 by the authors.","Interannual variability; Rainfall; Reforestation; RegCM4; Temperature; West Africa; Wind dynamics",,Article,Scopus

Measurements were conducted over 2011-2013 on plots of an experimental arable station on winter wheat, winter rye, spring barley, and potatoes. CO2 fluxes were measured using the dynamic closed chamber system, while spectral vegetation indices were determined using SKYE multispectral sensors. Based on spectral data collected in 2011 and 2013, various models to estimate net ecosystem productivity and gross ecosystem productivity were developed. These models were then verified based on data collected in 2012. The R2 for the best model based on spectral data ranged from 0.71 to 0.83 and from 0.78 to 0.92, for net ecosystem productivity and gross ecosystem productivity, respectively.

It has received limited attention compared to other sources of ISIS revenues such as oil, looting, ransom, foreign donations and various forms of taxation. We estimate winter crops production of wheat and barley in ISIS-controlled areas in both Syria and Iraq for the years 2014–2015 and irrigated summer crops production (cotton) in Northeast Syria. We show that remote sensing can give a credible estimation of agricultural production in the absence of statistics. With evidence from MODIS Aqua and Terra Satellites as well as Landsat imagery, we find that agricultural production in ISIS-controlled Syrian and Iraqi zones has been sustained in 2014 and 2015, despite the detrimental impact of conflict. After a drought in 2014 production was able to capitalize on improved rainfalls in 2015. First indications show that the winter grain harvest of 2016 in Iraqi territories of ISIS was significantly above pre-conflict mean and below pre-conflict mean in its Syrian territories. We also show how water flows along the Euphrates have impacted production. We estimate the revenue that ISIS can derive from wheat and barley production and the likely magnitude of an exportable surplus. Agricultural production gives the group a degree of resilience, although its economy is not sustainable in the longer run and could be affected by military collapse. Taxation of recurrent income streams such as agriculture will become more important for ISIS as its extractive sources of revenues show signs of dwindling. Beside non-grain food imports, agricultural production is crucial for its political legitimacy by ensuring food provision to the broader population. Food security considerations would require a high priority in any post-ISIS reconstruction effort and would need to include the rehabilitation of supply chains for agricultural inputs such as quality seeds and fertilizers. © 2016 The Author(s)","Agriculture; Food security; Iraq; Remote sensing; Syria; Terrorism finance","agricultural development; crop production; finance; food provisioning; food security; food supply; GIS; income; MODIS; remote sensing; tax system; Terra (satellite); terrorism; Iraq; Syrian Arab Republic; Gossypium hirsutum; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Three methodologies are compared-the “direct approach” (DA), the “Threshold Adaptation” approach (TA), and the “Positive Approach” (Pos)-as well as a method called “Singularity Stochastic Removal” (SSR) specifically developed for precipitation, all based on the same adjustment technique. Unlike the three other models, SSR allows dealing in the same way with the situations where the precipitation model has too many wet days or not with respect to the reference data. SSR also avoids separating the correction of the occurrence from that of the intensity, which constitutes a flexible tool. First, the four approaches are applied to a historical regional climate model precipitation run. Evaluations are realized through occurrence- and intensity-related criteria. Although SSR, DA, and Pos may be close to each other depending on the criterion, in general, SSR provides the best results when all criteria are accounted for. This is even more true when the classical assumption that “the model precipitation had too many wet days” does not hold. The BC methods are also intercompared over the 2071-2100 period. The different BC methods are in agreement with previous studies, with relatively equivalent evolutions from 1976-2005 to 2071-2100, although nuances are present from one BC method to another. As a global conclusion, the SSR method for precipitation is a good compromise to correct both occurrences and intensities. © 2016. American Geophysical Union.

Simulation models provide excellent instruments for researchers to gain more insight into relevant processes and best agricultural practices and provide tools for planners for decision making support. The extent to which models are capable of reliable extrapolation and prediction is important for exploring new farming systems or assessing the impacts of future land and climate changes.A performance assessment was conducted by testing six detailed state-of-the-art models for simulation of nitrate leaching (ARMOSA, COUPMODEL, DAISY, EPIC, SIMWASER/STOTRASIM, SWAP/ANIMO) for lysimeter data of the Wagna experimental field station in Eastern Austria, where the soil is highly vulnerable to nitrate leaching.Three consecutive phases were distinguished to gain insight in the predictive power of the models: 1) a blind test for 2005-2008 in which only soil hydraulic characteristics, meteorological data and information about the agricultural management were accessible; 2) a calibration for the same period in which essential information on field observations was additionally available to the modellers; and 3) a validation for 2009-2011 with the corresponding type of data available as for the blind test. A set of statistical metrics (mean absolute error, root mean squared error, index of agreement, model efficiency, root relative squared error, Pearson's linear correlation coefficient) was applied for testing the results and comparing the models.None of the models performed good for all of the statistical metrics. Models designed for nitrate leaching in high-input farming systems had difficulties in accurately predicting leaching in low-input farming systems that are strongly influenced by the retention of nitrogen in catch crops and nitrogen fixation by legumes. An accurate calibration does not guarantee a good predictive power of the model.

The uncertainty is quantified using the Cramer-von Mises score (CvM) to measure the ""distance"" between the simulated and observed CDFs. The ability of the three RCMs and CDF-t to simulate the ""climate"" variability is quantified with the explained variance, variance ratio and extreme occurrence. The study shows that despite their differences, the three RCMs display very similar performance. In terms of global distributions (i.e. CvM), all models perform better than ERA-40 for both seasons and variables. However, looking at variance criteria, RCMs are not always much better than ERA-40 reanalyses, whereas CDF-t produces accurate results when applied to ERA-40. In a second step, a combined statistical/dynamical downscaling approach has been used, consisting in applying CDF-t to the RCM outputs. It shows that CDF-t applied to the RCM outputs does not necessarily produce better results than those from CDF-t directly applied to ERA-40. It also shows that CDF-t applied to RCMs generally improves the downscaled CDFs and that the ""additional"" added value of CDF-t applied to the RCMs is independent of the performance of the RCMs in terms of CvM, explained variance, variance ratio and extreme occurrence. © 2012 Author(s).",,"assessment method; climate modeling; downscaling; rainfall; regional climate; statistical analysis; temperature effect; wind forcing; Mediterranean Sea",Article,Scopus

Big data and data analysis methods and models are important tools in food security (FS) studies for gap analysis and preparation of appropriate analytical frameworks. These innovations necessitate the development of novel methods for collecting, storing, processing, and extracting data. Methodology. The primary goal of this study was to conduct a critical review of agricultural big data and methods and models used for FS studies published in peer-reviewed journals since 2010. Approximately 130 articles were selected for full content review after the pre-screening process. Results. There are different sources of data collection, including but not limited to online databases, the internet, omics, Internet of Things, social media, survey rounds, remote sensing, and the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database. The collected data require analysis (i.e., mining, neural networks, Bayesian networks, and other ML algorithms) before data visualization using Python, R, Circos, Gephi, Tableau, or Cytoscape. Approximately 122 models, all of which were used in FS studies worldwide, were selected from 130 articles. However, most of these models addressed only one or two dimensions of FS (i.e., availability and access) and ignored the other dimensions (i.e., stability and utilization), creating a gap in the global context. Conclusions. There are certain FS gaps both worldwide and in the United Arab Emirates that need to be addressed by scientists and policymakers. Following the identification of the drivers, policies, and indicators, the findings of this review could be used to develop an appropriate analytical framework for FS and nutrition.

Canopy spectral response in visible near-infrared (VNIR, 400–979 nm) has been widely used to estimate CNC and AGB of canopies but is often confounded by the soil background, crop type, phenological changes and environmental conditions. Machine (ML) and deep learning (DL) have emerged as promising techniques for mapping CNC and AGB using canopy spectral reflectance in VNIR. However, ML and DL models’ performance relies on extensive labelled training datasets, which are often limited due to being expensive and labour intensive. We estimated CNC and AGB using state-of-the-art hyperspectral (HS) modeling approaches using partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), and one- and two-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D and 2D CNN). These models, together with multispectral (MS) approaches, were evaluated in the context of a small (422) dataset for model development collected from diverse fertilization and contrasting growth conditions. A handheld field spectroradiometer was used to collect spectral reflectance samples across a wide range (more than ten-fold difference in AGB) of canopy development stages in two seasons (winter and summer) in ryegrass, and across phenological stages (from GS-25 to GS-60) in barley. Results can be summarized in four components: (1) the median values of performance metrics in 1D CNN (R2test=0.83, NRMSEtest=0.15 for CNC; R2test=0.79 (ryegrass), 0.61 (barley), NRMSEtest= 0.29 (ryegrass), 0.30 (barley) for AGB) and PLSR (R2test=0.71, NRMSEtest= 0.20 for CNC; R2test=0.62 (ryegrass), 0.70 (barley), NRMSEtest= 0.38 (ryegrass), 0.27 (barley) for AGB) showed the best performance for CNC and AGB prediction in the test data; (2) when evaluated with the independent measurements, 1D CNN demonstrated the best (up to 56% decrease in NRMSE) performance for AGB and was comparable to PLSR for CNC (up to 25% decrease in NRMSE than their HS and MS counterparts); (3) predictive models underperformed at low canopy cover for CNC estimation and were adversely affected by the high biomass saturation effects for AGB prediction; and (4) visible spectrum is relatively more informative to CNC models whereas the red edge to NIR spectrum is more informative to AGB models.

Identifying phenological events assists growers in determining plant maturity, and harvest timing and guides the application of time-specific crop inputs. Currently, phenological monitoring requires repeated manual observations of individual plants’ growth stages, which is highly laborious, time-inefficient, and requires the handling and integration of large field-based data sets. The ability of growers to accurately forecast yield is also compounded by the asynchronous growth of banana plants. Satellite remote sensing has proved effective in monitoring spatial and temporal crop phenology in many broadacre crops. However, for banana crops, very high spatial and temporal resolution imagery is required to enable individual plant level monitoring. Unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV)-based sensing technologies provide a cost-effective solution, with the potential to derive information on health, yield, and growth in a timely, consistent, and quantifiable manner. Our research explores the ability of UAV-derived data to track temporal phenological changes of individual banana plants from follower establishment to harvest. Individual plant crowns were delineated using object-based image analysis, with calculations of canopy height and canopy area producing strong correlations against corresponding ground-based measures of these parameters (R2 of 0.77 and 0.69 respectively). A temporal profile of canopy reflectance and plant morphology for 15 selected banana plants were derived from UAV-captured multispectral data over 21 UAV campaigns. The temporal profile was validated against ground-based determinations of key phenological growth stages. Derived measures of minimum plant height provided the strongest correlations to plant establishment and harvest, whilst interpolated maxima of normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) best indicated flower emergence. For pre-harvest yield forecasting, the Enhanced Vegetation Index 2 provided the strongest relationship (R2 = 0.77) from imagery captured near flower emergence. These findings demonstrate that UAV-based multitemporal crop monitoring of individual banana plants can be used to determine key growing stages of banana plants and offer pre-harvest yield forecasts. © 2023 by the authors.","banana plant; geographic object-based image analysis; multispectral; multitemporal; phenology; UAV; unoccupied aerial vehicle; yield","Antennas; Cost effectiveness; Forecasting; Fruits; Harvesting; Image analysis; Image enhancement; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation mapping; Aerial vehicle; Banana plant; Geographic object-based image analysis; Multi-spectral; Multi-temporal; Phenology; Unoccupied aerial vehicle; Yield; Crops",Article,Scopus

Ground-truth wheat traits were measured at flowering and harvest in a field experiment combining four N and two water levels in central Spain over 2 years. Hyperspectral and thermal airborne images coincident with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 were acquired at flowering. A parametric linear model using all hyperspectral normalized difference spectral indices (NDSI) and two non-parametric models (artificial neural network and random forest) were used to assess their estimation ability combining NDSIs and other RS indicators. The feasibility of using freely available multispectral satellite was tested by applying the same methodology but using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 bands. Yield estimation obtained the highest R2 value, showing that the visible and short-wave infrared region (VSWIR) had similar accuracy to the hyperspectral and Sentinel-2 imagery (R2 ≈ 0.84). The SWIR bands were important in the GPC estimation with both sensors, whereas N output was better estimated using red-edge-based NDSIs, obtaining satisfactory results with the hyperspectral sensor (R2 = 0.74) and with the Sentinel-2 (R2 = 0.62).

Defining agricultural marginal land is a task that involves more than just considering the land's quality, its definition changed a lot during the last two centuries. OBJECTIVE: Development of new technologies and policy trends require the concepts of prime land and marginal land to be renewed from time to time. Although much research has been done on the concept of marginal land, it is currently limited by the lack of a clear, globally accepted definition. METHOD: There are four major sources of criteria of marginal lands: economic (e.g., rent cost, land value), geographical (e.g., temperature, slope, precipitation), ecosystem-based (e.g., protected areas, recreation, ecosystem services), soil suitability (e.g., yield capability, physical and chemical soil properties). The categorisation of agricultural land into groups like productive, marginal or unproductive often depends on the cultivation or management type. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Since conceptions of marginal land are dynamic both in time and space, flexible policy and practical solutions are needed for their non-degrading use, which in any case shall support nature-based socioeconomic development. To maintain the socioeconomic value of these areas, it is crucial to develop rural areas that are economically or biophysically marginalised. High nature value farming, bioenergy crops by sustainable land management and afforestation are highly recommended. Choosing the right management can transform marginal land into an optimal soil condition or incorrect management can degrade prime land into marginal land (unproductive land). SIGNIFICANCE: This paper provides a review and categorisation of the historical and new developments of marginal land concepts especially those which are working with agricultural aspects, including land management and reclamation. It could give a strong basis for further research in topic of marginal land. © 2022","Agriculture; Concept; Land management; Marginal land; Marginal land review","afforestation; agricultural land; bioenergy; crop yield; cultivation; land management",Review,Scopus

Grain production in China has remarkably improved since its founding in 1949, but the growth remains uneven across regions. The goal of this research was to assess the determinants of the yields of three major food crops (maize, rice, and wheat) in China and the mechanism of their responses to increased crop yields. Boosted regression tree models were created to capture the linked complex predictor-response relationships between crop yields and individual explanatory variables using prefecture-level agricultural statistics in China coupled with geographic data during the period from 1952 to 2017. The results showed that technological inputs (e.g., fertilizers, electricity consumption, and power of agricultural machinery) played a key role in the increase of crop yields, which explained 47%, 39%, and 62% of the variances in the yields of maize, rice, and wheat during the period 1952–2017, respectively. However, the contribution of technology became weaker over time, while the contribution of agro-environmental conditions and structural characteristics of administrative regions became stronger. Partial dependence plots indicated that encouraging higher technological inputs, accelerating large-scale grain production, shortening the urban-rural income gap, and improving the education of farmers were conductive to increasing crop yields. Overall, our results suggest that grain production policies aimed at increasing crop yields should better reflect the spatial heterogeneity of yield gaps; low-yield-gap regions should improve the utilization efficiency of water and fertilizer and formulate measures to inhibit non-grain production on cultivated land, while high-yield-gap regions should focus on improving technological inputs and promoting agricultural restructuring. This study provides deep insights into the processes of how individual explanatory variables affect crop yields, which is essential to develop differentiated grain production policies and provide valuable references for shortening yield gaps in high-yield-gap regions. © 2022","Boosted regression trees; China; Crop yields; Grain production policies; Sustainable agriculture","education; growth rate; China",Article,Scopus

Traditional landform modeling approaches are labor-intensive and time-consuming. In recent years, landform mapping has increasingly been digitized. This study conducted an in-depth analysis of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in combination with geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA), for mapping volcanic and glacial landforms. Sentinel-2 image, as well as predisposing variables (DEM and its derivatives, e.g., slope, aspect, curvature and flow accumulation), were segmented using a multi-resolution segmentation algorithm, and relevant features were selected to define segmentation scales for each landform category. A set of object-based features was developed based on spectral (e.g., brightness), geometrical (e.g., shape index), and textural (grey level co-occurrence matrix) information. The landform modelling networks were then trained and tested based on labelled objects generated using GEOBIA and ground control points. Our results show that an integrated approach of GEOBIA and CNN achieved an ACC of 0.9685, 0.9780, 0.9614, 0.9767, 0.9675, 0.9718, 0.9600, and 0.9778 for dacite lava, caldera, andesite lava, volcanic cone, volcanic tuff, glacial circus, glacial valley, and suspended valley, respectively. The quantitative evaluation shows the highest performance (Accuracy > 0.9600 and cross-validation accuracy > 0.9400) for volcanic and glacial landforms and; therefore, is recommended for regional and large-scale landform mapping. Our results and the provided automatic workflow emphasize the potential of integrated GEOBIA and CNN for fast and efficient landform mapping as a first step in the earth’s surface management. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"article; brightness; convolutional neural network; cross validation; image analysis; plant cone; quantitative analysis; segmentation algorithm; workflow; algorithm; image processing; procedures; Algorithms; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neural Networks, Computer; Workflow",Article,Scopus

They consider spatial and temporal variability in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum to modulate N applications to the actual crop nutrient status and requirements. However, deriving fertilizer N recommendations exclusively from remote proximal and remote sensing data can lead to substantial inaccuracies and new, more complex approaches are needed. Therefore, this study presents an improved approach that integrates crop modelling, proximal sensing and forecasts weather data to manage site-specific N fertilization in winter wheat. This improved approach is based on four successive steps: (1) optimal N supply is estimated through the DSSAT crop model informed with a combination of observed and forecast weather data; (2) actual crop N uptake is estimated using proximal sensing; (3) N prescription maps are created merging crop model and proximal sensing information, considering also the contribution of the soil N mineralisation; (4) N-Variable Rate Application (N-VRA) is implemented in the field. A VRA method based on DSSAT fed with historical weather data and a business-as- usual uniform fertilization were also compared. The methods were implemented in a 23.4 ha field in Northern Italy, cropped to wheat and characterized by large soil variability in texture and organic matter content. Results indicated that the model-based approaches consistently led to higher yields, agronomic efficiencies and gross margins than the uniform N application rate. Furthermore, the proximal sensing-based approach allowed capturing of the spatial variability in crop N uptake and led to a substantial reduction of the spatial variability in yield and protein content. This study grounds the development of web-based software as a friendly tool to optimize the N variable rate application in winter cereals. © 2022, The Author(s).","DSSAT; Nitrogen Fertilization; Proximal sensing; Variable rate; Winter wheat","crop yield; fertilizer; nitrogen; numerical model; remote sensing; wheat; winter",Article,Scopus

In total, 36 vegetation indices (VIs) were extracted from mosaicked aerial images that served as temporal phenomic predictors for southern rust scored in the field and senescence as scored using UAS-acquired mosaic images. Temporal best linear unbiased predictors (TBLUPs) were calculated using a nested model that treated hybrid performance as nested within flights in terms of rust and senescence. All eight machine learning regressions tested (ridge, lasso, elastic net, random forest, support vector machine with radial and linear kernels, partial least squares, and k-nearest neighbors) outperformed a general linear model with both higher prediction accuracies (92–98%) and lower root mean squared error (RMSE) for rust and senescence scores (linear model RMSE ranged from 65.8 to 2396.5 across all traits, machine learning regressions RMSE ranged from 0.3 to 17.0). UAS-acquired VIs enabled the discovery of novel early quantitative phenotypic indicators of maize senescence and southern rust before being detectable by expert annotation and revealed positive correlations between grain filling time and yield (0.22 and 0.44 in 2020 and 2021), with practical implications for precision agricultural practices. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"article; elastic tissue; grain filling; growing season; human; human experiment; imagery; k nearest neighbor; machine learning; maize; nonhuman; partial least squares regression; phenotype; prediction; quantitative analysis; random forest; root mean squared error; senescence; support vector machine; vegetation; algorithm; Basidiomycetes; genetics; machine learning; Algorithms; Basidiomycota; Machine Learning; Phenomics; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

However, early mapping of winter wheat using remotely sensed data is challenging because remote sensing observations can only be used for a part of the growth period. In this study, a framework was proposed for early season mapping of winter wheat using spectral and temporal information of Sentinel-2 images. First, time series of temporal and spectral features were derived using Whittaker smoothing. Subsequently, sensitivities of different parameters (i.e. input features, time interval, and length of time-series data) to early mapping were analyzed. Finally, early maps of winter wheat were generated based on optimal parameters. Results show that the earliest identifiable timing was delayed as the time interval of the time series increased. Winter wheat can be mapped in the early overwintering period (5 months before harvest) with an overall accuracy of 0.91, which is comparable to that of post-season mapping (0.94). In addition, the misclassification in early mapping was caused by uneven sample spatial patterns, natural conditions, and planting management; however, most errors can be gradually amended during the green-up and jointing periods, and the overall accuracy remained stable after the jointing stage. This study demonstrates that it is feasible to implement large-scale early mapping of winter wheat using satellite observations. The proposed approach potentially provides a reference for early mapping of other crop types in agricultural regions worldwide. © 2022 The Author(s).

Producing these maps at detailed scales requires exhaustive field surveys that can be laborious, time-consuming, and expensive to replicate. With a growing archive of remote sensing data, there are enormous opportunities to exploit dense satellite image time series (SITS), temporal sequences of images over the same area. Generally, crop type mapping relies on single-sensor inputs and is solved with the help of traditional learning algorithms such as random forests or support vector machines. Nowadays, deep learning techniques have brought significant improvements by leveraging information in both spatial and temporal dimensions, which are relevant in crop studies. The concurrent availability of Sentinel-1 (synthetic aperture radar) and Sentinel-2 (optical) data offers a great opportunity to utilize them jointly; however, optimizing their synergy has been understudied with deep learning techniques. In this work, we analyze and compare three fusion strategies (input, layer, and decision levels) to identify the best strategy that optimizes optical-radar classification performance. They are applied to a recent architecture, notably, the pixel-set encoder–temporal attention encoder (PSE-TAE) developed specifically for object-based classification of SITS and based on self-attention mechanisms. Experiments are carried out in Brittany, in the northwest of France, with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series. Input and layer-level fusion competitively achieved the best overall F-score surpassing decision-level fusion by 2%. On a per-class basis, decision-level fusion increased the accuracy of dominant classes, whereas layer-level fusion improves up to 13% for minority classes. Against single-sensor baseline, multi-sensor fusion strategies identified crop types more accurately: for example, input-level outperformed Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 by 3% and 9% in F-score, respectively. We have also conducted experiments that showed the importance of fusion for early time series classification and under high cloud cover condition. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, a comprehensive investigation is needed to evaluate the impact of land use change on the LST. Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques were used for the detailed investigation. RS data for the years 1993, 2007 and 2020 during summer (March–May) in Dhaka city were used to prepare land cover maps, analyze LST, generate hazard maps and relate the land cover change with LST by using GIS. The results show that the built-up area in Dhaka city increased by 67% from 1993 to 2020 by replacing lowland mainly, followed by vegetation, bare soil and water bodies. LSTs found in the study area were ranged from 23.26 to 39.94 °C, 23.69 to 43.35 °C and 24.44 to 44.58 °C for the years 1993, 2007 and 2020, respectively. The increases of spatially distributed maximum and mean LST were found 4.62 °C and 6.43 °C, respectively, for the study period of 27 years while the change in minimum LST was not substantial. LST increased by around 0.24 °C per year and human thermal discomfort shifted from moderate to strong heat stress for the total study period due to the increase of built-up and bare lands. This study also shows that normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) were negatively correlated with LST while normalized difference built-up Index (NDBI) and normalized difference built-up Index (NDBAI) were positively correlated with LST.

This study provides a comprehensive step by step modelling approach for a small agricultural watershed using the SWAT model. The watershed is situated in Petzenkirchen in the western part of Lower Austria and has total area of 66 hectares. At present, 87% of the catchment area is arable land, 5% is used as pasture, 6% is forested and 2% is paved. The calibration approach involves a sequential calibration of the model starting from surface runoff, and groundwater flow, followed by crop yields and then soil moisture, and finally total streamflow and sediment yields. Calibration and validation are carried out using the r-package SWATplusR. The impact of each calibration step on sediment yields and total streamflow is evaluated. The results of this approach are compared with those of the conventional model calibration approach, where all the parameters governing various hydrological processes are calibrated simultaneously. Results showed that the model was capable of successfully predicting surface runoff, groundwater flow, soil profile water content, total streamflow and sediment yields with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of greater than 0.75. Crop yields were also well simulated with a percent bias (PBIAS) ranging from −17% to 14%. Surface runoff calibration had the highest impact on streamflow output, improving NSE from 0.39 to 0.77. The step-wise calibration approach performed better for streamflow prediction than the simultaneous calibration approach. The results of this study show that the step-wise calibration approach is more accurate, and provides a better representation of different hydrological components and processes than the simultaneous calibration approach. © 2021 by the authors.

Several studies have demonstrated the excellent capability of radar and optical imagery for crop mapping and biophysical parameter estimation. This paper aims at modeling the crop biophysical parameters, e.g., Leaf Area Index (LAI) and biomass, using a combination of radar and optical Earth observations. We extracted several radar features from polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and Vegetation Indices (VIs) from optical images to model crops’ LAI and dry biomass. Then, the mutual correlations between these features and Random Forest feature importance were calculated. We considered two scenarios to estimate crop parameters. First, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, e.g., Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), were utilized to estimate two crop biophysical parameters. To this end, crops’ dry biomass and LAI were estimated using three input data; (1) SAR polarimetric features; (2) spectral VIs; (3) integrating both SAR and optical features. Second, a deep artificial neural network was created. These input data were fed to the mentioned algorithms and evaluated using the in-situ measurements. These observations of three cash crops, including soybean, corn, and canola, have been collected over Manitoba, Canada, during the Soil Moisture Active Validation Experimental 2012 (SMAPVEX-12) campaign. The results showed that GB and XGB have great potential in parameter estimation and remarkably improved accuracy. Our results also demonstrated a significant improvement in the dry biomass and LAI estimation compared to the previous studies. For LAI, the validation Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was reported as 0.557 m2 /m2 for canola using GB, and 0.298 m2 /m2 for corn using GB, 0.233 m2 /m2 for soybean using XGB.

This study investigated the use of remotely sensed phenology, climate data and machine learning for estimating yield at a resolution suitable for optimising crop management in fields. We used spatially weighted growth curve estimation to identify the timing of phenological events from sequences of Landsat NDVI and derive phenological and seasonal climate metrics. Using data from a 17,000 ha study area, we investigated the relationships between the metrics and yield over 17 years from 2003 to 2019. We compared six statistical and machine learning models for estimating yield: multiple linear regression, mixed effects models, generalised additive models, random forests, support vector regression using radial basis functions and deep learning neural networks. We used a 50-50 train-test split on pad-dock-years where 50% of paddock-year combinations were randomly selected and used to train each model and the remaining 50% of paddock-years were used to assess the model accuracy. Using only phenological metrics, accuracy was highest using a linear mixed model with a random effect that allowed the relationship between integrated NDVI and yield to vary by year (R = 0.67, MAE = 0.25 t ha−1, RMSE = 0.33 t ha−1, NRMSE = 0.25). We quantified the improvements in accuracy when seasonal climate metrics were also used as predictors. We identified two optimal models using the combined phenological and seasonal climate metrics: support vector regression and deep learning models (R = 0.68, MAE = 0.25 t ha−1, RMSE = 0.32 t ha−1, NRMSE = 0.25). While the linear mixed model using only phenological metrics performed similarly to the nonlinear models that are also seasonal climate metrics, the nonlinear models can be more easily generalised to estimate yield in years for which training data are unavailable. We conclude that long-term hindcasts of wheat yield in fields, at 30 m spatial resolution, can be produced using remotely sensed phenology from Landsat NDVI, climate data and machine learning. © 2021 by the authors.

SIF-based primary productivity metrics have demonstrated higher fidelity to large-scale patterns of crop productivity than reflectance-based vegetation indices when averaged across the growing season. In-season crop yield forecasting typically relies upon reflectance-based vegetation indices, raising the question of whether in-season monitoring could be improved by utilizing SIF. Here, we analyze patterns of US agricultural productivity from USDA surveys and their in-season relationships with coarse-resolution GOME-2 SIF, high-resolution downscaled SIF, SIF-based primary productivity metrics, MODIS NDVI, and MODIS GPP. We find that coarse-resolution SIF-based metrics and NDVI exhibit similar out-of-sample in-season (April–July and April–August) predictive ability, even when spatially filtering higher-resolution NDVI data to cropland areas. The downscaled SIF product performed more poorly than the coarse-resolution SIF, and MODIS GPP performed more poorly than MODIS NDVI. All forecasts are improved by incorporating county fixed effects to control for cross-sectional differences between counties. NDVI-based metrics allow for significantly better yield predictions during drought conditions than SIF-based metrics, suggesting limited added value of SIF for early warning of drought impacts. The benefits of SIF for crop monitoring should be continually evaluated as the frequency and quality of SIF measurements continue to improve. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Crop forecasting; Crop productivity; GOME-2; NDVI; SIF; Solar-induced fluorescence","Chlorophyll; Crops; Drought; Forecasting; Forestry; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Quality control; Radiometers; Reflection; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Coarser resolution; Crop forecasting; Crop productivity; GOME-2; NDVI; Primary productivity; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Solar-induced fluorescences; Vegetation index; Fluorescence; chlorophenol; chlorophyll; crop production; crop yield; fluorescence; forecasting method; MODIS; NDVI; United States",Article,Scopus

Population growth and the increasing demand of resources will exacerbate these impacts. Focusing on rainfed maize production, we evaluate the socio-ecological risk that municipalities currently face and how climate change could modify it. Municipalities were classified based on their biophysical and socioeconomic traits like temperature, precipitation, population, gross domestic product, marginalization, and agricultural subsidies. The study identifies municipalities that would face higher risk under climate change conditions, and it evaluates whether increases in agricultural subsidies could be effective for reducing the farmers' future risk. Our results show that during the 2010's, 36.8% of the municipalities and 15% of the population were at very high and high risk, respectively. By 2070, under a high-warming scenario these figures increase to 56.5 and 18.5%. We find that a generalized augment in agricultural subsidies is not enough to compensate for the effects of climate change on the socio-ecological risk of rainfed maize producers. We suggest that transformative adaptation is required for managing the agricultural risk that socio-ecological systems experience under climate change conditions. Such adaptation strategies should include poverty alleviation, promotion of resistant and native varieties of crops, capacity building to improve management and water use, sustainable technification, and soil restoration.

Study focus: This study aims to improve the prediction of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) to enhance the efficacy of drainage system design in data-poor areas. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were developed to estimate Ksat and compared with empirical regression-type Pedotransfer Function (PTF) equations. Subsequently, the ANNs and PTFs estimated Ksat values were used in EnDrain software to design subsurface drainage systems which were evaluated against designs using measured Ksat values. New hydrological insights: Results showed that ANNs more accurately predicted Ksat than PTFs. Drainage design based on PTFs predictions (1) result in a deeper water-level and (2) higher drainage density, increasing costs. Drainage designs based on ANNs predictions gave drain spacing and water table depth equivalent to those predicted using measured data. The results of this study indicate that ANNs can be developed using existing and under-utilised data sets and applied successfully to data-poor areas.

By comparing the predictive accuracy between multiple regression and machine learning models before and after the use of random forest recursive feature elimination, all multiple regression, and machine learning models showed improved accuracy while the most accurate model was the elastic net regression with 65.2% explained variance. The results show only neutral (4.11 on a 7-point Likert scale) regarding the overall satisfaction score on ERL. Even majority of students are competent in technology and have no obvious issue in accessing learning devices or Wi-Fi, face-to-face learning is more preferable compared to ERL and this is found to be the most important predictor. Besides, the level of efforts made by instructors, the agreement on the appropriateness of the adjusted assessment methods, and the perception of online learning being well delivered are shown to be highly important in determining the satisfaction scores.

In this study, we compared the original Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and an enhanced version of SWAT model with physically based Freeze-Thaw cycle representation (SWAT-FT) for simulating future annual ET, stream flow, water yield, surface runoff, and subsurface runoff in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). SWAT-FT projected fewer frozen days than the original SWAT model due to its better representation of snow cover insulation effects. Both models derived declining trends in annual streamflow and terrestrial water yield in the late 21st century due to increased ET under warmer climate. However, these two models exhibited contrasting mechanisms underlying the streamflow decline. For original SWAT model, the decrease in surface runoff was the major driver, while for SWAT-FT, reduced subsurface runoff was the main cause. In general, the original SWAT model predicted more surface runoff and less subsurface runoff than SWAT-FT. Further geospatial inspection shows large discrepancies between these two models, particularly in the northern colder parts of the UMRB, where the maximum differences in annual surface and subsurface runoff reached 130 mm yr−1 and 140 mm yr−1, respectively.

However, although gas exchange between croplands and the atmosphere is measurable in the field, it is difficult to quantify at the plot scale over relatively large areas because of the heterogeneous character of landscapes and differences in crop management. However, assessing accurate carbon and water budgets over croplands is essential to promote sustainable agronomic practices and reduce the water demand and the climatic impacts of croplands while maintaining sufficient yields. From this perspective, we developed a crop model, SAFYE-CO2, that assimilates high spatial- and temporal-resolution (HSTR) remote sensing products to estimate daily crop biomass, water and CO2 fluxes, annual yields, and carbon budgets at the parcel level over large areas. This modeling approach was evaluated for sunflower against two in situ datasets. First, the model's output was compared to data acquired during two cropping seasons at the Auradé integrated carbon observation system (ICOS) instrumented site in southwestern France. The model accurately simulated the daily net CO2 flux (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.97 gC·m-2·d-1 and determination coefficient (R2) = 0.83) and water flux (RMSE = 0.68 mm·d-1 and R2 = 0.79). The model's performance was then evaluated against biomass and yield data collected from 80 plots located in southwestern France. The model was able to satisfactorily estimate biomass dynamics and yield (RMSE = 66 and 54 g·m-2, respectively). To investigate the potential application of the proposed approach at a large scale, given that soil properties are important factors affecting the model, a sensitivity analysis of two existing soil products (GlobalSoilMap and SoilGrids) was carried out. Our results show that these products are not sufficiently accurate for inclusion as inputs to the model, which requires more accurate information on soil water retention capacity to assess water fluxes. Additionally, we argue that no water stress should be considered in the crop growth computation since this stress is already present because of remote sensing information in the proposed approach. This study should be considered a first step to fulfill the existing gap in quantifying carbon budgets at the plot scale over large areas and to accurately estimate the effects of management practices, such as the use of cover crops or specific crop rotations on cropland C and water budgets. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon budget; Crop modeling; Remote sensing; Soil properties; Water budget","Biogeochemistry; Biomass; Budget control; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Crops; Ecology; Mean square error; Plants (botany); Sensitivity analysis; Soil moisture; Determination coefficients; High resolution remote sensing; Management practices; Remote sensing information; Root mean square errors; Soil water retention; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Water budget components; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

In recent years, an abundance of spatial data providing information on soils, topography, and vegetation condition have become available from both proximal and remote sensing platforms. Given the wide range of data costs (between USD $0−50/ha), it is important to understand where often limited financial resources should be directed to optimize field production. Two key questions arise. First, will these data actually aid in better fine-resolution yield prediction to help optimize crop management and farm economics? Second, what level of priority should stakeholders commit to in order to obtain these data? Before fully addressing these questions a remaining challenge is the complex nature of spatiotemporal yield variation. Here, a methodological framework is presented to separate the spatial and temporal components of crop yield variation at the subfield level. The framework can also be used to quantify the benefits of different data types on the predicted crop yield as well to better understand the connection of that data to underlying mechanisms controlling yield. Here, fine-resolution (10 m) datasets were assembled for eight 64 ha field sites, spanning a range of climatic, topographic, and soil conditions across Nebraska. Using Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis, we found the first axis of variation contained 60–85 % of the explained variance from any particular field, thus greatly reducing the dimensionality of the problem. Using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Random Forest (RF) approaches, we quantified that location within the field had the largest relative importance for modeling crop yield patterns. Secondary factors included a combination of vegetation condition, soil water content, and topography. With respect to predicting spatiotemporal crop yield patterns, we found the RF approach (prediction RMSE of 0.2−0.4 Mg/ha for maize) was superior to MLR (0.3−0.8 Mg/ha). While not directly comparable to MLR and RF the EOF approach had relatively low error (0.5–1.7 Mg/ha) and is intriguing as it requires few calibration parameters (2–6 used here) and utilizes the climate-based aridity index, allowing for pragmatic long-term predictions of subfield crop yield. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Maize and soybean; Remote sensing; Spatiotemporal; Statistics; Yield","aridity; calibration; crop yield; financial provision; optimization; remote sensing; soil water; spatial data; stakeholder; topography; Nebraska; United States; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Analyses were performed for the Delaware Watershed at Perry Lake in eastern Kansas. Precipitation indices for DAYMET and PRISM precipitation closely matched GHCN-D, whereas NLDAS and GLDAS showed weaker correlations. We also used these precipitation data as input to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model that confirmed similar trends in streamflow simulation. For stations with complete data, GHCN-D based SWAT-simulated streamflow variability better than gridded precipitation data.

Up to now, this technology has been limited to the control of weeds and pests, whereas the second generation of GM crops is expected to assist farmers in abiotic stress tolerance or improved nutritional features. Aiming to analyze this subject holistically, in this presentation we address an advanced technology for drought-tolerant GM crops, upscaling from molecular details obtained in the laboratory to an extensive network of field trials as well as the impact of the introduction of this innovation into the market. Sunflower has divergent transcription factors, which could be key actors in the drought response orchestrating several signal transduction pathways, generating an improved performance to deal with water deficit. One of such factors, HaHB4, belongs to the homeodomain-leucine zipper family and was first introduced in Arabidopsis. Transformed plants had improved tolerance to water deficits, through the inhibition of ethylene sensitivity and not by stomata closure. Wheat and soybean plants expressing the HaHB4 gene were obtained and cropped across a wide range of growing conditions exhibiting enhanced adaptation to drought-prone environments, the most important constraint affecting crop yield worldwide. The performance of wheat and soybean, however, differed slightly across mentioned environments; whereas the improved behavior of GM wheat respect to controls was less dependent on the temperature regime (cool or warm), differences between GM and wild-type soybeans were remarkably larger in warmer compared to cooler conditions. In both species, these GM crops are good candidates to become market products in the near future. In anticipation of consumers’ and other stakeholders’ interest, spectral analyses of field crops have been conducted to differentiate these GM crops from wild type and commercial cultivars. In this paper, the potential impact of the release of such market products is discussed, considering the perspectives of different stakeholders. © Copyright © 2020 González, Rigalli, Miranda, Romagnoli, Ribichich, Trucco, Portapila, Otegui and Chan.","drought tolerance; grain yield determination; HaHB4; sunflower transcription factor; transgenic soybean; transgenic wheat",,Article,Scopus

Agriculture 4.0, as the fourth evolution in the farming technology, puts forward four essential requirements: increasing productivity, allocating resources reasonably, adapting to climate change, and avoiding food waste. As advanced information systems and Internet technologies are adopted in Agriculture 4.0, enormous farming data, such as meteorological information, soil conditions, marketing demands, and land uses, can be collected, analyzed, and processed for assisting farmers in making appropriate decisions and obtaining higher profits. Therefore, agricultural decision support systems for Agriculture 4.0 has become a very attractive topic for the research community. The objective of this paper aims at exploring the upcoming challenges of employing agricultural decision support systems in Agriculture 4.0.

This work aimed to interpret the feasibility of several machine learning approaches to assess the spatial distribution of solar radiation on Earth based on the Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) Meteorological Imager (MI) geostationary satellite. Four data-driven models were selected (artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and DNN), to compare their accuracy and spatial estimating performance. Moreover, we used a physical model to probe the ability of data-driven methods, implementing hold-out and k-fold cross-validation approaches based on pyranometers located in South Korea. The results of analysis showed the RF had the highest accuracy in predicting performance, although the difference between RF and the second-best technique (DNN) was insignificant. Temporal variations in root mean square error (RMSE) were dependent on the number of data samples, while the physical model showed relatively less sensitivity. Nevertheless, DNN and RF showed less variability in RMSE than the others. To examine spatial estimation performance, we mapped solar radiation over South Korea for each model. The data-driven models accurately simulated the observed cloud pattern spatially, whereas the physical model failed to do because of cloud mask errors. These exhibited different spatial retrieval performances according to their own training approaches. Overall analysis showed that deeper layers of networks approaches (RF and DNN), could best simulate the challenging spatial pattern of thin clouds when using satellite multispectral data. © 2019 by the authors.","Artificial neural network; COMS MI; Deep neural network; Random forest; Solar radiation; Support vector machine","Decision trees; Geostationary satellites; Machine learning; Mean square error; Network layers; Neural networks; Sensitivity analysis; Solar radiation; Support vector machines; K fold cross validations; Machine learning approaches; Random forests; Retrieval performance; Root mean square errors; Satellite multispectral data; Spatial characteristics; Support vector regression (SVR); Deep neural networks",Article,Scopus

In a previous article it was argued that there is little merit to the Syria-climate conflict thesis, including no clear evidence that drought-related migration contributed to civil war onset. Building on this earlier work, the present article investigates an issue which was not fully analysed in the previous one: the nature and causes of the pre-civil war agrarian crisis in Syria's northeast Jazira region, and especially in the governorate of Hasakah. This crisis is usually represented as rooted essentially in a severe multi-year drought which, it is claimed, led to multiple crop failures and in turn large-scale migration. Here it is argued, by contrast, that the central causes of Hasakah's agrarian crisis were long-term and structural, involving three main factors: extreme water resource degradation; deepening rural poverty; and underpinning these, specific features of Syria's and Hasakah's politics and political economy. The article contends, most notably, that the exceptional severity of Hasakah's crisis was a function of the nationwide collapse of Syria's agrarian and rentier model of state-building and development, combined with Hasakah's distinctive political geography as an ethnically contested borderland and frontier zone. I thus conclude that rather than supporting narratives of environmental scarcity-induced conflict, the Syrian case actually confirms the opposite: namely, political ecologists’ insistence on the centrality of the political, and of conflict, in causing environmental scarcities and insecurities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Drought; Frontiers; Oil; Political ecology; Syrian civil war","civil war; climate change; drought; political conflict; political economy; poverty; resource scarcity; water resource; Hasakah; Syrian Arab Republic",Article,Scopus

The core element of the framework is the derivation of a composite agricultural performance index which is composed of different subindicators taking into account cropping intensity, crop diversity, crop rotations, fallow land frequency, land utilization, water use efficiency, and water availability. We derive these subindicators from net primary productivity and evapotranspiration data obtained from the MODIS sensor on board the Terra satellite during the observation period from 2000 to 2016, as well as from cropland maps created through multiannual classification of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We classified pixel-based NDVI time series covering more than 8 × 106 ha of irrigated cropland based on a hierarchical approach concatenating unsupervised and supervised classification techniques to automatically generate and refine training labels, which are then used to train a decision fusion classifier, achieving an average overall accuracy of 78%. The results give unprecedented insights into spatial patterns of agricultural performance in the ASB. The proposed method is transferable and applicable for global-scale mapping, and the results of this remote sensing-aided assessment can provide important information for regional agricultural planning purposes. © The Authors.

This study aims to investigate the potential use of suspended sediment concentration (SSC), water quality and remote sensing data to calibrate and validate a large-scale sediment model. Observed data from across 108 stations located in the Doce River basin was used for the period between 1997-2010. Ten calibration and validation experiments using the MOCOM-UA optimization algorithm coupled with the MGB-SED model were carried out, which, over the same period of time, resulted in 37 calibration and 111 validation tests. The experiments were performed by modifying metrics, spatial discretization, observed data and parameters of the MOCOM-UA algorithm. Results generally demonstrated that the values of correlation presented slight variations and were superior in the calibration step. Additionally, increasing spatial discretization or establishing a background concentration for the model allowed for improved results. In a station with high quantity of SSC data, calibration improved the ENS coefficient from-0.44 to 0.44.

The location and quantity of BMPs were obtained from the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service National Conservation Planning (NCP) database. A Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was built and calibrated for this predominantly agricultural Eagle Creek watershed, incorporating NCP BMPs and monitoring data at the watershed outlet, an edge-of-field (EOF), and tile monitoring sites. Input air temperature modifications were required to induce simulated tile flow to match monitoring data. Calibration heavily incorporated tile monitoring data to correctly proportion surface and subsurface flow, but calibration statistics were unsatisfactory at the EOF and tile monitoring sites. At the watershed outlet, satisfactory to very good calibration statistics were achieved over a 2-year calibration period, and satisfactory statistics were found in the 2-year validation period. SWAT fixes parameters controlling nutrients primarily at the watershed level; a refinement of these parameters at a smaller-scale could improve field-level calibration. Field-scale modeling results indicate that filter strips (FS) are the most effective single BMPs at reducing dissolved reactive phosphorus, and FS typically decreased sediment and nutrient yields when added to any other BMP or BMP combination. Cover crops were the most effective single, in-field practice by reducing nutrient loads over winter months. Watershed-scale results indicate BMPs can reduce sediment and nutrients, but reductions due to NCP BMPs in the Eagle Creek watershed for all water-quality constituents were less than 10%. Hypothetical scenarios simulated with increased BMP acreages indicate larger investments of the appropriate BMP or BMP combination can decrease watershed level loads. © 2018 by the authors.","Best management practices (BMPs); Edge-of-field (EOF); Field-scale; Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI); Nutrients; Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT); Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB)","Agriculture; Calibration; Conservation; Lakes; Monitoring; Nutrients; Restoration; Water quality; Best management practice (BMPs); Edge-of-field (EOF); Field scale; Great lakes; Lake Erie; Soil and water assessment tool; Watersheds",Article,Scopus

Recent observations and modeling studies have suggested that the ice sheet contribution to future sea level rise could have been underestimated in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. The ensuing freshwater discharge coming from ice sheets could have significant impacts on global climate, and especially on the vulnerable tropical areas. During the last glacial/deglacial period, megadrought episodes were observed in the Sahel region at the time of massive iceberg surges, leading to large freshwater discharges. In the future, such episodes have the potential to induce a drastic destabilization of the Sahelian agro-ecosystem. Using a climate modeling approach, we investigate this issue by superimposing on the Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 (RCP8.5) baseline experiment a Greenland flash melting scenario corresponding to an additional sea level rise ranging from 0.5 m to 3 m. Our model response to freshwater discharge coming from Greenland melting reveals a significant decrease of the West African monsoon rainfall, leading to changes in agricultural practices. Combined with a strong population increase, described by different demography projections, important human migration flows could be potentially induced. We estimate that, without any adaptation measures, tens to hundreds million people could be forced to leave the Sahel by the end of this century. On top of this quantification, the sea level rise impact over coastal areas has to be superimposed, implying that the Sahel population could be strongly at threat in case of rapid Greenland melting.","Climate change; Ice sheet melting; Impact; Sahel; Vulnerability","fresh water; rain; sea water; Article; climate change; demography; Greenland; human; ice sheet; melting point; migration; population density; population migration; precipitation; priority journal; rural population; Sahel; surface area; vulnerable population; climate change; computer simulation; freezing; greenhouse effect; ice cover; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; time factor; water flow; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Freezing; Fresh Water; Global Warming; Greenland; Humans; Ice Cover; Models, Theoretical; Seawater; Time Factors; Water Movements",Article,Scopus

The performances of the crop model for two different assimilation methods were compared by employing particle filters (PF) and the proper orthogonal decomposition-based ensemble four-dimensional variational (POD4DVar) strategies. The uncertainties of wheat yield estimates due to different assimilation temporal scales (phenological stages and temporal frequencies) and spatial scale were also analyzed. The results showed that, compared with the crop model without assimilation and with PF-based assimilation, a better yield estimate performance resulted when the POD4DVar-based strategy was used at the field scale. When using this strategy, root mean square errors (RMSE) of 523 kg·ha-1, 543 kg·ha-1 and 172 kg·ha-1 and relative errors (RE) of 5.65%, 5.91% and 7.77% were obtained at the field plot scale, a pixel scale of 1 km and the county scale, respectively. Although the best yield estimates were obtained when all of the observed LAIs were assimilated into the crop model, an acceptable estimate of crop yield could also be achieved by assimilating fewer observations between jointing and anthesis periods of the crop growth season. With decreasing assimilation frequency and pixel resolution, the accuracy of the crop yield estimates decreased; however, the computation time decreased. Thus, it is important to consider reasonable spatio-temporal scales to obtain tradeoffs between accuracy and effectiveness in regional wheat estimates. © 2017 by the authors.","Assimilation; Crop model; Four-dimensional variational; Leaf area index; Particle filter; Spatio-temporal; Uncertainties","Agriculture; Distributed computer systems; Mean square error; Monte Carlo methods; Pixels; Principal component analysis; Target tracking; Uncertainty analysis; Assimilation; Crop model; Four dimensional variational; Leaf Area Index; Particle filter; Spatio temporal; Uncertainties; Crops",Article,Scopus

Despite their importance, limited attention has been given to these uncertainty sources. We compare 27 projected temperature and precipitation indices over 22 regions of the world (including the global land area) in the near (2021-2060) and distant future (2061-2100), calculated using four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), five GCMs, two bias-correction methods, and three reference forcing data sets. To widen the variety of forcing data sets, we developed a new forcing data set, S14FD, and incorporated it into this study. The results show that S14FD is more accurate than other forcing data sets in representing the observed temperature and precipitation extremes in recent decades (1961-2000 and 1979-2008). The use of different bias-correction methods and forcing data sets contributes more to the total uncertainty in the projected precipitation index values in both the near and distant future than the use of different GCMs and RCPs. However, GCM appears to be the most dominant uncertainty source for projected temperature index values in the near future, and RCP is the most dominant source in the distant future. Our findings encourage climate risk assessments, especially those related to precipitation extremes, to employ multiple bias-correction methods and forcing data sets in addition to using different GCMs and RCPs. © 2017.

In this work, we analyze if and to what extent the bias in the simulated crop yield can be reduced by using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model to downscale ERA-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis) rainfall and radiation data. Then, we evaluate the uncertainties resulting from both the choice of the physical parameterizations of the WRF model and its internal variability. Impact assessments were performed at two sites in Sub-Saharan Africa and by using two crop models to simulate Niger pearl millet and Benin maize yields. We find that the use of the WRF model to downscale ERA-Interim climate data generally reduces the bias in the simulated crop yield, yet this reduction in bias strongly depends on the choices in the model setup. Among the physical parameterizations considered, we show that the choice of the land surface model (LSM) is of primary importance. When there is no coupling with a LSM, or when the LSM is too simplistic, the simulated precipitation and then the simulated yield are null, or respectively very low; therefore, coupling with a LSM is necessary. The convective scheme is the second most influential scheme for yield simulation, followed by the shortwave radiation scheme. The uncertainties related to the internal variability of the WRF model are also significant and reach up to 30% of the simulated yields. These results suggest that regional models need to be used more carefully in order to improve the reliability of impact assessments. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.","crop model; EPIC; regional climate model; SARRA-H; West Africa; WRF","Agriculture; Climate change; Crops; Weather forecasting; Crop model; EPIC; Regional climate modeling; SARRA-H; West Africa; WRF; Climate models; assessment method; climate effect; climate modeling; crop yield; error analysis; regional climate; uncertainty analysis; weather forecasting; West Africa; Pennisetum glaucum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

This LMDZ5B version includes a mass-flux representation of the thermal plumes or rolls of the convective boundary layer, coupled to a bi-Gaussian statistical cloud scheme, as well as a parameterization of the cold pools generated below cumulonimbus by re-evaporation of convective precipitation. The triggering and closure of deep convection are now controlled by lifting processes in the sub-cloud layer. An available lifting energy and lifting power are provided both by the thermal plumes and by the spread of cold pools. The individual parameterizations were carefully validated against the results of explicit high resolution simulations. Here we present the work done to go from those new concepts and developments to a full 3D atmospheric model, used in particular for climate change projections with the IPSL-CM5B coupled model. Based on a series of sensitivity experiments, we document the differences with the previous LMDZ5A version distinguishing the role of parameterization changes from that of model tuning. Improvements found previously in single-column simulations of case studies are confirmed in the 3D model: (1) the convective boundary layer and cumulus clouds are better represented and (2) the diurnal cycle of convective rainfall over continents is delayed by several hours, solving a longstanding problem in climate modeling. The variability of tropical rainfall is also larger in LMDZ5B at intraseasonal time-scales. Significant biases of the LMDZ5A model however remain, or are even sometimes amplified. The paper emphasizes the importance of parameterization improvements and model tuning in the frame of climate change studies as well as the new paradigm that represents the improvement of 3D climate models under the control of single-column case studies simulations. © 2012 The Author(s).","Climate change projections; Climate modeling; Deep convection; Physical parameterizations; Shallow convection","atmospheric convection; atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; climate modeling; cold pool; convective boundary layer; cumulonimbus; cumulus; diurnal variation; parameterization; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; turbulence",Article,Scopus

Environmental data collected at the field level, such as soil and climatic information, can be relevant to improve predictive ability in genomic prediction models by describing more precisely genotype-by-environment interactions, which represent a key component of the phenotypic response for complex crop agronomic traits. Modern predictive modeling approaches can efficiently handle various data types and are able to capture complex nonlinear relationships in large datasets. In particular, machine learning techniques have gained substantial interest in recent years. Here we examined the predictive ability of machine learning-based models for two phenotypic traits in maize using data collected by the Maize Genomes to Fields (G2F) Initiative. The data we analyzed consisted of multi-environment trials (METs) dispersed across the United States and Canada from 2014 to 2017. An assortment of soil- and weather-related variables was derived and used in prediction models alongside genotypic data. Linear random effects models were compared to a linear regularized regression method (elastic net) and to two nonlinear gradient boosting methods based on decision tree algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM). These models were evaluated under four prediction problems: (1) tested and new genotypes in a new year; (2) only unobserved genotypes in a new year; (3) tested and new genotypes in a new site; (4) only unobserved genotypes in a new site. Accuracy in forecasting grain yield performance of new genotypes in a new year was improved by up to 20% over the baseline model by including environmental predictors with gradient boosting methods. For plant height, an enhancement of predictive ability could neither be observed by using machine learning-based methods nor by using detailed environmental information.

In this study, a geostatistical approach for bias correction of daily precipitation at ungauged locations is presented. The method utilizes a double quantile mapping with dry day correction for future periods. The transfer function of the bias correction for the ungauged locations is established using distribution functions estimated by ordinary kriging with anisotropic variograms. The methodology was applied to the daily precipitation simulations of the entire CORDEX-Africa ensemble for a study region located in the West African Sudanian Savanna. This ensemble consists of 23 regional climate models (RCM) that were run for three different future scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5). The evaluation of the approach for a historical 50-year period (1950–2005) showed that the method can reduce the inherent strong precipitation bias of RCM simulations, thereby reproducing the main climatological features of the observed data. Moreover, the bias correction technique preserves the climate change signal of the uncorrected RCM simulations. However, the ensemble spread is increased due to an overestimation of the rainfall probability of uncorrected RCM simulations. The application of the bias correction method to the future period (2006–2100) revealed that annual precipitation increases for most models in the near (2020–2049) and far future (2070–2099) with a mean increase of up to a-1 (18%). An analysis of the monthly and daily time series showed a slightly delayed onset and intensification of the rainy season. © 2022 The Authors.

To inform decisions, it is also crucial to quantify the forecasting uncertainty and prove its relevance for food security. Yet, in previous studies both these aspects have been largely overlooked. This paper develops a methodology to anticipate the agricultural Vegetation Health Index (VHI) while making the underlying prediction uncertainty explicit. To achieve this aim, a probabilistic machine learning framework modelling weather and climate determinants is introduced and implemented through Quantile Random Forests. In a second step, a statistical link between VHI forecasts and monthly food price variations is established. As a pilot implementation, the framework is applied to nine countries of South-East Asia (SEA) with consideration of national monthly rice prices. Model benchmarks show satisfactory accuracy metrics, suggesting that the probabilistic VHI predictions can provide decision-makers with reliable information about future cropland health and its impact on food price variation weeks or even months ahead, albeit with increasing uncertainty as the forecasting horizon grows. These results - ultimately allowing to anticipate the impact of weather shocks on household food expenditure - contribute to advancing the multidisciplinary literature linking vegetation health, probabilistic forecasting models, and food security policy. © 2022 The Authors","Food security; Probabilistic machine learning; Remote sensing of the environment; Vegetation health; Vulnerability analysis","Agriculture; Climate change; Decision trees; Food supply; Forecasting; Health; Machine learning; Population statistics; Remote sensing; Food security; Machine-learning; Probabilistic forecasting; Probabilistic machine learning; Probabilistic machines; Remote sensing of the environment; Remote-sensing; Vegetation health; Vegetation health indices; Vulnerability analysis; Vegetation; agricultural land; food security; forecasting method; machine learning; probability; remote sensing; vegetation; vulnerability; Article; climate change; controlled study; cropland; food security; forecasting; household; household food expenditure; machine learning; quantile random forest; random forest; reliability; remote sensing; vegetation; Vegetation Health Index; weather; agriculture; climate change; crop; food security; forecasting; Agriculture; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Food Security; Forecasting",Article,Scopus

We evaluated the potential of the new PRISMA hyperspectral sensor for mapping soil organic matter (SOM), available soil phosphorus (P2O5), and potassium (K2O) content over a cultivated area in Khouribga, northern Morocco. These soil nutrients were estimated using (i) the random forest (RF) algorithm based on feature selection methods, including feature subset evaluation and feature ranking methods belonging to three categories (i.e., filter, wrapper, and embedded techniques), and (ii) 107 soil samples taken from the study area. The results show that the RF-embedded method produced better predictive accuracy compared with the filter and wrapper methods. The model for SOM showed moderate accuracy ((Formula presented.) = 0.5, RMSEP = 0.43%, and RPIQ = 2.02), whereas that for soil P2O5 and K2O exhibited low efficiency ((Formula presented.) = 0.26 and 0.36, RMSEP = 51.07 and 182.31 ppm, RPIQ = 0.65 and 1.16, respectively). The interpolation of RF-residuals by ordinary kriging (OK) methods reached the highest predictive results for SOM ((Formula presented.) = 0.69, RMSEP = 0.34%, and RPIQ = 2.56), soil P2O5 ((Formula presented.) = 0.44, RMSEP = 44.10 ppm, and RPIQ = 0.75), and soil K2O ((Formula presented.) = 0.51, RMSEP = 159.29 ppm, and RPIQ = 1.34), representing the best fitting ability between the hyperspectral data and soil nutrients. The result maps provide a spatially continuous surface mapping of the soil landscape, conforming to the pedological substratum.

In this paper, we first show how WUSNs can operate reliably under field conditions year-round and at the same time be used for determining and mapping soil conditions from the buried sensor nodes. We demonstrate the design and deployment of a 23-node WUSN installed at an agricultural field site that covers an area with a 530 m radius. The WUSN has continuously operated since September 2019, enabling real-time monitoring of soil volumetric water content (VWC), soil temperature (ST), and soil electrical conductivity. Secondly, we present data collected over a nine-month period across three seasons. We evaluate the performance of a deep learning algorithm in predicting soil VWC using various combinations of the received signal strength (RSSI) from each buried wireless node, aboveground pathloss, the distance between wireless node and receive antenna (D), ST, air temperature (AT), relative humidity (RH), and precipitation as input parameters to the model. The AT, RH, and precipitation were obtained from a nearby weather station. We find that a model with RSSI, D, AT, ST, and RH as inputs was able to predict soil VWC with an R2 of 0.82 for test datasets, with a Root Mean Square Error of ±0.012 (m3/m3). Hence, a combination of deep learning and other easily available soil and climatic parameters can be a viable candidate for replacing expensive soil VWC sensors in WUSNs. © 2022 by the authors.

In this study, we developed a python-based framework that simplifies the process of building and training machine-learning-based hydrological models and automates the process of pre-processing hydrological data and post-processing model results. Pre-processing utilities assist in incorporating domain knowledge of hydrology in the machine learning model, such as the distribution of weather data into hydrologic response units (HRUs) based on different HRU discretization definitions. The post-processing utilities help in interpreting the model's results from a hydrological point of view.

The past several decades have witnessed the emergence of conservation tillage practices to combat soil erosion and degradation. However, the effects of conservation tillage on crop water productivity (CWP) remain uncertain, especially from a regional-scale perspective. Here, we used an improved process-based agroecosystem model (DLEM-Ag) to quantify the long-term effects of conservation tillage (e.g., no-tillage, NT; reduced tillage, RT) on CWP (defined as the ratio of crop productivity to evapotranspiration) of corn and soybean across the Ohio River Basin during 1979–2018. Our results revealed an average increase of 2.8% and 8.4% in CWP for corn and soybean, respectively, under the NT adoption scenario. Compared to the conventional tillage scenario, NT and RT would enhance CWP, primarily due to reductions in evapotranspiration, particularly evaporation. Further analysis suggested that, although NT and RT may decrease surface runoff, these practices could also increase subsurface drainage and nutrient loss from corn and soybean farmland via leaching. These results indicate that conservation tillage should be complemented with additional water and nutrient management practices to enhance soil water retention and optimize nutrient use in the region's cropland. Our findings also provide unique insights into optimizing management practices for other areas where conservation tillage is widely applied. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation tillage; Crop water productivity (CWP); No-tillage; Ohio River Basin (ORB); Process-based agroecosystem model","Crops; Cultivation; Ecosystems; Evapotranspiration; Food supply; Groundwater flow; Nutrients; Rivers; Soil conservation; Soil moisture; Watersheds; Conservation tillage; Crop water productivity; Management practises; No tillage; Ohio River; Ohio river basin; Process-based agroecosystem model; River basins; Water productivity; Productivity; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural land; agricultural management; conservation tillage; crop production; food security; maize; nutrient loss; nutrient use efficiency; soybean; Ohio Basin; United States; Glycine max",Article,Scopus

These properties are used to populate an earth model vector, and the spatial variation of properties across this vector sheds light on the underlying earth structure or physical phenomenon of interest, from groundwater aquifers to plate tectonics. However, to infer these properties the spatial characteristics of these properties need to be known in advance. Typically, assumptions are made about the length scales of earth properties, which are encoded a priori in a Bayesian probabilistic setting. In an optimization setting, appeals are made to promote model simplicity together with constraints which keep models close to a preferred model. All of these approaches are valid, though they can lead to unintended features in the resulting inferred geophysical models owing to inappropriate prior assumptions, constraints or even the nature of the solution basis functions. In this work it will be shown that in order to make accurate inferences about earth properties, inferences can first be made about the underlying length scales of these properties in a very general solution basis. From a mathematical point of view, these spatial characteristics of earth properties can be conveniently thought of as 'properties' of the earth properties. Thus, the same machinery used to infer earth properties can be used to infer their length scales. This can be thought of as an 'infer to infer' paradigm analogous to the 'learning to learn' paradigm which is now commonplace in the machine learning literature. However, it must be noted that (geophysical) inference is not the same as (machine) learning, though there are many common elements which allow for cross-pollination of useful ideas from one field to the other, as is shown here. A non-stationary trans-dimensional Gaussian Process (TDGP) is used to parametrize earth properties, and a multichannel stationary TDGP is used to parametrize the length scales associated with the earth property in question. Using non-stationary kernels, that is kernels with spatially variable length scales, models with sharp discontinuities can be represented within this framework. As GPs are multidimensional interpolators, the same theory and computer code can be used to solve geophysical problems in 1-D, 2-D and 3-D. This is demonstrated through a combination of 1-D and 2-D non-linear regression examples and a controlled source electromagnetic field example. The key difference between this and previous work using TDGP is generalized nested inference and the marginalization of prior length scales for better posterior subsurface property characterization. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Although trees compete with crops for soil resources in agroforestry,they can also improve crops' growing conditions, especially, by providing shade under drought. They can promote higher crop yields and higher harvest quality in the drylands. However, the beneficial effect of tree shade may depend on the seasonal pattern of rainfall, which determines the compensation between yield components. In this study, we evaluated two annual crops (durum wheat and faba bean) in olive agroforestry in northern Morocco. We manipulated water supply in a field experiment to span the high inter-annual rainfall variability at the site and tested whether olive trees reduce or improve crop yields. We assessed the effect of water addition on crop growth, yield components, and final yields and estimated the land equivalent ratio of olive agroforestry. Agroforestry limited crop growth and yield whatever the water regime. The magnitude of grain yield reduction was around 50 % for both crops in 2018, probably due to shade. The number of grains per unit area was the most impacted yield component in both 2018 and 2019. In contrast, water addition only had limited effects on faba bean yield, although it enhanced wheat grain yield by 11 % and the number of wheat spikes by 13 %. Agroforestry improved individual grain weight by 39 % for wheat and 17 % for faba bean, and enhanced the protein content of wheat grains and straw by 4 % and 9 %. However, improvements in grain weight and in protein content were not sufficient to compensate for yield loss due to shade. Despite lower crop yields, we show that agroforestry systems are still more land productive than sole crops and trees, even under arid conditions. We show how changing water supply may impact the performance of olive agroforestry in a drier future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Faba bean; Land equivalent ratio; Morocco; Stress-gradient hypothesis; Tree-Crop interactions; Wheat; Yield components","agroforestry; arid environment; compensation; crop yield; legume; performance assessment; protein; water availability; water supply; wheat; Morocco; Elliptio dilatata; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum; Vicia faba",Article,Scopus

In commercial agricultural systems, combine harvesters with onboard yield monitors collect real-time yield data during harvest with high spatial resolution, generating a large ground dataset. Here, we leveraged a yield monitor dataset of over one million maize field observations across the United States Corn Belt from 2008 to 2018 to evaluate the Scalable Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM). SCYM uses region-specific crop model simulations and climate data to interpret vegetation indices from satellite observations, thus enabling efficient sub-field yield estimation across large regions and multiple years without reliance on ground data calibration. We used the ground dataset to compare alternative SCYM model implementations, define minimum required satellite observation criteria, and evaluate the sensitivity of satellite-based yield estimates to on-the-ground variation in management, soil, and annual weather. We found that smoothing annual time series data with harmonic regression increased 30 m pixel-level accuracy from r2 = 0.31 to 0.40 and reduced dependency on specific satellite observation timing, enabling robust yield estimation on 97% of annual maize area using only Landsat data. Agreement improved as the assessment was aggregated to field-level (r2 = 0.45) and county-level (r2 = 0.69) scales, demonstrating the need for fine-resolution ground truth data to better assess sub-field level accuracy in high resolution products. We found that SCYM and ground data showed a similar yield response to management and environmental variation, particularly capturing linear and nonlinear responses to sowing density, soil water holding capacity, and growing season precipitation. However, sensitivity to factors like soil quality and planting date was muted for SCYM estimates compared to ground-based yields. Random forest models were able to match SCYM performance when trained on at least 1000 ground observations, but performed poorly when tested on years and locations not represented in the training data.

However, little is known about interconnections between EMF and taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities of rare and abundant bacteria. Using MiSeq sequencing and multiple statistical analyses, we evaluated the maintenance of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities of rare and abundant bacteria and their contributions to EMF in salinized agricultural soils (0.09 to 19.91 dS/m). Rare bacteria exhibited closer phylogenetic clustering and broader environmental breadths than abundant ones, while abundant bacteria showed higher functional redundancies and stronger phylogenetic signals of ecological preferences than rare ones. Variable selection (86.7%) dominated rare bacterial community assembly, and dispersal limitation (54.7%) and variable selection (24.5%) determined abundant bacterial community assembly. Salinity played a decisive role in mediating the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes and showed significant effects on functions and diversities of both rare and abundant bacteria. Rare bacterial taxonomic a-diversity and abundant bacterial phylogenetic a-diversity contributed significantly to EMF, while abundant bacterial taxonomic a-diversity and rare bacterial phylogenetic a-diversity did not. Additionally, abundant rather than rare bacterial community function had a significant effect on soil EMF. These findings extend our knowledge of environmental adaptation of rare and abundant bacteria and highlight different contributions of taxonomic and phylogenetic a-diversities of rare and abundant bacteria to soil EMF. IMPORTANCE Soil salinization is a worldwide environmental problem and threatens plant productivity and microbial diversity. Understanding the generation and maintenance of microbial diversity is essential to estimate soil tillage potential via investigating ecosystem multifunctionality. Our sequence-based data showed differences in environmental adaptations of rare and abundant bacteria at taxonomic and phylogenetic levels, which led to different contributions of taxonomic and phylogenetic a-diversities of rare and abundant bacteria to soil EMF. Studying the diversity of rare and abundant bacteria and their contributions to EMF in salinized soils is critical for guiding soil restoration.

However, banana productivity generally achieves less than optimal yield potential (<30%) in most regions, including Uganda. Numerous studies have been undertaken to identify the key challenges that smallholder banana growers face at different stages of the banana value chain, with one of the main constraints being a lack of policy-relevant agricultural data. The World Bank (WB) initiated a methodological survey design aimed at identifying the distribution of banana varieties across a number of key Ugandan growing regions, at the individual household scale. To achieve this outcome a number of approaches including ground-based surveys, DNA tissue collection of selected banana plants and remote sensing were evaluated. For the remote sensing component, the set objectives were to develop statistical models from the hyperspectral reflectance properties of individual leaves that could differentiate typical ECA banana varieties, as well as their parentage (usage). The study also explored the potential of extrapolating the ground-based hyperspectral measures to high-resolution WorldView-3 (WV3) satellite imagery, therefore creating the potential of mapping the distribution of banana varieties at a regional scale. The DNA testing of 43 banana varieties propagated at the National Banana Research Program site at National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) research station in Kampala, Uganda, identified 12 genetically different varieties. A canonical powered partial least square (CPPLS) model developed from hyperspectral reflectance properties of the sampled banana leaves successfully differentiated BLU, BOG, GON, GRO and KAY genotypes. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm was also evaluated to determine if spectral bands coinciding with those provided by WV3 data could segregate banana varieties. The results suggested that this was achievable and as such presents an opportunity to extrapolate the hyperspectral classifications to broader areas of land. The ability to spectrally differentiate these five genotypes has merit as they are not typical east African varieties. As such, identifying the distribution and density of these varieties across Uganda provides vital information to the banana breeders of NARO of where their new varieties are being disseminated too, data that has been previously difficult to obtain. Although the results from this pilot study indicated that not all banana varieties could be spectrally differentiated, the methodology developed and the positive results that were achieved do present remote sensing as a complimentary technology to the ongoing surveying of banana and other crop types grown within Ugandan household farming systems. © 2020 The Authors","Agriculture productivity; Banana; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Prediction modelling; Survey design","Agricultural robots; Decision trees; Extrapolation; Plants (botany); Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Software testing; Surveys; Agricultural research; Hyper-spectral classification; Hyperspectral reflectance; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Partial least square (PLS); Research programs; Research stations; Smallholder farmers; Fruits; crop plant; crop yield; cultivar; farming system; genotype; ground-based measurement; in situ measurement; remote sensing; satellite imagery; WorldView; Central Africa; Kampala; Uganda",Article,Scopus

These approaches have found broad acceptance but lack real-time and physiological feedback for near-daily management purposes. This is true for broad-acre crops, such as snap bean, which is valued at hundreds of millions of dollars in the annual agricultural market. We aim to investigate the relationships between snap bean yield and plant spectral and biophysical information, collected using a hyperspectral spectroradiometer (400 to 2500 nm). The experiment focused on 48 single snap bean plants (cv. Huntington) in a controlled greenhouse environment during the growth period (69 days). We used applicable accuracy and precision metrics from partial least squares regression and cross-validation methods to evaluate the predictive ability of two harvest stages, namely an early-harvest and late-harvest stage, against our yield indicator (bean pod weight). Four different spectral data sets were used to investigate whether such oversampled, hyperspectral data sets could accurately and precisely model observed variability in yield, in terms of the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE). The objective of our approach hinges on the philosophy that selected spectral bands from this study, i.e., those that best explain yield variability, can be downsampled from a hyperspectral system for use in a more cost-effective, operational multispectral sensor. Our results suggested the optimal period for spectral evaluation of snap bean yield is 20 to 25 or 32 days prior to harvest for the early- and late-harvest stages, respectively, with the best model performing at a low RMSE (3.02 g plant - 1) and a high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.72). An unmanned aerial systems-mounted, affordable, and wavelength-programmable multispectral imager, with bands corresponding to those identified, could provide a near real-time and reliable yield estimate prior to harvest. © The Authors.

Designing and deploying a WSN is a challenging and multivariate task, dependent on the considered environment. For example, a need for network synchronization arises in such networks to correlate acquired measurements. This work focuses on the design and installation of a WSN that is capable of facilitating the sensing aspects of smart and precision agriculture applications.

Statistical or process-based crop models can be used to quantify how yields will respond to these events and future climate change. However, the accuracy of weather-yield relationships derived from crop models, whether statistical or process-based, is dependent on the quality of the underlying input data used to run these models. In this context, a major challenge in many developing countries is the lack of accessible and reliable meteorological datasets. Gridded weather datasets, derived from combinations of in situ gauges, remote sensing, and climate models, provide a solution to fill this gap, and have been widely used to evaluate climate impacts on agriculture in data-scarce regions worldwide. However, these reference datasets are also known to contain important biases and uncertainties. To date, there has been little research to assess how the choice of reference datasets influences projected sensitivity of crop yields to weather. We compare multiple freely available gridded datasets that provide daily weather data over the Indian sub-continent over the period 1983-2005, and explore their implications for estimates of yield responses to weather variability for key crops grown in the region (wheat and rice). Our results show that individual gridded weather datasets vary in their representation of historic spatial and temporal temperature and precipitation patterns across India. We show that these differences create large uncertainties in estimated crop yield responses and exposure to variability in growing season weather, which in turn, highlights the need for improved consideration of input data uncertainty in statistical studies that explore impacts of climate variability and change on agriculture. © 2019 The Author(s).

Measuring evapotranspiration (ET) and its parameters (stomatal conductance (gs), leaf area index (LAI), canopy temperature (Tc), and soil moisture (SM)) across cropping systems is costly and time-consuming. However, interpretation of remotely-sensed data can facilitate the effective assessment of relative ET demands among competing forest landuses. This study develops and tests geospatial models informed by a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), vegetation vigor index (VVI), and other spectral information to estimate ET and its parameters, which are measured on experimental watersheds with young pines and natural understory (YP), switchgrass only (SG), and young pine intercropped with switchgrass (IC). The treatment watersheds were replicated on three sites located across the Southeastern U.S. in Carteret, NC; Calhoun, MS; and Greene, AL. Despite the growth inconsistency for the SG only treatment, remote modeling estimation of ET parameters yielded an acceptable R2 &gt; 0.70, and the ET model yielded R2 of 0.50 and a standard error of prediction of 0.94. However, ET and ET parameter model estimation for the IC performed somewhat less satisfactorily, with an R2 of 0.47, 0.59, 0.56, 0.81, and 0.57 for ET, LAI, gs, Tc, and SM, respectively, potentially due to inconsistencies in Landsat image pixel size and landuse homogeneity. Moreover, ET parameter models for the YP site performed rather poorly, with R2 = 0.28, 0.63, and 0.76 for LAI, gs, and Tc, respectively. Additionally, image analysis automation was created with Python scripting and geospatial models. The findings from this study suggest that inclusion of more spatial variability, sound data mining, ultra-high resolution imagery and advanced image processing approaches to account for potential modeling uncertainties can enhance the predictive capability of models to remotely estimate environmental parameters including ET. Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) based models provided promising results for estimating ET and ET parameters using remotely-sensed digital information when they are prepared with advanced data mining, but it is likely that laypersons may find these models difficult to use. However, forest managers with access to neural network software can use our devised RBFN training models for estimating those forest hydrologic parameters with better accuracy. © 2019","ArcGIS ModelBuilder; Canopy temperature; Data mining; Evapotranspiration; Landsat; Orthoimagery; Python script; RBFN; Software development; Soil moisture; SPOT; Stomatal conductance; Visual basics studios","Budget control; Computer software; Data mining; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; High level languages; Image enhancement; Personnel training; Radial basis function networks; Remote sensing; Software design; Software engineering; Soil moisture; Uncertainty analysis; Vegetation; Watersheds; ArcGIS ModelBuilder; Canopy temperature; LANDSAT; Orthoimagery; Python script; RBFN; SPOT; Stomatal conductance; Parameter estimation; ArcGIS; automation; coniferous tree; cropping practice; data mining; evapotranspiration; grass; image analysis; image processing; intercropping; Landsat; remote sensing; software; soil moisture; stomatal conductance; Panicum virgatum",Article,Scopus

However, compared to drought impact, the impact of excessive rainfall on crop yield remains unresolved. Here, we present observational evidence from crop yield and insurance data that excessive rainfall can reduce maize yield up to −34% (−17 ± 3% on average) in the United States relative to the expected yield from the long-term trend, comparable to the up to −37% loss by extreme drought (−32 ± 2% on average) from 1981 to 2016. Drought consistently decreases maize yield due to water deficiency and concurrent heat, with greater yield loss for rainfed maize in wetter areas. Excessive rainfall can have either negative or positive impact on crop yield, and its sign varies regionally. Excessive rainfall decreases maize yield significantly in cooler areas in conjunction with poorly drained soils, and such yield loss gets exacerbated under the condition of high preseason soil water storage. Current process-based crop models cannot capture the yield loss from excessive rainfall and overestimate yield under wet conditions.

The emergence of high-resolution images, such as Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, enables the identification of corn at the field scale, and these images can be applied on a large scale with the support of cloud computing technology. Hebei Province is the major production area of corn in China, and faces serious groundwater overexploitation due to irrigation. Corn was mapped using multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. A total of 1712 scenes of Sentinel-2 data and 206 scenes of Sentinel-1 data acquired from June to October 2017 were processed to composite image metrics as input to a random forest (RF) classifier. To avoid speckle noise in the classification results, the pixel-based classification result was integrated with the object segmentation boundary completed in eCognition software to generate an object-based corn map according to crop intensity. The results indicated that the approach using multitemporal SAR and optical images in the GEE cloud platform is reliable for corn mapping. The corn map had a high F1-Score of 90.08% and overall accuracy of 89.89% according to the test dataset, which was not involved in model training. The corn area estimated from optical and SAR images was well correlated with the census data, with an R2 = 0.91 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 470.90 km2.

Low tropics lands cattle, face the challenge to adapt the production systems to the climate change consequences, wich has generated longer dry seasons and more food shortage for the animals during these periods. Objective. The objective of this literature review was to collect and analyze research results on shrubs forage species Tithonia diverfisolia, Gliricidia sepium, Cratylia argentea, and Crescentia cujete as a strategy to improve the nutritional offer in livestock in the low tropics. Development. In Colombia, beef cattle production is mainly located in the low tropics, and usually have feeding problems due to poor grasses quality and low availability in drought period. Silvopastoral systems (SSP) contribute to improve the productive and reproductive performance of cattle, since they integrate trees and/or shrubs, and grasses, combining diverse forage strata, with a greater nutritional and forage offer than conventional systems. The shrubs T. diverfisolia, G. sepium, C. argentea, y C. cujete due to their multipurpose characteristics, biomass production, and adaptation to diverse climatic and edaphic conditions, have been used in grazing, fodder banks, live fences and forage conservation, e.g. silage. Conclusion. Due to their characteristics, uses, biomass production, and nutritional profile, it would be pertinent to evaluate the behavior of these species in feeding strategies in cattle farms under tropics conditions. © 2019 Universidad de Costa Rica.

Production efficiency models (PEMs) estimate Gross Primary Production (GPP) as a function of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy, which is derived from Earth observation. GPP can be summed over the growing season and adjusted by a crop-specific harvest index to estimate yield. Although PEMs have many advantages over other crop yield models, they are not widely used, because performance is relatively poor. Here, a new PEM is presented that addresses deficiencies for macro-scale application: Production Efficiency Model Optimized for Crops (PEMOC). It was developed by optimizing functions from the literature with GPP estimated by eddy covariance flux towers in the United States. The model was evaluated using newly developed Earth observation products and county-level yield statistics for major crops. PEMOC generally performed better at the field and county level than another commonly used PEM, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer GPP (MOD17). PEMOC and MOD17 estimates of GPP had an R2 and root mean squared error (RMSE) over the growing season of 0.71–0.89 (9.87–17.47 g CO2 d−1) and 0.59–0.83 (6.86–22.20 g CO2 d−1) with flux tower GPP. PEMOC produced R2s and RMSE of 0.70 (0.52), 0.60 (0.61), and 0.62 (0.59), while MOD17 produced R2s and RMSE of 0.65 (0.57), 0.53 (0.66), and 0.65 (0.57) with corn, soybean, and winter wheat crop yield anomalies. The sample size of rice was small, so yields were compared directly. PEMOC and MOD17 produced R2s and RMSE of 0.53 (3.42 t ha−1) and 0.40 (4.89 t ha−1). The most sizeable model improvements were seen for C3 and C4 crops during emergence/senescence and peak season, respectively. These improvements were attributed to C3 and C4 partitioning, optimized temperature and moisture constraints, and an evapotranspiration-based soil moisture index. © 2018","Biomass; Earth observation; Evapotranspiration; NPP; WUE","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Efficiency; Evapotranspiration; Macros; Mean square error; Observatories; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Earth observation data; Earth observation products; Earth observations; Fraction of photosynthetically active radiations; Gross primary production; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Physiological informations; Root mean squared errors; Crops; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural modeling; biomass; crop yield; Earth; ecophysiology; eddy covariance; efficiency measurement; estimation method; evapotranspiration; flux measurement; growing season; MODIS; net primary production; optimization; primary production; remote sensing; water use efficiency; United States; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Although water issues alone have not been the sole trigger for warfare in the past, tensions over freshwater management and use represent one of the main concerns in political relations between riparian states and may exacerbate existing tensions, increase regional instability and social unrest. Previous studies made great efforts to understand how international water management problems were addressed by actors in a more cooperative or confrontational way. In this study, we analyze what are the pre-conditions favoring the insurgence of water management issues in shared water bodies, rather than focusing on the way water issues are then managed among actors. We do so by proposing an innovative analysis of past episodes of conflict and cooperation over transboundary water resources (jointly defined as “hydro-political interactions”). On the one hand, we aim at highlighting the factors that are more relevant in determining water interactions across political boundaries. On the other hand, our objective is to map and monitor the evolution of the likelihood of experiencing hydro-political interactions over space and time, under changing socioeconomic and biophysical scenarios, through a spatially explicit data driven index. Historical cross-border water interactions were used as indicators of the magnitude of corresponding water joint-management issues. These were correlated with information about river basin freshwater availability, climate stress, human pressure on water resources, socioeconomic conditions (including institutional development and power imbalances), and topographic characteristics. This analysis allows for identification of the main factors that determine water interactions, such as water availability, population density, power imbalances, and climatic stressors. The proposed model was used to map at high spatial resolution the probability of experiencing hydro-political interactions worldwide. This baseline outline is then compared to four distinct climate and population density projections aimed to estimate trends for hydro-political interactions under future conditions (2050 and 2100), while considering two greenhouse gases emission scenarios (moderate and extreme climate change). The combination of climate and population growth dynamics is expected to impact negatively on the overall hydro-political risk by increasing the likelihood of water interactions in the transboundary river basins, with an average increase ranging between 74.9% (2050 – population and moderate climate change) to 95% (2100 - population and extreme climate change). Future demographic and climatic conditions are expected to exert particular pressure on already water stressed basins such as the Nile, the Ganges/Brahmaputra, the Indus, the Tigris/Euphrates, and the Colorado. The results of this work allow us to identify current and future areas where water issues are more likely to arise, and where cooperation over water should be actively pursued to avoid possible tensions especially under changing environmental conditions.

The paper covers all the methodologies used for various agricultural applications like empirically based models, machine learning based models and radiative transfer theorem based models. A thorough literature review of more than 100 research papers indicates that SAR polarimetry can be used effectively for crop inventory and biophysical parameters estimation such are leaf area index, plant water content, and biomass but shown less sensitivity towards plant height as compared to SAR interferometry. Polarimetric SAR Interferometry is preferable for taking advantage of both SAR polarimetry and SAR interferometry. Numerous studies based upon multi-parametric SAR indicate that optimum selection of SAR sensor parameters enhances SAR sensitivity as a whole for various agricultural applications. It has been observed that researchers are widely using three models such are empirical, machine learning and radiative transfer theorem based models. Machine learning based models are identified as a better approach for crop monitoring using radar remote sensing data. It is expected that the review article will not only generate interest amongst the readers to explore and exploit radar remote sensing for various agricultural applications but also provide a ready reference to the researchers working in this field. © IJASEIT.","Biophysical parameters retrieval; Crop inventory; Polarimetric SAR interferometry (PolInSAR); SAR polarimetry (PolSAR); Synthetic aperture radar (SAR); Synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR)",,Article,Scopus

This work investigates the biophysical and hydrological effects of future climate change, including trends in CO2, in the St. Joseph River watershed, Eastern Corn Belt. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was first modified to take dynamic CO2 concentration as input. A regional crop leaf development curve from Landsat TM imagery was also used to adjust model performance in corn leaf area development for the historical period. A multi-objective calibration strategy was employed to ensure acceptable simulation of streamflow, seasonal crop growth and interannual crop yield simultaneously. The model was then driven by future climate change and CO2 data from three Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs), which are GFDL-CM2.1.1, NCAR-PCM1.3, and UKMO-HADCM3.1, under three Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES), including B1, A1 B and A2 to investigate crop and streamflow response in two future periods: the near future (2021–2050) and the far future (2061–2090). The St. Joseph River watershed is expected to experience more winter and spring precipitation, but slightly decreasing summer precipitation. Due to increasing temperature and decreasing summer moisture, more drought stress is predicted. Both annual total aeration and drought stress are projected to be more variable in both future periods. Although future CO2 enhancement will benefit the crop growth and final yield by improving radiation use efficiency (RUE) and reducing drought stresses, simulated corn yield still decreased by 6% in the near future period, and 16% in the far future period due to the combined effect of both climate change and CO2 enhancement. Streamflow redistribution is also predicted in the future. Stream discharge is projected to increase for the whole flow range in the near future period. For the far future period, high flows are expected to decrease, while low flows are expected to increase, indicating more hydrologic drought and flood events in the St. Joseph River watershed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; CO2; Crop modeling; Hydrology; SWAT","Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Crops; Drought; Floods; Hydrology; Moisture; Plants (botany); Rivers; Stream flow; Watersheds; Atmosphere ocean general circulation models; Crop model; Increasing temperatures; Multi-objective calibration; Radiation use efficiency; Soil and water assessment tool; Special report on emissions scenarios; SWAT; Climate change; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

In the Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB), complex hydrological models have been applied at various scales to help describe relationships between land use and water, nutrient, and sediment dynamics. This manuscript evaluated the capacity of the current Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to predict hydrological and water quality processes within WLEB at the finest resolution watershed boundary unit (NHDPlus) along with the current conditions and conservation scenarios. The process based SWAT model was capable of the fine-scale computation and complex routing used in this project, as indicated by measured data at five gaging stations. The level of detail required for fine-scale spatial simulation made the use of both hard and soft data necessary in model calibration, alongside other model adaptations. Limitations to the model's predictive capacity were due to a paucity of data in the region at the NHDPlus scale rather than due to SWAT functionality. Results of treatment scenarios demonstrate variable effects of structural practices and nutrient management on sediment and nutrient loss dynamics. Targeting treatment to acres with critical outstanding conservation needs provides the largest return on investment in terms of nutrient loss reduction per dollar spent, relative to treating acres with lower inherent nutrient loss vulnerabilities. Importantly, this research raises considerations about use of models to guide land management decisions at very fine spatial scales. Decision makers using these results should be aware of data limitations that hinder fine-scale model interpretation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation practice; Lake Erie; Model calibration; NHDPlus model; Soft data; Swat-SAS","Economics; Gaging; Lakes; Land use; Nutrients; Soil conservation; Water quality; Watersheds; Conservation practices; Lake Erie; Model calibration; Soft data; Swat-SAS; Decision making; conservation management; hydrological modeling; spatial data; water quality; watershed; Article; calibration; environmental protection; hydrology; land use; nutrient; priority journal; river basin; sediment; simulation; validation process; water quality; watershed; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Erie",Article,Scopus

Particularly in regions that experience seasonal water scarcity, land use scenario assessments provide a valuable basis for the evaluation of possible future water shortages. The objective of this study is to dynamically integrate land use model projections with a hydrologic model to analyze potential future impacts of land use change on the water resources of a rapidly developing catchment upstream of Pune, India. For the first time projections from the urban growth and land use change model SLEUTH are employed as a dynamic input to the hydrologic model SWAT. By this means, impacts of land use changes on the water balance components are assessed for the near future (2009-2028) employing four different climate conditions (baseline, IPCC A1B, dry, wet). The land use change modeling results in an increase of urban area by + 23.1% at the fringes of Pune and by + 12.2% in the upper catchment, whereas agricultural land (- 14.0% and - 0.3%, respectively) and semi-natural area (- 9.1% and - 11.9%, respectively) decrease between 2009 and 2028. Under baseline climate conditions, these land use changes induce seasonal changes in the water balance components. Water yield particularly increases at the onset of monsoon (up to + 11.0 mm per month) due to increased impervious area, whereas evapotranspiration decreases in the dry season (up to - 15.1 mm per month) as a result of the loss of irrigated agricultural area. As the projections are made for the near future (2009-2028) land use change impacts are similar under IPCC A1B climate conditions. Only if more extreme dry years occur, an exacerbation of the land use change impacts can be expected. Particularly in rapidly changing environments an implementation of both dynamic land use change and climate change seems favorable to assess seasonal and gradual changes in the water balance. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Hydrologic modeling; India; Land use change; SLEUTH; SWAT","Agriculture; Catchments; Land use; Runoff; Urban growth; Water resources; Water supply; Hydrologic modeling; India; Land-use change; SLEUTH; SWAT; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; hydrological modeling; land cover; land use change; urban growth; water budget; water resource; agricultural land; Article; catchment; climate change; dry season; dynamics; environmental change; environmental impact; evapotranspiration; fluid balance; hydrology; India; irrigation (agriculture); land use; priority journal; season; seasonal variation; statistical model; urban area; urbanization; water supply; India; Maharashtra; Pune",Article,Scopus

However, the rapidly growing acreage of these crops, new legislations, the necessity of minimizing the environmental footprint, and a cost-effective production demand certain managerial practices based on precision agriculture and remote sensing, which have shown promising results in food production. Scope and approach: This paper presents a comprehensive review of remote sensing platforms, sensors, applications, and analytic pipelines with a focus on nut crops, even though the materials are applicable for other specialty crops. In this regard, the paper is divided into five main sections: First, the problems and potential solutions are elaborated in the introduction. Second, the available platforms: satellites, manned aircraft, and UASs are discussed. Then the sensors used for remote sensing, their working principle, and the pros and cons of each are presented. Next, practiced and suggested applications of remote sensing data are reviewed. Finally, data processing and analytics needed to produce and interpret reliable results are highlighted. Key findings and conclusions: Key findings are listed as: 1) The acreage of the nut orchards and the purpose of the studies determine the fitting sensor and platform. 2) Although various sensors are available and reported to have promising results in other crops, they have not been used for nut crops. 3) Accurate sensor calibration is crucial for repeatable results as well as temporal and inter-field comparisons. 4) Except for water management, most remote sensing applications are limitedly studied in nut orchards, creating some research opportunities. 5) Finally, increasing data size requires new machine learning techniques and data fusion frameworks to handle all variables and fill the knowledge gap. © 2022 The Authors","Nut crops; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial systems (UAS)","Antennas; Cost effectiveness; Data handling; Learning systems; Orchards; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Water management; Nut crop; Platform sensors; Precision Agriculture; Protein contents; Remote sensing applications; Remote sensing platforms; Remote sensing sensors; Remote-sensing; Unmanned aerial system; Unmanned aerial systems; Crops; calibration; data processing; machine learning; nut; precision agriculture; remote sensing; sensor; unmanned vehicle; United States",Review,Scopus

Forecast performance needs to be investigated over space and time before practical applications. We assess seasonal forecast performance (skill, probability and accuracy) in predicting flowering and veraison stages of two representative varieties in Portugal over 1993–2017. The state-of-the-art forecast system ECMWF-SEAS5 provides 7-month seasonal forecasts and is coupled with a locally adapted phenology model. Overall, findings illustrate the dependence of forecast performance on initialization timings, regions and predicting subjects (stages and varieties). Forecast performance improves by delaying the initialization timing and only forecasts initialized on April 1st show better skills than climatology on predicting phenology terciles (early/normal/late). The considerable bias of daily values of seasonal climate predictions can represent the main barrier to accurate forecasts. Better prediction performance is consistently found in Central-Southern regions compared to Northern regions, attributing to an earlier phenology occurrence with a shorter forecast length. Comparable predictive skills between flowering and veraison for both varieties imply better predictability in summer. Consequently, promising seasonal phenology predictions are foreseen in Central-Southern wine regions using forecasts initialized on April 1st with approximately 1–2/3–4 months lead time for flowering/veraison: potential prediction errors are ∼2 weeks, along with an overall moderate forecast skill on categorical events. However, considerable inter-annual variability of forecast performance over the same classified phenology years reflects the substantial influence of climate variability. This may represent the main challenge for reliable forecasts in Mediterranean regions. Recommendations are suggested for methodological innovations and practical applications towards reliable regional phenology forecasts. © 2023 The Author(s)","Climate risk; Forecast performance; Mediterranean climate; Phenology forecast; Phenology modelling; Seasonal climate forecast","climatology; flowering; forecasting method; phenology; seasonal variation; viticulture; Portugal",Article,Scopus

So far, climate change impacts on agriculture for the basin have mostly been assessed for single-cropping systems, which may bias the results considering that the basin is dominated by different cropping systems, with about one-third of the crop area under double cropping. In this study, we simulate single- and double-cropping systems in the Nile basin and assess the climate change impacts on different cropping systems under two scenarios, i.e. “no adaptation” and “adaptation to a late-maturing cultivar”. We find that the mean crop yields of maize, soybean and wheat decrease with future warming without cultivar adaptation. We attribute this to the shortening of the growing season due to increased temperature. The decrease is stronger in all single-cropping systems (12.6–45.5%) than in double-cropping systems (5.9–26.6%). The relative magnitude of yield reduction varies spatially with the greatest reduction in the northern part of the basin experiencing the strongest warming. In a scenario with cultivar adaptation, mean crop yields show a stronger increase in double-cropping systems (14.4–35.2%) than single-cropping systems (8.3–13.7%). In this scenario, farmers could possibly benefit from increasing cropping intensities while adapting to late-maturing cultivars. This study underscores the importance of accounting for multiple-cropping systems in agricultural assessments under climate change within the Nile basin. © 2022, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Agriculture; Climate change; Multiple cropping; Nile basin",,Article,Scopus

The development of salt-tolerant genotypes is critical for mitigating yield losses, and this journey begins with the identification of sensitive and tolerant plants. Numerous physiologic and molecular markers for detecting salt-tolerant wheat genotypes have been developed. One of them is proline, which has been used for a long time but has received little information about proline-related genes in wheat genotypes. In this study, proline content and the expression levels of proline-related genes (TaPTF1, TaDHN, TaSRG, TaSC, TaPIMP1, TaMIP, TaHKT1;4, TaGSK, TaP5CS, and TaMYB) were examined in sensitive, moderate, and tolerant genotypes under salt stress (0, 50, 150, and 250 mM NaCl) for 0, 12, and 24 h. Our results show that salt stress increased the proline content in all genotypes, but it was found higher in salt-tolerant genotypes than in moderate and sensitive genotypes. The salinity stress increased gene expression levels in salt-tolerant and moderate genotypes. While salt-stress exposure for 12 and 24 h had a substantial effect on gene expression in wheat, TaPTF1, TaPIMP1, TaMIP, TaHKT1;4, and TaMYB genes were considerably upregulated in 24 h. The salt-tolerant genotypes showed a higher positive interaction than a negative interaction. The TaPTF1, TaP5CS, TaGSK1, and TaSRG genes were found to be more selective than the other analyzed genes under salt-stress conditions. Despite each gene’s specific function, increasing proline biosynthesis functioned as a common mechanism for separating salt tolerance from sensitivity. © 2022 by the authors.","correlation network analysis; gene expression; proline-related genes; qRT-PCR; salt stress",,Article,Scopus

Recent advances in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and development of sensors have opened a new avenue for data acquisition cost-effectively and rapidly. We evaluated UAV-based multispectral and thermal images for in-season GY prediction using 30 winter wheat genotypes under 3 water treatments. For this, multispectral vegetation indices (VIs) and normalized relative canopy temperature (NRCT) were calculated and selected by the gray relational analysis (GRA) at each growth stage, i.e., jointing, booting, heading, flowering, grain filling, and maturity to reduce the data dimension. The elastic net regression (ENR) was developed by using selected features as input variables for yield prediction, whereas the entropy weight fusion (EWF) method was used to combine the predicted GY values from multiple growth stages. In our results, the fusion of dual-sensor data showed high yield prediction accuracy [coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.527–0.667] compared to using a single multispectral sensor (R2 = 0.130–0.461). Results showed that the grain filling stage was the optimal stage to predict GY with R2 = 0.667, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.881 t ha–1, relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) = 15.2%, and mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.721 t ha–1. The EWF model outperformed at all the individual growth stages with R2 varying from 0.677 to 0.729. The best prediction result (R2 = 0.729, RMSE = 0.831 t ha–1, RRMSE = 14.3%, and MAE = 0.684 t ha–1) was achieved through combining the predicted values of all growth stages. This study suggests that the fusion of UAV-based multispectral and thermal IR data within an ENR-EWF framework can provide a precise and robust prediction of wheat yield.

However, empirical evidence regarding the effects of extreme weather conditions on crop yields remains incomplete. We examine the contribution of climate and weather to winter wheat yields in Ukraine, a leading crop exporter with some of the highest yield variabilities observed globally. We used machine learning to link daily climatic data with annual winter wheat yields from 1985 to 2018. We differentiated the impacts of long-term climatic conditions (e.g., temperature) and weather extremes (e.g., heat waves) on yields during the distinct developmental stages of winter wheat. Our results suggest that climatic and weather variables alone explained 54% of the wheat yield variability at the country level. Heat waves, tropical night waves, frost, and drought conditions, particularly during the reproductive and grain filling phase, constitute key factors that compromised wheat yields in Ukraine. Assessing the impacts of weather extremes on crop yields is urgent to inform strategies that help cushion farmers against growing production risks because these extremes will likely become more frequent and intense with climate change. © 2021, The Author(s).","Agriculture; Climatic change; Extreme events; Random forests; Ukraine; Yield variability","Climate change; Decision trees; Machine learning; Risk assessment; Climatic changes; Crop yield; Developmental stage; Extreme events; Heatwaves; Ukraine; Weather extremes; Wheat yield; Winter wheat yields; Yield variability; Crops; climate change; crop yield; drought; machine learning; weather forecasting; wheat; Ukraine",Article,Scopus

The CALCINEURIN B-LIKE PROTEIN (CBL) is a vital family of plant calcium sensor proteins that can transmit Ca2+ signals triggered by environmental stimuli including salt stress. Therefore, assessing the potential of NtCBL for genetic improvement of salt stress is valuable. In our studies on NtCBL members, constitutive overexpression of NtCBL5A was found to cause salt supersensitivity with necrotic lesions on leaves. NtCBL5A-overexpressing (OE) leaves tended to curl and accumulated high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under salt stress. The supersensitivity of NtCBL5A-OE leaves was specifically induced by Na+, but not by Cl−, osmotic stress, or drought stress. Ion content measurements indicated that NtCBL5A-OE leaves showed sensitivity to the Na+ accumulation levels that wild-type leaves could tolerate. Furthermore, transcriptome profiling showed that many immune response-related genes are significantly upregulated and photosynthetic machinery-related genes are significantly downregulated in salt-stressed NtCBL5A-OE leaves. In addition, the expression of several cation homeostasis-related genes was also affected in salt-stressed NtCBL5A-OE leaves. In conclusion, the constitutive overexpression of NtCBL5A interferes with the normal salt stress response of tobacco plants and leads to Na+-dependent leaf necrosis by enhancing the sensitivity of transgenic leaves to Na+. This Na+ sensitivity of NtCBL5A-OE leaves might result from the abnormal Na+ compartmentalization, plant photosynthesis, and plant immune response triggered by the constitutive overexpression of NtCBL5A. Identifying genes and pathways involved in this unusual salt stress response can provide new insights into the salt stress response of tobacco plants. © Copyright © 2021 Mao, Yuan, Mo, An, Shi, Visser, Bai, Sun, Liu, Liu, Wang and van der Linden.","CBL PROTEIN; immune response; Na+; necrotic lesions; photosystem; reactive oxygen species; salt stress; tobacco",,Article,Scopus

The effect of distance to trees in alley cropping AFS on yield‐related crop parameters has predominantly been studied using point data from transects. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a novel possibility to map plant traits with high spatial resolution and coverage. In the present study, UAV‐borne red, green, blue (RGB) and multispectral imagery was utilized for the prediction of whole crop dry biomass yield (DM) and leaf area index (LAI) of barley at three different conventionally managed silvoarable alley cropping agroforestry sites located in Germany. DM and LAI were modelled using random forest regression models with good accuracies (DM: R² 0.62, nRMSEp 14.9%, LAI: R² 0.92, nRMSEp 7.1%). Important variables for prediction included normalized reflectance, vegetation indices, texture and plant height. Maps were produced from model predictions for spatial analysis, showing significant effects of distance to trees on DM and LAI. Spatial patterns differed greatly between the sampled sites and suggested management and soil effects overriding tree effects across large portions of 96 m wide crop alleys, thus questioning alleged impacts of AFS tree rows on yield distribution in in-tensively managed barley populations. Models based on UAV‐borne imagery proved to be a valu-able novel tool for prediction of DM and LAI at high accuracies, revealing spatial variability in AFS with high spatial resolution and coverage. © 2021 by the authors.

As a rapid and nondestructive approach, the analysis of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based imagery may be of assistance to estimate N and height. The main objective of this study is to present an approach to predict leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC, g kg−1) and PH (m) with machine learning techniques and UAV-based multispectral imagery in maize plants. An experiment with 11 maize cultivars under two rates of N fertilization was carried during the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 crop seasons. The spectral vegetation indices (VI) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference red-edge index (NDRE), green normalized difference vegetation (GNDVI), and the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) were extracted from the images and, in a computational system, used alongside the spectral bands as input parameters for different machine learning models. A randomized 10-fold cross-validation strategy, with a total of 100 replicates, was used to evaluate the performance of 9 supervised machine learning (ML) models using the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of regression (R2), and root mean square error (RMSE) metrics. The results indicated that the random forest (RF) algorithm performed better, with r and RMSE, respectively, of 0.91 and 1.9 g.kg−1 for LNC, and 0.86 and 0.17 m for PH. It was also demonstrated that VIs contributed more to the algorithm’s performances than individual spectral bands. This study concludes that the RF model is appropriate to predict both agronomic variables in maize and may help farmers to monitor their plants based upon their LNC and PH diagnosis and use this knowledge to improve their production rates in the subsequent seasons. © 2020 by the authors.

The sensitivities of Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model were tested for changes in horizontal resolution (convection permitting versus parameterized) on the replication of West African monsoon for the year 2014. Sensitivity test was also performed for response of rainfall to changes in microphysics (MP) and planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes. Generally, the result shows that WRF is able to replicates rainfall distribution with an adequate representation of the dynamical features of West African monsoon system. The high-resolution (wrf-4km) shows dry bias along the coast of the Gulf of Guinea but generally outperforms wrf-24km run especially in replication of the extreme rainfall distribution. The dry bias along the coastal area is suggested to not to be only related to convection but mostly to microphysics and PBL parameterisation schemes. Differences were noticed between the dynamics of WRF and ERA-interim outputs despite the use of spectral nudging in the experiment which then suggest strong interactions between scales. These differences were observed to be restricted mainly to the low-layer monsoon flow in JJA. Both runs at 24 and 4 km hardly simulate the typical diurnal distribution of rainfall. The sensitivity of WRF to MP (only sophisticated MP were tested) and PBL reveals a stronger impact of PBL than MP on rainfall distribution and the most significant added value over the Guinean coast and surroundings area was provided by the configurations using non-local PBL scheme (as ACM2). The changes in MP and PBL schemes in general seem to have less effect on the explicit runs (wrf-4km) in the replication of the rainfall over the Gulf of Guinea and the surroundings seaboard. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Convection permitting; High resolution; Parameterization; Rainfall; West Africa monsoon; WRF","atmospheric convection; climate modeling; climate variation; computer simulation; extreme event; monsoon; rainfall; regional climate; spatial distribution; Atlantic Ocean; Guinea; Gulf of Guinea",Article,Scopus

As opposed to waiting until the harvest season, multispectral imagery using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are capable of measuring the canopy metrics and vegetation indices (VIs) traits at different time points of the growth cycle. This resourceful time series aerial image processing with appropriate analytical framework is very important for the automatic extraction of phenotypic features from the image data. Many studies have demonstrated the usefulness of advanced remote sensing technologies coupled with machine learning (ML) approaches for accurate prediction of valuable crop traits. Until now, Cassava has received little to no attention in aerial image-based phenotyping and ML model testing. Results: To accelerate image processing, an automated image-analysis framework called CIAT Pheno-i was developed to extract plot level vegetation indices/canopy metrics. Multiple linear regression models were constructed at different key growth stages of cassava, using ground-truth data and vegetation indices obtained from a multispectral sensor. Henceforth, the spectral indices/features were combined to develop models and predict cassava root yield using different Machine learning techniques. Our results showed that (1) Developed CIAT pheno-i image analysis framework was found to be easier and more rapid than manual methods. (2) The correlation analysis of four phenological stages of cassava revealed that elongation (EL) and late bulking (LBK) were the most useful stages to estimate above-ground biomass (AGB), below-ground biomass (BGB) and canopy height (CH). (3) The multi-temporal analysis revealed that cumulative image feature information of EL + early bulky (EBK) stages showed a higher significant correlation (r = 0.77) for Green Normalized Difference Vegetation indices (GNDVI) with BGB than individual time points. Canopy height measured on the ground correlated well with UAV (CHuav)-based measurements (r = 0.92) at late bulking (LBK) stage. Among different image features, normalized difference red edge index (NDRE) data were found to be consistently highly correlated (r = 0.65 to 0.84) with AGB at LBK stage. (4) Among the four ML algorithms used in this study, k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) showed the best performance for root yield prediction with the highest accuracy of R2 = 0.67, 0.66 and 0.64, respectively. Conclusion: UAV platforms, time series image acquisition, automated image analytical framework (CIAT Pheno-i), and key vegetation indices (VIs) to estimate phenotyping traits and root yield described in this work have great potential for use as a selection tool in the modern cassava breeding programs around the world to accelerate germplasm and varietal selection.

Although the potential effects of each of these factors have been discussed in a number of separate studies, no recent synthesis has been published to provide quantitative estimates of climate change impacts on crop yields, with or without adaptation strategies. In this paper, we synthetize a broad range of experimental or modeling studies to estimate, at the global scale, crop yield changes resulting from the marginal and combined effects of temperature, CO2 concentration and precipitation, with and without adaptation strategies. Crop yield sensitivities are estimated by distinguishing between C3 and C4 crops. For C3 crops, our results show that the positive effects of adaptation (+7.25 %) and CO2 (+9% for +100 ppm) are high enough to offset the negative effects of temperature increase (-2.4 % for +1 °C), even at +4 °C. On the other hand, for maize (i.e., the only C4 plant species in our database) the somewhat low positive effect from increased CO2 concentration and the absence of a significant effect of adaptation lead to higher yield losses, in the order of -10 % for +4 °C. The minimum level of CO2 concentration increase requested to achieve a yield gain under increased temperature conditions is much higher for maize than for C3 crops, in particular for wheat. The estimated effects of adaptation are uncertain, especially for soybean and rice, but also for maize, where the absence of a significant adaptation effect is probably at least partly due to limited data availability. Our results demonstrate that CO2 effects on crop yields should not be overlooked in foresight studies on the impacts of climate change. Our analysis also highlights the importance of improving our knowledge of how effective adapation strategies are in mitigating the impact of climate change. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; CO2; Ensemble modelling; Meta-analysis; Yield","adaptive management; agricultural modeling; C4 plant; carbon dioxide; climate change; crop plant; crop yield; global perspective; meta-analysis; rainfall; strategic approach; temperature effect; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

However, the key genetic components responsible for the reduction in cotton yield in saline-Alkali soils are still unclear. Results: Here, we evaluated three main components of lint yield, single boll weight (SBW), lint percentage (LP) and boll number per plant (BNPP), across 316 G. hirsutum accessions under four salt conditions over two years. Phenotypic analysis indicated that LP was unchanged under different salt conditions, however BNPP decreased significantly and SBW increased slightly under high salt conditions. Based on 57,413 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis, a total of 42, 91 and 25 stable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified for SBW, LP and BNPP, respectively. Phenotypic and QTL analysis suggested that there was little correlation among the three traits. For LP, 8 stable QTLs were detected simultaneously in four different salt conditions, while fewer repeated QTLs for SBW or BNPP were identified. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated that their regulatory mechanisms were also quite different. Via transcriptome profile data, we detected that 10 genes from the 8 stable LP QTLs were predominantly expressed during fiber development. Further, haplotype analyses found that a MYB gene (GhMYB103), with the two SNP variations in cis-regulatory and coding regions, was significantly correlated with lint percentage, implying a crucial role in lint yield. We also identified that 40 candidate genes from BNPP QTLs were salt-inducible. Genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and cell structure maintenance were rich in plants grown in high salt conditions, while genes related to ion transport were active in plants grown in low salt conditions, implying different regulatory mechanisms for BNPP at high and low salt conditions. Conclusions: This study provides a foundation for elucidating cotton salt tolerance mechanisms and contributes gene resources for developing upland cotton varieties with high yields and salt stress tolerance. © 2020 The Author(s).","Boll number per plant; Boll weight per plant; Genome-wide association study; Gossypium hirsutum; Lint percentage; Salt stress; Transcriptome analysis","analysis; anatomy and histology; chemistry; cotton; genetic variation; genetics; genome-wide association study; Gossypium; salinity; soil; Cotton Fiber; Genetic Variation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Gossypium; Salinity; Soil",Article,Scopus

As an alternative to the susceptible-infected-resistant (SIR)-based models, this study proposes a hybrid machine learning approach to predict the COVID-19, and we exemplify its potential using data from Hungary. The hybrid machine learning methods of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multi-layered perceptron-imperialist competitive algorithm (MLP-ICA) are proposed to predict time series of infected individuals and mortality rate. The models predict that by late May, the outbreak and the total morality will drop substantially. The validation is performed for 9 days with promising results, which confirms the model accuracy. It is expected that the model maintains its accuracy as long as no significant interruption occurs.

Nondestructive crop growth monitoring based on remote sensing technologies can accurately assess crop N status, which may be used to guide the in-season site-specific N recommendations. The fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing is a low-cost, easy-to-operate technology for collecting spectral reflectance imagery, an important data source for precision N management. The relationships between many vegetation indices (VIs) derived from spectral reflectance data and crop parameters are known to be nonlinear. As a result, nonlinear machine learning methods have the potential to improve the estimation accuracy. The objective of this study was to evaluate five different approaches for estimating rice (Oryza sativa L.) aboveground biomass (AGB), plant N uptake (PNU), and N nutrition index (NNI) at stem elongation (SE) and heading (HD) stages in Northeast China: (1) single VI (SVI); (2) stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR); (3) random forest (RF); (4) support vector machine (SVM); and (5) artificial neural networks (ANN) regression. The results indicated that machine learning methods improved the NNI estimation compared to VI-SLR and SMLR methods. The RF algorithm performed the best for estimating NNI (R2 = 0.94 (SE) and 0.96 (HD) for calibration and 0.61 (SE) and 0.79 (HD) for validation). The root mean square errors (RMSEs) were 0.09, and the relative errors were &lt;10% in all the models. It is concluded that the RF machine learning regression can significantly improve the estimation of rice N status using UAV remote sensing. The application machine learning methods offers a new opportunity to better use remote sensing data for monitoring crop growth conditions and guiding precision crop management. More studies are needed to further improve these machine learning-based models by combining both remote sensing data and other related soil, weather, and management information for applications in precision N and crop management. © 2020 by the authors.","Fixed-wing UAV remote sensing; Machine learning; Nitrogen status diagnosis; Precision nitrogen management; Random forest","Antennas; Crops; Decision trees; Fixed wings; Food supply; Linear regression; Mean square error; Neural networks; Nitrogen; Nutrition; Random forests; Reflection; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Machine learning methods; Nitrogen management; Nitrogen status; Remote sensing technology; Root mean square errors; Stepwise multiple linear regression; Sustainable agricultural development; UAV remote sensing; Learning systems",Article,Scopus

Random forest (RF), artificial neural networks (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machines (SVM) were used to develop models. Training and validation of these models were conducted using in-situ observations from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) from 2001 to 2016. The rule of the traditional Köppen-Geiger (K-G) climate classification was used to classify climate regions. The input variables were land surface temperature (LST) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), monthly precipitation data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 product, and the Digital Elevation Map (DEM) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The overall accuracy (OA) based on validation data from 2001 to 2016 for all models was high over 95%. DEM and minimum winter temperature were two distinct variables over the study area with particularly high relative importance. ANN produced more realistic spatial distribution of the classified climates despite having a slightly lower OA than the others. The accuracy of the models using high altitudinal in-situ data of the Mountain Meteorology Observation System (MMOS) was also assessed. Although the data length of the MMOS data was relatively short (2013 to 2017), it proved that the snowy, dry and cold winter and cool summer class (Dwc) is widely located in the eastern coastal region of South Korea. Temporal shifting of climate was examined through a comparison of climate maps produced by period: from 1950 to 2000, from 1983 to 2000, and from 2001 to 2013. A shrinking trend of snow classes (D) over the Korean Peninsula was clearly observed from the ANN-based climate classification results. Shifting trends of climate with the decrease/increase of snow (D)/temperate (C) classes were clearly shown in the maps produced using the proposed approaches, consistent with the results from the reanalysis data of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC). © 2019 Park et al.

Best management practices implemented to improve water quality have met with limited success. Such lack of success is increasingly attributed to legacy nutrient stores in the subsurface that may act as sources after reduction of external inputs. However, current water-quality models lack a framework to capture these legacy effects. Here we have modified the SWAT (Soil Water Assessment Tool) model to capture the effects of nitrogen (N) legacies on water quality under multiple land-management scenarios. Our new SWAT-LAG model includes (1) a modified carbon-nitrogen cycling module to capture the dynamics of soil N accumulation, and (2) a groundwater travel time distribution module to capture a range of subsurface travel times. Using a 502-km2 Iowa watershed as a case study, we found that between 1950 and 2016, 25% of the total watershed N surplus (N Deposition + Fertilizer + Manure + N Fixation − Crop N uptake) had accumulated within the root zone, 14% had accumulated in groundwater, while 27% was lost as riverine output, and 34% was denitrified. In future scenarios, a 100% reduction in fertilizer application led to a 79% reduction in stream N load, but the SWAT-LAG results suggest that it would take 84 years to achieve this reduction, in contrast to the 2 years predicted in the original SWAT model. The framework proposed here constitutes a first step toward modifying a widely used modeling approach to assess the effects of legacy N on the time required to achieve water-quality goals. ©2019.

This function is defined as the capacity of a soil to supply nutrients and water and to produce plant biomass for human use, providing food, feed, fiber, and fuel. For farmers, the productivity function delivers an economic basis and is a prerequisite for agricultural sustainability. Our study was designed to develop an agricultural primary productivity decision support model. To obtain a highly accurate decision support model that helps farmers and advisors to assess and manage the provision of the primary productivity soil function on their agricultural fields, we addressed the following specific objectives: (i) to construct a qualitative decision support model to assess the primary productivity soil function at the agricultural field level; (ii) to carry out verification, calibration, and sensitivity analysis of this model; and (iii) to validate the model based on empirical data. The result is a hierarchical qualitative model consisting of 25 input attributes describing soil properties, environmental conditions, cropping specifications, and management practices on each respective field. An extensive dataset from France containing data from 399 sites was used to calibrate and validate the model. The large amount of data enabled data mining to support model calibration. The accuracy of the decision support model prior to calibration supported by data mining was ~40%. The data mining approach improved the accuracy to 77%. The proposed methodology of combining decision modeling and data mining proved to be an important step forward. This iterative approach yielded an accurate, reliable, and useful decision support model for the assessment of the primary productivity soil function at the field level. This can assist farmers and advisors in selecting the most appropriate crop management practices. Embedding this decision support model in a set of complementary models for four adjacent soil functions, as endeavored in the H2020 LANDMARK project, will help take the integrated sustainability of arable cropping systems to a new level. © 2019 Sandén, Trajanov, Spiegel, Kuzmanovski, Saby, Picaud, Henriksen and Debeljak.","Agricultural decision-making; Data mining; Decision support model; Expert knowledge; Soil functions; Yield",,Article,Scopus

The West African population is expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years. The responses of crops to short-term climate change is critical to the population and the decision makers tasked with food security. This leads to three questions: how will crop yields change in the near future? What influence will climate change have on crop failures? Which adaptation methods should be employed to ameliorate undesirable changes? An ensemble of near-term climate projections are used to simulate maize, millet and sorghum in West Africa in the recent historic period (1986-2005) and a near-term future when global temperatures are 1.5K above pre-industrial levels to assess the change in yield, yield variability and crop failure rate. Four crop models were used to simulate maize, millet and sorghum in West Africa in the historic and future climates. Across the majority of West Africa the maize, millet and sorghum yields are shown to fall. In the regions where yields increase, the variability also increases. This increase in variability increases the likelihood of crop failures, which are defined as yield negative anomalies beyond 1 standard deviation during the historic period. The increasing variability increases the frequency of crop failures across West Africa. The return time of crop failures falls from 8.8, 9.7 and 10.1 years to 5.2, 6.3 and 5.8 years for maize, millet and sorghum respectively. The adoption of heat-resistant cultivars and the use of captured rainwater have been investigated using one crop model as an idealized sensitivity test. The generalized doption of a cultivar resistant to high-temperature stress during flowering is shown to be more beneficial than using rainwater harvesting. © Author(s) 2018.",,"Agriculture; Climate models; Crops; Decision making; Failure analysis; Food supply; Adaptation methods; Climate projection; Global temperatures; High temperature stress; Pre-industrial levels; Rain water harvesting; Short-term climate changes; Standard deviation; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; decision making; food security; high temperature; maize; millet; sorghum; temperature effect; West Africa; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The adoption of corn stover removal, switchgrass, and/or Miscanthus biofuel cropping systems was simulated to assess the impact of cellulosic biofuel production on pollutant losses. The stover removal results indicate removal of 20 or 50% of corn stover in the BRW would have negligible effects on streamflow and relatively minor or negligible effects on sediment and nutrient losses, even on higher sloped cropland. Complete cropland conversion into switchgrass or Miscanthus, resulted in reductions of streamflow, sediment, nitrate, and other pollutants ranging between 23-99%. The predicted nitrate reductions due to Miscanthus adoption were over two times greater compared to switchgrass, with the largest impacts occurring for tile-drained cropland. Targeting of switchgrass or Miscanthus on cropland ≥2% slope or ≥7% slope revealed a disproportionate amount of sediment and sediment-bound nutrient reductions could be obtained by protecting these relatively small areas of higher sloped cropland. Overall, the results indicate that all biofuel cropping systems could be effectively implemented in the BRW, with the most robust approach being corn stover removal adopted on tile-drained cropland in combination with a perennial biofuel crop on higher sloped landscapes.

However, extracting patterns and features from this large corpus of data requires the use of machine learning (ML) tools to enable data assimilation and feature identification for stress phenotyping. Four stages of the decision cycle in plant stress phenotyping and plant breeding activities where different ML approaches can be deployed are (i) identification, (ii) classification, (iii) quantification, and (iv) prediction (ICQP). We provide here a comprehensive overview and user-friendly taxonomy of ML tools to enable the plant community to correctly and easily apply the appropriate ML tools and best-practice guidelines for various biotic and abiotic stress traits. High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) has unlocked new prospects for non-destructive field-based phenotyping. Autonomous, semi-autonomous, or manual platforms equipped with single or multiple sensors collect spatial and temporal data, resulting in massive amounts of data for analysis and storage.The enormous volume, variety, and velocity of HTP data generated by such platforms make it a 'big data' problem. Big data generated by these near real-time platforms must be efficiently archived and retrieved for analysis. The analysis and interpretation of these large datasets is quite challenging.Sophisticated data collection, storage, and processing are becoming ubiquitous, and newer areas of application are emerging constantly. One such relatively new domain is plant stress analytics.ML algorithms are a very promising approach for faster, more efficient, and better data analytics. ML being inherently multidisciplinary draws inspiration and utilizes concepts from probability theory, statistics, decision theory, optimization, and visualization.Most current applications of ML tools in plant sciences have focused on using a limited set of ML tools (SVM, ANN). A good understanding of which, when, and how various ML tools can be applied will be very informative to the plant community to leverage these ML tools. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Abiotic stress; Biotic stress; High-throughput phenotyping; Imaging; Machine learning; Plant breeding","breeding; high throughput screening; machine learning; metabolism; phenotype; physiological stress; plant; Breeding; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Machine Learning; Phenotype; Plants; Stress, Physiological",Review,Scopus

However, extrapolating site-scale observations to regional scales represents a major challenge confronting the agricultural modeling community. This study introduces a novel geospatial agricultural modeling system (GAMS) exploring the integration of the mechanistic Environmental Policy Integrated Climate model, spatially-resolved data, surveyed management data, and supercomputing functions for cropland C budgets estimates. This modeling system creates spatially-explicit modeling units at a spatial resolution consistent with remotely-sensed crop identification and assigns cropping systems to each of them by geo-referencing surveyed crop management information at the county or state level. A parallel computing algorithm was also developed to facilitate the computationally intensive model runs and output post-processing and visualization. We evaluated GAMS against National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) reported crop yields and inventory estimated county-scale cropland C budgets averaged over 2000-2008. We observed good overall agreement, with spatial correlation of 0.89, 0.90, 0.41, and 0.87, for crop yields, Net Primary Production (NPP), Soil Organic C (SOC) change, and Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), respectively. However, we also detected notable differences in the magnitude of NPP and NEE, as well as in the spatial pattern of SOC change. By performing crop-specific annual comparisons, we discuss possible explanations for the discrepancies between GAMS and the inventory method, such as data requirements, representation of agroecosystem processes, completeness and accuracy of crop management data, and accuracy of crop area representation. Based on these analyses, we further discuss strategies to improve GAMS by updating input data and by designing more efficient parallel computing capability to quantitatively assess errors associated with the simulation of C budget components. The modularized design of the GAMS makes it flexible to be updated and adapted for different agricultural models so long as they require similar input data, and to be linked with socio-economic models to understand the effectiveness and implications of diverse C management practices and policies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Agriculture; Carbon; Climate change; EPIC; Geospatial modeling; Parallel computing","Agriculture; Budget control; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Crops; Economics; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Input output programs; Parallel architectures; Parallel processing systems; Surveys; Accurate quantifications; Environmental policy integrated climate models; EPIC; Geospatial model; National agricultural statistics services; Net primary production; Parallel computing algorithms; Spatially-explicit models; Information management; agricultural land; agricultural land; algorithm; carbon budget; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; climate modeling; concentration (composition); crop yield; crop yield; environmental policy; environmental policy; error analysis; error analysis; estimation method; forest inventory; regional pattern; regional pattern; remote sensing; remote sensing; simulation; statistical analysis",Article,Scopus

Various global soil moisture products have been mostly retrieved from microwave remote sensing data. However, currently there is rarely spatially explicit and time-continuous soil moisture information with a high resolution at the national scale. In this study, we generated a 1km soil moisture dataset for dryland wheat and maize in China (ChinaCropSM1 km) over 1993-2018 through a random forest (RF) algorithm based on numerous in situ daily observations of soil moisture. We independently used in situ observations (181327 samples) from the agricultural meteorological stations (AMSs) across China for training (164202 samples) and others for testing (17125 samples). An irrigation module was first developed according to crop type (i.e., wheat, maize), soil depth (0-10, 10-20cm) and phenology. We produced four daily datasets separately by crop type and soil depth, and their accuracies were all satisfactory (wheat r 0.93, ubRMSE 0.033m3m-3; maize r 0.93, ubRMSE 0.035m3m-3). The spatiotemporal resolutions and accuracy of ChinaCropSM1 km were significantly better than those of global soil moisture products (e.g., r increased by 116%, ubRMSE decreased by 64%), including the global remote-sensing-based surface soil moisture dataset (RSSSM) and the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) SM.

Study focus: Several studies have shown a relationship between climate change and changes in sediment yield. However, there are limited modeling applications that study this relationship at regional scales mainly due to data availability and computational cost. This study proposes a methodological framework using the SWAT+ model to predict and project sediment yield at a regional scale in data-scarce regions using global datasets. We implement a framework that (a) incorporates topographic factors from high/medium resolution DEMs (b) incorporates crop phenology data (c) introduces an areal threshold to linearize sediment yield in large model units and (d) apply a hydrological mass balance calibration. We test this methodology in the Nile Basin using a model application with (revised) and without (default) the framework under historical and future climate projections. New hydrological insights for the region: Results show improved sediment yield estimates in the revised model, both in absolute values and spatial distribution when compared to measured and reported estimates.

The airborne hyperspectral system with its vast area coverage, high spectral resolution, and varied narrow-band selection is an excellent tool for crop physiological characteristics and yield prediction. However, the extensive and redundant three-dimensional (3D) cube data processing and computation have made the popularization of this tool a challenging task. This research integrated two important open-sourced systems (R and Python) combined with automated hyperspectral narrowband vegetation index calculation and the state-of-the-art AI-based automated machine learning (AutoML) technology to estimate yield and biomass, based on three crop categories (spring wheat, pea and oat mixture, and spring barley with red clover) with multifunctional cultivation practices in northern Europe and Estonia. Our study showed the estimated capacity of the empirical AutoML regression model was significant. The best coefficient of determination (R2) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) for single variety planting wheat were 0.96 and 0.12 respectively; for mixed peas and oats, they were 0.76 and 0.18 in the booting to heading stage, while for mixed legumes and spring barley, they were 0.88 and 0.16 in the reproductive growth stages. In terms of straw mass estimation, R2 was 0.96, 0.83, and 0.86, and NRMSE was 0.12, 0.24, and 0.33 respectively. This research contributes to, and confirms, the use of the AutoML framework in hyperspectral image analysis to increase implementation flexibility and reduce learning costs under a variety of agricultural resource conditions. It delivers expert yield and straw mass valuation two months in advance before harvest time for decision-makers. This study also highlights that the hyperspectral system provides economic and environmental benefits and will play a critical role in the construction of sustainable and intelligent agriculture techniques in the upcoming years. © 2022 by the authors.

Yet, the water balance of cultivated areas is strongly influenced by applied management practices (e.g. planting, irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting). The SWAT+ (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model represents agricultural land by default in a generic way, where the start of the cropping season is driven by accumulated heat units. However, this approach does not work for tropical and subtropical regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, where crop growth dynamics are mainly controlled by rainfall rather than temperature. In this study, we present an approach on how to incorporate crop phenology using decision tables and global datasets of rainfed and irrigated croplands with the associated cropping calendar and fertilizer applications in a regional SWAT+ model for northeastern Africa. We evaluate the influence of the crop phenology representation on simulations of leaf area index (LAI) and evapotranspiration (ET) using LAI remote sensing data from Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) and WaPOR (Water Productivity through Open access of Remotely sensed derived data) ET data, respectively. Results show that a representation of crop phenology using global datasets leads to improved temporal patterns of LAI and ET simulations, especially for regions with a single cropping cycle. However, for regions with multiple cropping seasons, global phenology datasets need to be complemented with local data or remote sensing data to capture additional cropping seasons. In addition, the improvement of the cropping season also helps to improve soil erosion estimates, as the timing of crop cover controls erosion rates in the model. With more realistic growing seasons, soil erosion is largely reduced for most agricultural hydrologic response units (HRUs), which can be considered as a move towards substantial improvements over previous estimates. We conclude that regional and global hydrological models can benefit from improved representations of crop phenology and the associated management practices. Future work regarding the incorporation of multiple cropping seasons in global phenology data is needed to better represent cropping cycles in areas where they occur using regional to global hydrological models. © Copyright:",,"Biology; Cultivation; Decision tables; Erosion; Hydrology; Land use; Remote sensing; Soils; Tropics; Agricultural land use; Crop phenology; Cropping seasons; Global datasets; Leaf Area Index; Management practises; Remote sensing data; Soil and Water assessment tools; Soil erosion; Tool models; Crops; agricultural land; agricultural management; hydrological change; land use; soil and water assessment tool",Article,Scopus

A range of approaches have been assessed to improve the effectiveness of the connection between seasonal forecast information and mechanistic crop models, which include GCMs, analogue, stochastic disaggregation, and statistical prediction through converting seasonal weather summaries into the daily weather. GCM outputs are produced in a format compatible with mechanistic crop models. Such outputs are critical for researchers to have information on the merits and demerits of tools and approaches on integrating seasonal forecast and crop models.

Specific leaf nitrogen (SLN) and leaf mass per leaf area (LMA), as well as, maximal rates of Rubisco carboxylation (Vcmax), phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylation (Vpmax), and electron transport (Jmax), quantified using a C4 photosynthesis model, were evaluated in two field-grown training sets (n = 169 plots including 124 genotypes) in 2019 and 2020. Partial least square regression (PLSR) was used to predict Vcmax (R2 = 0:83), Vpmax (R2 = 0:93), Jmax (R2 = 0:76), SLN (R2 = 0:82), and LMA (R2 = 0:68) from tractor-based hyperspectral sensing. Further assessments of the capability of the PLSR models for Vcmax, Vpmax, Jmax, SLN, and LMA were conducted by extrapolating these models to two trials of genome-wide association studies adjacent to the training sets in 2019 (n = 875 plots including 650 genotypes) and 2020 (n = 912 plots with 634 genotypes). The predicted traits showed medium to high heritability and genome-wide association studies using the predicted values identified four QTL for Vcmax and two QTL for Jmax. Candidate genes within 200 kb of the Vcmax QTL were involved in nitrogen storage, which is closely associated with Rubisco, while not directly associated with Rubisco activity per se. Jmax QTL was enriched for candidate genes involved in electron transport. These outcomes suggest the methods here are of great promise to effectively screen large germplasm collections for enhanced photosynthetic capacity.

Their effective applicability to a targeted problem is nevertheless conditional on a detailed evaluation of their ability to simulate the near-term climate evolution under specific conditions. Here we explore the performance of the IPSL-CM5A-LR DCP system in predicting air temperature over Europe, by proposing a systematic assessessment of the prediction skill for different time windows (periods of the calendar time, forecast years and months/seasons). In this framework, we also compare raw and de-biased hindcasts, in which the temperature outputs have been corrected using a quantile matching method. The systematic analysis allows to discern certain conditions conferring larger predictability, which we find to be intermittent in time. The predictions appear more skilful around the 1960s and after the 1980s, in coincidence with large shifts of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability, which are well reproduced in the hindcasts. Averages on longer forecast periods also generally imply better prediction skill, while the best predicted months appear to be mainly those between late spring and early autumn. Moreover, we find an overall added value due to initialisation, while de-biased predictions significantly outperform raw predictions only for a few specific time windows. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of the proposed systematic exploration of skill opportunities in DCPs for integrated applications in climate sensitive sectors. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Atlantic multidecadal variability; Climate service; Climate variability; De-biasing; Decadal climate predictions","air temperature; Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation; climate prediction; climate variation; decadal variation; hindcasting; Europe",Article,Scopus

Remotely sensed SIF integrates environmental, physiological and structural changes that alter photosynthesis at leaf, plant and canopy scales. Radiative transfer models are ideally suited to investigate the complex sources of variability in the SIF signal to guide the interpretation of SIF retrievals from airborne and space-borne platforms. Here, we coupled the Fluspect-Cx model of leaf optical properties and chlorophyll-a fluorescence with the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model to upscale SIF from individual leaves to three-dimensional (3D) structurally explicit canopies. For one-dimensional homogeneous (turbid-like) canopies, DART-SIF was nearly identical to SIF simulated in two existing models, SCOPE and mSCOPE (RMSE &lt;0.221 W.m−2.μm−1.sr−1). DART simulations in geometrically explicit 3D canopies offered four important insights regarding the influence of vegetation structure on the multi-angular top-of-canopy SIF signal. First, changes in the 3D canopy architecture of maize crops, represented by leaf density (leaf area index), and plant clumping (canopy closure) had a larger impact on SIF than the modelled photosynthetic efficiency distinction between sun-adapted and shade-adapted foliage. Second, clumping of leaves at the crop and stand levels was identified as one of the key driving factors of multi-angular anisotropy of red and far-red SIF (686 and 740 nm) for both maize and eucalyptus canopies. Third, non-photosynthetic woody material had a significant impact on top-of-canopy SIF in modelled 3D forest stands. Wood shadowing decreased the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by green leaves, and consequently the SIF emissions, by 10% in sparse and 17% in dense eucalyptus stands. The wood obstruction (blocking) effect, quantified as a relative difference of SIF escape probabilities from canopies with and without wood in the nadir viewing direction, decreased far-red SIF by 4–6% but it had a smaller and sometimes positive influence (by less than 2%) on red SIF. Fourth, DART 3D radiative budget profiles revealed that the majority of the SIF signal from a dense eucalyptus stand originated from the top 25% of the simulated canopy. Interestingly, the introduction of bark-covered woody elements did not alter the simulated balance and omnidirectional escape factor of red SIF in this upper canopy part but did raise significantly both of them in case of far-red SIF. These results demonstrate the importance of 3D radiative transfer and radiative budget simulations for investigating SIF interactions in structurally complex plant canopies and for a better understanding of spatiotemporal and multi-angular remote sensing SIF observations. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Clumping; DART; Fluspect; LAI; SCOPE; SIF; Sun-/shade-adapted leaves; Wood","Chlorophyll; Crops; Fluorescence; Optical properties; Photosynthesis; Physiological models; Radiative transfer; Vegetation; Wood; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Clumping; Discrete anisotropic radiative transfer; Fluorescence signals; Fluspect; LAI; Radiative transfer modelling; SCOPE; Solar-induced fluorescences; Sun-/shade-adapted leaf; Anisotropy; anisotropy; canopy architecture; chlorophyll; fluorescence; geometry; induced response; numerical model; radiative transfer; remote sensing; solar radiation; vegetation structure; Eucalyptus",Article,Scopus

However, a current knowledge gap lies in the integration of AutoML technology and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) within image-based data classification tasks. Therefore, we employed a state-of-the-art (SOTA) and completely open-source AutoML framework, Auto-sklearn, which was constructed based on one of the most widely used ML systems: Scikit-learn. It was combined with two novel AutoML visualization tools to focus particularly on the recognition and adoption of UAS-derived multispectral vegetation indices (VI) data across a diverse range of agricultural management practices (AMP). These include soil tillage methods (STM), cultivation methods (CM), and manure application (MA), and are under the four-crop combination fields (i.e., red clover-grass mixture, spring wheat, pea-oat mixture, and spring barley). Furthermore, they have currently not been efficiently examined and accessible parameters in UAS applications are absent for them. We conducted the comparison of AutoML performance using three other common machine learning classifiers, namely Random Forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). The results showed AutoML achieved the highest overall classification accuracy numbers after 1200 s of calculation. RF yielded the second-best classification accuracy, and SVM and ANN were revealed to be less capable among some of the given datasets. Regarding the classification of AMPs, the best recognized period for data capture occurred in the crop vegetative growth stage (in May). The results demonstrated that CM yielded the best performance in terms of classification, followed by MA and STM. Our framework presents new insights into plant–environment interactions with capable classification capabilities. It further illustrated the automatic system would become an important tool in furthering the understanding for future sustainable smart farming and field-based crop phenotyping research across a diverse range of agricultural environmental assessment and management applications. © 2021 by the authors.

Over-fertilization can have negative influences on the field and the regional level (e.g., agro-ecosys-tems). Remote sensing of the plant N of field crops presents a valuable tool for the monitoring of N flows in agro-ecosystems. Available data for validation of satellite-based remote sensing of N is scarce. Therefore, in this study, field spectrometer measurements were used to simulate data of the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites developed for vegetation monitoring by the ESA. The prediction performance of normalized ratio indices (NRIs), random forest regression (RFR) and Gaussian processes regression (GPR) for plant-N-related traits was assessed on a diverse real-world dataset including multiple crops, field sites and years. The plant N traits included the mass-based N measure, N concentration in the biomass (Nconc), and an area-based N measure approximating the plant N uptake (NUP). Spectral indices such as normalized ratio indices (NRIs) performed well, but the RFR and GPR methods outperformed the NRIs. Key spectral bands for each trait were identified using the RFR variable importance measure and the Gaussian processes regression band analysis tool (GPR-BAT), highlighting the importance of the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region for estimation of plant Nconc—and to a lesser extent the NUP. The red edge (RE) region was also important. The GPR-BAT showed that five bands were sufficient for plant N trait and leaf area index (LAI) estimation and that a surplus of bands effectively reduced prediction performance. A global sensitivity analysis (GSA) was performed on all traits simultaneously, showing the dominance of the LAI in the mixed remote sensing signal. To delineate the plant-N-related traits from this signal, regional and/or national data collection campaigns producing large crop spectral libraries (CSL) are needed. An improved database will likely enable the mapping of N at the agro-ecosystem level or for use in precision farming by farmers in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

Evapotranspiration (ET), which consists of crop water use through transpiration and water loss through direct soil evaporation, is a good indicator of soil moisture availability and vegetation health. ET therefore has been an integral part of many yield estimation efforts. The Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) is an ET-based crop stress indicator that describes temporal anomalies in a normalized evapotranspiration metric as derived from satellite remote sensing. ESI has demonstrated the capacity to explain regional yield variability in water-limited regions. However, its performance in some regions where the vegetation cycle is intensively managed appears to be degraded due to interannual phenological variability. This investigation selected three study sites across the U.S. Corn Belt – Mead, NE, Ames, IA and Champaign, IL – to investigate the potential operational value of 30-m resolution, phenologically corrected ESI datasets for yield prediction. The analysis was conducted over an 8-year period from 2010 to 2017, which included both drought and pluvial conditions as well as a broad range in yield values. Detrended yield anomalies for corn and soybean were correlated with ESI computed using annual ET curves temporally aligned based on (1) calendar date, (2) crop emergence date, and (3) a growing degree day (GDD) scaled time axis. Results showed that ESI has good correlations with yield anomalies at the county scale and that phenological corrections to the annual temporal alignment of the ET timeseries improve the correlation, especially when the time axis is defined by GDD rather than the calendar date. Peak correlations occur in the silking stage for corn and the reproductive stage for soybean – phases when these crops are particularly sensitive to soil moisture deficiencies. Regression equations derived at the time of peak correlation were used to estimate yields at county scale using a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. The ESI-based yield estimates agree well with the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) county-level crop yield data, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.79 to 0.93 and percent root-mean-square errors of 5–8%.

However, SIF observations are subject to directional effects which can lead to considerable uncertainties in various applications. Practical approaches for normalizing directional SIF observations to nadir viewing, to minimize the directional effects, have not been well studied. Here we developed two practical and physically-solid approaches for removing the directional effects of anisotropic SIF observations: one is based on near-infrared or red reflectance of vegetation (NIRv and Redv), and the other is based on the kernel-driven model with multi-angular SIF measurements. The first approach uses surface reflectance while the second approach directly leverages multi-angular SIF measurements. The performance of the two approaches was evaluated using a dataset of multi-angular measurements of SIF and reflectance collected with a high-resolution field spectrometer over different plant canopies. Results show that the relative mean absolute errors between the normalized nadir SIF and the observed SIF at nadir decrease by 3–6% (far-red) and 6–8% (red) for the first approach, and by 7–13% and 6–11% for the second approach, compared to the original data, respectively.

Agriculture is strongly affected by climate change due to increasing temperatures, water shortage, heavy rainfall and variations in the frequency and intensity of excessive climatic events such as floods and droughts. Farmers need to adapt to climate change by developing advanced and sophisticated farming systems instead of simply farming at lower intensity and occupying more land. Integrated agricultural systems constitute a promising solution, as they can lower reliance on external inputs, enhance nutrient cycling and increase natural resource use efficiency. In this context, the concept of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) emerged as a promising solution to secure the resources for the growing world population under climate change conditions. This work proposes a CSA architecture for fostering and supporting integrated agricultural systems, such as Mixed Farming Systems (MFS), by facilitating the design, the deployment and the management of crop–livestock-=forestry combinations towards sustainable, efficient and climate resilient agricultural systems. Propelled by cutting-edge technology solutions in data collection and processing, along with fully autonomous monitoring systems, e.g., smart sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the proposed architecture called MiFarm-CSA, aims to foster core interactions among animals, forests and crops, while mitigating the high complexity of these interactions, through a novel conceptual framework. © 2021 by the authors.","climate smart agriculture; internet of things; mixed farming systems; participatory learning; socio-economic modelling; unmanned aerial vehicles",,Article,Scopus

The population used consisted of 666 wheat genotypes screened for five years (2015-19) at two locations (Pullman and Lind, WA, USA). Nine different models, including two machine learning (random forest and support vector machine) and two deep learning models (convolutional neural network and multilayer perceptron) were explored for cross-validation, forward, and across locations predictions. The prediction accuracies for different traits varied from 0.45-0.81, 0.29-0.55, and 0.27-0.50 under cross-validation, forward, and across location predictions. In general, forward prediction accuracies kept increasing over time due to increments in training data size and was more evident for machine and deep learning models. Deep learning models were superior over the traditional ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction (RRBLUP) and Bayesian models under all prediction scenarios. The high accuracy observed for end-use quality traits in this study support predicting them in early generations, leading to the advancement of superior genotypes to more extensive grain yield trails. Furthermore, the superior performance of machine and deep learning models strengthens the idea to include them in large scale breeding programs for predicting complex traits. © 2021 by the authors.

In the study, a hybrid inversion method, which combined a physical model with a statistical method, was proposed to estimate the crop LAI. The simulated compact high-resolution imaging spectrometer (CHRIS) canopy spectral crop reflectance datasets were generated using the PROSAIL model (the coupling of PROSPECT leaf optical properties model and Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves model) and the CHRIS band response function. Partial least squares (PLS) was then used to reduce the dimension of the simulated spectral data. Using the principal components (PCs) of PLS as the model inputs, the hybrid inversion models were built using various modeling algorithms, including the backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR), and random forest regression (RFR). Finally, remote sensing mapping of the CHRIS data was achieved with the hybrid model to test the inversion accuracy of LAI estimates. The validation result yielded an accuracy of R2 = 0.939 and normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) = 6.474% for the PLS_RFR model, which indicated that the crops LAI could be estimated accurately by using spectral feature extraction and a hybrid inversion strategy. The results showed that the model based on principal components extracted by PLS had a good estimation accuracy and noise immunity and was the preferred method for LAI estimation. Furthermore, the comparative analysis results of various datasets showed that prior knowledge could improve the precision of the retrieved LAI, and using this information to constrain parameters (e.g., chlorophyll content or LAI), which make important contributions to the spectra, is the key to this improvement. In addition, among the PLS, BP-ANN, LS-SVR, and RFR methods, RFR was the optimal modeling algorithm in the paper, as indicated by the high R2 and low NRMSE in various datasets. © 2020 by the authors.

In the past, empirical algorithms have been widely employed to retrieve information on this biochemical plant component from canopy reflectance. However, these approaches do not seek for a cause-effect relationship based on physical laws. Moreover, most studies solely relied on the correlation of chlorophyll content with nitrogen, and thus neglected the fact that most N is bound in proteins. Our study presents a hybrid retrieval method using a physically-based approach combined with machine learning regression to estimate crop N content. Within the workflow, the leaf optical properties model PROSPECT-PRO including the newly calibrated specific absorption coefficients (SAC) of proteins, was coupled with the canopy reflectance model 4SAIL to PROSAIL-PRO. The latter was then employed to generate a training database to be used for advanced probabilistic machine learning methods: a standard homoscedastic Gaussian process (GP) and a heteroscedastic GP regression that accounts for signal-to-noise relations. Both GP models have the property of providing confidence intervals for the estimates, which sets them apart from other machine learners. Moreover, a GP-based sequential backward band removal algorithm was employed to analyze the band-specific information content of PROSAIL-PRO simulated spectra for the estimation of aboveground N. Data from multiple hyperspectral field campaigns, carried out in the framework of the future satellite mission Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP), were exploited for validation. In these campaigns, corn and winter wheat spectra were acquired to simulate spectral EnMAP data. Moreover, destructive N measurements from leaves, stalks and fruits were collected separately to enable plant-organ-specific validation. The results showed that both GP models can provide accurate aboveground N simulations, with slightly better results of the heteroscedastic GP in terms of model testing and against in situ N measurements from leaves plus stalks, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.1 g/m². However, the inclusion of fruit N content for validation deteriorated the results, which can be explained by the inability of the radiation to penetrate the thick tissues of stalks, corn cobs and wheat ears. GP-based band analysis identified optimal spectral settings with ten bands mainly situated in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral region. Use of well-known protein absorption bands from the literature showed comparative results. Finally, the heteroscedastic GP model was successfully applied on airborne hyperspectral data for N mapping. We conclude that GP algorithms, and in particular the heteroscedastic GP, should be implemented for global agricultural monitoring of aboveground N from future imaging spectroscopy data. © 2020 The Authors","Agricultural monitoring; EnMAP; Gaussian processes; Imaging spectroscopy; Inversion; Radiative transfer modeling","data inversion; Gaussian method; imaging method; machine learning; monitoring; nitrogen; radiative transfer; regression analysis",Article,Scopus

Uncertainty in historical, current and future effectiveness of actions hampers decisions about how to mitigate changes to prevent biodiversity loss and species extinctions. Research in resource management, agriculture and health indicates that forecasts predicting the effects of near-term or seasonal environmental conditions on management greatly improve outcomes. Such forecasts help resolve uncertainties about when and how to operationalize management. We reviewed the scientific literature on environmental management to investigate whether near-term forecasts are developed to inform biodiversity decisions in Australia, a nation with one of the highest recent extinction rates across the globe. We found that forecasts focused on economic objectives (e.g. fisheries management) predict on significantly shorter timelines and answer a broader range of management questions than forecasts focused on biodiversity conservation. We then evaluated scientific literature on the effectiveness of 484 actions to manage seven major terrestrial threats in Australia, to identify opportunities for near-term forecasts to inform operational conservation decisions. Depending on the action, between 30% and 80% threat management operations experienced near-term weather impacts on outcomes before, during or after management. Disease control, species translocation/reintroduction and habitat restoration actions were most frequently impacted, and negative impacts such as increased species mortality and reduced recruitment were more likely than positive impacts. Drought or dry conditions, and rainfall, were the most frequently reported weather impacts, indicating that near-term forecasts predicting the effects of low or excessive rainfall on management outcomes are likely to have the greatest benefits. Across the world, many regions are, like Australia, becoming warmer and drier, or experiencing more extreme rainfall events. Informing conservation decisions with near-term and seasonal ecological forecasting will be critical to harness uncertainties and lower the risk of threat management failure under global change. © 2020 The Authors.

Here, we added a sediment diagenesis and sediment carbon (C) resuspension module into the SWAT-C model and tested it for simulating both particulate organic C (POC) and dissolved organic C (DOC) fluxes using 4 years of monthly observations (2014-2017) in the Tuckahoe watershed (TW) in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region. Results: Sensitivity analyses show that parameters that regulate POC deposition in river networks are more sensitive than those that determine C resuspension from sediments. Further analyses indicate that allochthonous contributions to POC and DOC are about 36.6 and 46 kgC ha-1 year-1, respectively, while autochthonous contributions are less than 0.72 kgC ha-1 year-1 for both POC and DOC (less than 2% of allochthonous sources). The net deposition of POC on the riverbed (i.e., 11.4 kgC ha-1 year-1) retained ca. 31% of terrestrial inputs of POC. In addition, average annual buried C was 0.34 kgC ha-1 year-1, accounting for only 1% of terrestrial POC inputs or 3% of net POC deposition. The results indicate that about 79% of deposited organic C was converted to inorganic C (CH4 and CO2) in the sediment and eventually released into the overlying water column. Conclusion: This study serves as an exploratory study on estimation of C fluxes from terrestrial to aquatic environments at the watershed scale. We demonstrated capabilities of the SWAT-C model to simulate C cycling from uplands to riverine ecosystems and estimated C sinks and sources in aquatic environments. Overall, the results highlight the importance of including carbon cycle dynamics within the riverbed in order to accurately estimate aquatic carbon fluxes and stocks. The new capabilities of SWAT-C are expected to serve as a useful tool to account for those processes in watershed C balance assessment. © 2020 The Author(s).","DOC; POC; Resuspension; Sediment diagenesis","aquatic environment; carbon cycle; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; diagenesis; dissolved organic carbon; particulate organic carbon; resuspension; river bed; terrestrial environment; watershed; Maryland; Mid-Atlantic States; Tuckahoe River; United States; Peltandra virginica",Article,Scopus

However, the genetic basis of many domesticated characteristics remains to be explored. Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is the most important tetraploid cotton species, accounting for about 90% of world cotton commerce. Here, we reveal the effects of domestication on fiber and stress traits through comprehensive analyses of semi-domesticated races and cultivated cotton accessions. A total of 416 cotton accessions were genotyped, and a decrease in genetic diversity from races to landraces and modern cultivars was detected. Furthermore, 71 domestication selective sweeps (DSS) and 14 improvement selective sweeps (ISS) were identified, with the Dt sub-genome experiencing stronger selection than the At sub-genome during the both selection types. The more expressed genes and a delay in the expression peak of genes related to secondary cell wall (SCW) development in modern cultivars compared to semi-domesticated cotton races, may have contributed to long fibers in these plants. However, down-regulation of genes related to stress response was responsible for decreasing stress tolerance in modern cultivars. We further experimentally confirmed that silencing of PR1 and WRKY20, genes that showed higher expression in the semi-domesticated races, drastically compromised cotton resistance to V. dahliae. Our results reveal fiber improvement and decreased stress tolerance as a result of the domestication of modern upland cotton cultivars. © Copyright © 2019 Zhu, Li, Wang, Li, Si, Cai and Guo.","artificial selection; domestication; expression profile; fiber development; single nucleotide polymorphism array; stress tolerance; upland cotton",,Article,Scopus

In central North America it has consisted of cropland expansion in the early 1900s, yield intensification starting in the 1930s, and the development of large irrigated areas beginning in the 1950s. The area of this study encompasses the Midwest and Great Plains of the United States not only because significant agricultural change has occurred here but also because of the significant cooling (warming hole) there in the midcentury. This study investigates the relative contribution of agricultural development and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on the observed patterns of regional changes in summer temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration using a long-term twentieth-century reanalysis dataset (CERA-20C) as boundary conditions for simulations with the MIT Regional Climate Model (MRCM). Temperatures in the Great Plains (338–438N, 958–1098W) and the Midwest (388–488N, 828–1098W) would have been significantly higher in the second half of the twentieth century without the influence of agricultural development, largely due to an increase in evaporative cooling. The simulations of precipitation changes reflect a significant influence of global SST teleconnections at decadal time scales. Numerical simulations also demonstrate the competing effects of cropland expansion and yield intensification on shaping the observed pattern of increases in precipitation. Ultimately, a combination of agricultural development and decadal variability of global sea surface temperatures (SST) explains most of the observed variability of summer temperature and precipitation during the twentieth century over central North America. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.",,"Agriculture; Climate models; Evaporative cooling systems; Evapotranspiration; Expansion; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Landforms; Oceanography; Surface waters; Agricultural development; Decadal variability; Evaporative cooling; Precipitation change; Regional climate modeling; Relative contribution; Sea surface temperature (SST); Summer temperature; Climate change; agricultural development; boundary condition; climate change; climate modeling; data set; greenhouse gas; summer; twentieth century; warming; Great Plains; Midwest; United States",Article,Scopus

Abstract: The breeder’s equation is the foundational application of quantitative genetics to crop improvement. Guided by the variables that describe response to selection, emerging breeding technologies can make a powerful step change in the effectiveness of public breeding programs. The most promising innovations for increasing the rate of genetic gain without greatly increasing program size appear to be related to reducing breeding cycle time, which is likely to require the implementation of parent selection on non-inbred progeny, rapid generation advance, and genomic selection. These are complex processes and will require breeding organizations to adopt a culture of continuous optimization and improvement. To enable this, research managers will need to consider and proactively manage the, accountability, strategy, and resource allocations of breeding teams. This must be combined with thoughtful management of elite genetic variation and a clear separation between the parental selection process and product development and advancement process. With an abundance of new technologies available, breeding teams need to evaluate carefully the impact of any new technology on selection intensity, selection accuracy, and breeding cycle length relative to its cost of deployment. Finally breeding data management systems need to be well designed to support selection decisions and novel approaches to accelerate breeding cycles need to be routinely evaluated and deployed. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"Agriculture; Genes; Human resource management; Optimization; Productivity; Agricultural productivity; Breeding technology; Continuous optimization; Data management system; Plant breeding programs; Response to selection; Selection decisions; Selection intensity; Information management; genetic marker; genetic selection; genetics; inheritance; plant; plant breeding; procedures; public sector; single nucleotide polymorphism; Genetic Markers; Inheritance Patterns; Plant Breeding; Plants; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Public Sector; Selection, Genetic",Review,Scopus

The cross-validation results show that the machine learning models greatly outperform the traditional linear model in predicting runoff coefficient. High-resolution (0.1°) runoff coefficient and runoff maps for the China's transboundary river basins riparian countries were produced and compared with other estimates at the country level.

Whilst extreme weather conditions may cause extreme impacts, crop failure commonly is induced by the occurrence of multiple and combined anomalous meteorological drivers. For these cases, the explanation of conditions leading to crop failure is complex, as the links connecting weather and crop yield can be multiple and non-linear. Furthermore, climate change is likely to perturb the meteorological conditions, possibly altering the occurrences of crop failures or leading to unprecedented drivers of extreme impacts. The goal of this study is to identify important meteorological drivers that cause crop failures and to explore changes in crop failures due to global warming. For that, we focus on a historical failure event, the extreme low soybean production during the 2012 season in the midwestern US. We first train a random forest model to identify the most relevant meteorological drivers of historical crop failures and to predict crop failure probabilities. Second, we explore the influence of global warming on crop failures and on the structure of compound drivers. We use large ensembles from the EC-Earth global climate model, corresponding to present-day, pre-industrial +2 and 3° C warming, respectively, to isolate the global warming component. Finally, we explore the meteorological conditions inductive for the 2012 crop failure and construct analogues of these failure conditions in future climate settings. We find that crop failures in the midwestern US are linked to low precipitation levels, and high temperature and diurnal temperature range (DTR) levels during July and August. Results suggest soybean failures are likely to increase with climate change. With more frequent warm years due to global warming, the joint hot-dry conditions leading to crop failures become mostly dependent on precipitation levels, reducing the importance of the relative compound contribution. While event analogues of the 2012 season are rare and not expected to increase, impact analogues show a significant increase in occurrence frequency under global warming, but for different combinations of the meteorological drivers than experienced in 2012. This has implications for assessment of the drivers of extreme impact events. © Copyright:",,"Climate models; Crops; Decision trees; Earth (planet); Condition; Crop failures; Crop yield; Extreme weather conditions; Failure events; Meteorological condition; Non linear; Precipitation level; Soybean production; Storylines; Global warming; climate change; climate effect; crop production; extreme event; forest dynamics; global warming; United States",Article,Scopus

In recent years, deep learning (DL) methods have been considered in the context of genomic prediction. The DL methods are nonparametric models providing flexibility to adapt to complicated associations between data and output with the ability to adapt to very complex patterns. Main body: We review the applications of deep learning (DL) methods in genomic selection (GS) to obtain a meta-picture of GS performance and highlight how these tools can help solve challenging plant breeding problems. We also provide general guidance for the effective use of DL methods including the fundamentals of DL and the requirements for its appropriate use. We discuss the pros and cons of this technique compared to traditional genomic prediction approaches as well as the current trends in DL applications. Conclusions: The main requirement for using DL is the quality and sufficiently large training data. Although, based on current literature GS in plant and animal breeding we did not find clear superiority of DL in terms of prediction power compared to conventional genome based prediction models. Nevertheless, there are clear evidences that DL algorithms capture nonlinear patterns more efficiently than conventional genome based. Deep learning algorithms are able to integrate data from different sources as is usually needed in GS assisted breeding and it shows the ability for improving prediction accuracy for large plant breeding data. It is important to apply DL to large training-testing data sets. © 2021, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Genomic selection; Genomic trends; Plant breeding","algorithm; deep learning; plant breeding; prediction; review; animal; Bayes theorem; biological model; genetic selection; genome; genomics; phenotype; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Deep Learning; Genome; Genomics; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Selection, Genetic",Review,Scopus

LAI estimation models use multi-source data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), but using multimodal data to estimate maize LAI, and the effect of tassels and soil background, remain understudied. Our research aims to (1) determine how multimodal data contribute to LAI and propose a framework for estimating LAI based on remote-sensing data, (2) evaluate the robustness and adaptability of an LAI estimation model that uses multimodal data fusion and deep neural networks (DNNs) in single- and whole growth stages, and (3) explore how soil background and maize tasseling affect LAI estimation. To construct multimodal datasets, our UAV collected red–green–blue, multispectral, and thermal infrared images. We then developed partial least square regression (PLSR), support vector regression, and random forest regression models to estimate LAI. We also developed a deep learning model with three hidden layers. This multimodal data structure accurately estimated maize LAI. The DNN model provided the best estimate (coefficient of determination [R2] ¼ 0.89, relative root mean square error [rRMSE] ¼ 12.92%) for a single growth period, and the PLSR model provided the best estimate (R2 ¼ 0.70, rRMSE ¼ 12.78%) for a whole growth period. Tassels reduced the accuracy of LAI estimation, but the soil background provided additional image feature information, improving accuracy. These results indicate that multimodal data fusion using low-cost UAVs and DNNs can accurately and reliably estimate LAI for crops, which is valuable for high-throughput phenotyping and high-spatial precision farmland management. © American Society of Plant Biologists 2021.

This paper investigates the potential of applying FS and multivariate flood scaling properties [multiple linear regression (MLR)] as constraints in model calibration. Based on the assumption that the scaling property of flood exists in four study catchments in northern China, eight calibration scenarios are designed with adopting different combinations of traditional indicators and FS or MLR as objective functions. The performance of the proposed method is verified by employing a distributed hydrological model, namely, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The results indicate that reasonable performance could be obtained in FS with fewer requirements of observed streamflow data, exhibiting better simulation of flood peaks than the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient calibration scenario. The observed streamflow data or regional flood information are required in the MLR calibration scenario to identify the dominant catchment descriptors, and MLR achieves better performance on catchment interior points, especially for the events with uneven distribution of rainfall. On account of the improved performance on hydrographs and flood frequency curve at the watershed outlet, adopting the statistical indicators and flood scaling property simultaneously as model constraints is suggested. The proposed methodology enhances the physical connection of flood peak among subbasins and considers watershed actual conditions and climatic characteristics for each flood event, facilitating a new calibration approach for both gauged catchments and data-scarce catchments. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.","Flood events; Hydrologic models; Hydrology; Satellite observations; Streamflow; Watersheds","calibration; flooding; hydrological modeling; hydrology; regression analysis; satellite imagery; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; watershed",Article,Scopus

For this, the following methods of Machine Learning (ML) were implemented: (i) Deep Learning (DL) and (ii) Bayesian Regularized Neural Network (BRNN) both in combination with different hyperparameters. These ML methods were also compared with Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (GBLUP) and different Bayesian regression models [Bayes A, Bayes B, Bayes Cπ, Bayesian Ridge Regression, Bayesian LASSO, and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)]. DL models, using Rectified Linear Units (as the activation function), had higher predictive ability values, which varied from 0.27 (pilodyn penetration of 6 years old eucalypt trees) to 0.78 (flowering-related traits of maize). Moreover, the larger mini-batch size (100%) had a significantly higher predictive ability for wood-related traits than the smaller mini-batch size (10%). On the other hand, in the BRNN method, the architectures of one and two layers that used only the pureline function showed better results of prediction, with values ranging from 0.21 (pilodyn penetration) to 0.71 (flowering traits). A significant increase in the prediction ability was observed for DL in comparison with other methods of genomic prediction (Bayesian alphabet models, GBLUP, RKHS, and BRNN). Another important finding was the usefulness of DL models (through an iterative algorithm) as an SNP detection strategy for genome-wide association studies. The results of this study confirm the importance of DL for genome-wide analyses and crop/tree improvement strategies, which holds promise for accelerating breeding progress. © Copyright © 2020 Maldonado, Mora-Poblete, Contreras-Soto, Ahmar, Chen, do Amaral Júnior and Scapim.","Bayesian regularized neural network; deep learning; eucalypt; genomic prediction; machine learning; single-nucleotide polymorphisms; tropical maize",,Article,Scopus

The thriving environment for the implementation of different agriculture systems is justified by a series of technologies that offer the prospect of improving agricultural productivity through the intensive use of data. The concept of big data in agriculture is not exclusively related to big volume, but also on the variety and velocity of the collected data. Big data is a key concept for the future development of agriculture as it offers unprecedented capabilities and it enables various tools and services capable to change its current status.

The Nile delta provides two thirds of Egypt's agriculture land, but is threatened by urban sprawl. The paper aims to quantify urban expansion over a 45 year period using 6 time points from 1972 to 2017, and its impacts on agricultural potential, soil organic carbon stocks, and implications for water use. The study used multi-temporal satellite data and remote sensing techniques (Maximum Likelihood supervised classification, and NDVI), soil sampling and analysis, data on water irrigation, and agroecological system and ecosystem services model (MicroLEIS, InVEST) to assess the effects of land use change. Urban area increased by a factor of 5, from 452 km2 in 1972 to 2644 km2 in 2017. The greatest losses occurred to the fertile Vertic Torrifluvent soils on the older delta, which lost 1734 km2. Soil organic carbon (0–75 cm depth) lost as a result of soil sealing from urbanisation rose from 25,000 to 141,000 Mg C over the 45 years. As a result of increased pressure on delta land, agriculture expanded into the higher desert areas outside the delta, on marginal land sustained by intensive fertiliser use and irrigation, which in turn puts pressure on water use. Therefore, rapid urban expansion has resulted in a loss of soil carbon and a shift in agriculture from fertile soils to marginal soils, requiring more capital inputs, which is ultimately less sustainable. Modelling suggested that soil management improvement could make better use of fertile soils within the Delta currently affected by high salinity and poor drainage. Future planning should encourage urban expansion on the less fertile soils outside of the delta, while improving suitability of existing agricultural land and minimising land degradation within the delta. © 2019","InVEST ecosystem services model; NDVI; Soil organic carbon; Urban sprawl; Water use","organic carbon; water; carbon; agricultural land; agroecology; fertilizer application; irrigation system; land degradation; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil fertility; urban sprawl; urbanization; water use; agricultural land; Article; controlled study; cultivated land; ecosystem; environmental impact; environmental parameters; fluid intake; normalized difference vegetation index; remote sensing; rural area; salinity; soil depth; soil fertility; soil management; soil quality; spatiotemporal analysis; stock assessment; urban area; urbanization; agriculture; Egypt; soil; Egypt; Nile Delta; Agriculture; Carbon; Ecosystem; Egypt; Soil; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

In agriculture, more efficient use of natural resources is at the heart of sustainable intensification. However, technical improvements do not directly translate into resource savings because producers and consumers adapt their behaviour to such improvements, often resulting in a rebound effect, where part or all of the potential resource savings are offset. In extreme cases, increases in efficiency may even result in higher, instead of lower, resource consumption (the Jevons paradox). Rebound effects are particularly complex in agricultural land and soil management, where multiple resources are used simultaneously and efficiency gains aim to lower the need for farmland, water, energy, nutrients, pesticides, and greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, quantification of rebound effects is a prerequisite for generating realistic scenarios of global food provision and for advancing the debate on land sparing versus land sharing. However, studies that provide an overview of rebound effects related to the resources used in agriculture or guidelines for assessing potential rebound effects from future innovations are lacking. This paper contributes to closing this gap by reviewing the current state of knowledge and developing a framework for a structured appraisal of rebound effects. As a test case, the proposed framework is applied to emerging technologies and practices in agricultural soil management in Germany. The literature review revealed substantial evidence of rebound effects or even Jevons’ paradox with regard to efficiency increases in land productivity and irrigation water use. By contrast, there were few studies addressing rebound effects from efficiency increases in fertilizer use, pesticide application, agricultural energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions. While rebound effects are by definition caused by behavioural adaptations of humans, in agriculture also natural adaptations occur, such as resistance of pests to certain pesticides. Future studies should consider extending the definition of rebound effects to such natural adaptations. The test case revealed the potential for direct and indirect economic rebound effects of a number of emerging technologies and practices, such as improved irrigation technologies, which increase water productivity and may thereby contribute to increases in irrigated areas and total water use. The results of this study indicated that rebound effects must be assessed to achieve realistic estimates of resource savings from efficiency improvements and to enable informed policy choices. The framework developed in this paper is the first to facilitate such assessments. © 2019 The Authors","Agriculture; Efficiency; Impact assessment; Irrigation; Jevons paradox; Land sparing","Agriculture; Agronomy; Behavioral research; Economic analysis; Efficiency; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Pesticide effects; Productivity; Soils; Water management; Water supply; Efficiency improvement; Emerging technologies; Impact assessments; Irrigation water use; Jevons paradox; Pesticide applications; Resource consumption; Technical improvement; Economic and social effects",Review,Scopus

This paper analyses an ensemble of simulations from six regional climate models (RCMs) taking part in the coordinated regional downscaling experiment, the ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis (ERAI) and three satellite-based and observationally-constrained daily precipitation datasets, to assess the performance of the RCMs with regard to the intraseasonal variability. A joint analysis of seasonal-mean precipitation and the total column water vapor (also called precipitable water—PW) suggests the existence of important links at different timescales between these two variables over the Sahel and highlights the relevance of using PW to follow the monsoon seasonal cycle. RCMs that fail to represent the seasonal-mean position and amplitude of the meridional gradient of PW show the largest discrepancies with respect to seasonal-mean observed precipitation. For both ERAI and RCMs, spectral decompositions of daily PW as well as rainfall show an overestimation of low-frequency activity (at timescales longer than 10 days) at the expense of the synoptic (timescales shorter than 10 days) activity. Consequently, the effects of the African Easterly Waves and the associated mesoscale convective systems are substantially underestimated, especially over continental regions. Finally, the study investigates the skill of the models with respect to hydro-climatic indices related to the occurrence, intensity and frequency of precipitation events at the intraseasonal scale. Although most of these indices are generally better reproduced with RCMs than reanalysis products, this study indicates that RCMs still need to be improved (especially with respect to their subgrid-scale parameterization schemes) to be able to reproduce the intraseasonal variance spectrum adequately. © 2016, The Author(s).","Intraseasonal variability; Precipitation indices; Regional climate modeling; West African monsoon","climate modeling; convective system; easterly wave; ensemble forecasting; monsoon; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; West Africa",Article,Scopus

The influence of species diversity and sensor specifications on the performances of various classification approaches are discussed.

The framework relies on a multitask convolutional neural network to achieve accurate classification at pixel and object (i.e. individual tree crown) level. It was successfully applied to the most comprehensive dataset of optical imagery ever collected over a mangrove forest, achieving accurate mapping of species on airborne (OA = 95 %, Kappa = 0.93) and spaceborne imagery (OA and Kappa up to 97 % and 0.95, respectively), including the newly-operating hyperspectral DESIS and PRISMA instruments.

Multispectral imagery performs well at very-high to high resolutions (up to 10–20 m) but suffers from the lack of spectral information at medium resolution (30 m). Hyperspectral imagery provided the best results at sub-metric resolution (0.5 m) and satisfactory results at 30-m resolution (OA ≥ 85), and could benefit from implementing spectral unmixing in the latter case. Given the increasing attention accorded to mangroves, remote sensing will undoubtedly become an essential tool to monitor the diversity of these endangered ecosystems in the future. In that respect, efforts should concentrate on evaluating the capabilities of new and upcoming instruments and multisource data combination to improve mangrove species mapping and, more broadly, to meet conservation goals. © 2022 The Author(s)","Deep learning; Mangrove forest; Object-oriented classification; Optical imagery; Pixel-oriented classification; Species mapping","Conservation; Deep learning; Ecosystems; Forestry; Infrared radiation; Optical remote sensing; Pixels; Vegetation mapping; Deep learning; Mangrove forest; Mangrove species; Multispectral imagery; Object oriented classification; Optical imagery; Pixel-oriented; Pixel-oriented classification; Space-borne; Species mapping; Image classification; conservation status; mangrove; mapping method; pixel; satellite imagery; species diversity",Article,Scopus

Information about the proximity of the reconstructed SIF (SIFr) datasets to GPP across land cover types and climatic conditions provides important support for a better application of these products for modelling applications. We conducted a multiscale analysis of four different long-term (12 years, 2007–2018) high-resolution global SIFr datasets (0.05° × 0.05°), namely – CSIF (Contiguous SIF), GOSIF (Global OCO-2 SIF), LUE-SIF (Light Use Efficiency SIF), and HSIF (Harmonized SIF) - at 4-day, 8-day, and monthly time scales and found that for the majority of sites, the SIFr is linearly related to ground-based GPP measurements with the eddy covariance method. While the relationship between SIFr and GPP (i.e., the slope - GPP/SIFr) varied significantly across the SIFr datasets, sites, and land cover types, all four SIFr datasets were unequivocally a better predictor of GPP compared to remotely sensed vegetation indices – NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and EVI (enhanced vegetation index), sensed by the MODIS satellite. Furthermore, we also analyzed SIF-GPP relationships during drought vs non-drought conditions and found that for about 30% of the sites, comprising mostly non-forests site, the SIF-GPP relationship became weaker (decreased R2) with a lower slope during drought conditions compared to non-drought conditions. Among the four different products, the CSIF (at 4-day timescale) and GOSIF (at 8-day timescale) predicted GPP better compared to LUE-SIF and HSIF across all land cover types. Owing to their long-term availability (since 2000 for CSIF and GOSIF), these SIFr datasets combined with proxies of ecosystem properties can be used to appropriately capture vegetation dynamics and the interannual variabilities across a wide range of climatic conditions. © 2022 The Authors","CSIF; Eddy-covariance; GOME-2; GOSIF; HSIF; MODIS; OCO-2","Fluorescence; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Radiometers; Vegetation; Contiguous SIF; Eddy covariance; Global OCO-2 SIF; GOME-2; Gross primary productivity; Harmonized SIF; Land-cover types; MODIS; OCO-2; Solar-induced fluorescences; Drought; eddy covariance; land cover; MODIS",Article,Scopus

This research has developed deep learning hybrid model (i.e., CNN-LSTM) to factor in role of cloud effects integrating the merits of convolutional neural networks with long short-term memory networks to forecast near real-time (i.e., 5-min) PPFD in a sub-tropical region Queensland, Australia. The prescribed CLSTM model is trained with real-time sky images that depict stochastic cloud movements captured through a total sky imager (TSI-440) utilising advanced sky image segmentation to reveal cloud chromatic features into their statistical values, and to purposely factor in the cloud variation to optimise the CLSTM model. The model, with its competing algorithms (i.e., CNN, LSTM, deep neural network, extreme learning machine and multivariate adaptive regression spline), are trained with 17 distinct cloud cover inputs considering the chromaticity of red, blue, thin, and opaque cloud statistics, supplemented by solar zenith angle (SZA) to predict short-term PPFD. The models developed with cloud inputs yield accurate results, outperforming the SZA-based models while the best testing performance is recorded by the objective method (i.e., CLSTM) tested over a 7-day measurement period. Specifically, CLSTM yields a testing performance with correlation coefficient r = 0.92, root mean square error RMSE = 210.31 μ mol of photons m−2 s−1, mean absolute error MAE = 150.24 μ mol of photons m−2 s−1, including a relative error of RRMSE = 24.92% MAPE = 38.01%, and Nash Sutcliffe’s coefficient ENS = 0.85, and Legate and McCabe’s Index LM = 0.68 using cloud cover in addition to the SZA as an input. The study shows the importance of cloud inclusion in forecasting solar radiation and evaluating the risk with practical implications in monitoring solar energy, greenhouses and high-value agricultural operations affected by stochastic behaviour of clouds. Additional methodological refinements such as retraining the CLSTM model for hourly and seasonal time scales may aid in the promotion of agricultural crop farming and environmental risk evaluation applications such as predicting the solar UV index and direct normal solar irradiance for renewable energy monitoring systems. © 2022, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Photosynthetic photon flux density; Photosynthetic radiation; Risk evaluation; Solar radiation modelling; Stochastic cloud effects","Brain; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Electric power transmission networks; Errors; Eye movements; Forecasting; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Mean square error; Photons; Photovoltaic effects; Risk assessment; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Visualization; Cloud effects; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Photosynthetic photon flux densities; Photosynthetic radiation; Risk evaluation; Solar radiation model; Solar zenith angle; Stochastic cloud effect; Stochastics; Image segmentation; artificial neural network; cloud cover; forecasting method; photon flux density; prediction; risk assessment; solar radiation; stochasticity",Article,Scopus

They are mainly designed at a specific spatial scale, the field. But with the new spatial data being made available in modern agriculture, they are being more and more applied at multiple and changing scales. These applications range from typically at broader scales, to perform regional or national studies, or at finer scales to develop modern site-specific management approaches. These new approaches to the application of crop models raise new questions concerning the evaluation of their performance, particularly for downscaled applications. This article first reviews the reasons why practitioners decide to spatialize crop models and the main methods they have used to do this, which questions the best place of the spatialization process in the modelling framework. A strong focus is then given to the evaluation of these spatialized crop models. Evaluation metrics, including the consideration of dedicated sensitivity indices are reviewed from the published studies. Using a simple example of a spatialized crop model being used to define management zones in precision viticulture, it is shown that classical model evaluation involving aspatial indices (e.g. the RMSE) is not sufficient to characterize the model performance in this context. A focus is made at the end of the review on potentialities that a complementary evaluation could bring in a precision agriculture context. © 2022, The Author(s).","Crop model uncertainty; Scaling methods; Sensitivity analysis; Spatial pattern; Spatialization","numerical model; precision agriculture; spatial data; viticulture",Review,Scopus

Effective management requires data collection over large spatio-temporal scales, readily accessible and integrated information from monitoring, and tools to support decision-making. However, there are many roadblocks to achieving adequate and timely information on both the effectiveness, and long-term success of conservation efforts, including limited funding, inadequate sampling, and data processing bottlenecks. These factors can result in ineffective, or even detrimental, management decisions in already impacted ecosystems. An automated approach facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) provides conservation managers with a toolkit that can help alleviate a number of these issues by reducing the monitoring bottlenecks and long-term costs of monitoring. Automating the collection, transfer, and processing of data provides managers access to greater information, thereby facilitating timely and effective management. Incorporating automation and big data availability into a decision support system with a user-friendly interface also enables effective adaptive management. We summarise the current state of artificial intelligence and automation techniques used in marine science and use examples in other disciplines to identify existing and potentially transferable methods that can enable automated monitoring and improve predictive modelling capabilities to support decision making. We also discuss emerging technologies that are likely to be useful as research in computer science and associated technologies continues to develop and become more accessible. Our perspective highlights the potential of AI and big data analytics for supporting decision-making, but also points to important knowledge gaps in multiple areas of the automation processes. These current challenges should be prioritised in conservation research to move toward implementing AI and automation in conservation management for a more informed understanding of impacted ecosystems to result in successful outcomes for conservation managers. We conclude that the current research and emphasis on automated and AI assisted tools in several scientific disciplines may mean the future of monitoring and management in marine science is facilitated and improved by the implementation of automation.

Existing spatial interpolation methods have relatively low accuracy, and the resolution of available long-term gridded products of air temperature for China is coarse. Point observations from meteorological stations can provide long-term air temperature data series but cannot represent spatially continuous information. Here, we devised a method for spatial interpolation of air temperature data from meteorological stations based on powerful machine learning tools. First, to determine the optimal method for interpolation of air temperature data, we employed three machine learning models: random forest, support vector machine, and Gaussian process regression. A comparison of the mean absolute error, root mean square error, coefficient of determination, and residuals revealed that a Gaussian process regression had high accuracy and clearly outperformed the other two models regarding the interpolation of monthly maximum, minimum, and mean air temperatures. The machine learning methods were compared with three traditional methods used frequently for spatial interpolation: inverse distance weighting, ordinary kriging, and ANUSPLIN (Australian National University Spline). Results showed that the Gaussian process regression model had higher accuracy and greater robustness than the traditional methods regarding interpolation of monthly maximum, minimum, and mean air temperatures in each month. A comparison with the TerraClimate (Monthly Climate and Climatic Water Balance for Global Terrestrial Surfaces), FLDAS (Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System), and ERA5 (ECMWF, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, Climate Reanalysis) data sets revealed that the accuracy of the temperature data generated using the Gaussian process regression model was higher. Finally, using the Gaussian process regression method, we produced a long-term (January 1951 to December 2020) gridded monthly air temperature data set, with 1 km resolution and high accuracy for China, which we named GPRChinaTemp1km. The data set consists of three variables: monthly mean air temperature, monthly maximum air temperature, and monthly minimum air temperature. The obtained GPRChinaTemp1km data were used to analyse the spatiotemporal variations of air temperature using Theil-Sen median trend analysis in combination with the Mann-Kendall test. It was found that the monthly mean and minimum air temperatures across China were characterised by a significant trend of increase in each month, whereas monthly maximum air temperatures showed a more spatially heterogeneous pattern, with significant increase, non-significant increase, and non-significant decrease. The GPRChinaTemp1km data set is publicly available at 10.5281/zenodo.5112122 (He et al., 2021a) for monthly maximum air temperature, at 10.5281/zenodo.5111989 (He et al., 2021b) for monthly mean air temperature, and at 10.5281/zenodo.5112232 (He et al., 2021c) for monthly minimum air temperature. © 2022 Copernicus GmbH.

Accurately estimating phenotyping traits of breeding maize at plot scale helps to promote gene mining for specific traits and provides a guarantee for accelerating the breeding of superior varieties. Constructing an efficient and accurate estimation model is the key to the application of UAV-based multiple sensors data. This study aims to apply the ensemble learning model to improve the feasibility and accuracy of estimating maize phenotypic traits using UAV-based red-green-blue (RGB) and multispectral sensors. The UAV images of four growth stages were obtained, respectively. The reflectance of visible light bands, canopy coverage, plant height (PH), and texture information were extracted from RGB images, and the vegetation indices were calculated from multispectral images. We compared and analyzed the estimation accuracy of single-type feature and multiple features for LAI (leaf area index), fresh weight (FW), and dry weight (DW) of maize. The basic models included ridge regression (RR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Gaussian process (GP), and K-neighbor network (K-NN). The ensemble learning models included stacking and Bayesian model averaging (BMA). The results showed that the ensemble learning model improved the accuracy and stability of maize phenotypic traits estimation. Among the features extracted from UAV RGB images, the highest accuracy was obtained by the combination of spectrum, structure, and texture features. The model had the best accuracy constructed using all features of two sensors. The estimation accuracies of ensemble learning models, including stacking and BMA, were higher than those of the basic models. The coefficient of determination (R2) of the optimal validation results were 0.852, 0.888, and 0.929 for LAI, FW, and DW, respectively. Therefore, the combination of UAV-based multisource data and ensemble learning model could accurately estimate phenotyping traits of breeding maize at plot scale.

Machine learning is another area of research that has successfully been applied to solve various networking problems such as routing, traffic engineering, resource allocation, and security. Recently, we have seen a surge in the application of ML-based techniques for the improvement of various IoT applications. Although, big data analytics and machine learning are extensively researched, there is a lack of study that exclusively focus on the evolution of ML-based techniques for big data analysis in the IoT healthcare sector. In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive review on the application of machine learning techniques for big data analysis in the healthcare sector. Furthermore, strength and weaknesses of existing techniques along with various research challenges are highlighted. Our study will provide an insight for healthcare practitioners and government agencies to keep themselves well-equipped with the latest trends in ML-based big data analytics for smart healthcare. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Big data; Data analytics; Healthcare; Internet of things; Machine learning; Sensing","Advanced Analytics; Behavioral research; Big data; Data Analytics; Data handling; Data mining; Health care; Machine learning; Wearable technology; Context-oriented information; Government agencies; Internet of Things (IOT); Machine learning techniques; Networking problems; Psychological health; Research challenges; Smart healthcare systems; Internet of things",Article,Scopus

In particular, machine learning algorithms have been applied to UAV‐based remote sensing data for enhancing the UAV capabilities of various applications. This systematic review was performed on studies through a statistical meta‐analysis of UAV applications along with machine learning algorithms in agro‐environmental monitoring. For this purpose, a total number of 163 peer-reviewed articles published in 13 high‐impact remote sensing journals over the past 20 years were reviewed focusing on several features, including study area, application, sensor type, platform type, and spatial resolution. The meta‐analysis revealed that 62% and 38% of the studies applied regression and classification models, respectively. Visible sensor technology was the most frequently used sensor with the highest overall accuracy among classification articles. Regarding regression models, linear regression and random forest were the most frequently applied models in UAV remote sensing imagery processing. Finally, the results of this study confirm that applying machine learning approaches on UAV imagery produces fast and reliable results. Agriculture, forestry, and grassland mapping were found as the top three UAV applications in this review, in 42%, 22%, and 8% of the studies, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.

The UMRB is an important ecosystem located in the north central U.S. that is experiencing a range of ecological stresses. Specifically, testing of SWAT was performed for: (1) Hargreaves (HG) and Penman-Monteith (PM) PET methods, and (2) Livneh, National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) and Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) climate datasets. The Livneh-PM combination resulted in the highest average annual water yield of 380.6 mm versus the lowest estimated water yield of 193.9 mm for the Livneh-HG combination, in response to 23-year uncalibrated simulations. Higher annual ET and PET values were predicted with HG method versus the PM method for all three weather datasets in response to the uncalibrated simulations, due primarily to higher HG-based estimates during the growing season. Based on these results, it was found that the HG method is the preferred PET option for the UMRB. Initial calibration of SWAT was performed using the Livneh data and HG method for three Mississippi River main stem gauge sites, which was followed by spatial validation at 10 other gauge sites located within the UMRB stream network. Overall satisfactory results were found for the calibration and validation gauge sites, with the majority of R2 values ranging between 0.61 and 0.82, Nash-Sutcliffe modeling efficiency (NSE) values ranging between 0.50 and 0.79, and Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) values ranging between 0.61 and 0.84. The results of an additional experimental suite of six scenarios, which represented different combinations of climate data sets and calibrated parameters, revealed that suggested statistical criteria were again satisfied by the different scenario combinations. Overall, the PRISM data exhibited the strongest reliability for the UMRB. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate data sets; Hargreaves method; HAWQS; Penman-Monteith method; SWAT; UMRB","Calibration; Data streams; Ecology; Efficiency; Gages; Prisms; Rivers; Soil quality; Water quality; Watersheds; Climate data; Hargreaves methods; HAWQS; Penman-Monteith method; SWAT; UMRB; Climate models; sea water; data set; evapotranspiration; soil and water assessment tool; water yield; aquatic environment; Article; calibration; evapotranspiration; hydrologic and water quality system; hydrological model; land use; Mississippi; prediction; priority journal; river basin; seasonal variation; simulation; Soil and Water Assessment Tool model; Mississinewa Basin; United States",Article,Scopus

Modeling and predicting the biomass and yield of individual plants at the farm scale represents a major challenge in precision agriculture, particularly when salinity and other abiotic stresses may play a role. Here, we evaluate a diversity panel of the wild tomato species (Solanum pimpinellifolium) through both field and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based phenotyping of 600 control and 600 salt-treated plants. The study objective was to predict fresh shoot mass, tomato fruit numbers, and yield mass at harvest based on a range of variables derived from the UAV imagery. UAV-based red–green–blue (RGB) imageries collected 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 weeks before harvest were also used to determine if prediction accuracies varied between control and salt-treated plants. Multispectral UAV-based imagery was also collected 1 and 2 weeks prior to harvest to further explore predictive insights. In order to estimate the end of season biomass and yield, a random forest machine learning approach was implemented using UAV-imagery-derived predictors as input variables. Shape features derived from the UAV, such as plant area, border length, width, and length, were found to have the highest importance in the predictions, followed by vegetation indices and the entropy texture measure. The multispectral UAV imagery collected 2 weeks prior to harvest produced the highest explained variances for fresh shoot mass (87.95%), fruit numbers (63.88%), and yield mass per plant (66.51%). The RGB UAV imagery produced very similar results to those of the multispectral UAV dataset, with the explained variance reducing as a function of increasing time to harvest. The results showed that predicting the yield of salt-stressed plants produced higher accuracies when the models excluded control plants, whereas predicting the yield of control plants was not affected by the inclusion of salt-stressed plants within the models. This research demonstrates that it is possible to predict the average biomass and yield up to 8 weeks prior to harvest within 4.23% of field-based measurements and up to 4 weeks prior to harvest at the individual plant level. Results from this work may be useful in providing guidance for yield forecasting of healthy and salt-stressed tomato plants, which in turn may inform growing practices, logistical planning, and sales operations. © Copyright © 2020 Johansen, Morton, Malbeteau, Aragon, Al-Mashharawi, Ziliani, Angel, Fiene, Negrão, Mousa, Tester and McCabe.","biomass; multi-spectral; random forest; RGB; salinity; tomato plants; UAV; yield",,Article,Scopus

However, these are complex, highly coupled long-term processes that are difficult to observe or explore through empirical science alone. Models are required that capture the main anthropogenic disturbances, whilst operating across regions and long timescales, simulating both natural and agricultural environments, and shifts among these. Many biogeochemical models neglect agriculture or interactions between carbon and nutrient cycles, which is surprising given the scale of intervention in nitrogen and phosphorus cycles introduced by agriculture. This gap is addressed here, using a plant-soil model that simulates integrated soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus (CNP) cycling across natural, semi-natural and agricultural environments. The model is rigorously tested both spatially and temporally using data from long-term agricultural experiments across temperate environments. The model proved capable of reproducing the magnitude of and trends in soil nutrient stocks, and yield responses to nutrient addition. The model has potential to simulate anthropogenic effects on biogeochemical cycles across northern Europe, for long timescales (centuries) without site-specific calibration, using easily accessible input data. The results demonstrate that weatherable P from parent material has a considerable effect on modern pools of soil C and N, despite significant perturbation of nutrient cycling from agricultural practices, highlighting the need to integrate both geological and agricultural processes to understand effects of land-use change on food security, C storage and nutrient sustainability. The results suggest that an important process or source of P is currently missing in our understanding of agricultural biogeochemical cycles. The model could not explain how yields were sustained in plots with low P fertiliser addition. We suggest that plant access to organic P is a key uncertainty warranting further research, particularly given sustainability concerns surrounding rock sources of P fertiliser. © 2020 The Authors","Agriculture; Land-use change; Modelling; Plant-soil biogeochemistry; Sustainability","Agriculture; Carbon; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Fertilizers; Food storage; Food supply; Forestry; Land use; Models; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Plants (botany); Soils; Sustainable development; Agricultural environments; Agricultural practices; Anthropogenic disturbance; Biogeochemical cycling; Land-use change; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Site specific calibration; Soil biogeochemistry; Biogeochemistry; carbon; nitrogen; phosphorus; agricultural practice; biogeochemical cycle; biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; land use change; nitrogen cycle; phosphorus cycle; source apportionment; sustainability; agriculture; Article; biogeochemical cycling; carbon cycling; environmental parameters; environmental sustainability; food security; geographic distribution; land use; mathematical model; nitrogen cycling; nitrogen deposition; nutrient cycle; phosphorus cycling; priority journal; soil fertilization; Europe",Article,Scopus

Based on the results, the accurate classification of land use or land cover and the accurate extraction of environmental factors are the basis for remote sensing monitoring of the ecological environment in mining areas. In terms of the extraction of ecological factors, vegetation extraction is relatively advanced in contrast to the extraction of animal and microbial data. For the monitoring of environmental conditions of mining areas, sophisticated methods are available to identify pollution levels of vegetation and to accurately monitor soil quality. However, the methods for water and air pollution monitoring in mining areas still need to be improved. These limitations considerably impede the application of remote sensing monitoring in mining areas.

However, their impacts and links to terrestrial water storage (TWS) in general, have not been studied. This study presents the pioneer results of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) of TWS derived from both global reanalysis data (1980–2015) and GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) (2002–2014) with SST fields. The main issues discussed include, (i) oceanic hot spots that impact on TWS over tropical West Africa (TWA) based on CCA, (ii) long term changes in model and global reanalysis data (soil moisture, TWS, and groundwater) and the influence of climate variability on these hydrological indicators, and (iii) the hydrological characteristics of the Equatorial region of Africa (i.e., the Congo basin) based on GRACE-derived TWS, river discharge, and precipitation. Results of the CCA diagnostics show that El-Niño Southern Oscillation related equatorial Pacific SST fluctuations is a major index of climate variability identified in the main portion of the CCA procedure that indicates a significant association with long term TWS reanalysis data over TWA (r = 0.50, ρ &lt; 0.05). Based on Mann-Kendall's statistics, the study found fairly large long term declines (ρ &lt; 0.05) in TWS and soil moisture (1982 − 2015), mostly over the Congo basin, which coincided with warming of the land surface and the surrounding oceans. Meanwhile, some parts of the Sahel show significant wetting (rainfall, soil moisture, groundwater, and TWS) trends during the same period (1982–2015) and aligns with the ongoing narratives of rainfall recovery in the region. Results of singular spectral analysis and regression confirm that multi-annual changes in the Congo River discharge explained a considerable proportion of variability in GRACE-hydrological signal over the Congo basin (r = 0.86 and R2 = 0.70, ρ &lt; 0.05). Finally, leading orthogonal modes of MERRA and GRACE-TWS over TWA show significant association with global SST anomalies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Canonical correlation analysis; Climate variability; Congo basin; ENSO; Land water storage; Rainfall","Atmospheric pressure; Climate models; Climatology; Correlation methods; Digital storage; Groundwater; Moisture; Oceanography; Rain; Soil moisture; Soils; Spectrum analysis; Surface waters; Wetting; Canonical correlation analysis; Climate variability; Congo basins; ENSO; Land water storage; Climate change",Article,Scopus

Forty percent of this water is derived from groundwater. Approximately 20%-30% of the groundwater sources are saline and 20%-50% of global irrigation water is salinized. Salinization reduces crop yields and the number of crop varieties which can be grown on an arable holding. Structured ZVI (zero valent iron, Fe0 pellets desalinate water by storing the removed ions as halite (NaCl) within their porosity. This allows an ""Aquifer Treatment Zone"" to be created within an aquifer, (penetrated by a number of wells (containing ZVI pellets)). This zone is used to supply partially desalinated water directly from a saline aquifer. A modeled reconfigured aquifer producing a continuous flow (e.g., 20 m3/day, 7300 m3/a) of partially desalinated irrigation water is used to illustrate the impact of porosity, permeability, aquifer heterogeneity, abstraction rate, Aquifer Treatment Zone size, aquifer thickness, optional reinjection, leakage and flow by-pass on the product water salinity. This desalination approach has no operating costs (other than abstraction costs (and ZVI regeneration)) and may potentially be able to deliver a continuous flow of partially desalinated water (30%-80% NaCl reduction) for $0.05-0.5/m3. © 2017 by the authors.","Aquifer; Desalination; Irrigation; Salinization; Zero valent iron (ZVI, Fe0)",,Article,Scopus

This need for high-resolution data leads to apply projection techniques called downscaling. Downscaling can be performed according to two approaches: dynamical and statistical models. The latter approach is constituted by various statistical families conceptually different. If several studies have made some intercomparisons of existing downscaling models, none of them included all those families and approaches in a manner that all the models are equally considered. To this end, the present study conducts an intercomparison exercise under the EURO- and MED-CORDEX initiative hindcast framework. Six Statistical Downscaling Models (SDMs) and five Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are compared in terms of precipitation outputs. The downscaled simulations are driven by the ERAinterim reanalyses over the 1989–2008 period over a common area at 0.44° of resolution. The 11 models are evaluated according to four aspects of the precipitation: occurrence, intensity, as well as spatial and temporal properties. For each aspect, one or several indicators are computed to discriminate the models. The results indicate that marginal properties of rain occurrence and intensity are better modelled by stochastic and resampling-based SDMs, while spatial and temporal variability are better modelled by RCMs and resampling-based SDM. These general conclusions have to be considered with caution because they rely on the chosen indicators and could change when considering other specific criteria. The indicators suit specific purpose and therefore the model evaluation results depend on the end-users point of view and how they intend to use with model outputs. Nevertheless, building on previous intercomparison exercises, this study provides a consistent intercomparison framework, including both SDMs and RCMs, which is designed to be flexible, i.e., other models and indicators can easily be added. More generally, this framework provides a tool to select the downscaling model to be used according to the statistical properties of the local-scale climate data to drive properly specific impact models. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","CORDEX; Dynamical downscaling; Intercomparison; Precipitation; Statistical downscaling","climate modeling; downscaling; hindcasting; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; spatial variation; statistical analysis; temporal variation",Article,Scopus

Calculation of crop N uptake and offtake requires estimates of yield of crop product (e.g. grain or beans) and crop residues (e.g. straw or stover) and the N concentration of both components. Yields of crop products are often reasonably well known, but those of crop residues are not. While the harvest index (HI) can be used to interpolate the quantity of crop residue from available data on crop product yields, harvest indices are known to vary across locations, as do N concentrations of residues and crop products. The increasing availability of crop data and advanced statistical and machine learning methods present us with an opportunity to move towards more locally relevant estimates of crop harvest index and N concentrations using more readily available data. The aim of this study was to investigate whether improved estimates of maize crop HI and N concentrations of crop products and crop residues can be based on crop data available at the global scale, such as crop yield, fertilizer application rates and estimates of yield potential. Experiments from 1487 different locations conducted across 31 countries were used to test various prediction models. Predictions from mixed-effects models and random forest machine learning models provided reasonable levels of prediction accuracy (R2 of between 0.33 and 0.68), with the random forest method having greater accuracy. Although the mixed-effects prediction models had lower prediction accuracy than random forest, they did provide better interpretability. Selection of which method to use will depend on the objective of the user. Here, the random forest and mixed-effects methods were applied to N in maize, but could equally be applied to other crops and other nutrients, if data becomes available. This will enable obtaining more locally relevant estimates of crop nutrient offtake to improve estimates of nutrient balances and nutrient use efficiency at national, regional or global levels, as part of strategies towards more sustainable nutrient management. © 2022 The Authors","Budget; Harvest index; Maize; Mixed-effect model; Nutrient; Nutrient removal; Nutrient use efficiency; Random forest","crop residue; fertilizer application; machine learning; nitrogen; nutrient use efficiency",Article,Scopus

In this work, we investigate the fusion of multiple probability density functions (pdfs) of a continuous random variable or vector. Although the case of continuous random variables and the problem of pdf fusion frequently arise in multisensor signal processing, statistical inference, and machine learning, a universally accepted method for pdf fusion does not exist. The diversity of approaches, perspectives, and solutions related to pdf fusion motivates a unified presentation of the theory and methodology of the field. We discuss three different approaches to fusing pdfs. In the axiomatic approach, the fusion rule is defined indirectly by a set of properties (axioms). In the optimization approach, it is the result of minimizing an objective function that involves an information-theoretic divergence or a distance measure. In the supra-Bayesian approach, the fusion center interprets the pdfs to be fused as random observations. Our work is partly a survey, reviewing in a structured and coherent fashion many of the concepts and methods that have been developed in the literature. In addition, we present new results for each of the three approaches. Our original contributions include new fusion rules, axioms, and axiomatic and optimization-based characterizations; a new formulation of supra-Bayesian fusion in terms of finite-dimensional parametrizations; and a study of supra-Bayesian fusion of posterior pdfs for linear Gaussian models. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Chernoff fusion; covariance intersection; forecasting; Hölder mean; information fusion; Kullback-Leibler divergence; linear Gaussian model; model averaging; multisensor signal processing; pooling function; probabilistic machine learning; probabilistic opinion pooling; sensor network; supra-Bayesian fusion; target tracking.; α-divergence","Bayesian networks; Data handling; Gaussian distribution; Information fusion; Machine learning; Random variables; Sensor networks; Signal processing; Target tracking; Bayesian fusion; Chernoff fusion; Covariance intersection; Holder mean; Kullback Leibler divergence; Linear Gaussian model; Model averaging; Pooling function; Probabilistic machine learning; Probabilistic opinion pooling; Probabilistics; Sensors network; Supra-bayesian fusion; Target tracking.; Targets tracking; Α-divergence; Probability density function",Article,Scopus

However, the degree to which incoming solar radiation and the structure of the canopy rather than leaf physiology contribute to SIF variations is still not well characterized. Therefore, we investigated relationships between SIF and variables that at least partly capture the canopy structure component of SIF. For this, we relied on high-quality SIF observations from ground-based instruments, high-resolution airborne SIF imagery and the most recent satellite SIF products to cover large ranges in spatial and temporal resolution and diverse ecosystems. We found that the canopy structure-related near-infrared reflectance of vegetation multiplied by incoming sunlight (NIRVP) is a robust proxy for far-red SIF across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Our findings indicate that contributions from leaf physiology to SIF variability are small compared to the structure and radiation components. Also, NIRVP captured spatio-temporal patterns of canopy photosynthesis better than SIF, which seems to be mostly due to the greater retrieval noise of SIF. Compared to other relevant structural SIF proxies, NIRVP showed more robust relationships to SIF, especially at the global scale. Our results highlight the promise of using widely available NIRVP data for vegetation monitoring and also indicate the potential of using SIF and NIRVP in combination to extract physiological information from SIF. © 2021 The Authors","GPP; Gross primary productivity; Near-infrared reflectance of vegetation; NIRv; Photosynthesis; Remote sensing; SIF; Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence","Chlorophyll; Fluorescence; Infrared devices; Photosynthesis; Physiology; Reflection; Satellite imagery; Vegetation; Chlorophyll fluorescence; GPP; Gross primary productivity; Near infra-red reflectances; Near infrared reflectance; Near-infrared reflectance of vegetation; NIRv; Remote-sensing; Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Remote sensing; chlorophyll; ecophysiology; fluorescence; photosynthesis; physiology; satellite imagery; solar radiation",Article,Scopus

Remote sensing can detect and map the presence of weeds in various spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. This review aims to show the current and future trends of UAV applications in weed detection in the crop field. This study systematically searched the original articles published from 1 January 2016 to 18 June 2021 in the databases of Scopus, ScienceDirect, Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux (CAB) Direct, and Web of Science (WoS) using Boolean string: “weed” AND “Unmanned Aerial Vehicle” OR “UAV” OR “drone”. Out of the papers identified, 144 eligible studies did meet our inclusion criteria and were evaluated. Most of the studies (i.e., 27.42%) on weed detection were carried out during the seedling stage of the growing cycle for the crop. Most of the weed images were captured using red, green, and blue (RGB) camera, i.e., 48.28% and main classification algorithm was machine learning techniques, i.e., 47.90%. This review initially highlighted articles from the literature that includes the crops’ typical phenology stage, reference data, type of sensor/camera, classification methods, and current UAV applications in detecting and mapping weed for different types of crop. This study then provides an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of each sensor and algorithm and tries to identify research gaps by providing a brief outlook at the potential areas of research concerning the benefit of this technology in agricultural industries. Integrated weed management, coupled with UAV application improves weed monitoring in a more efficient and environmentally-friendly way. Overall, this review demonstrates the scientific information required to achieve sustainable weed management, so as to implement UAV platform in the real agricultural contexts. © 2021 by the authors.

The rapid, accurate and nondestructive monitoring of biomass is the key to smart agriculture and precision agriculture. Traditional detection methods are based on destructive measurements. Although satellite remote sensing, manned airborne equipment, and vehicle-mounted equipment can nondestructively collect measurements, they are limited by low accuracy, poor flexibility, and high cost. As nondestructive remote sensing equipment with high precision, high flexibility, and low-cost, unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have been widely used to monitor crop biomass. In this review, UAS platforms and sensors, biomass indices, and data analysis methods are presented. The improvements of UAS in monitoring crop biomass in recent years are introduced, and multisensor fusion, multi-index fusion, the consideration of features not directly related to monitoring biomass, the adoption of advanced algorithms and the use of low-cost sensors are reviewed to highlight the potential for monitoring crop biomass with UAS. Considering the progress made to solve this type of problem, we also suggest some directions for future research. Furthermore, it is expected that the challenge of UAS promotion will be overcome in the future, which is conducive to the realization of smart agriculture and precision agriculture. © Copyright © 2021 Wang, Liu, Wang, Fan, Tian, Qiao and Li.","crop biomass; precision agriculture; remote sensing; smart agriculture; unmanned aerial systems; unmanned aerial vehicle",,Review,Scopus

We discuss the complementarities among these methods with an emphasis on integration into tools that utilize operations research and systems approaches to help plant breeders rapidly and optimally design new cultivars under extant time, cost, and environmental constraints. In illustrating this potential, we demonstrate the interconnectedness and probabilistic nature of plant breeding objectives and highlight research opportunities to refine and combine knowledge across multiple disciplines.

Genomic selection relies on advances in machine learning and the availability of genotyping data to predict agronomically relevant phenotypic traits. Here we provide a systematic review of machine learning approaches applied for genomic selection of single and multiple traits in major crops in the past decade. We emphasize the need to gather data on intermediate phenotypes, e.g. metabolite, protein, and gene expression levels, along with developments of modeling techniques that can lead to further improvements of genomic selection. In addition, we provide a critical view of factors that affect genomic selection, with attention to transferability of models between different environments.

Farmers can adapt their management, traders or insurers their pricing schemes, suppliers their stocks, logistic companies their routes, national authorities their food balance sheets to guide import or export and, finally, international aid organizations can mobilize reliefs. Evidence has grown in the literature that such forecasts with a meaningful lead time are possible on various geographic scales and for a broad range of crops. Here, we present a systematic review of the methods applied in end-of-season yield forecasting and three frequently used data sources: weather data, satellite data and crop masks. Our literature database comprises 362 studies (2004–2019) which were evaluated regarding methods, crops, regions, data sources, lead time and performance. Moreover, we present 24 sources of real-time and predictive weather data, 21 sources of remote sensing data and 16 crop masks. Yield forecasting in our literature sample has been performed for 44 crops in 71 countries, also including many non-staple crops, but with an apparent bias in regions and crops. Forecasting performance depends on various factors, including crop, region, method, lead time to harvest and input diversity. Our systematic review supports a broader application of locally successful approaches at larger scales by providing a comprehensive, accessible compendium of necessary information for yield forecasting. We discuss improvement potentials with respect to methodological approaches and available data sources. We additionally suggest standardization procedures for future forecasting studies and encourage studying additional crops and geographic regions. Implications of forecasts for different target groups on different scales and the adaptation towards climate change are also discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Crop mask; Improvement suggestions; Literature database; Remote sensing; Seasonal crop yield forecasting; Weather products","climate change; crop plant; crop yield; data set; geographical region; methodology; satellite data",Review,Scopus

Salinity limits the growth and productivity of crops worldwide. Na+/H+ antiporters play a key role during the plant development and in its tolerance to salt stress. The aim of the present study was a genome-wide characterization and expression pattern analysis under the salinity stress of the sodium-proton antiporter (NHX) of Gossypium barbadense in comparison with Gossypium hirsutum. In G. barbadense, 25 NHX genes were identified on the basis of the Na+_H+ exchanger domain. All except one of the G. barbadense NHX transporters have an Amiloride motif that is a known inhibitor of Na+ ions in plants. A phylogenetic analysis inferred three classes of GbNHX genes—viz., Vac (GbNHX1, 2 and 4), Endo (GbNHX6), and PM (GbNHX7). A high number of the stress-related cis-acting elements observed in promoters show their role in tolerance against abiotic stresses. The Ka/Ks values show that the majority of GbNHX genes are subjected to strong purifying selection under the course of evolution. To study the functional divergence of G. barbadense NHX transporters, the real-time gene expression was analyzed under salt stress in the root, stem, and leaf tissues. In G. barbadense, the expression was higher in the stem, while in G. hirsutum the leaf and root showed a high expression. Moreover, our results revealed that NHX2 homologues in both species have a high expression under salinity stress at higher time intervals, followed by NHX7. The protein-protein prediction study revealed that GbNHX7 is involved in the CBL-CIPK protein interaction pathway. Our study also provided valuable information explaining the molecular mechanism of Na+ transport for the further functional study of Gossypium NHX genes. © 2020 by the authors.

In order to meet a variety of demands, suitable cultivars and innovative breeding methods need to be developed. Breeding methods have changed over time following the advance of genetics. With the advent of new sequencing technology in the early 21st century, predictive breeding, such as genomic selection (GS), emerged when large-scale genomic information became available. GS shows good predictive ability for the selection of individuals with traits of interest even for quantitative traits by using various types of the whole genome-scanning markers, breaking away from the limitations of marker-assisted selection (MAS). In the current review, we briefly describe the history of breeding techniques, each breeding method, various statistical models applied to GS and methods to increase the GS efficiency. Consequently, we intend to propose and define the term digital breeding through this review article. Digital breeding is to develop a predictive breeding methods such as GS at a higher level, aiming to minimize human intervention by automatically proceeding breeding design, propagating breeding populations, and to make selections in consideration of various environments, climates, and topography during the breeding process. We also classified the phases of digital breeding based on the technologies and methods applied to each phase.

Machine vision is one of the most popular parts of machine learning and has been widely used where advanced automation and control have been required. The trend has shifted from classical image processing and machine learning techniques to modern artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) methods. Based on large training datasets and pre-trained models, DL-based methods have proven to be more accurate than previous traditional techniques. Machine vision has wide applications in agriculture, including the detection of weeds and pests in crops. Variation in lighting conditions, failures to transfer learning, and object occlusion constitute key challenges in this domain. Recently, DL has gained much attention due to its advantages in object detection, classification, and feature extraction. DL algorithms can automatically extract information from large amounts of data used to model complex problems and is, therefore, suitable for detecting and classifying weeds and crops. We present a systematic review of AI-based systems to detect weeds, emphasizing recent trends in DL. Various DL methods are discussed to clarify their overall potential, usefulness, and performance.

One that involves the sustainable use of natural resources without adverse environmental impacts by relying less on production inputs whether it be agrochemicals or machineries. We examined the extent to which regenerative agriculture, permaculture, and smart technology have evolved in response to sustainable agricultural production, agricultural decision support system, and overall global food security. Collectively, regenerative agriculture and permaculture are semi-closed holistic systems approach designed to reduce or eliminate dependence on external inputs (e.g., chemicals) which restores and maintains natural systems (e.g., soil quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem services). We suggest that fully embracing modern regenerative agriculture as well as integrated permaculture will improve soil health, ecosystem biodiversity, land and resource conservation, agricultural sustainability, and food security. Identifying and implementing practices towards regenerative agriculture, integrated permaculture, digital agriculture, and sustainable agricultural management utilizing modern agricultural technologies infused with data science (artificial intelligence [AI] or machine learning [ML]) is critical. © 2021 The Authors.

These and other digitalization-enabling technologies are generating a massive amount of data with enormous potential to manage supply chains more efficiently and sustainably. Nevertheless, the intricate patterns and complexity embedded in large volumes of data present a challenge for systematic human expert analysis. In such a datadriven context, Computational Intelligence (CI) has achieved significant momentum to analyze, mine, and extract the underlying data information, or solve complex optimization problems, striking a balance between productive efficiency and sustainability of food supply systems. Although some recent studies have sorted the CI literature in this field, they are mainly oriented towards a single family of CI methods (a group of methods that share common characteristics) and review their application in specific FSC stages. As such, there is a gap in identifying and classifying FSC problems from a broader perspective, encompassing the various families of CI methods that can be applied in different stages (from production to retailing) and identifying the problems that arise in these stages from a CI perspective. This paper presents a new and comprehensive taxonomy of FSC problems (associated with agriculture, fish farming, and livestock) from a CI approach; that is, it defines FSC problems (from production to retail) and categorizes them based on how they can be modeled from a CI point of view. Furthermore, we review the CI approaches that are more commonly used in each stage of the FSC and in their corresponding categories of problems. We also introduce a set of guidelines to help FSC researchers and practitioners to decide on suitable families of methods when addressing any particular problems they might encounter. Finally, based on the proposed taxonomy, we identify and discuss challenges and research opportunities that the community should explore to enhance the contributions that CI can bring to the digitization of the FSC. © 2021 by the authors.

Although PM concentrations have been assessed using air quality monitoring stations or modelling, few studies have measured indoor PM in large-scale birth cohorts. The Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS) measured indoor and outdoor air quality in approximately 5000 households when the participating children were aged 1.5 and 3 years. PM was collected using portable pumps for 7 days (total of 24 h), inside and outside each home. Prediction models for indoor PM concentrations were built using data collected at age 1.5 years and post-validated against data collected at age 3 years. Median indoor/outdoor PM2.5 and PM10–2.5 concentrations at age 1.5 years [3 years] were 12.9/12.7 [12.5/11.3] μg/m3 and 5.0/6.3 [5.1/6.1] μg/m3, respectively. Random forest regression analysis found that the major predictors of indoor PM2.5 were indoor PM10–2.5, outdoor PM2.5, indoor smoking, observable smoke and indoor/outdoor temperature. Indoor PM2.5, outdoor PM10–2.5, indoor humidity and opening room windows were important predictors of indoor PM10–2.5 concentrations. Indoor benzene, acetaldehyde, ozone and nitrogen dioxide concentrations were also found to predict indoor PM2.5 and PM10–2.5 concentrations, possibly due to the formation of secondary organic aerosols. These findings demonstrate the importance of reducing outdoor PM concentrations, avoiding indoor smoking, using air cleaner in applicable and diminishing sources of VOCs that could form secondary organic aerosols, and the resulting models can be used to predict indoor PM concentrations for the rest of the JECS cohort. © 2021 The Author(s)","Birth cohort; Household characteristics; Indoor air; Particulate matter; Volatile organic compounds","acetaldehyde; benzene; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air quality; concentration (composition); indoor air; morbidity; mortality; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; risk factor; smoke; spatiotemporal analysis; air quality; ambient air; Article; household; humidity; Japan; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; prediction; priority journal; random forest; secondary organic aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; child; environmental monitoring; human; indoor air pollution; infant; Japan; particle size; particulate matter; preschool child; Japan; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; Child; Child, Preschool; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Infant; Japan; Particle Size; Particulate Matter",Article,Scopus

The increasing amount and variety of data captured and obtained by these emerging technologies in IoT offer the rice smart farming strategy new abilities to predict changes and identify opportunities. The quality of data collected from sensors greatly influences the performance of the modelling processes using ML algorithms. These three elements (e.g., BD, ML and IoT) have been used tremendously to improve all areas of rice production processes in agriculture, which transform traditional rice farming practices into a new era of rice smart farming or rice precision agriculture. In this paper, we perform a survey of the latest research on intelligent data processing technology applied in agriculture, particularly in rice production. We describe the data captured and elaborate role of machine learning algorithms in paddy rice smart agriculture, by analyzing the applications of machine learning in various scenarios, smart irrigation for paddy rice, predicting paddy rice yield estimation, monitoring paddy rice growth, monitoring paddy rice disease, assessing quality of paddy rice and paddy rice sample classification. This paper also presents a framework that maps the activities defined in rice smart farming, data used in data modelling and machine learning algorithms used for each activity defined in the production and post-production phases of paddy rice. Based on the proposed mapping framework, our conclusion is that an efficient and effective integration of all these three technologies is very crucial that transform traditional rice cultivation practices into a new perspective of intelligence in rice precision agriculture.

Canopy structure-and chlorophyll-sensitive VIs derived from Sentinel-2 images were used to estimate the start and end of the growing season (SOS and EOS, respectively) during the period 2016-2018, for an SRC poplar (Populus spp.) plantation in Lochristi (Belgium). Three different filtering methods (Savitzky-Golay (SavGol), polynomial (Polyfit) and Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS) and five SOS-and EOS threshold methods (first derivative function, 10% and 20% percentages and 10% and 20% percentiles) were applied to identify the optimal methods for the determination of phenophases. Our results showed that the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) had the best fit with GPP phenology, as derived from eddy covariance measurements, in identifying SOSand EOS-dates. For SOS, the performance was only slightly better than for several other indices, whereas for EOS, MTCI performed markedly better. The relationship between SOS/EOS derived from GPP and VIs varied interannually. MTCI described best the seasonal pattern of the SRC plantation's GPP (R2 = 0.52 when combining all three years). However, during the extreme dry year 2018, the Chlorophyll Red Edge Index performed slightly better in reproducing growing season GPP variability than MTCI (R2 = 0.59; R2 = 0.49, respectively). Regarding smoothing functions, Polyfit and HANTS methods showed the best (and very similar) performances. We further found that defining SOS as the date at which the 10% or 20% percentile occurred, yielded the best agreement between the VIs and the GPP; while for EOS the dates of the 10% percentile threshold came out as the best. © 2020 by the authors.

The increasing availability of soil data that can be efficiently acquired remotely and proximally, and freely available open-source algorithms, have led to an accelerated adoption of ML techniques to analyse soil data. Given the large number of publications, it is an impossible task to manually review all papers on the application of ML in soil science without narrowing down a narrative of ML application in a specific research question. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the application of ML techniques in soil science aided by a ML algorithm (latent Dirichlet allocation) to find patterns in a large collection of text corpora. The objective is to gain insight into publications of ML applications in soil science and to discuss the research gaps in this topic. We found that (a) there is an increasing usage of ML methods in soil sciences, mostly concentrated in developed countries, (b) the reviewed publications can be grouped into 12 topics, namely remote sensing, soil organic carbon, water, contamination, methods (ensembles), erosion and parent material, methods (NN, neural networks, SVM, support vector machines), spectroscopy, modelling (classes), crops, physical, and modelling (continuous), and (c) advanced ML methods usually perform better than simpler approaches thanks to their capability to capture non-linear relationships. From these findings, we found research gaps, in particular, about the precautions that should be taken (parsimony) to avoid overfitting, and that the interpretability of the ML models is an important aspect to consider when applying advanced ML methods in order to improve our knowledge and understanding of soil. We foresee that a large number of studies will focus on the latter topic. © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

Without N constraint in ecosystem models, the simulated benefits from CO2 fertilization and CO2-induced increases in water use efficiency (WUE) may be overestimated. In this study, satellite observations of a relative measure of chlorophyll content are used as a proxy for leaf photosynthetic N content globally for 2003–2011. Global gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration are estimated under elevated CO2 and N-constrained model scenarios. Results suggest that the rate of global GPP increase is overestimated by 85% during 2000–2015 without N limitation. This limitation is found to occur in many tropical and boreal forests, where a negative leaf N trend indicates a reduction in photosynthetic capacity, thereby suppressing the positive vegetation response to enhanced CO2 fertilization. Based on our carbon-water coupled simulations, enhanced CO2 concentration decreased stomatal conductance and hence increased WUE by 10% globally over the 1982 to 2015 time frame. Due to increased anthropogenic N application, GPP in croplands continues to grow and offset the weak negative trend in forests due to N limitation. Our results also show that the improved WUE is unlikely to ease regional droughts in croplands because of increases in evapotranspiration, which are associated with the enhanced GPP. Although the N limitation on GPP increase is large, its associated confidence interval is still wide, suggesting an urgent need for better understanding and quantification of N limitation from satellite observations. ©2017.

However, little is known on the effects of combined change in temperature, CO2 concentration, and extreme events on barley grain quality and how capable are the current process-based crop models capture the signal of climate change on quality traits. Here in this review, we initially explored the response of quality traits of barley to heat, drought, and CO2 concentration from experiential studies. Next, we reviewed the state of the art of some of the current modeling approaches to capture grain quality. Lastly, we suggested possible opportunities to improve current models for tracking the detailed quality traits of barley. Heat and drought stress increase the protein concentration which has a negative effect on malting quality. The rise of CO2 concentration significantly reduces the grain protein, again resulting in a decline of the malting and brewing quality since the nitrogen concentration of grains needs to be kept at a specific level. The current crop models that simulate barley grain quality are limited to simulation of grain nitrogen concentration, size, and number in response to climate extremes and CO2. Nevertheless, crop models fail to account for the complex interactions between the conflicting effects of rising temperatures and droughts as well as increasing CO2 concentrations on grain protein. They have mainly adapted wheat models that cannot capture barley's protein composition and whole grain malting quality. Implementation of experiments from gene to canopy scales which are explicitly designed to detect the interactions among environmental variables on detailed quality traits and couple the remote sensing plus data-driven approaches to crop models are possible opportunities to improve modeling of barley grain quality. The development of modeling routines can capture the detailed grain quality provide valuable tools for forming climate adaptive strategies. Equally important, they can guide breeding programs to develop climate-resilient but high-quality barley genotypes. © 2022 The Authors","Barley; Climate warming; Extreme events; Process-bases modeling; Quality traits","agricultural modeling; barley; climate change; drought stress; extreme event; remote sensing",Review,Scopus

Mathematical models are crucial for strategic and forecasting applications; however, models related to the banana crop are less common, and reviews on previous modelling efforts are scarce, emphasizing the need for evidence-based studies on this topic. Therefore, we reviewed 75 full-text articles published between 1985 and 2021 for information on mathematical models related to banana growth and, fruit and fibre yield. We analysed results in order to provide a descriptive synthesis of selected studies. According to the co-occurrence analysis, most studies were conducted on the mathematical modelling of banana fruit production. Modellers often used multiple linear regression models to estimate banana plant growth and fruit yield. Existing models incorporate a range of predictor variables, growth conditions, varieties, modelling approaches and evaluation methods, which limits comparative evaluation and selection of the best model. However, the banana process-based simulation model 'SIMBA' and artificial neural network have proven their robust applicability to estimate banana plant growth. This review shows that there is insufficient information on mathematical models related to banana fibre yield. This review could aid stakeholders in identifying the strengths and limitations of existing models, as well as providing insight on how to build novel and reliable banana crop-related mathematical models.

Governments and industries are developing strategies to respond to the risks and opportunities associated with these disruptors. Modelling is a useful tool for system conceptualisation, understanding, and scenario testing. Today, New Zealand and other nations need integrated modelling tools at the national scale to help industries and stakeholders plan for future disruptive changes. In this paper, following a scoping review process, we analyse modelling approaches and available agricultural systems’ model examples per thematic applications at the regional to national scale to define the best options for the national policy development.

Therefore, phenotyping to enhance resilience to these abiotic stresses is critical for sustaining genetic gains in crop improvement programs. However, traditional methods for screening traits related to these stresses are slow, laborious, and often expensive. Remote sensing provides opportunities to introduce low-cost, less biased, high-Throughput phenotyping methods to capture large genetic diversity to facilitate enhancement of stress resilience in crops. This review focuses on four key physiological traits and processes that are critical in understanding crop responses to drought and heat stress during reproductive and grain-filling periods. Specifically, these traits include: (i) time of day of flowering, to escape these stresses during flowering; (ii) optimizing photosynthetic efficiency; (iii) storage and translocation of water-soluble carbohydrates; and (iv) yield and yield components to provide in-season yield estimates. Moreover, we provide an overview of current advances in remote sensing in capturing these traits, and discuss the limitations with existing technology as well as future direction of research to develop high-Throughput phenotyping approaches. In the future, phenotyping these complex traits will require sensor advancement, high-quality imagery combined with machine learning methods, and efforts in transdisciplinary science to foster integration across disciplines. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.","Drought stress; Field-based high-Throughput phenotyping; Heat stress; Photosynthetic efficiency; Remote sensing; Time of day of flowering; Water-soluble carbohydrates; Yield estimation",,Review,Scopus

Since eddy covariance flux towers have a relatively small footprint and are distributed unevenly across the world, upscaling the observations is necessary to obtain global-scale estimates of biosphere-atmosphere exchange. Based on cross-consistency checks with atmospheric inversions, sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) and dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), here we provide a systematic assessment of the latest upscaling efforts for gross primary production (GPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the FLUXCOM initiative, where different machine learning methods, forcing data sets and sets of predictor variables were employed.</p> Spatial patterns of mean GPP are consistent across FLUXCOM and DGVM ensembles ( at 1 spatial resolution) while the majority of DGVMs show, for 70 of the land surface, values outside the FLUXCOM range. Global mean GPP magnitudes for 2008-2010 from FLUXCOM members vary within 106 and 130 PgC class with the largest uncertainty in the tropics. Seasonal variations in independent SIF estimates agree better with FLUXCOM GPP (mean global pixel-wise) than with GPP from DGVMs (mean global pixel-wise). Seasonal variations in FLUXCOM NEE show good consistency with atmospheric inversion-based net land carbon fluxes, particularly for temperate and boreal regions. Interannual variability of global NEE in FLUXCOM is underestimated compared to inversions and DGVMs. The FLUXCOM version which also uses meteorological inputs shows a strong co-variation in interannual patterns with inversions (for 2001-2010). Mean regional NEE from FLUXCOM shows larger uptake than inversion and DGVM-based estimates, particularly in the tropics with discrepancies of up to several hundred grammes of carbon per square metre per year. These discrepancies can only partly be reconciled by carbon loss pathways that are implicit in inversions but not captured by the flux tower measurements such as carbon emissions from fires and water bodies. We hypothesize that a combination of systematic biases in the underlying eddy covariance data, in particular in tall tropical forests, and a lack of site history effects on NEE in FLUXCOM are likely responsible for the too strong tropical carbon sink estimated by FLUXCOM. Furthermore, as FLUXCOM does not account for fertilization effects, carbon flux trends are not realistic. Overall, current FLUXCOM estimates of mean annual and seasonal cycles of GPP as well as seasonal NEE variations provide useful constraints of global carbon cycling, while interannual variability patterns from FLUXCOM are valuable but require cautious interpretation. Exploring the diversity of Earth observation data and of machine learning concepts along with improved quality and quantity of flux tower measurements will facilitate further improvements of the FLUXCOM approach overall. © 2020.

Each of these three domains requires dedicated sensor technology currently in place for ground and airborne applications and either have satellite concepts under development (e.g., HySPIRI/SBG (Surface Biology and Geology), Sentinel-8, HiTeSEM in the TIR) or are subject to satellite missions recently launched or scheduled within the next years (i.e., EnMAP and PRISMA (PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa, launched on March 2019) in the VNIR/SWIR, Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) in the SIF). Identification of plant water stress or drought is of utmost importance to guarantee global water and food supply. Therefore, knowledge of crop water status over large farmland areas bears large potential for optimizing agricultural water use. As plant responses to water stress are numerous and complex, their physiological consequences affect the electromagnetic signal in different spectral domains. This review paper summarizes the importance of water stress-related applications and the plant responses to water stress, followed by a concise review of water-stress detection through remote sensing, focusing on TIR without neglecting the comparison to other spectral domains (i.e., VNIR/SWIR and SIF) and multi-sensor approaches. Current and planned sensors at ground, airborne, and satellite level for the TIR as well as a selection of commonly used indices and approaches for water-stress detection using the main multi-/hyperspectral remote sensing imaging techniques are reviewed. Several important challenges are discussed that occur when using spectral emissivity, temperature-based indices, and physically-based approaches for water-stress detection in the TIR spectral domain. Furthermore, challenges with data processing and the perspectives for future satellite missions in the TIR are critically examined. In conclusion, information from multi-/hyperspectral TIR together with those from VNIR/SWIR and SIF sensors within a multi-sensor approach can provide profound insights to actual plant (water) status and the rationale of physiological and biochemical changes.

With the emergence of quantitative large-scale and high-throughput techniques, amount and dimensionality of experimental data have strongly increased. Appropriate strategies for data storage, management, and evaluation are needed to make efficient use of experimental findings. Computational approaches of data mining are essential for deriving statistical trends and signatures contained in data matrices. Although, current biology is challenged by high data dimensionality in general, this is particularly true for plant biology. Plants as sessile organisms have to cope with environmental fluctuations. This typically results in strong dynamics of metabolite and protein concentrations which are often challenging to quantify. Summarizing experimental output results in complex data arrays, which need computational statistics and numerical methods for building quantitative models. Experimental findings need to be combined by computational models to gain a mechanistic understanding of plant metabolism. For this, bioinformatics and mathematics need to be combined with experimental setups in physiology, biochemistry, and molecular biology.

Field observations and remote sensing both show that tundra “greening” has been widespread, but heterogeneity in regional and landscape-scale trends suggest that additional controls are mediating the response of tundra vegetation to warming. In this study, we examined the relationship between changes in vegetation productivity in the western Canadian Arctic and biophysical variables by analyzing trends in the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) obtained from nonparametric regression of annual Landsat surface reflectance composites. We used Random Forests classification and regression tree modelling to predict the trajectory and magnitude of greening from 1984 to 2016 and identify biophysical controls. More than two-thirds of our study area showed statistically significant increases in vegetation productivity, but observed changes were heterogeneous, occurring most rapidly within areas of the Southern Arctic that were: (1) dominated by dwarf and upright shrub cover types, (2) moderately sloping, and (3) located at lower elevation. These findings suggest that the response of tundra vegetation to warming is mediated by regional- and landscape-scale variation in microclimate, topography and soil moisture, and physiological differences among plant functional groups.

Rapid and accurate acquisition of information about large plant populations is critical for monitoring plant health and dissecting the underlying genetic traits. In recent years, high‐throughput phenotyping technology has benefitted immensely from both remote sensing and machine learning. Simultaneous use of multiple sensors (e.g., high‐resolution RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, chlorophyll fluorescence, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR)) allows a range of spatial and spectral resolutions depending on the trait in question. Meanwhile, computer vision and machine learning methodology have emerged as powerful tools for extracting useful biological information from image data. Together, these tools allow the evaluation of various morphological, structural, biophysical, and biochemical traits.

Together these stresses suppress global crop production by as much as 50% and their impacts are predicted to be exacerbated by climate change. Infrastructure and management practices can mitigate these detrimental impacts, but are costly. Crop breeding for improved tolerance has had some success but is progressing slowly and is not keeping pace with climate change. In contrast, Silicon (Si) is known to improve plant tolerance to a range of stresses and could provide a sustainable, rapid and cost-effective mitigation method. The exact mechanisms are still under debate but it appears Si can relieve salt stress via accumulation in the root apoplast where it reduces “bypass flow of ions to the shoot. Si-dependent drought relief has been linked to lowered root hydraulic conductance and reduction of water loss through transpiration. However, many alternative mechanisms may play a role such as altered gene expression and increased accumulation of compatible solutes. Oxidative damage that occurs under stress conditions can be reduced by Si through increased antioxidative enzymes while Si-improved photosynthesis has also been reported. Si fertilizer can be produced relatively cheaply and to assess its economic viability to improve crop stress tolerance we present a cost-benefit analysis. It suggests that Si fertilization may be beneficial in many agronomic settings but may be beyond the means of smallholder farmers in developing countries. Si application may also have disadvantages, such as increased soil pH, less efficient conversion of crops into biofuel and reduced digestibility of animal fodder. These issues may hamper uptake of Si fertilization as a routine agronomic practice. Here, we critically evaluate recent literature, quantifying the most significant physiological changes associated with Si in plants under drought and salinity stress. Analyses show that metrics associated with photosynthesis, water balance and oxidative stress all improve when Si is present during plant exposure to salinity and drought. We further conclude that most of these changes can be explained by apoplastic roles of Si while there is as yet little evidence to support biochemical roles of this element. © Copyright © 2020 Thorne, Hartley and Maathuis.","agronomy; drought; osmotic stress; oxidative stress; photosynthesis; review; salinity; silicon fertilization",,Article,Scopus

No quantitative evidence exists of how their exclusion may lead to potentially inaccurate model projections and understanding of hydrologic dynamics across the world's major river basins. To fill this knowledge gap, we developed the first-ever major river basin-scale modeling approach integrating surface depressions and focusing on the 450,000-km2 Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) in the United States. We applied a novel topography-based algorithm to estimate areas and volumes of ~455,000 surface depressions (&gt;1 ha) across the UMRB (in addition to lakes and reservoirs) and subsequently aggregated their effects per subbasin. Compared to a “no depression” conventional model, our depression-integrated model (a) improved streamflow simulation accuracy with increasing upstream abundance of depression storage, (b) significantly altered the spatial patterns and magnitudes of water yields across 315,000 km2 (70%) of the basin area, and (c) provided realistic spatial distributions of rootzone wetness conditions corresponding to satellite-based data. Results further suggest that storage capacity (i.e., volume) alone does not fully explain depressions' cumulative effects on landscape hydrologic responses. Local (i.e., subbasin level) climatic and geophysical drivers and downstream flowpath-regulating structures (e.g., reservoirs and dams) influence the extent to which depression storage volume in a subbasin causes hydrologic effects. With these new insights, our study supports the integration of surface depression storage and thereby catalyzes a reassessment of current hydrological modeling and management practices for basin-scale studies. ©2020.

Taking a case of a multifunctional landscape in the central HKH region, we aimed to assess the biophysical production possibilities of major ES, their relationships and co-occurrence, and dynamic interactions at different spatial scales. We quantified and mapped six major ES (crop production, timber production, carbon sequestration, soil conservation, water yield, and habitat quality) at two spatial scales: landscape level (functional unit) and watershed level (management unit). Further, we analysed the relationship and interactions among all the possible pairs of the considered ES. All six ES were found to have a positive correlation, except crop production which showed a significant negative correlation with soil conservation. Moreover, we delineated 186 watersheds in the landscape and clustered them based on their biophysical potentials for the supply of ES. Gap statistics from K-means clustering identified three main clusters of watersheds (i.e., agriculture-dominated, poor-performing uplands, and multifunctional). The supply of ES from downstream watersheds was substantially higher than that of the upstream watersheds. We then discussed the interrelationships among ES at various spatial scales and suggested policy instruments for ecosystem management. The relationship among ES shows dynamic forms of spatial distribution, which need to be sustainably managed for minimizing trade-offs and maximizing synergies through the consideration of an integrated watershed management approach, improved agronomy practices, and global climate actions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Co-occurrence; Mapping and quantification; Multifunctional watersheds, mountain landscapes; Trade-offs in ecosystem services",,Article,Scopus

For that, a total of 232 papers published in international scientific journal databases was examined. We gathered the published materials and evaluated their characteristics regarding the application, sensor, and technique used. We discuss how DL presents promising results and has the potential for processing tasks associated with UAV-based image data.

Nonetheless, the question in these unstopped evolutions is about the interlinkages with sustainability. In this context, the objectives of this study are to highlight the main insights from the available scientific literature about the interrelationships between the new trends in the agriculture and the sustainability.

As plant breeders seek to increase crop productivity and produce more food for the future, the amount of phenotype information they require will also increase.

Plant phenotyping robots have emerged as a high-throughput technology to measure morphological, chemical and physiological properties of large number of plants. Several robotic systems have been developed to fulfill different phenotyping missions. In particular, robotic phenotyping has the potential to enable efficient monitoring of changes in plant traits over time in both controlled environments and in the field. The operation of these robots can be challenging as a result of the dynamic nature of plants and the agricultural environments. Here we discuss developments in phenotyping robots, and the challenges which have been overcome and others which remain outstanding.

Remote sensing emerged as a key technology revealing both spatial and temporal vegetation patterns. Harnessing the ever growing streams of remote sensing data for the increasing demands on vegetation assessments and monitoring requires efficient, accurate and flexible methods for data analysis. In this respect, the use of deep learning methods is trend-setting, enabling high predictive accuracy, while learning the relevant data features independently in an end-to-end fashion. Very recently, a series of studies have demonstrated that the deep learning method of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is very effective to represent spatial patterns enabling to extract a wide array of vegetation properties from remote sensing imagery. This review introduces the principles of CNN and distils why they are particularly suitable for vegetation remote sensing. The main part synthesizes current trends and developments, including considerations about spectral resolution, spatial grain, different sensors types, modes of reference data generation, sources of existing reference data, as well as CNN approaches and architectures. The literature review showed that CNN can be applied to various problems, including the detection of individual plants or the pixel-wise segmentation of vegetation classes, while numerous studies have evinced that CNN outperform shallow machine learning methods. Several studies suggest that the ability of CNN to exploit spatial patterns particularly facilitates the value of very high spatial resolution data. The modularity in the common deep learning frameworks allows a high flexibility for the adaptation of architectures, whereby especially multi-modal or multi-temporal applications can benefit. An increasing availability of techniques for visualizing features learned by CNNs will not only contribute to interpret but to learn from such models and improve our understanding of remotely sensed signals of vegetation. Although CNN has not been around for long, it seems obvious that they will usher in a new era of vegetation remote sensing. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

It is a key to improve productivity by using the best agricultural practices and optimal usage of resources. Agriculture faces diverse challenges due to soil degradation, climate variation, and increasing costs. To unfold these challenges, PA uses Wireless Sensor Networks(WSNs) and exploits acquisition, communication, and processing of the data as basic enabling technologies to amplify the crop yield. Also, many other multidisciplinary technologies are supporting PA in finding the most novel use cases for PA. The use of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed PA at almost every level. The fog/edge paradigm is mitigating many challenges such as network bandwidth and security by bringing computation closer to the deployed network. At the same time, Software Defined Networks (SDN) brings flexibility, big data assists in handling data, and nanotechnology plays a crucial part in driving the innovation in PA. This paper delves into ways these technologies are transforming PA in respective tracks, exhibiting the significance of integrating multidisciplinary approaches towards the future of PA. In addition to a comprehensive survey, this paper proposes a multidisciplinary architecture: AgriFusion, for efficient and cost-effective agriculture solutions. A list of industrial solutions for different aspects of farm management and their underlying focused technology have been highlighted. This can help to align research and industrial goals for PA.

Meeting increasing demand for meat and other dairy products in a sustainable manner is a big challenge. At a field scale, Global Positioning System and groundbased sensor technologies provide promising tools for grassland and herd management with high precision. With the growth in availability of spaceborne remote sensing data, it is therefore important to revisit the relevant methods and applications that can exploit this imagery. In this article, we have reviewed the (i) current status of grassland monitoring/observation methods and applications based on satellite remote sensing data, (ii) the technological and methodological developments to retrieve different grassland biophysical parameters and management characteristics (i.e. degradation, grazing intensity) and (iii) identified the key remaining challenges and some new upcoming trends for future development. Important Findings The retrieval of grassland biophysical parameters have evolved in recent years from classical regression analysis to more complex, efficient and robust modeling approaches, driven by satellite data, and are likely to continue to be the most robust method for deriving grassland information, however these require more high quality calibration and validation data. We found that the hypertemporal satellite data are widely used for time series generation, and particularly to overcome cloud contamination issues, but the current low spatial resolution of these instruments precludes their use for field-scale application in many countries. This trend may change with the current rise in launch of satellite constellations, such as RapidEye, Sentinel-2 and even the microsatellites such as those operated by Skybox Imaging. Microwave imagery has not been widely used for grassland applications, and a better understanding of the backscatter behaviour from different phenological stages is needed for more reliable products in cloudy regions. The development of hyperspectral satellite instrumentation and analytical methods will help for more detailed discrimination of habitat types, and the development of tools for greater end-user operation.","Agricultural grassland; Grassland biomass; Grazing intensity; Pasture management; Remote sensing",,Article,Scopus

The impact of bias-correction on the historical (1980–2005) period, the inter-variable relationships, and the measures of spatio-temporal consistency are investigated.

In recent years, there has been significant progress in plant phenomics and genomics approaches for generating reliable large datasets. However, selecting an appropriate data integration and analysis method to improve the efficiency of phenome-phenome and phenome-genome association studies is still a bottleneck. This study proposes a hyperspectral wide association study (HypWAS) approach as a phenome-phenome association analysis through a hierarchical data integration strategy to estimate the prediction power of hyperspectral reflectance bands in predicting soybean seed yield. Using HypWAS, five important hyperspectral reflectance bands in visible, red-edge, and near-infrared regions were identified significantly associated with seed yield. The phenome-genome association analysis of each tested hyperspectral reflectance band was performed using two conventional genome-wide association studies (GWAS) methods and a machine learning mediated GWAS based on the support vector regression (SVR) method. Using SVR-mediated GWAS, more relevant QTL with the physiological background of the tested hyperspectral reflectance bands were detected, supported by the functional annotation of candidate gene analyses. The results of this study have indicated the advantages of using hierarchical data integration strategy and advanced mathematical methods coupled with phenome-phenome and phenome-genome association analyses for a better understanding of the biology and genetic backgrounds of hyperspectral reflectance bands affecting soybean yield formation. The identified yield-related hyperspectral reflectance bands using HypWAS can be used as indirect selection criteria for selecting superior genotypes with improved yield genetic gains in large breeding populations.

Continuous satellite-based monitoring of this key plant trait would help to understand individual crop N use efficiency and thus would enable site-specific N management. Since hyperspectral imaging sensors could provide detailed measurements of spectral signatures corresponding to the optical activity of chemical constituents, they have a theoretical advantage over multi-spectral sensing for the detection of crop N. The current study aims to provide a state-of-the-art overview of crop N retrieval methods from hyperspectral data in the agricultural sector and in the context of future satellite imaging spectroscopy missions. Over 400 studies were reviewed for this purpose, identifying those estimating mass-based N (N concentration, N%) and area-based N (N content, Narea) using hyperspectral remote sensing data. Retrieval methods of the 125 studies selected in this review can be grouped into: (1) parametric regression methods, (2) linear nonparametric regression methods or chemometrics, (3) nonlinear nonparametric regression methods or machine learning regression algorithms, (4) physically-based or radiative transfer models (RTM), (5) use of alternative data sources (sun-induced fluorescence, SIF) and (6) hybrid or combined techniques. Whereas in the last decades methods for estimation of Narea and N% from hyperspectral data have been mainly based on simple parametric regression algorithms, such as narrowband vegetation indices, there is an increasing trend of using machine learning, RTM and hybrid techniques. Within plants, N is invested in proteins and chlorophylls stored in the leaf cells, with the proteins being the major nitrogen-containing biochemical constituent. However, in most studies, the relationship between N and chlorophyll content was used to estimate crop N, focusing on the visible-near infrared (VNIR) spectral domains, and thus neglecting protein-related N and reallocation of nitrogen to non-photosynthetic compartments. Therefore, we recommend exploiting the estimation of nitrogen via the proxy of proteins using hyperspectral data and in particular the short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral domain. We further strongly encourage a standardization of nitrogen terminology, distinguishing between N% and Narea. Moreover, the exploitation of physically-based approaches is highly recommended combined with machine learning regression algorithms, which represents an interesting perspective for future research in view of new spaceborne imaging spectroscopy sensors. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Biochemical traits; Hybrid techniques, machine learning; Hyperspectral; Radiative transfer modelling","Chemical detection; Chlorophyll; Crops; Information retrieval; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Nitrogen; Parameter estimation; Proteins; Radiative transfer; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Transfer learning; Biochemical traits; Hybrid techniques; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral imaging sensors; Hyperspectral remote sensing data; Non-parametric regression; Parametric regression methods; Radiative transfer modelling; Hyperspectral imaging; chlorophyll; machine learning; nitrogen; radiative transfer; regression analysis; remote sensing; satellite data; spectral analysis; standardization",Review,Scopus

In this context, better knowledge of how climate will change in West Africa and how such changes will impact crop productivity is crucial to inform policies that may counteract the adverse effects. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of climate change impacts on agriculture inWest Africa based on the recent scientific literature.West Africa is nowadays experiencing a rapid climate change, characterized by a widespread warming, a recovery of the monsoonal precipitation, and an increase in the occurrence of climate extremes. The observed climate tendencies are also projected to continue in the twenty-first century under moderate and high emission scenarios, although large uncertainties still affect simulations of the future West African climate, especially regarding the summer precipitation. However, despite diverging future projections of the monsoonal rainfall, which is essential for rain-fed agriculture, a robust evidence of yield loss in West Africa emerges. This yield loss is mainly driven by increased mean temperature while potential wetter or drier conditions as well as elevated CO2 concentrations can modulate this effect. Potential for adaptation is illustrated for major crops in West Africa through a selection of studies based on process-based crop models to adjust cropping systems (change in varieties, sowing dates and density, irrigation, fertilizer management) to future climate. Results of the cited studies are crop and region specific and no clear conclusions can be made regarding the most effective adaptation options.

Insufficient or excessive application of N fertilizers can limit crop yield and quality, especially as excessive N fertilizers can damage the environment and proper fertilizer application is essential for agricultural production. Efficient monitoring of crop N content is the basis of precise fertilizer management, and therefore to increase crop yields and improve crop quality. Remote sensing has gradually replaced traditional destructive methods such as field surveys and laboratory testing for crop N diagnosis. With the rapid advancement of remote sensing, a review on crop N monitoring is badly in need of better summary and discussion. The purpose of this study was to identify current research trends and key issues related to N monitoring. It begins with a comprehensive statistical analysis of the literature on remote sensing monitoring of N in rice and wheat over the past 20 years. The study then elucidates the physiological mechanisms and spectral response characteristics of remote sensing monitoring of canopy N. The following section summarizes the techniques and methods applied in remote sensing monitoring of canopy N from three aspects: remote sensing platforms for N monitoring; correlation between remotely sensed data and N status; and the retrieval methods of N status. The influential factors of N retrieval were then discussed with detailed classification. However, there remain challenges and problems that need to be addressed in the future studies, including the fusion of multisource data from different platforms, and the uncertainty of canopy N inversion in the presence of background factors. The newly developed hybrid model integrates the flexibility of machine learning with the mechanism of physical models. It could be problem solving, which has the advantages of processing multi-source data and reducing the interference of confounding factors. It could be the future development direction of crop N inversion with both high precision and universality. © 2022 by the authors.","nitrogen remote sensing; quantitative retrieval; research prospect; rice and wheat","Data handling; Monitoring; Nitrogen fertilizers; Physiological models; Remote sensing; Crop quality; Crop yield; Multisource data; N fertilizers; Nitrogen remote sensing; Quantitative retrieval; Remote sensing monitoring; Remote-sensing; Research prospect; Rice and wheat; Crops",Review,Scopus

Abstract: Quantitative resistance (QR) has long been utilized to manage blackleg in Brassica napus (canola, oilseed rape), even before major resistance genes (R-genes) were extensively explored in breeding programmes. In contrast to R-gene-mediated qualitative resistance, QR reduces blackleg symptoms rather than completely eliminating the disease. As a polygenic trait, QR is controlled by numerous genes with modest effects, which exerts less pressure on the pathogen to evolve; hence, its effectiveness is more durable compared to R-gene-mediated resistance. Furthermore, combining QR with major R-genes has been shown to enhance resistance against diseases in important crops, including oilseed rape. For these reasons, there has been a renewed interest among breeders in utilizing QR in crop improvement. However, the mechanisms governing QR are largely unknown, limiting its deployment. Advances in genomics are facilitating the dissection of the genetic and molecular underpinnings of QR, resulting in the discovery of several loci and genes that can be potentially deployed to enhance blackleg resistance. Here, we summarize the efforts undertaken to identify blackleg QR loci in oilseed rape using linkage and association analysis. We update the knowledge on the possible mechanisms governing QR and the advances in searching for the underlying genes. Lastly, we lay out strategies to accelerate the genetic improvement of blackleg QR in oilseed rape using improved phenotyping approaches and genomic prediction tools. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"Crops; Oilseeds; Association analysis; Breeding programmes; Genetic improvements; Leptosphaeria maculans; Mediated resistances; Oilseed rape (Brassica napus); Possible mechanisms; Quantitative resistance; Genes; chromosomal mapping; disease resistance; genetics; growth, development and aging; immunology; Leptosphaeria; microbiology; phenotype; physiology; plant breeding; plant chromosome; plant disease; plant gene; procedures; quantitative trait locus; rapeseed; Brassica napus; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Plant; Disease Resistance; Genes, Plant; Leptosphaeria; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Plant Diseases; Quantitative Trait Loci",Review,Scopus

Development of the Haber-Bosch industrial process for ammonia synthesis helped to relieve N limitation of agricultural production, fueling the Green Revolution and reducing hunger. However, the massive use of industrial N fertilizer has doubled the N moving through the global N cycle with dramatic environmental consequences that threaten planetary health. Thus, there is an urgent need to reduce losses of reactive N from agriculture, while ensuring sufficient N inputs for food security. Here we review current knowledge related to N use efficiency (NUE) in agriculture and identify research opportunities in the areas of agronomy, plant breeding, biological N fixation (BNF), soil N cycling, and modeling to achieve responsible, sustainable use of N in agriculture. Amongst these opportunities, improved agricultural practices that synchronize crop N demand with soil N availability are low-hanging fruit. Crop breeding that targets root and shoot physiological processes will likely increase N uptake and utilization of soil N, while breeding for BNF effectiveness in legumes will enhance overall system NUE. Likewise, engineering of novel N-fixing symbioses in non-legumes could reduce the need for chemical fertilizers in agroecosystems but is a much longer-term goal. The use of simulation modeling to conceptualize the complex, interwoven processes that affect agroecosystem NUE, along with multi-objective optimization, will also accelerate NUE gains. © Copyright © 2021 Udvardi, Below, Castellano, Eagle, Giller, Ladha, Liu, Maaz, Nova-Franco, Raghuram, Robertson, Roy, Saha, Schmidt, Tegeder, York and Peters.","agronomy; biological nitrogen fixation; breeding; microbiome; nitrogen use efficiency; policy; roots; soil health",,Review,Scopus

As it turns out, the region appears to be underrepresented in the existing compendium of Earth science and hydrology-focused journal papers when it comes to significant discussion on terrestrial hydrology and freshwater science. This prominent gap is largely precipitated by increasing number of constraints that include lack of considerable and robust investments in gauge measurements for meteorological and hydrological applications, poor funding of research institutions and other disincentives, among other factors. In this manuscript, the challenges and problems in large-scale terrestrial hydrology-focused investigation in West Africa are reviewed. Using a dossier of some recent contributions in the field of remote sensing hydrology, this review also highlights some of the progress in terrestrial hydrology and the opportunities that exist for hydro-geodetic research in West Africa that leverage on sustained investments in satellite geodetic missions. It is noted that West Africa is still a pristine environment for hydrology-focused research and can benefit from recent advancements in sophisticated space agency programs such as the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, which undoubtedly has revolutionized terrestrial hydrology research around the world for nearly two decades. Given the poor density of gauge stations and limited ground observations, hydrological research in West Africa is expected to benefit more from independent space observations and multi-resolution data. This is because the lack of sufficient in-situ data for the parameterizations and adequate initialization of outputs from hydrological models and reanalysis data for hydrological applications results in poor representation of the West African land surface and hydrological state variables. To further improve our contemporary understanding of West Africa’s terrestrial hydrology, the continued evaluation/validation of these observations and space-borne measurements is advocated. © 2019, Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences & Polish Academy of Sciences.","Climate variability; Droughts; Rainfall; River discharge; Terrestrial hydrology","Drought; Gages; Geodesy; Rain; Remote sensing; Tropics; Water resources; Climate variability; Gravity recovery and climate experiments; Multiresolution data; Pristine environments; Research institutions; River discharge; Space agency programs; Sustained investment; Hydrology; climate conditions; climate variation; drought; geodesy; hydrological modeling; rainfall; river discharge; water resource; West Africa",Review,Scopus

Climate change-driven global warming can trigger higher insect pest pressures and plant diseases thus affecting crop production sternly. The traits controlling genes for stress or disease tolerance are economically imperative in crop plants. In this scenario, the extensive exploration of available wild, resistant or susceptible germplasms and unraveling the genetic diversity remains vital for breeding programs. The dawn of next-generation sequencing technologies and omics approaches has accelerated plant breeding by providing the genome sequences and transcriptomes of several plants. The availability of decoded plant genomes offers an opportunity at a glance to identify candidate genes, quantitative trait loci (QTLs), molecular markers, and genome-wide association studies that can potentially aid in high throughput marker-assisted breeding. In recent years genomics is coupled with marker-assisted breeding to unravel the mechanisms to harness better better crop yield and quality. In this review, we discuss the aspects of marker-assisted breeding and recent perspectives of breeding approaches in the era of genomics, bioinformatics, high-tech phonemics, genome editing, and new plant breeding technologies for crop improvement.

DL represents significant progress in the ability of neural networks to automatically engineer problem-relevant features and capture highly complex data distributions. I argue that DL can help address several major new and old challenges facing research in water sciences such as interdisciplinarity, data discoverability, hydrologic scaling, equifinality, and needs for parameter regionalization. This review paper is intended to provide water resources scientists and hydrologists in particular with a simple technical overview, transdisciplinary progress update, and a source of inspiration about the relevance of DL to water. The review reveals that various physical and geoscientific disciplines have utilized DL to address data challenges, improve efficiency, and gain scientific insights. DL is especially suited for information extraction from image-like data and sequential data. Techniques and experiences presented in other disciplines are of high relevance to water research. Meanwhile, less noticed is that DL may also serve as a scientific exploratory tool. A new area termed AI neuroscience, where scientists interpret the decision process of deep networks and derive insights, has been born. This budding subdiscipline has demonstrated methods including correlation-based analysis, inversion of network-extracted features, reduced-order approximations by interpretable models, and attribution of network decisions to inputs. Moreover, DL can also use data to condition neurons that mimic problem-specific fundamental organizing units, thus revealing emergent behaviors of these units. Vast opportunities exist for DL to propel advances in water sciences. ©2018.

This progress covers most aspects of PRS application in PP, including patterns of global spatial distribution and temporal dynamics, specific PRS technologies, phenotypic research fields, working environments, species, and traits. Subsequently, we demonstrate how to link PRS to multi-omics studies, including how to achieve multi-dimensional PRS data acquisition and processing, how to systematically integrate all kinds of phenotypic information and derive phenotypic knowledge with biological significance, and how to link PP to multi-omics association analysis.

More and more resource studies are emerging providing 1000 and more genotypes and millions of SNPs for one species covering a hitherto inaccessible intraspecific genetic variation. The larger the databases are growing, the better statistical approaches for genomic selection will be available. However, there are clear limitations on the statistical but also on the biological part. Intraspecific genetic variation is able to explain a high proportion of the phenotypes, but a large part of phenotypic plasticity also stems from environmentally driven transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, post-translational, epigenetic and metabolic regulation. Moreover, regulation of the same gene can have different phenotypic outputs in different environments. Consequently, to explain and understand environment-dependent phenotypic plasticity based on the available genotype variation we have to integrate the analysis of further molecular levels reflecting the complete information flow from the gene to metabolism to phenotype. Interestingly, metabolomics platforms are already more cost-effective than NGS platforms and are decisive for the prediction of nutritional value or stress resistance. Here, we propose three fundamental pillars for future breeding strategies in the framework of Green Systems Biology: (i) combining genome selection with environment-dependent PANOMICS analysis and deep learning to improve prediction accuracy for marker-dependent trait performance; (ii) PANOMICS resolution at subtissue, cellular and subcellular level provides information about fundamental functions of selected markers; (iii) combining PANOMICS with genome editing and speed breeding tools to accelerate and enhance large-scale functional validation of trait-specific precision breeding. © 2020 The Authors.

However, plant performance or phenotype (P) is determined by the combined effects of genotype (G), envirotype (E), and genotype by environment interaction (GEI). Phenotypes can be predicted more precisely by training a model using data collected from multiple sources, including spatiotemporal omics (genomics, phenomics, and enviromics across time and space). Integration of 3D information profiles (G-P-E), each with multidimensionality, provides predictive breeding with both tremendous opportunities and great challenges. Here, we first review innovative technologies for predictive breeding. We then evaluate multidimensional information profiles that can be integrated with a predictive breeding strategy, particularly envirotypic data, which have largely been neglected in data collection and are nearly untouched in model construction. We propose a smart breeding scheme, integrated genomic-enviromic prediction (iGEP), as an extension of genomic prediction, using integrated multiomics information, big data technology, and artificial intelligence (mainly focused on machine and deep learning). We discuss how to implement iGEP, including spatiotemporal models, environmental indices, factorial and spatiotemporal structure of plant breeding data, and cross-species prediction. A strategy is then proposed for prediction-based crop redesign at both the macro (individual, population, and species) and micro (gene, metabolism, and network) scales. Finally, we provide perspectives on translating smart breeding into genetic gain through integrative breeding platforms and open-source breeding initiatives. We call for coordinated efforts in smart breeding through iGEP, institutional partnerships, and innovative technological support. © 2022 The Author","artificial intelligence; big data; crop design; genomic selection; integrated genomic-enviromic selection; machine and deep learning; smart breeding; spatiotemporal omics","artificial intelligence; genetic selection; genome; genomics; genotype; phenotype; plant breeding; procedures; Artificial Intelligence; Big Data; Genome; Genomics; Genotype; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Selection, Genetic",Review,Scopus

Food security is a matter of concern for stakeholders and policymakers as the global population is predicted to bypass 10 billion in the coming years. Crop improvement via modern breeding techniques along with efficient agronomic practices innovations in microbiome applications, and exploiting the natural variations in underutilized crops is an excellent way forward to fulfill future food requirements. In this review, we describe the next-generation breeding tools that can be used to increase crop production by developing climate-resilient superior genotypes to cope with the future challenges of global food security. Recent innovations in genomic-assisted breeding (GAB) strategies allow the construction of highly annotated crop pan-genomes to give a snapshot of the full landscape of genetic diversity (GD) and recapture the lost gene repertoire of a species. Pan-genomes provide new platforms to exploit these unique genes or genetic variation for optimizing breeding programs. The advent of next-generation clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR/Cas) systems, such as prime editing, base editing, and de nova domestication, has institutionalized the idea that genome editing is revamped for crop improvement. Also, the availability of versatile Cas orthologs, including Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14, improved the editing efficiency. Now, the CRISPR/Cas systems have numerous applications in crop research and successfully edit the major crop to develop resistance against abiotic and biotic stress. By adopting high-throughput phenotyping approaches and big data analytics tools like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), agriculture is heading toward automation or digitalization. The integration of speed breeding with genomic and phenomic tools can allow rapid gene identifications and ultimately accelerate crop improvement programs. In addition, the integration of next-generation multidisciplinary breeding platforms can open exciting avenues to develop climate-ready crops toward global food security. © Copyright © 2021 Razzaq, Kaur, Akhter, Wani and Saleem.","abiotic stress; climate change; CRISPR/Cas; crop improvement; food security; genome editing; genomics; next-generation breeding",,Review,Scopus

Forty years ago, a tree physiological research tradition in aboveground and belowground resource capture was established with questions and methods on climate-tree-soil-crop interactions in space and time that are still relevant for today’s challenges. After summarising early research contributions, we review recent literature to assess current levels of uncertainty in climate adaptation assessments in and through AF. Quantification of microclimate within and around tree canopies showed a gap between standard climate station data (designed to avoid tree influences) and the actual climate in which crop and tree meristems or livestock operates in real-world AF. Where global scenario modelling of ‘macroclimate’ change in mean annual rainfall and temperature extrapolates from climate station conditions in past decades, it ignores microclimate effects of trees. There still is a shortage of long-term phenology records to analyse tree biological responses across a wide range of species to climate variability, especially where flowering and pollination matter. Physiological understanding can complement farmer knowledge and help guide policy decisions that allow AF solutions to emerge and tree germplasm to be adjusted for the growing conditions expected over the lifetime of a tree. © 2021, The Author(s).","Agroecology; Agroforestry models; Climate shift; Multipurpose trees; Resilience; Tree architecture","aboveground biomass; adaptive management; agroforestry; belowground biomass; climate change; flowering; global change; high temperature; management practice; pollination; rainfall; research work; scenario analysis; strategic approach; trend analysis; vegetation cover",Review,Scopus

In addition to their role in mitigating climate change, SCS practices play a role in delivering agroecosystem resilience, climate change adaptability and food security. Environmental heterogeneity and differences in agricultural practices challenge the practical implementation of SCS, and our analysis addresses the associated knowledge gap. Previous assessments have focused on global potentials, but there is a need among policymakers to operationalise SCS. Here, we assess a range of practices already proposed to deliver SCS, and distil these into a subset of specific measures. We provide a multidisciplinary summary of the barriers and potential incentives towards practical implementation of these measures. First, we identify specific practices with potential for both a positive impact on SCS at farm level and an uptake rate compatible with global impact. These focus on: (a) optimising crop primary productivity (e.g. nutrient optimisation, pH management, irrigation); (b) reducing soil disturbance and managing soil physical properties (e.g. improved rotations, minimum till); (c) minimising deliberate removal of C or lateral transport via erosion processes (e.g. support measures, bare fallow reduction); (d) addition of C produced outside the system (e.g. organic manure amendments, biochar addition); (e) provision of additional C inputs within the cropping system (e.g. agroforestry, cover cropping). We then consider economic and non-cost barriers and incentives for land managers implementing these measures, along with the potential externalised impacts of implementation. This offers a framework and reference point for holistic assessment of the impacts of SCS. Finally, we summarise and discuss the ability of extant scientific approaches to quantify the technical potential and externalities of SCS measures, and the barriers and incentives to their implementation in global agricultural systems. © 2019 The Authors.

All these different tipping elements share common characteristics related to their nonlinear nature. They can also interact with each other leading to synergies that can lead to cascading tipping points. Even if the probability of each tipping event is low, they can happen relatively rapidly, involve multiple variables, and have large societal impacts. Therefore, adaptation measures and management in general should extend their focus beyond slow and continuous changes, into abrupt, nonlinear, possibly cascading, high impact phenomena. Remote sensing observations are found to be decisive in the understanding and determination of early warning signals of many tipping elements. Nevertheless, considerable research still remains to properly incorporate these data in the current generation of coupled Earth system models. This is a key prerequisite to correctly develop robust decadal prediction systems that may help to assess the risk of crossing thresholds potentially crucial for society. The prediction of tipping points remains difficult, notably due to stochastic resonance, i.e. the interaction between natural variability and anthropogenic forcing, asking for large ensembles of predictions to correctly assess the risks. Furthermore, evaluating the proximity to crucial thresholds using process-based understanding of each system remains a key aspect to be developed for an improved assessment of such risks. This paper finally proposes a few research avenues concerning the use of remote sensing data and the need for combining different sources of data, and having long and precise-enough time series of the key variables needed to monitor Earth system tipping elements. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","AMOC; Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets; Atlantic; Bifurcation; Climate dynamics; Early warning; Earth observation; Land use; Marine biology; Permafrost; Remote sensing; SPG; Terrestrial resource use; Tipping element; Tipping point","Ecosystems; Forecasting; Magnetic resonance; Remote sensing; Space optics; Stochastic systems; Antarctic ice sheets; Anthropogenic forcing; Decadal predictions; Overturning circulation; Remote sensing data; Social-ecological systems; Stochastic resonances; Terrestrial resources; Risk assessment; bifurcation; climate; early warning system; EOS; gyre; land use; marine environment; meridional circulation; permafrost; remote sensing; resource use; Antarctic Ice Sheet; Antarctica; Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet",Review,Scopus

Modelling has contributed to better understanding of crop performance and yield gaps, better prediction of pest and insect outbreaks, and improving the efficiency of crop management including irrigation systems and optimization of planting dates.

The atmospheric CO2 growth rates would have been much larger if natural sinks in the land biosphere and ocean had not removed over half of this anthropogenic CO2. As these CO2 emissions grew, uptake by the ocean increased in response to increases in atmospheric CO2 partial pressure (pCO2). On land, gross primary production also increased, but the dynamics of other key aspects of the land carbon cycle varied regionally. Over the past three decades, CO2 uptake by intact tropical humid forests declined, but these changes are offset by increased uptake across mid- and high-latitudes. While there have been substantial improvements in our ability to study the carbon cycle, measurement and modeling gaps still limit our understanding of the processes driving its evolution. Continued ship-based observations combined with expanded deployments of autonomous platforms are needed to quantify ocean-atmosphere fluxes and interior ocean carbon storage on policy-relevant spatial and temporal scales. There is also an urgent need for more comprehensive measurements of stocks, fluxes and atmospheric CO2 in humid tropical forests and across the Arctic and boreal regions, which are experiencing rapid change.
