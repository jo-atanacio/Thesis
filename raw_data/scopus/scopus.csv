Accurate forecasts will aid farmers in making financial and managerial decisions, thereby preventing food shortage. Machine learning (ML) techniques have proven an effective means for predicting the yield of crops, which greatly impact agricultural yield prediction where various Artificial Intelligence as well as deep learning techniques can be utilized. A detailed literature review has been performed in this work to analyze and explore various ML algorithms and to identify the features viz., weather, soil types and properties, fertilizers that highly influence the crop yield prediction.

Deep Learning (DL) models are recently well-known for predicting crop yields. Multi-parametric Deep Neural Network (MDNN) is a DL model employed to estimate the crop yield concerning multiple parameters such as climate and soil. A Growing-Degree Day (GDD) has been used to determine the impact of climate change on crop yield. The determined values along with the climate and soil parameters have been learned by the DNN to estimate the yield quality. The MDNN performs well with the huge volume of data and it is not suitable for the medium scale of data. The learning ability of MDNN is improved in this paper by proposing a Multi-parametric Multiple Kernel DNN (MMKDNN) to provide better crop yield prediction for medium-scale data. The effectiveness of the model built in the last hidden layer is solely determined by the intermediate representations of the input. The intermediate representation of the input in a neural network is combined through multiple kernel learning. The MMKDNN with increasing complexity representations is preserved in this way, but the output calculation, i.e. crop yield prediction, is free to use all of the network's knowledge. For five different types of crops, the experiments are conducted to assess the efficiency of the MMKDNN. © 2022","Crop yield prediction; DNN; GDD; Multi-parametric multiple kernel DNN; Multiple kernel learning","Climate change; Climate models; Crops; Forecasting; Learning systems; Crop yield; Crop yield prediction; DNN; Growing degree-days; Learning models; Medium-scale; Multi-parametric multiple kernel DNN; Multiple Kernel Learning; Multiple kernels; Yield prediction; Deep neural networks",Article,Scopus

Remote sensing data captured using various satellites provide reliable phenological information for a crop through surface reflectance bands. Other important factors, affecting crop yield include meteorological and soil. The data which we have used for crop yield prediction is multimodal. It consists of spatiotemporal meteorological (numeric) and surface reflectance bands (satellite image), and temporally static soil (satellite image) data. We effectively utilize this multimodal data to develop the proposed multimodal deep learning model, CropYieldNet. The objective of the paper is to accurately predict crop yield using high resolution data obtained from recently launched satellites such as Landsat8 and Sentinel-2. We used contrastive learning in a supervised setting and data augmentation techniques to overcome the limited historical data available for training deep learning models.We introduce a depth-level selection module for effectively modelling the depth-variant information of soil data. We have also modified our model to perform in-season (early) crop yield prediction which is as accurate as end-season prediction. We evaluate our model for two crops, corn and soybean, on counties in US and districts in India using data from MODIS, Landsat8, and Sentinel-2 satellites.

Recent studies on crop yield production are limited to regional-scale predictions. The regional-scale crop yield predictions usually face challenges in capturing local yield variations based on farm management decisions and the condition of the field. For this research, we identified the need to create a large and reusable farm-scale crop yield production dataset, which could provide precise farm-scale ground-truth prediction targets. Therefore, we utilise multi-temporal data, such as Sentinel-2 satellite images, weather data, farm data, grain delivery data, and cadastre-specific data. We introduce a deep hybrid neural network model to train this multi-temporal data. This model combines the features of convolutional layers and recurrent neural networks to predict farm-scale crop yield production across Norway. The proposed model could efficiently make the target predictions with the mean absolute error of 76 kg per 1000 m2.

Accurately predicting crop yields is crucial for addressing these challenges. However, this prediction task is exceptionally complicated since crop yields depend on numerous factors such as weather, land surface, and soil quality, as well as their interactions. In recent years, machine learning models have been successfully applied in this domain. However, these models either restrict their tasks to a relatively small region, or only study over a single or few years, which makes them hard to generalize spatially and temporally. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based recurrent neural network for crop yield prediction, to incorporate both geographical and temporal knowledge in the model, and further boost predictive power. Our method is trained, validated, and tested on over 2000 counties from 41 states in the US mainland, covering years from 1981 to 2019. As far as we know, this is the first machine learning method that embeds geographical knowledge in crop yield prediction and predicts crop yields at the county level nationwide. We also laid a solid foundation by comparing our model on a nationwide scale with other well-known baseline methods, including linear models, tree-based models, and deep learning methods. Experiments show that our proposed method consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on various metrics, validating the effectiveness of geospatial and temporal information.

Furthermore, when using nonlinear ML, redundant VCI/TCI data present additional challenges that adversely affect the models’ output. This study proposes a framework that (i) employs higher-order spatial independent component analysis (sICA), and (ii), exploits a combination of the principal component analysis (PCA) and ML (i.e., PCA-ML combination) to deal with the two challenges in order to enhance crop yield prediction accuracy.

Its production is reliant on favorable climatic conditions. Improving the ability of farmers to predict crop productivity under different climatic scenarios, can assist farmers and other stakeholders in making important decisions in terms of agronomy and crop choice. This paper proposes a decision support system prototype for rice crop yield prediction for Maharashtra state, India. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been created in Java using NetBeans tool and Microsoft Office Access database for the ease of farmers and decision makers. The interface allows for the selection of the range of precipitation, minimum temperature, average temperature, maximum temperature and reference crop evapotranspiration and predicts the expected class of yield viz., low, moderate or high. The ranges of the parameters were calculated by using historic data from the study area.

Historically, the requirements for satellites to successfully monitor crop growth and yield differed depending on the extent of the area being monitored. Diverging imaging capabilities can be reconciled by blending images from high-temporal-frequency (HTF) and high-spatial-resolution (HSR) sensors to produce images that possess both HTF and HSR characteristics across large areas. We evaluated the relative performance of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat, and blended imagery for crop yield estimates (2009-2015) using a carbon-turnover yield model deployed across the Australian cropping area. Based on the fraction of missing Landsat observations, we further developed a parsimonious framework to inform when and where blending is beneficial for nationwide crop yield prediction at a finer scale (i.e., the 25-m pixel resolution). Landsat provided the best yield predictions when no observations were missing, which occurred in 17% of the cropping area of Australia. Blending was preferred when <42% of Landsat observations were missing, which occurred in 33% of the cropping area of Australia. MODIS produced a lower prediction error when ≥42% of the Landsat images were missing (~50% of the cropping area). By identifying when and where blending outperforms predictions from either Landsat or MODIS, the proposed framework enables more accurate monitoring of biophysical processes and yields, while keeping computational costs low. © 2020 by the authors.","Crop yield prediction; Data blending; Gap-filling; Landsat; MODIS","Crops; Forecasting; Radiometers; Biophysical process; Computational costs; Crop growth and yields; High spatial resolution; High temporal frequency; Imaging capabilities; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Relative performance; Image processing",Article,Scopus

Satellite-based Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) products have revealed hot spots of photosynthesis over global croplands, such as in the U.S. Midwest. However, to what extent these satellite-based SIF products can enhance the performance of crop yield prediction when benchmarking against other existing satellite data remains unclear. Here we assessed the benefits of using three satellite-based SIF products in yield prediction for maize and soybean in the U.S. Midwest: gap-filled SIF from Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2), new SIF retrievals from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and the coarse-resolution SIF retrievals from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). The yield prediction performances of using SIF data were benchmarked with those using satellite-based vegetation indices (VIs), including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and land surface temperature (LST). Five machine-learning algorithms were used to build yield prediction models with both remote-sensing-only and climate-remote-sensing-combined variables. We found that high-resolution SIF products from OCO-2 and TROPOMI outperformed coarse-resolution GOME-2 SIF product in crop yield prediction. Using high-resolution SIF products gave the best forward predictions for both maize and soybean yields in 2018, indicating the great potential of using satellite-based high-resolution SIF products for crop yield prediction. However, using currently available high-resolution SIF products did not guarantee consistently better yield prediction performances than using other satellite-based remote sensing variables in all the evaluated cases. The relative performances of using different remote sensing variables in yield prediction depended on crop types (maize or soybean), out-of-sample testing methods (five-fold-cross-validation or forward), and record length of training data. We also found that using NIRv could generally lead to better yield prediction performance than using NDVI, EVI, or LST, and using NIRv could achieve similar or even better yield prediction performance than using OCO-2 or TROPOMI SIF products. We concluded that satellite-based SIF products could be beneficial in crop yield prediction with more high-resolution and good-quality SIF products accumulated in the future. © 2020 The Authors","crop yield; forecasting; machine learning; prediction; Solar-induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence","chlorophyll; crop yield; fluorescence; forecasting method; machine learning; maize; NDVI; prediction; satellite imagery; soybean; Midwest; United States; Glycine max",Article,Scopus

Earth observation provides a unique source of information to monitor crops from a diversity of spectral ranges. However, the integrated use of these data and their values in crop yield prediction is still understudied. Here we proposed the combination of environmental data (climate, soil, geography, and topography) with multiple satellite data (optical-based vegetation indices, solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), land surface temperature (LST), and microwave vegetation optical depth (VOD)) into the framework to estimate crop yield for maize, rice, and soybean in northeast China, and their unique value and relative influence on yield prediction was assessed. Two linear regression methods, three machine learning (ML) methods, and one ML ensemble model were adopted to build yield prediction models. Results showed that the individual ML methods outperformed the linear regression methods, the ML ensemble model further improved the single ML models. Moreover, models with more inputs achieved better performance, the combination of satellite data with environmental data, which explained 72%, 69%, and 57% of maize, rice, and soybean yield variability, respectively, demonstrated higher yield prediction performance than individual inputs. While satellite data contributed to crop yield prediction mainly at the early-peak of the growing season, climate data offered extra information mainly at the peak-late season. We also found that the combined use of EVI, LST and SIF has improved the model accuracy compared to the benchmark EVI model. However, the optical-based vegetation indices shared similar information and did not provide much extra information beyond EVI. The within-season yield forecasting showed that crop yields can be satisfactorily forecasted at two to three months prior to harvest. Geography, topography, VOD, EVI, soil hydraulic and nutrient parameters are more important for crop yield prediction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Crop yield; Environmental data; Machine learning; Multi-source satellite data; Yield prediction","Crops; Food supply; Forecasting; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Satellites; Vegetation; Crop yield; Environmental data; Multi-source satellite data; Multi-Sources; Northeast China; Optical-; Satellite data; Solar-induced fluorescences; Vegetation index; Yield prediction; Topography; crop yield; machine learning; optical depth; prediction; satellite data; surface temperature; vegetation index; article; China; climate; fluorescence; forecasting; growing season; harvest; linear regression analysis; machine learning; maize; microwave radiation; nonhuman; nutrient; optical depth; plant yield; prediction; rice; soil; soybean; topography; vegetation; agriculture; crop; season; China; Agriculture; Climate; Crops, Agricultural; Seasons; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

However, their utility is limited by unrealistic time structure of daily rainfall and biases in rainfall frequency and intensity distributions. Crop growth is very sensitive to daily variations of rainfall; thus any mismatch in daily rainfall statistics could impact crop yield simulations. Here, we present an improved methodology to correct GCM rainfall biases and time structure mismatches for maize yield prediction in Katumani, Kenya. This includes GCM bias correction (BC), to correct over- or under-predictions of rainfall frequency and intensity, and nesting corrected GCM information with a stochastic weather generator, to generate daily rainfall realizations conditioned on a given monthly target. Bias-corrected daily GCM rainfall and generated rainfall realizations were used to evaluate crop response. Results showed that corrections of GCM rainfall frequency and intensity could improve crop yield prediction but yields remain under-predicted. This is strongly attributed to the time structure mismatch in daily GCM rainfall leading to excessively long dry spells. To address this, we tested several ways of improving daily structure of GCM rainfall. First, we tested calibrating thresholds in BC but were found not very effective for improving dry spell lengths. Second, we tested BC-stochastic disaggregation (BC-DisAg) and appeared to simulate more realistic dry spell lengths using bias-corrected GCM rainfall information (e.g., frequency, totals) as monthly targets. Using rainfall frequency alone to condition the weather generator removed biases in dry spell lengths, improved predicted yields, but under-predicted yield variability. Combining rainfall frequency and totals, however, not only produced more realistic yield variability but also corrected under-prediction of yields. We envisaged that the presented method would enhance the utility of daily GCM rainfall in crop yield prediction. © 2010 Royal Meteorological Society.","Bias correction; Crop models; GCM; Stochastic disaggregation; Weather generator","Bias correction; Crop models; GCM; Stochastic disaggregation; Weather generator; Climate models; Crops; Drought; Forecasting; Stochastic systems; Rain; climate modeling; computer simulation; correction; crop yield; global climate; maize; precipitation assessment; precipitation intensity; prediction; rainfall; stochasticity; Eastern Province [Kenya]; Katumani; Kenya; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Nowadays, due to the unpredictable climatic changes, farmers are struggling to obtain a good amount of yield from the crops. To feed the increasing population of India, there is a need to incorporate the latest technology and tools in the agricultural sector. This study focuses on the prediction of major kharif crops in Andhra Pradesh’s one of the largest costal districts: Visakhapatnam. As rainfall is the main factor in determining amount of kharif crop production, in this study, first we predict the amount of monsoon rainfall by using modular artificial neural networks (MANNs), and then, we predict the amount of major kharif crops that can be yielded by using the rainfall data and area given to that particular crop by using support vector regression (SVR). By using the methodology of MANNs-SVR, proper agricultural strategies can be made in order to increase the yield of the crops.

While the impacts of these updates on modeled hydrology are well studied, impacts on predicted water quality and crop yield are unresolved. In this study, we evaluated data assimilation effects for a range of predictions in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). We used satellite surface soil moisture data products from the Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission to update SWAT soil moisture for two U.S. experimental watersheds. We addressed possible limitations to the vertical transfer of surface soil moisture updates to deeper layers in the model by additionally testing a modified soil percolation approach that relies on relative saturation rather than the original thresholding behavior of SWAT. Results at both watersheds demonstrated that data assimilation greatly impacted water quality and crop yield predictions. Modifying the soil percolation algorithm, however, did not improve assimilation results. Assimilation increased median soil moisture (+2% to +6 %) which in turn increased total streamflow (+0.43 to +1.70 m3/s daily). Critically, streamflow alone was not a sufficient predictor for the assimilation changes to water quality predictions as flow component contributions and seasonality differed between sites. A varied response in annual water quality predictions to soil moisture updates was identified (+1.70 to +123 kg/ha total nitrogen; −0.11 to −0.57 kg/ha total phosphorous; +8.1 to +50.0 kg/ha sediment) that was dependent upon the timing of the updates, site characteristics, and change to specific transport and transformation processes. Crop yield predictions were similarly impacted by data assimilation from changes to both water and nutrient availability that varied by crop type. The overall strong and diverse response of water quality and crop yield predictions to soil moisture updates provides evidence that assimilation can impact a range of model predictions. Efforts to improve soil moisture simulations, therefore, have potential for meaningful improvements in targeted, non-hydrologic predictions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Data assimilation; Ecohydrologic modeling; Remote sensing; SMAP; Soil moisture; SWAT","Crops; Forecasting; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Soil testing; Solvents; Stream flow; Water quality; Watersheds; Active/passive; Crop yield; Data assimilation; Ecohydrologic models; Moisture data; Quality yield; Remote-sensing; Soil and Water assessment tools; Soil moisture active/passive; Yield prediction; SWAT; crop yield; data assimilation; remote sensing; soil and water assessment tool; soil moisture; soil water; streamflow; water quality; watershed",Article,Scopus

In this regard, this work employs data mining techniques to predict future crop (i.e., Irish potatoes and Maize) harvests using weather and yields historical data for Musanze, a district in Rwanda. The study applies machine learning techniques to predict crop harvests based on weather data and communicate the information about production trends. Weather data and crop yields for Irish potatoes and maize were gathered from various sources. The collected data were analyzed through Random Forest, Polynomial Regression, and Support Vector Regressor. Rainfall and temperature were used as predictors. The models were trained and tested. The results indicate that Random Forest is the best model with root mean square error of 510.8 and 129.9 for potato and maize, respectively, whereas R2 was 0.875 and 0.817 for the same crops datasets. The optimum weather conditions for the optimal crop yield were identified for each crop. The results suggests that Random Forest is recommended model for early crop yield prediction. The findings of this study will go a long way to enhance reliance on data for agriculture and climate change related decisions, especially in low-to-middle income countries such as Rwanda. © 2023 by the authors.","air temperature; crops yield; Irish potato; maize; polynomial regression; prediction; rainfall; random forest; support vector machine",,Article,Scopus

Integrating the power of optimization, machine learning, and agronomic insight, we present a new predictive model (referred to as the interaction regression model) for crop yield prediction, which has three salient properties. First, it achieved a relative root mean square error of 8% or less in three Midwest states (Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa) in the US for both corn and soybean yield prediction, outperforming state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Second, it identified about a dozen environment by management interactions for corn and soybean yield, some of which are consistent with conventional agronomic knowledge whereas some others interactions require additional analysis or experiment to prove or disprove. Third, it quantitatively dissected crop yield into contributions from weather, soil, management, and their interactions, allowing agronomists to pinpoint the factors that favorably or unfavorably affect the yield of a given location under a given weather and management scenario. The most significant contribution of the new prediction model is its capability to produce accurate prediction and explainable insights simultaneously. This was achieved by training the algorithm to select features and interactions that are spatially and temporally robust to balance prediction accuracy for the training data and generalizability to the test data. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"algorithm; article; harvest; Illinois; Indiana; Iowa; machine learning; nonhuman; plant yield; prediction; soil management; soybean; weather",Article,Scopus

Machine learning (ML) is an essential approach for achieving practical and effective solutions for this problem. Many comparisons of ML methods for yield prediction have been made, seeking for the most accurate technique. Generally, the number of evaluated crops and techniques is too low and does not provide enough information for agricultural planning purposes. This paper compares the predictive accuracy of ML and linear regression techniques for crop yield prediction in ten crop datasets. Multiple linear regression, M5-Prime regression trees, perceptron multilayer neural networks, support vector regression and k-nearest neighbor methods were ranked. Four accuracy metrics were used to validate the models: the root mean square error (RMS), root relative square error (RRSE), normalized mean absolute error (MAE), and correlation factor (R). Real data of an irrigation zone of Mexico were used for building the models. Models were tested with samples of two consecutive years. The results show that M5- Prime and k-nearest neighbor techniques obtain the lowest average RMSE errors (5.14 and 4.91), the lowest RRSE errors (79.46% and 79.78%), the lowest average MAE errors (18.12% and 19.42%), and the highest average correlation factors (0.41 and 0.42). Since M5-Prime achieves the largest number of crop yield models with the lowest errors, it is a very suitable tool for massive crop yield prediction in agricultural planning.","K-nearest neighbor; Multiple linear regression; Neural networks; Regression trees; Support vector regression",,Article,Scopus

Crop yield prediction (CYP) is a hot research topic since it depends upon several parameters such as environment, rainfall, soil, water, seasonal crop, etc. Machine learning (ML) models are commonly employed for the extraction of important crop features to predict yield. The ML models act as a decision support tool for CYP, which enables to decide on what type of crops can grow and at what season. With this motivation, this paper focuses on the design of kernel extreme learning machine-based crop yield prediction (KELM-CYP) model. The goal of the KELM-CYP technique is to predict the crop yield based on different parameters such as state name, season crop, area, and rainfall. The proposed KELM-CYP model initially performs data preprocessing in two levels namely data merging and data normalization. Besides, KELM is a kind of machine learning (ML) based model commonly used for regression and classification processes. KELM is an extended version of extreme learning machine (ELM) by the use of kernel transformation process that allows having improved generalization performance owing to the kernel conversion from the input to kernel space. In order to showcase the enhanced predictive outcome of the KELM-CYP model, a wide range of simulations takes place on benchmark datasets from Kaggle repository. The experimental results pointed out the better performance of the KELM-CYP model in terms of different measures. © 2022 IEEE","Agriculture; Crop yield; Kernel extreme learning machine; Machine learning; Prediction model; Rainfall; Regression process","Decision support systems; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Machine learning; Rain; Crop yield; Hot research topics; Kernel extreme learning machine; Learning machines; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Prediction modelling; Regression process; Yield prediction; Yield prediction models; Crops",Conference Paper,Scopus

Due to the frequent climate changes, farmers struggle to achieve a high yield. This work presents an effective methodology for crop yield prediction of major crop production. In the presented methodology, crop yield is predicted by considering soil health data, crop production data and rainfall data. The input soil nutrients, weather and crop production data are processed. The input data is collected from the Uttar Pradesh (UP) region. In the first phase, the soil fertility index estimates the soil quality. In the second phase, the soil quality score and other crop yield related parameters like rainfall and crop production data are taken for further processing. Initially, the input soil health, crop production, and rainfall data are pre-processed. In the pre-processing stage, data cleaning with if-null processing and min-max normalization is used for data standardization. The features are then selected using the adaptive bald eagle search optimization (ABES) approach. Finally, the crop yield prediction of sugarcane, wheat and rice crops is obtained accurately by utilizing a hybrid deep capsule auto encoder with a softmax regression (Hybrid DCAS) model. Here, the hyper-parameter tuning of the presented deep learning model is achieved by a modified Flamingo Search (MFS) optimization approach. The overall implementation is carried out on PYTHON.

Factors impacting CY improvement include rising population, water shortage, fertilizer use, climate change and unprecedented insect attacks. To resolve these issues, a smart agriculture technique is proposed in this work. Internet of Things (IoT) sensor devices are used to collect data from farms, following which the fuzzy association rule-based classification technique classifies the data into two, valuable and nonvaluable. An improved artificial neural network (IANN) algorithm is applied to identify and analyze the factors involved in monitoring CY's. Thereafter, all valuable data pertaining to the type of seed, fertilizer and crop cost is stored in blocks to secure data and communication between members of the farming community. Finally, an edge computing device is used to store the blocks and transfer information. The valuable data collected is classified using the fuzzy association rule and analyzed using the IANN technique, both of which facilitate a comparison with the historical data so as to enable better decision making in terms of seed and fertilizer selection. Similarly, crop price is predicted through a comparison of present and historical yields. To overcome breaches in security, a blockchain technique is employed in this work to secure communication between farmers, investors and merchants. The investor dispatches instructions on the selection of the seed and fertilizer, as well as the crop cost, through the blockchain to the farmer and the merchant. Such secure communication bypasses third-party involvement and inconsistencies in the data. When compared to the traditional method, the proposed technique offers better accuracy and profits, right from seed selection to trading. The proposed IANN technique produced a higher yield than the traditional method with a profit of 51%, 35% and 20% for rice, bananas and flowers, respectively. Similarly, the IANN technique provides 99.15% prediction accuracy in terms of a profit analysis. The blockchain and edge computing-based transactions improve security and reduce transactional latency. The proposed system ensures sustainability and traceability in agriculture. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.","agriculture yield; artificial neural network; blockchain; cloud storage; Crop yield prediction; fuzzy and association rules; internet of things; random forest","Association rules; Crops; Decision trees; Digital storage; Fertilizers; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy rules; Internet of things; Network security; Profitability; Agriculture yield; Block-chain; Cloud storages; Crop yield; Crop yield prediction; Edge computing; Fuzzy association rule; Neural network techniques; Random forests; Yield prediction; Blockchain",Article,Scopus

However, the calibration of a simulation model for tea yield prediction and the comparison of these approaches is needed regarding the different data types. This research study aims to provide a comparative study of the methods for tea yield prediction using the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations AquaCrop simulation model and machine learning techniques.

Several parameters such as weather, pests, biophysical and physio morphological features merit their consideration while determining the yield. However, these parameters are uncertain in their nature, thus making the determined amount of yield to be approximate. It is exactly here that the fuzzy logic comes into play. This paper elaborates an attempt to develop fuzzy inference systems for crop yield prediction. Physio morphological features of Sorghum were considered. A huge database (around 1000 records) of physio morphological features such as days of 50 percent flowering, dead heart percentage, plant height, panicle length, panicle weight and number of primaries and the corresponding yield were considered for the development of the model. In order to find out the sensitivity of parameters, one-to-one, two-to-one and three-to-one combinations of input and output were considered. The results have clearly shown that panicle length contributes for the yield as the lone parameter with almost one-to-one matching between predicted yield and actual value while panicle length and panicle weight in combination seemed to play a decisive role in contributing for the yield with the prediction accuracy reflected by very low RMS value. © de Gruyter 2012.","Approximate Reasoning; Crop Yield; Fuzzy Logic; Fuzzy Rule Base; Membership Functions; Physio-Morphological Features","Agricultural activities; Approximate reasoning; Crop yield; Fuzzy inference systems; Fuzzy rule base; Input and outputs; Market requirements; Morphological features; Panicle length; Physio-Morphological Features; Plant height; Predicted yield; Prediction accuracy; Sensitivity of parameters; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy systems; Membership functions; Uncertainty analysis; Agriculture",Article,Scopus

For example, the root mean square errors (RMSE) ranged between 6 and 14% of the average observed yield with RF models in all test cases whereas these values ranged from 14% to 49% for MLR models. Our results show that RF is an effective and versatile machine-learning method for crop yield predictions at regional and global scales for its high accuracy and precision, ease of use, and utility in data analysis. RF may result in a loss of accuracy when predicting the extreme ends or responses beyond the boundaries of the training data. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

A set of nine regional configurations with eight regional models from the ENSEMBLES project is evaluated. Although they are all based on similar large-scale conditions, the performances of regional models in reproducing the most crucial variables for crop production are extremely variable. This therefore leads to a large dispersion in crop yield prediction when using regional models in a climate/crop modelling system. This dispersion comes from the different physics in each regional model and also the choice of parametrizations for a single regional model. Indeed, two configurations of the same regional model are sometimes more distinct than two different regional models. Promising results are obtained when applying a bias correction technique to climate model outputs. Simulated yields with bias corrected climate variables show much more realistic means and standard deviations. However, such a bias correction technique is not able to improve the reproduction of the year-to-year variations of simulated yields. This study confirms the importance of the multi-model approach for quantifying uncertainties for impact studies and also stresses the benefits of combining both regional and statistical downscaling techniques. Finally, it indicates the urgent need to address the main uncertainties in atmospheric processes controlling the monsoon system and to contribute to the evaluation and improvement of climate and weather forecasting models in that respect. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.","climate impacts; climate modelling; crop yield; West Africa",,Article,Scopus

However, few studies focus specifically on fundamental issues encountered in developing a high-performance statistical crop model for yield prediction. Such issues include: how to select predictors and fitting functions, how to effectively address the spatiotemporal scale issue, weather it is beneficial to include satellite data as explanatory variables, and how to reconcile different model evaluation procedures. In this study, we present our statistical modeling practices for predicting rainfed corn yield in the Midwest U.S. and address the aforementioned issues through comprehensive diagnostic analysis. Our results show that vapor pressure deficit and precipitation at a monthly scale, in spline form with customized knots, define the “Best Climate-only” model among alternative climate variables (e.g., air temperature) and fitting functions (e.g., linear or polynomial), with an out-of-sample (leave-one-year-out) median R 2 of 0.79 and RMSE of 1.04 t/ha (16.6 bu/acre) from 2003 to 2016. Satellite variables, such as MODIS land surface temperature and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), when used as predictors alone, reduce the model's RMSE to 0.93 t/ha (14.8 bu/acre). Adding satellite variables (i.e., EVI in polynomial form) to the “Best Climate-only” model gives the “Best Climate + EVI” model, which has the highest prediction performance of this study, with a median R 2 of 0.85 and RMSE of 0.90 t/ha (14.3 bu/acre). Such a model trained using all data (so-called “global model”) in most cases leads to better predictions than the state-specific trained models. However, the global model's prediction performance exhibits considerable regional and interannual variations. The regional-varying performance is related to states’ spatiotemporal variability in yield, where states with larger spatial yield variability show higher R 2 , and states with smaller temporal yield variability show lower RMSE. Interannual variations in prediction performance are linked to yield variability and degree of wetness, with higher R 2 in years with larger yield variability but increasingly larger RMSE toward wetter years and extreme dry years. These identified spatial and temporal variations of model's performance, together with inconsistent evaluation practices undermine the comparability between statistical modeling studies. Alleviating such comparability issues requires more transparency and open data practices. The statistical model presented in this study provides a benchmark for further development and can be applied to future research related to yield prediction or assessment of climate change impact. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Corn; Statistical model; Yield forecast; Yield prediction","agricultural modeling; agriculture; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; forecasting method; land surface; maize; model; MODIS; prediction; rainfed agriculture; spatiotemporal analysis; statistical analysis; surface temperature; vapor pressure; vegetation index; Midwest; United States; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

As a result, farmers rely on accurate weather forecasts to run their businesses. Agriculture is interwoven with other industries, including the sugar industry, which relies on sugarcane farmers. They may be able to better organise their logistics by employing machine learning or artificial intelligence to estimate agricultural production. As a result, both AI and connected IoT devices have a lot of potential in agriculture. When estimating agricultural yields, there are various elements to consider. Weather trends, satellite images, soil quality, and the potential of an infestation are all investigated in this location. When all of these criteria are taken into account, a complete picture of when crops should be planted emerges. In the event that unanticipated problems develop, there are also 'what-if' scenarios and backup plans in place. Climate change can affect agricultural production in a variety of ways, including changes in average temperatures, precipitation amounts, heat waves, CO2 levels in the air, and ozone levels at ground level. Climate change has a wide range of affects from country to country. Lower-elevation countries are more prone to have difficulties producing crops. Equipment capable of accurately predicting the evolution of weather patterns is required Weather forecasts based on statistics look at previous data to see if there are any patterns between seasons. As a result, the winter data can be used to forecast summer temperatures. Winter temperatures will almost probably alter if summer temperatures change. In the published literature, researchers have detailed their confirmed solutions to various problems. If prior concepts are used without first receiving a qualified review, future researchers will not get the desired results. If the researchers don't first undertake a thorough investigation of the most recent indications of performance, it's likely that they won't be able to find evidence of future growth in the direction of excellence.

The agricultural production is struggling to keep up the level of required crop yields due to numerous risks affecting the yield. The past two decades have witnessed the increased intensity of agricultural production risks due to challenges posed by climate changes. There is a dire need to address it with proper insights into the data attributes impacting the crop yield. Currently, many of the machine learning and deep learning methods focus on training the model using the data collected and stored in a centralized data repository. However, many attributes related to weather data, soil data and crop management data are scattered and siloed to particular organization servers or smart farming devices. In this study, we are proposing a federated learning method for training yield prediction models on a horizontally distributed dataset located on different client devices. In particular, federated averaging algorithm is used to train the deep residual network based regression models such as ResNet-16 and ResNet-28 for soybean yield prediction in a decentralized setting and compare its performance with deep learning and machine learning methods. The results from experimented learning models show that federated averaging using ResNet-16 regression model with Adam optimizer yielded optimal results compared to centralized learning models and can be easily deployed for yield prediction in a federated setting. © 2022 IEEE.","Agricultural Production Risk Management; Deep Learning; Federated Averaging; Federated Learning; Machine Learning; Soybean Yield Prediction","Climate change; Deep learning; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Risk management; Agricultural production risk management; Agricultural productions; Crop yield; Deep learning; Federated averaging; Federated learning; Learning methods; Machine-learning; Soybean yield prediction; Yield prediction; Crops",Conference Paper,Scopus

As a result, to enhance the efficiency of crop yields via new technology is a critical step in obtaining competitive crops.

Optimal management strategies however rely on early estimates of climate and yield. These estimates are usually derived from the historic range of climate variations applied to current crop conditions. Early in the season these predictions are wide ranging as they incorporate all past historic climate variability and hence a large range of possible yields. Dynamical seasonal climate models offer the opportunity to narrow this range contingent on the models having adequate predictive skill. This study explores the benefits of using a climate model over historical climate to predict wheat yield in the Australian cropping zone throughout the cropping season. We take an ensemble of daily outputs of temperature, radiation and rainfall from a seasonal climate model (POAMA) and apply a simple downscaling and calibration to align with 57 stations across the Australian cropping zone. These data are then used as an input to a crop model (APSIM) to translate seasonal conditions into a yield prediction. Simulations deploy historic weather data up to a date on which forecast data replace measured data. Here we used a range of dates (April to October) through the cropping season for the period 1981 to 2015, to determine where and when the forecast is skilful compared to using the full weather record up to harvest. The forecasts are categorised in three yield categories low (decile 1–3), average (4–7) and high (8–10) and determined to be ‘misleading’ if they predict low instead of high or vice versa. In the west and south of Australia less than 3 years in 20 give a misleading forecast in April, and less than 1 in 20 years by August. The forecast for east of Australia has less skill primarily due to a strong rainfall bias with the climate model not being able to simulate the correct daily rainfall patterns. Compared to the predictions gained from using the full range of historical climate, POAMA derived forecasts have a narrower prediction range than the climatology driven ones, however this comes at the expense of a higher number of misleading forecasts. Nevertheless, in June (August) the POAMA driven simulations have a greater than 65% (80%) chance of being in the correct or one category out, which was higher than using climatology in each region at the same lead time. The baseline set by this study demonstrates the potential utility of dynamic climate models to predict yield, which should only improve with on-going advances in climate modelling and techniques in downscaling. © 2018","APSIM; GCM; Grain yield forecast; Seasonal climate forecast","climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; crop yield; ensemble forecasting; rainfall; seasonality; solar radiation; temperature; wheat; Australia; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

This study aims to develop a crop yield forecasting model at large spatial scales using meteorological variables closely related to crop growth. The influence of climate patterns on agricultural productivity can be spatially inhomogeneous due to local soil and environmental conditions. We propose a Bayesian spatially varying functional model (BSVFM) to predict county-level corn yield for five Midwestern states, based on annual precipitation and daily maximum and minimum temperature trajectories modeled as multivariate functional predictors. The proposed model accommodates spatial correlation and measurement errors of functional predictors, and respects the spatially heterogeneous relationship between the response and associated predictors by allowing the functional coefficients to vary over space. The model also incorporates a Bayesian variable selection device to further expand its capacity to accommodate spatial heterogeneity. The proposed method is demonstrated to outperform other highly competitive methods in corn yield prediction, owing to the flexibility of allowing spatial heterogeneity with spatially varying coefficients in our model.

Forecasting or predicting the crop yield well ahead of its harvest time would assist the strategists and farmers for taking suitable measures for selling and storage. Accurate prediction of crop development stages plays an important role in crop production management. Such predictions will also support the allied industries for strategizing the logistics of their business. Several means and approaches of predicting and demonstrating crop yields have been developed earlier with changing rate of success, as these don't take into considerations the weather and its characteristics and are mostly empirical. For this a combined constructional and methodological approach is proposed like variety inception, pesticide & fertilizer management, integrated cropping, rainwater harvesting, efficient irrigation techniques etc. would also be needed. The neural network algorithm is less prone to error than other machine learning and data mining techniques, making it an effective machine learning tool for predicting crop yields. The ANN back propagation algorithm is used to determine the appropriate weight value to calculate the error derivative. The accuracy of the crop yield estimation for the diverse crops involved in strategizing and planning is deliberated to be one of the utmost significant issues for agronomic production purposes. The yield prediction is still considered to be a major issue that remains to be explained based on available data for some agricultural areas. Crop monitoring and forecasting of crop yields for the proposed system will be carried out via satellite images with low resolution. The combination of extensive and extended topographical coverage and its high temporal frequency make these images an appropriate choice for the prediction of crop yields. To ease the training, the dimensionality of the data is reduced by supposing that the position of pixels doesn't influence the typical crop yield. The prototype distinguishes between crops, the infrared and temperature bands of images taken during apex growing season contribute the most to the crop prediction.

Near real-time satellites observations can be used to mitigate the adverse impacts of extreme events and promote climate resilience. Population growth and demand of resources in developing countries will increase vulnerability in agriculture production and are likely to be exacerbated by the effects of climate change. This paper introduces wetness and temperature products as important factors in decision and policy making, especially in regions with sparse surface observations. These objective satellite data serve as: (1) an early detector of growing conditions and thus food supply; (2) an index for insurance programs (i.e. risk management) that can more quickly trigger release of catastrophic bonds to farmers to mitigate crop failure impact; (3) an important educational and informational tool in crop selection, resource management, and other adaptation or mitigation strategies; (4) an important tool in food aid and transport; (5) and management of water resource allocation.

It relay on weather and other environmental aspects. Some of the factors on which agriculture is dependent are Soil, climate, flooding, fertilizers, temperature, precipitation, crops, insecticides and herb. The crop yield is dependent on these factors and hence difficult to predict. To know the status of crop production, in this work we perform descriptive study on agricultural data using various machine learning techniques. Crop yield estimates include estimating crop yields from available historical data such as precipitation data, soil data, and historic crop yields. This prediction will help farmers to predict crop yield before farming. Here we are utilizing three datasets like as clay dataset, precipitation dataset, and production dataset of Karnataka state, then we structure an assembled data sets and on this dataset we employ three different algorithms to get the genuine assessed yield and the precision of three different methods. K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Support Vector Machine(SVM), and Decision tree algorithms are applied on the training dataset and are tested with the test dataset, and the implementation of these algorithms is done using python programming and spyder tool. The performance comparison of algorithms is shown using mean absolute error, cross validation and accuracy and it is found that Decision tree is giving accuracy of 99% with very less mean square error(MSE).

Wheat, maize, and rice are major crops contributing to global food security. The impact of climate change on crop yield with different models and techniques has been projected; this article reviewed the worldwide impact of climate change on future wheat, rice, and maize production. Wheat and maize crop yields may increase due to climate change in colder regions and may decrease in the countries near the equator. The increase in carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere may help wheat and maize crops regarding increased carbon intake in colder regions. The rice crop yield may decrease in almost all major rice-producing countries due to water scarcity, which can be amplified due to climate change. The impact of climate change on crop yield prediction involves uncertainties due to different crop models, global circulation models, and bias correction techniques. It is recommended to use multiple climatic models and more than one bias correction technique for better climatic projections. Adaptation measures could help to reduce the adverse impacts of future climate on agriculture. Shifting the planting calendar, irrigation and nutrient management, improving crop varieties, and expanding the agricultural areas are suggested as the most effective adaptation actions in response to climate change.

However, most reported studies are vague on the choice of the global circulation models (GCMs) for climate projections, and on the corresponding uncertainty with this type of model simulations. Here we investigated whether climate-crop modelling can be used for identifying crop management-level adaptation options. We focused our analyses on a case study for maize in southern Africa using the APSIM crop growth model and projections from 17 individual climate models for the period 2017–2060 for the contrasting representative concentration pathways 2.6 and 8.5. Intensification of nitrogen fertiliser use (from 30 to 90 kg N ha−1) was simulated as an example of a crop management-level adaptation to climate change. Uncertainties in crop yield predictions were about 30 to 60%, i.e. larger than expected crop responses to most management-level interventions or adaptations. Variation in simulated yields was caused by inter-seasonal rainfall variability and uncertainty with climate models. Some GCMs resulted in significantly different maize yield predictions, without any clear pattern across sites. Given these high uncertainties, we argue that crop modellers should be cautious when informing future crop management adaptation strategies based on climate-crop model ensembles. A better use of crop models is the simulation of crop responses to current weather variability aiming at the identification of crop management practices for coping with climate variability. Promising practices can then be evaluated with farmers on their feasibility over a range of plausible future biophysical and socio-economic farming conditions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; Climate models; Crop modelling; Crop yield; Uncertainty","agricultural management; agricultural modeling; climate change; climate modeling; crop yield; maize; seasonal variation; uncertainty analysis; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; South Africa; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Crop simulation models can provide the capability for predicting physiological and yield effects of these environmental changes across a wide range of species and day-to-day conditions. Much more is now known about rubisco kinetics, photosynthetic response to CO2, stomatal function, and leaf-level feedback mechanisms than 10 to 15 yr ago. Despite these advances, few whole crop models use leaf-level rubisco kinetics to model photosynthetic sensitivity to CO2 and almost none use an energy balance to predict foliage temperature and CO2-induced decreases in transpiration. These advances can be incorporated into whole canopy models of photosynthesis and energy balance that are sensitive to CO2, temperature, and humidity. Species differences in photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO2 and environmental or genotypic regulations of the amount and activity of rubisco represent significant knowledge gaps. We need better information on the second-order effects of CO2-enrichment on partitioning of assimilates and ability of plants to use the additional photosynthate. Model improvements are needed in predicting source-sink imbalances in order to simulate feedback inhibition effects on the photosynthetic response to CO2.

Five ML models (linear regression, LASSO, LightGBM, random forest, and XGBoost) and six ensemble models have been designed to address the research question. The results suggest that adding simulation crop model variables (APSIM) as input features to ML models can decrease yield prediction root mean squared error (RMSE) from 7 to 20%. Furthermore, we investigated partial inclusion of APSIM features in the ML prediction models and we found soil moisture related APSIM variables are most influential on the ML predictions followed by crop-related and phenology-related variables. Finally, based on feature importance measure, it has been observed that simulated APSIM average drought stress and average water table depth during the growing season are the most important APSIM inputs to ML.

In contrast to conventional regression-based yield prediction methods, a very broad range of possible input features and their combinations are exhaustively tested for maximum explanatory power. Weather variables such as temperature, precipitation, and sunshine duration are aggregated over different seasonal time periods preceding the harvest to 45 potential input features per original variable. In a first step, this large set of features is reduced to those aggregates very probably holding explanatory power for observed yields. The second, computationally demanding step evaluates predictions for all districts with all of their possible combinations. Step three selects those combinations of weather features that showed the highest predictive power across districts. Finally, the district-specific best performing regressions among these are used for actual prediction, and the results are spatially aggregated. To evaluate the new approach, ABSOLUT v1.2 is applied to predict the yields of silage maize, winter wheat, and other major crops in Germany based on two decades of data from about 300 districts. It turned out to be absolutely crucial to not only make out-of-sample predictions (solely based on data excluding the target year to predict) but to also consequently separate training and testing years in the process of feature selection. Otherwise, the prediction accuracy would be over-estimated by far. The question arises whether performances claimed for other statistical modelling examples are often upward-biased through input variable selection disregarding the out-of-sample principle. © 2022, The Author(s).","Crop yield modelling; Machine learning; Multiple linear regression; Statistical inference; Weather-based yield prediction","crop; season; statistical model; weather; wheat; Crops, Agricultural; Linear Models; Seasons; Triticum; Weather",Article,Scopus

The agencies require advance estimates of production of major crops at a regional scale for taking various policy decisions. Hence, it is necessary to develop operational systems for crop monitoring and yield forecasting. Unlike the traditional annual crop yield estimates based on the statistics-based framework, remote sensing techniques are recognized as an effective approach for yield forecasting. In particular, the microwave remote sensing data have gained importance due to its all-weather imaging capability and sensitivity to crop phenological changes. In this present work, an integrated framework ‘SASYA-Space technology for Agricultural Systems and Yield forecasting Algorithm’ is introduced for crop yield forecasting using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing images. SASYA incorporates a model inversion scheme to estimate crop biophysical parameters (Leaf Area Index–LAI and wet biomass) simultaneously using a multi-output support vector regression (MSVR). The framework cross-link the MSVR based inversion module with a yield prediction module, which utilizes the WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) crop simulation model. The robustness of the framework is assessed for estimation of winter barley yield using L-band NISAR data simulated using full-pol L-band E-SAR airborne SAR data acquired during AgriSAR 2006 campaign over DEMMIN test site in Germany. The simulated NISAR data in HH-HV-VV, HH-HV, and VV-HV modes are first compared by investigating accuracies to estimate crop biophysical parameters with the inversion of Water Cloud Model. These LAI and wet biomass estimates are then used in SASYA framework to assimilate with WOFOST crop yield model to estimate grain yield. Different polarization modes HH-HV-VV, HH-HV, and VV-HV are also assessed to investigate best performance in grain yield estimation. Also, different test cases are considered to find the suitable acquisition dates based on crop phenological stages, which returns the best potential yield estimation. The SAR images during heading and early fruit development stage are found to be most important for yield prediction with lowest RMSE error in the range of 0.57–1.612 ton/ha.

Using crop dataset of various crops from various regions of India, rainfall and temperature dataset for same regions , the proposed model is used to predict crop yield. The aim of proposed model is to develop a tool which is meant to deliver prediction based on the crop of the individual.

Model performance evaluation in ungauged basins is an important research topic. In this study, we propose a framework for developing Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) input data, including hydrography, terrain, land use, soil, tile, weather, and management practices, for the Upper Mississippi River basin (UMRB). We also present a performance evaluation of SWAT hydrologic budget and crop yield simulations in the UMRB without calibration. The uncalibrated SWAT model ably predicts annual streamflow at 11 USGS gauges and crop yield at a four-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) scale. For monthly streamflow simulation, the performance of SWAT is marginally poor compared with that of annual flow, which may be due to incomplete information about reservoirs and dams within the UMRB. Further validation shows that SWAT can predict base flow contribution ratio reasonably well. Compared with three calibrated SWAT models developed in previous studies of the entire UMRB, the uncalibrated SWAT model presented here can provide similar results. Overall, the SWAT model can provide satisfactory predictions on hydrologic budget and crop yield in the UMRB without calibration. The results emphasize the importance and prospects of using accurate spatial input data for the physically based SWAT model. This study also examines biofuel-biomass production by simulating all agricultural lands with switchgrass, producing satisfactory results in estimating biomass availability for biofuel production. © 2010 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Crop yield; Soil and water assessment tool; Streamflow; Ungauged basin; Upper Mississippi River basin","Agricultural land; Annual flow; Baseflows; Best management practices; Biofuel production; Biomass availability; Biomass productions; Crop yield; Distributed hydrologic model; Hydrologic budgets; Incomplete information; Input datas; Land-use change; Management practices; Model performance evaluations; Performance evaluation; Physically based; Research topics; Satisfactory predictions; Soil and water assessment tool; Spatial input data; Streamflow simulations; SWAT model; Switchgrass; Ungauged basins; Upper Mississippi; Biofuels; Budget control; Calibration; Crops; Forecasting; Groundwater flow; Input output programs; Land use; Reservoirs (water); Rivers; Soils; Stream flow; Water resources; Watersheds; Climate models; agricultural land; agricultural modeling; biofuel; biomass; calibration; crop yield; grass; hydrological modeling; model test; performance assessment; river basin; streamflow; water budget; yield response; Mississippi Basin; United States; Panicum virgatum",Article,Scopus

Traditional insurance for financial risk management is impractical in developing countries because of high transaction costs, adverse selection, information asymmetry, poor distribution and other challenges which hinder the availability of protection. Area-based index insurance is viewed as a promising financial risk management solution for smallholder farmers in developing countries, such as, Ghana. However, estimating the yield (i.e., yield prediction) is a critical part of pricing the premium for this insurance instrument. Because of the importance of predicting crop yield, the purpose of this study is to apply several forecasting methods for evaluating crop yield estimates in Ghana. Crop yield forecasting, which provides information for decision makers, is important in many ways to Ghana's economy. We compare yield forecasts using Simple Exponential Smoothing, Double Exponential Smoothing, Damped-Trend Linear Exponential Smoothing, and ARMA models applied separately to each district. The ARMA models proved to be more robust time-series models than the smoothing techniques for predicting crop yield in this study. This predictive power of ARMA models even with the presence of crop yield ""cycle"" does not depend on the length of cycle. Therefore, the results of this study indicate that the ARMA model is preferable over other time series models considered in this paper. The implication of the findings in this study is significant for insurance underwriters responsible for constructing area-based yield insurance that can benefit the Microinsurance market of smallholder farmers and for institutions that rely on those forecasts in providing capital.",,,Article,Scopus

This is particularly significant with respect to gradually developing anomalies such as droughts. The impact of the 1995-1996 drought on the Oklahoma wheat crop, and the possibility that predictive information might have reduced some of the losses, is examined through a combined modeling approach using climatological data and a crop growth model that takes into account an extensive range of soil, climatic, and plant variables. The results show potential outcomes and also illustrate the point at which all possible climatic outcomes were predicting a significantly low wheat yield. Based on anecdotal evidence of the 1995-1996 drought, which suggested that farmers who planted at different times experienced different yields, the model was run assuming a variety of different planting dates. Results indicate that there is indeed a noticeable difference in the modeled wheat yields given different planting dates. The information regarding effectiveness of planting date can be used in conjunction with current long-range forecasts to develop improved predictions for the current growing season. This approach produces information regarding the likelihood of extreme precipitation events and the impact on crop yield, which can provide a powerful tool to farmers and others during periods of drought or other climatic extremes. © 2007 ISB.","Climatic impacts on agriculture; Drought; Wheat yield forecast","acclimatization; article; biological model; computer simulation; environment; growth, development and aging; physiology; season; United States; wheat; Acclimatization; Computer Simulation; Environment; Models, Biological; Oklahoma; Seasons; Triticum; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

This system uses a machine learning algorithm trained on historical field data combined with spectral information extracted from satellite images. To this end, we used 5 years of historical data for a Moroccan orchard composed of 50 parcels. These data are related to climate, amount of water used for irrigation, fertilization products by dose, phytosanitary treatment dose, parcel size, and root-stock type on each parcel. Additionally, two very popular indices, the normalized difference vegetation index and normalized difference water index were extracted from Sentinel 2 and Landsat satellite images to improve prediction scores. We managed to build a total dataset composed of 250 rows, representing the 50 parcels over a period of 5 years labeled with the yield of each parcel. Several machine learning algorithms were tested with the necessary parameter optimization, while the orthonormal automatic pursuit algorithm gave good prediction scores of 0.2489 (MAE: Mean Absolute Error) and 0.0843 (MSE: Mean Squared Error).

The objective of this study is to analyse the contribution of intra seasonal rainfall indicators, namely dry and wet spells, for predicting millet yields at regional scale in Senegal using multiple linear regression. Using dry and wet spells with traditional indicators i.e. proxies of crop biomass and cumulated rainfall, hereafter called remote sensing indicators (NDVI, SPI3, WSI and RG), we analysed the ability of dry and wet spells alone or combined with these remote sensing indicators to provide intraseasonal forecasts covering the period 1991–2010. We analysed all 12 regions producing millet and found that results vary strongly between regions and also during the season, as a function of the dekad of prediction. At the spatial scale, the strongest performing combinations include the dry spell indicators DSC20 and DSxl in the peanut basin. While in the south of the country, the combination of wet period indicators WS1 or WSC5 with the RG is fairly reliable. Focussing on Thies, our best region in the groundnut basin, we showed that dry and wet spells indicators can explain up to 80% of yield variations, alone or in combination with remote sensing indicators. Regarding the timing of prediction, millet yield can be forecast as early as July with an accuracy of 40% of the mean yield but the best forecast is obtained in early September, at the peak of crop development (accuracy of 100 kg/ha i.e. 20% of the mean yield).

As an object-based method, it is spatially scalable from parcel to regional scale, making it useful for prediction tasks in which the reference data are available only at a coarser level, such as counties. We show that deep learning-based temporal convolutional network (TCN) outperforms the classical machine learning method random forests and produces more accurate results overall than published national crop forecasts. Our novel contribution is to show that mean-aggregated regional predictions with histogram-based features calculated from farm-level observations perform better than other tested approaches. In addition, TCN is robust to the presence of cloudy pixels, suggesting TCN can learn cloud masking from the data. The temporal compositing of information do not improve prediction performance. This indicates that with end-to-end learning less preprocessing in SITS tasks seems viable. © 2022 by the authors.","agriculture; crop production statistics; machine learning; object-based; remote sensing; time series; yield forecasts","Convolution; Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Deep learning; Food supply; Forecasting; Time series; Convolutional networks; Crop production; Crop production statistic; Crop yield; Machine-learning; Object based; Objects-based; Remote-sensing; Times series; Yield forecast; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

Data-driven models use spatiotemporal information that relate to plant growth and can be correlated with yield. Such data is available at different spatial resolutions so a decision is needed about what spatial resolution we should model at which can be determined based on the required management resolution; however, this does not always match the resolution of the input data. Prediction quality can change with spatial resolution. Therefore, this work focused on exploring changes in prediction quality with changes in the spatial resolution of predictors and the predictions. More specifically, this study investigated whether inputs should be resampled prior to modeling or the modeling implemented first with aggregation of predictions happening as a final step. The study consisted of 59 fields over six years in the south-west region of Australia. Rainfed canola, barley and wheat were used for this study. Data used for modeling were acquired from different sources. These data consisted of interpolated yield monitor data and soil sensor data, Landsat 8 data, elevation data, digital soil maps, and weather data.

We applied two methods to select input variables, used the random forest method to establish yield estimation models, and verified the accuracy of the models in three disaster years (1997, 2000, and 2001). The results show that the R2 values of the eight yield estimation models established in the two provinces were all above 0.7, Lin’s concordance correlation coefficients were all above 0.84, and the mean absolute relative errors were all below 0.14. The mean absolute relative error of the yield estimations in the three disaster years was 0.12 in Jilin Province and 0.13 in Liaoning Province. A model built using variables selected by a two-stage importance evaluation method can obtain a better accuracy with fewer variables. The final yield estimation model of Jilin province adopts eight independent variables, and the final yield estimation model of Liaoning Province adopts nine independent variables. Among the 11 adopted variables in two provinces, ATT (accumulated temperature above 10◦C) variables accounted for the highest proportion (54.54%).

Six fields in Atlantic Canada including three fields in Prince Edward Island (PE) and three fields in New Brunswick (NB) were sampled, over two (2017 and 2018) growing seasons, for soil electrical conductivity, soil moisture content, soil slope, normalized-difference vegetative index (NDVI), and soil chemistry.

Four datasets, namely PE-2017, PE-2018, NB-2017, and NB-2018, were then formed by combing data points from three fields to represent the province data for the respective years. Modeling techniques were employed to generate yield predictions assessed with different statistical parameters.

So this research deals with the automatic classification approach which provides help to the farmers and decrease their efforts. With the change of climate in the world, the mainstreams of the crops in the agricultural field are severely affected in performance in previous decades. The crop prediction yielding should be healthy to help the farmers for taking suitable procedures for selling and loading/storage. Such estimations on the yielding of the crops will also assist the industries based on the farming and production of the crops for development of the logistics of their commercials. Numerous approaches of estimating and crop yielding have been established in the previous times with variable success rates. This paper deals with the prediction of the wheat crop yielding using data mining approaches. The paper deals with the clustering approach using k-means clustering and feature extraction using independent component analysis and the classification is done using linear discriminant analysis and the simulation is done using MATLAB environment. From the result and discussions it can be noticed that our proposed approach is able to achieve less error rate probabilities and high signal to noise ratio.

Crop growth models have been considered as potential tools for simulating growth and yield of crops. Hence, DSSAT v 4.5/ CERES-Rice (Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer / Crop Estimation through Resource and Environment Synthesis) was applied to validate the Rice productivity from Bihar State in India. Long term historical weather data (1980-2011) and (1985-2011) from South and North West Alluvial plane zones of Bihar was used for yield analysis. Genetic coefficients required for running the CERES-Rice vs 4.5 model were derived and the performance of the model was tested under the climate variability conditions experienced by these two agroclimatic zones. Management combinations simulated were three transplanting dates (1st, 15th &amp; 30th July) for rice cultivar Rmansuri under rainfed conditions. The results indicated that both the early and late sowing dates result in lower yields as compared to optimum sowing date of 15th July. The simulated phenology and yield were found to be in agreement with observed data suggesting that the calibrated model may be operationally used with routinely observed soil, crop management and weather parameters for Rice yield estimation from these two regions of Bihar. The analysis also brought out that the yield differences under potential and rainfed condition during the study period, was influenced by variations in thermal, radiation regime as well as moisture regimes. The results showed that phenological stage of panicle initiation to grain filling is sensitive to water and Nitrogen availability status in the Rice Crop. This model is also satisfactory in predicting the Rice phenology. These results indicate that the CERES rice vs 4.5 models is capable of estimating growth stages and grain yield of rice cultivar Rmansuri in climatic conditions of Bihar with reasonable accuracy and hence show potential for its use as a tool in making various strategic and tactical decisions related to Agriculture planning in the state of Bihar. © 2014, India Meteorological Department.

In this investigation, the stochastic average monthly temperature profiles for a selected study area were used to determine the effects on crop production. The areas within the study area were spatially scaled to correspond to individual shires within the South West Agricultural region of Western Australia. The temperature was sampled for three selected years of crop production for 2002, 2003 and 2005. The evaluation was carried out using graphical, correlation and data mining regression techniques in order to detect the patterns of crop production.

Climate change is expected to have an adverse impact particularly on crop production. Previous studies have shown large discrepancies in the magnitude and sometimes in the direction of the impact on crop production. We assessed the impact of climate change on growth and yield of maize and wheat in Ethiopia using a multi-crop model ensemble. The multi-model ensemble (n = 48) was set up using the agroecosystem modelling framework Expert-N. The framework is modular which facilitates combining different submodels for plant growth and soil processes. The multi-model ensemble was driven by climate change projections representing the mid of the century (2021-2050) from ten contrasting climate models downscaled to finer resolution. The contributions of different sources of uncertainty in crop yield prediction were quantified. The sensitivity of crop yield to elevated CO2, increased temperature, changes in precipitations and N fertilizer were also assessed. Our results indicate that grain yields were very sensitive to changes in [CO2], temperature and N fertilizer amounts where the responses were higher for wheat than maize. The response to change in precipitation was weak, which we attribute to the high water holding capacity of the soils due to high organic carbon contents at the study sites. This may provide the sufficient buffering capacity for extended time periods with low amounts of precipitation. Under the changing climate, wheat productivity will be a major challenge with a 36 to 40% reduction in grain yield by 2050 while the impact on maize was modest. A major part of the uncertainty in the projected impact could be attributed to differences in the crop growth models. A considerable fraction of the uncertainty could also be traced back to different soil water dynamics modeling approaches in the model ensemble, which is often ignored. Uncertainties varied among the studied crop species and cultivars as well. The study highlights significant impacts of climate change on wheat yield in Ethiopia whereby differences in crop growth models causes the large part of the uncertainties. © 2022 Rettie et al.

Many agricultural crops in India have been impacted by climate change. As a country's population grows, its reliance on agriculture grows, and the country's economic process suffers as a result. In this situation, crop yields have a significant impact on the country's economic progress. There were insufficient food grains to feed the populace. Despite the existence of numerous methodologies or procedures for estimating agricultural production, their accuracy is not up to par. According to the literature review, there are no acceptable remedies or technologies to address the aforementioned condition. This method represented a push toward over-mechanization of agriculture. Agriculturists were encouraged and supported to engage in technology-based farming. This initiative attempts to assist farmers in forecasting future harvests and properly managing their costs by taking into account variables such as temperature, rainfall, and land acreage. To forecast the crop output of a certain agriculture region depending on the quantity of rainfall, the proposed method employs machine learning techniques and multilayer Perceptron. Farmers will be able to anticipate crop yields prior to planting and make the appropriate investment decisions as a result of this research. To estimate agricultural yields early in the harvest, this approach also focuses on appropriate marketing and storage stages.

However, designing a robust model for crop yield prediction over a large spatial region remains challenging due to inadequate surveyed samples and an under-development of deep-learning frameworks. To tackle this issue, we integrated multi-source (remote sensing, weather, and soil properties) data into a dual-stream deep-learning neural network model for winter wheat in China’s major planting regions. The model consists of two branches for robust feature learning: one for sequential data (remote sensing and weather series data) and the other for statical data (soil properties). The extracted features by both branches were aggregated through an adaptive fusion model to forecast the final wheat yield. We trained and tested the model by using official county-level statistics of historical winter wheat yields. The model achieved an average R2 of 0.79 and a root-mean-square error of 650.21 kg/ha, superior to the compared methods and outperforming traditional machine-learning methods. The dual-stream deep-learning neural network model provided decent in-season yield prediction, with an error of about 13% compared to official statistics about two months before harvest.

Three combination of predictors (climate data, vegetation data or a combination of both) are used to compare the respective contribution of statistical methods and inputs in the predictive skill. Our results showed that the combination of climate and vegetation with the machine learning methods gives the best performance. The best prediction skill is obtained for peanut yield likely due to its high sensitivity to interannual climate variability.

The Terraza sub-model provides an experimental prediction for the bioclimate deficiency and yield reduction, while the Cervatana sub-model predicts the general land use suitability for specific agricultural uses. Sixty-two districts in Southern Spain were modeled and mapped using soil data and the A1B climate scenario (balanced scenario) for three 30-year periods ending in 2040, 2070 and 2100, respectively. Our results showed that the majority of agricultural soils were suitable for wheat production, and less for sunflowers, especially under projected climate change scenarios. Extreme impacts of climate change were observed in the soil types Typic Xerofluvents and Calcic Haploxerepts, where the land capability was reduced from Good and Moderate classes to the Marginal class. This was especially observed in sunflower crops by 2100.

This study aimed to assess the climate change impacts on streamflow and sediment loads in the Upper Paranaíba river basin (UPRB), Southeastern Brazil. The SWAT model was applied to estimate the streamflow and sediment loads under observed conditions and to quantify possible climate change impacts from a multi-model ensemble and four Regional Climate Models (RCM) under two climate change scenarios. The results showed that simulations from the RCMs indicated reductions in streamflow varying from 27.6 to 75%. In addition, the simulated sediment loads were in agreement with the temporal pattern of streamflow. Besides all the uncertainties involved in climate change impacts simulations, the UPRB would suffer serious problems regarding to the water availability in extreme climatic conditions. As this basin is entirely inserted on the Brazilian Cerrado biome, the results can be useful in the context of eco-hydrological services, such as fresh water availability and identification of the land-use/soil combinations that are more vulnerable to water erosion. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Hydrological modeling; Regional Climate Model; Sediment modeling; Soil loss","Climate models; Hydrology; Land use; Sediments; Stream flow; Climate change impact; Climate change scenarios; Hydrological modeling; Hydrological services; Regional climate modeling; Regional climate models; Sediment model; Soil loss; Climate change; bedload; cerrado; climate change; climate modeling; freshwater environment; headwater; hydrological modeling; hydrological regime; land use change; regional climate; river basin; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; uncertainty analysis; water availability; Brazil; Parana [Brazil]; Paranaiba River",Article,Scopus

The surveyed articles are classified under nine areas, e.g., Global/Earth Related; Water-related Issues and agriculture, 95% of which are related to adaptation. The areas that have attracted the most studies about AI applications are water-related management issues (38%).

Timely and reliable wheat yield prediction in Australia is important for regional and global food security. Prior studies use either climate data, or satellite data, or a combination of these two to build empirical models to predict crop yield. However, though the performance of yield prediction using empirical methods is improved by combining the use of climate and satellite data, the contributions from different data sources are still not clear. In addition, how the regression-based methods compare with various machine-learning based methods in their performance in yield prediction is also not well understood and needs in-depth investigation. This work integrated various sources of data to predict wheat yield across Australia from 2000 to 2014 at the statistical division (SD)level. We adopted a well-known regression method (LASSO, as a benchmark)and three mainstream machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, and neural network)to build various empirical models for yield prediction. For satellite data, we used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI)from MODIS and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF)from GOME-2 and SCIAMACHY as metrics to approximate crop productivity. The machine-learning based methods outperform the regression method in modeling crop yield. Our results confirm that combining climate and satellite data can achieve high performance of yield prediction at the SD level (R2 ˜ 0.75). The satellite data track crop growth condition and gradually capture the variability of yield evolving with the growing season, and their contributions to yield prediction usually saturate at the peak of the growing season. Climate data provide extra and unique information beyond what the satellite data have offered for yield prediction, and our empirical modeling work shows the added values of climate variables exist across the whole season, not only at some certain stages. We also find that using EVI as an input can achieve better performance in yield prediction than SIF, primarily due to the large noise in the satellite-based SIF data (i.e. coarse resolution in both space and time). In addition, we also explored the potential for timely wheat yield prediction in Australia, and we can achieve the optimal prediction performance with approximately two-month lead time before wheat maturity. The proposed methodology in this paper can be extended to different crops and different regions for crop yield prediction. © 2019","Crop yield prediction; Enhanced vegetation index; Machine learning; Solar-induced fluorescence; Wheat","climate change; crop yield; fluorescence; machine learning; MODIS; prediction; satellite data; SCIAMACHY; solar activity; vegetation index; wheat; Australia; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Adaptation to future climate change by breeding climate resilient cultivars is essential. However the precise information as to where, when, and what cultivar traits should be applied to adapt to climate change in the coming decades has not been available. In this study, we developed novel hybrid assessment models by incorporating a process-based crop model and machine learning algorithms based on a large number of cultivars field experiments data. The models were applied to assess the impact of climate change on wheat productivity and to identify the timescale of wheat cultivar adaptation in the major wheat cultivation regions across China. Wheat yield was projected to decrease on average by 6.3% (9.4%) in the 2050 s under RCP 4.5 (8.5), relative to the baseline period (1986–2005), without the CO2 effect. By contrast, it was projected to increase on average by 5.7% (8.1%) in the 2050 s with the CO2 effect, across the regions and cultivar-maturing traits in China. Solar radiation, precipitation, temperature, cultivar-maturing traits, and CO2 are critical factors affecting wheat productivity in the major wheat cultivation regions. About 44% (39%) and 68% (57%) of wheat planting grids would require cultivar renewal before 2050 (2040) under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 emission scenario, respectively, at a medium risk level without the CO2 effect. The cultivars with a long reproductive growth duration, high photosynthetic efficiency and large harvest index would be generally promising although there are specific traits desirable for certain regions.

Crop management, poor soil conditions, and weather uncertainty affect rice production in this region. The objective of this study was to determine the potential impact of climate change on rice yield in the Artibonite Valley of Haiti for future periods (near-term: 2010-2039 and mid-century: 2040-2069) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5) defined by the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The Crop Estimation Resource and Environment Synthesis (CERES)-Rice model of the Decision Support for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) cropping system model was used to perform the simulations using local soil characteristics, meteorological data, and crop management following model calibration with local experimental data. Temperature (maximum and minimum) was predicted to increase during all three rice-growing seasons (spring-summer, summer-autumn, and winter-spring). Under both RCPs (4.5 and 8.5), the simulation results indicated that the ensemble-mean rice yield decreased during the spring-summer and summer-autumn seasons (by 5.1% to 6.6% and by 5.4% to 8.3%, respectively) and increased during the winter-spring season (by 2.3% to 3.6%). Although yield increased during the winter-spring season, the average annual yield was predicted to decrease by 3.6% to 7.1% and by 4.2% to 9.6% for the near-term and mid-century climate periods, respectively.

Climate change is likely to have an impact on the availability of water and therefore on sediment yield in catchments. In this context, quantifying the sediment response to an increased atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate change is of utmost importance to the proper management of rural catchments. However, quantitative assessment of climate change impact remains a complex task. In this study, the potential medium (2031-2060) and long-term (2069-2098) impacts of projected changes of temperature, rainfall and CO2 concentration on sediment yield in a small rural catchment located in NW Spain were evaluated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Climate change scenarios were created using future climate data projected by regional climate models from the ENSEMBLES project and two CO2 concentration scenarios (550 and 660 ppm). The results showed that climate change would have a noticeable impact on suspended sediment if the forecast temperature, rainfall and CO2 concentration changes included in this study were met. Overall, suspended sediment is expected to decrease (2031-2060: -11%, 2069-2098: -8%) compared to the baseline period (1981-2010), mainly due to decreased streamflow. However, an increase in sediment transport in winter is predicted, possibly associated with increased erosion in cultivated areas (11%-17%), suggesting that, at this time of the year, the effect of soil detachment prevails over sediment transport capacity. Consequently, management practices aimed at reducing soil erosion in cultivated areas should be carried out, because these are the main source of sediment in the study area. © 2016 by the authors.","Climate change; Rural catchment; Suspended sediment; SWAT model","Atmospheric composition; Carbon dioxide; Catchments; Climate models; Erosion; Rain; Runoff; Rural areas; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Sediments; Soils; Suspended sediments; Climate change scenarios; Quantitative assessments; Regional climate models; Rural catchments; Sediment transport capacity; Soil and water assessment tool; Suspended sediment yields; SWAT model; Climate change; carbon dioxide; catchment; climate change; concentration (composition); quantitative analysis; sediment transport; sediment yield; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; suspended sediment; water availability; Corbeira Stream; Galicia [Spain]; La Coruna [Galicia]; Spain",Article,Scopus

Under rain-fed conditions, crop yields are sensitive to weather and its variations and are thus affected by climate change. Previous research regarding climate change impacts on crop yields in AC has been limited to a regional-scale assessment, mostly focusing on climate without considering real-world field conditions (e.g., soil and topography). In this study, an enhanced Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to estimate crop yields at the watershed scale under climate change conditions projected for the period of 2020–2099 using global climate models with three different greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios from the Representative Concentration Pathways (i.e., RCP2.6, 4.5, and 8.5). Results suggest that climate change will negatively impact potato and barley yields under all three RCP scenarios. In particular, under the RCP8.5 scenario, there will be significant reductions (13–23%) in crop yields between 2060 and 2099. The leading cause of crop yield reductions is attributed to the soil water stress resulting from increased temperature and evapotranspiration during the growing season due to climate change. Elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations could potentially increase crop yields due to the CO2 fertilization effect. However, it is not enough to offset the negative impacts of soil water stress. Our results suggest that on top of controlling GHG emissions to below the RCP4.5 level, it is critical to develop and adapt crop, soil, and water management practices such as new crop-rotation systems, early planting dates, and supplemental irrigation to maintain future crop yields in AC. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Atlantic Canada; Climate Change; CO2 fertilization; Crop Yield; SWAT","Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Rain; Soil moisture; Topography; Water management; Watersheds; Atlantic canada; Climate change impact; CO2 fertilization; Crop yield; Fertilisation; Greenhouse gas emissions; Soil and Water assessment tools; Soil water; Water stress; Watershed scale; Carbon dioxide; agricultural management; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; evapotranspiration; fertilizer application; global climate; growing season; soil and water assessment tool; water management; watershed; Canada",Article,Scopus

Inner Mongolia, which occupies the largest area of the semiarid region in China, is a good representation of the region's climate and dryland agricultural conditions. Spring wheat is widely grown in this region, but the negative impacts of climate change have seriously threatened spring wheat production in recent years. To adapt to these changes, it is imperative to study the influence of climate change on spring wheat production. We employed a vulnerability assessment method to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of climate change on spring wheat production in Inner Mongolia and recommended specific countermeasures based on the results. The average temperature and precipitation during the spring wheat growing season was 16.5 °C and 224 mm, respectively, from 1961 to 2012. Northeastern Inner Mongolia was characterized by lower temperature and higher precipitation; the eastern region had both higher temperature and precipitation; and the southwestern area had higher temperature and lower precipitation. The climate in this region showed a warming and drying trend from 1961 to 2012, with average temperature during the spring wheat growing season increasing with an average rate 0.3 °C/10a and average precipitation decreasing with an average rate 4.3 mm/10a. Over the study period (from 1996 to 2012), the vulnerability of spring wheat in the eastern, central, and southwestern areas of Inner Mongolia was high, whereas that in the northeast was relatively low. Assuming the adaptive capacity of spring wheat is stable, the comprehensive unit vulnerability of spring wheat production is expected to significantly increase under the investigated climate change scenarios (based on historical climate trends and RCP4.5, RCP8.5 scenarios) relative to average values over the study period.

In this context, appropriate prediction of crop yield helps in agricultural production planning. Given the inability of the traditional linear models to provide satisfactory prediction performance, there is a need to develop a crop yield prediction model that is simple in complexity, accurate in prediction, and less time-consuming during training and validation phases. Keeping these objectives in view, the present paper focuses on building an adaptive, low complexity, and accurate nonlinear model for the prediction of crop yield. A time series dataset for the period 1991–2012 of Karnataka, a southwestern state of India, is used for yield prediction. An empirical nonlinear relation between crop yield and the four independent attributes has been obtained from the proposed ANN model. The independent attributes employed are total rainfall, the cumulative distribution of temperature, the proportion of irrigated land, and the average amount of fertilizer used. It is demonstrated that the developed model exhibits better prediction accuracy, less root mean square error in the range of 0.07–0.14, less mean square error in the range of 0.01–0.04, and mean absolute error in the range of 0.07–0.15 compared to its corresponding linear regression model. It is recommended that the proposed ANN model can also be applied to predict other agricultural products of the same or other geographical regions of the globe. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Functional link artificial neural network; Karnataka; Panel regression; Yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

However, the adaptability of existing hybrids to a changing climate has not been systematically investigated. Therefore, little is known about the appropriate timing of hybrid adaptation. Here, using a novel hybrid model which coupled CERES-Maize with machine learning, we critically investigated the impacts of climate change on maize productivity with an ensemble of hybrid-specific estimations in China. We determined when and where current hybrids would become unviable and hybrid adaptation need be implemented, as well as which hybrid traits would be desirable. Climate change would have mostly negative impacts on maize productivity, and the magnitudes of yield reductions would highly depend on the growth cycle of the hybrids. Hybrid replacement could partially, but not completely, offset the yield loss caused by projected climate change. Without adaptation, approximately 53% of the cultivation areas would require hybrid renewal before 2050 under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios. The medium-maturing hybrids with a long grain-filling duration and a high light use efficiency would be promising, although the ideotypic traits could be different for a specific environment. The findings highlight the necessity and urgency of breeding climate resilient hybrids, providing policy-makers and crop breeders with the early signals of when, where and what hybrids will be required, which stimulate proactive investment to facilitate breeding. The proposed crop modelling approach is scalable, largely data-driven and can be used to tackle the longstanding problem of predicting hybrids' future performance to accelerate development of new crop hybrids. © 2021 The Author(s).

Historical climatic and gauging data were collected from different stations within a watershed. Bias correction was performed on GCMs temperature and precipitation data. After successful development of the hydrological modeling system (SWAT) for the basin, streamflow was simulated for three future periods (2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100) and compared with the baseline data (1981-2010) to explore the changes in different flow indicators such as mean flow, low flow, median flow, high flow, flow duration curves, temporal shift in peaks, and temporal shifts in center-of-volume dates. From the results obtained, an overall increase in mean annual flow was projected in the basin under both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. Winter and spring showed a noticeable increase in streamflow, while summer and autumn showed a decrease in streamflow. High flows were predicted to increase, but median flow was projected to decrease in the future under both scenarios. Flow duration curves showed that the probability of occurrence of high flow is likely to be more in the future. It was also noted that peaks were predicted to shift from May to July in the future, and the center-of-volume date of the annual flow may vary from ??11 to 23 days in the basin, under both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. As a whole, the Mangla basin will face more floods and less droughts in the future due to the projected increase in high and low flows, decrease in median flows and greater temporal and magnitudinal variations in peak flows. These outcomes suggest that it is important to consider the influence of climate change on water resources to frame appropriate guidelines for planning and management. © 2016 by the authors.","Bias correction; Climate change; Discharge; GCMs; Precipitation; RCPs; SWAT; Temperature","Climate models; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Precipitation (chemical); Reservoirs (water); Stream flow; Temperature; Water resources; Bias correction; Climate change scenarios; GCMs; Global circulation model; Hydrological modeling; Probability of occurrence; RCPs; SWAT; Climate change; air temperature; baseline conditions; climate change; climate modeling; environmental assessment; historical record; hydrological modeling; inflow; precipitation (climatology); profitability; reservoir; streamflow; temporal variation; uncertainty analysis; water resource; Azad Kashmir; Mangla Dam; Pakistan",Article,Scopus

While previous studies have identified the importance that the temporal distribution of daily rainfall has on crop production, climate models often do not represent these distributions consistently with observed trends. The objectives of this study are to (1) evaluate the relationship between rainfall variability and yields for economically important crops in the upper Southeastern United States and (2) assess the potential impact that incorporating observed trends in rainfall variability has on yield projections under future climate change. This study develops statistical models of historic crop yields for five crops, finding that an explanatory variable related to daily rainfall variability, the wet-day Gini coefficient (GC), has a statistically significant negative relationship with crop yields in all cases. These models are then used to estimate the impacts of climate change using an ensemble of downscaled general circulation model (GCM) projections and scenarios that include a continuation of observed GC trends. Most downscaled GCMs evaluated do not project changes in GC consistent with observed trends, and scenarios that assume a continuation of observed trends result in projected yields that are up to 5.8% lower than those directly based on GCM projections. While additional research is needed in the climate science community to better understand how rainfall variability may change in the future, this should be mirrored in the impacts community so that agricultural impact assessments incorporate these potentially important changes. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Rain; Agricultural impacts; Climate change impact; Explanatory variables; General circulation model; Gini coefficients; Rainfall variability; Temporal distribution; Temporal dynamics; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; crop production; crop yield; future prospect; general circulation model; precipitation assessment; prediction; temporal distribution; trend analysis; United States",Article,Scopus

Higher temperatures and changes in rainfall induced by global warming are threatening rainfed agriculture in this region while the population is expected to increase approximately three-fold until 2050. Our study quantifies the impact of climate change on food security by combining climate modelling (16 models from CMIP5), crop yield (simulated by agronomic model, SARRA-O) and demographic evolution (provided by UN projection) under two future climatic scenarios. We simulate yield for the main crops in five countries inWest Africa and estimate the population pressure on crop production to assess the number of available cereal production per capita. We found that, although uncertain, the African monsoon evolution leads to an increase of rainfall in Eastern Sahel and a decrease inWestern Sahel under the RCP8.5 (Representative Concentration Pathway) scenario from IPCC, leading to the higher temperature increase by the end of the 21st century. With regard to the abundance of food for the inhabitants, all the scenarios in each country show that in 2050, local agricultural production will be below 50 kg per capita.

Changes in climate result in changes in streamflow and rising water temperatures, which impact biochemical reaction rates and increase stratification in lakes and reservoirs. Using two water quality modeling systems (the Hydrologic and Water Quality System; HAWQS and US Basins), five climate models, and two greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation policies, we assess future water quality in the continental U.S. to 2100 considering four water quality parameters: water temperature, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus. Once these parameters are aggregated into a water quality index, we find that, while the water quality models differ under the baseline, there is more agreement between future projections. In addition, we find that the difference in national-scale economic benefits across climate models is generally larger than the difference between the two water quality models. Both water quality models find that water quality will more likely worsen in the East than in the West.

Findings: WII studies shifted their focus on growing and emerging areas of climate change impact risk. The finding shows that the impact of climate change risk significantly influenced the viability of WII in terms of pricing and design of WII. Therefore, the cost of WII premium increases due to the uncertainty of climate change impact that enhances the probability of losses related to insured weather risks. However, WII has emerged as a risk management tool of climate insurance for vulnerable agrarian communities. The efficacy of WII has been significantly influenced by repetitive environmental disasters and climate change phenomena.

However, their relative importance in crop yields remains elusive, especially in heavily polluted regions. Here we develop crop yield prediction models, based on a large volume of historical crop data, as well as climate and pollution records in China since 1980. A long-term surface ozone concentration data set is developed from a machine-learning model and various observations. An assessment of four climate and pollution factors reveals the critical role of particulate and ozone pollution in regulating interannual variations of crop yields in China. During 2010–2018, we find that the particulate pollution mitigation outweighs the negative impacts of concurrent climate change, resulting in 0.5%–1.9% net yield increases nationwide, despite of the ozone increases in the North China Plain. Looking to the future, the impacts of climate change, particularly from surface temperature increase, will dominate over pollution factors and profoundly reduce future maize and rice yields by 0.6 to 2.8% 10 yr−1 by 2050.

The impact of bias-correction on the historical (1980–2005) period, the inter-variable relationships, and the measures of spatio-temporal consistency are investigated. The focus is on the discrepancies between the original and the bias-corrected results over five agro-ecological zones.

Developing more sustainable production systems requires long-term measurements and assessment of climate change impacts on yields, especially over such a vulnerable region. Providing accurate yield predictions plays a key role in addressing a critical sustainability gap. The goal of this study is the development of effective crop yield predictions to allow for a better-informed cropland management and future production potential, and to develop climate-smart adaptation strategies for increased food security. The objectives were to (1) identify the most important climate variables that significantly influence and can be used to effectively predict yield, (2) evaluate the advantage of using remotely sensed data alone and in combination with climate variables for yield prediction, and (3) determine the significance of using short compared to long historical data records for yield prediction. This study focused on yield prediction for corn, sorghum, alfalfa, and wheat using climate and remotely sensed data for the 1920–2019 period. The results indicated that the use of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) alone is less accurate in predicting crop yields. The combination of climate and NDVI variables provided better predictions compared to the use of NDVI only to predict wheat, sorghum, and corn yields. However, the use of a climate only model performed better in predicting alfalfa yield. Yield predictions can be more accurate with the use of shorter data periods that are based on region-specific trends. The identification of the most important climate variables and accurate yield prediction pertaining to New Mexico’s agricultural systems can aid the state in developing climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies to enhance the sustainability of these systems. © 2021 by the authorsLicensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Alfalfa; Averaging periods; Corn; NDVI; Sorghum; Statistical analysis; Sustainable agriculture systems; Wheat",,Article,Scopus

As C3 and C4 crops have different carbon sequestration pathways, the responses of their growth to climate change are different. This study comprehensively compared the impacts of climate change on the growth of C3 and C4 crops in China by considering several key variables, such as solar radiation, temperature, precipitation, CO2 concentration, and agro–climatic constraints. The WOFOST (WOrld FOod STudies) model was used to quantitatively simulate and analyze the impacts of these variables on crop yield under four different scenarios. The results show that 1) during the growth period, solar radiation had the most significant change, followed by temperature difference between day and night, daily minimum temperature, daily maximum temperature, and precipitation; 2) the growth indicators of both C3 and C4 crops were more strongly correlated with solar radiation and temperature; and 3) under the four scenarios, changes in temperature and solar radiation had negative effects on both C3 and C4 crops in most regions, and changes in CO2 concentration had greater impacts on crop yields than other factors.

Using a global agricultural trade model and different climate change pathways until 2050, we show that global commodity price increases triggered by declining yields due to climate change are dampened by an accelerated increase of U.S. BEV sales, which decrease maize ethanol demand. Accelerated BEV sales also reduce cropland requirements compared to baseline electrification scenarios. The accelerated market share of BEVs also (1) lowers the decrease in caloric intake for maize, rice, and wheat which has important food security implications in the presence of climate change and (2) changes trade relationships. The implications of those findings are that policy discussions surrounding policies to promote BEVs should include lower commodity prices and increased food security that dampen some of the negative effects of climate change.

This article presents a review of some of the different possible approaches taken on climate change, to demonstrate the need to build a multidisciplinary perspective of the problem. It is understood that only the integration of different perspectives, presented by different areas of knowledge, such as natural sciences, social and economic sciences and human sciences, will make it possible to build modeling and predictive scenarios, which realistically may represent the development of the earth system under the influence of climate change. In this way, with the support of all areas of knowledge, the creation of forecast models where all possible changes to the different variables of the earth system may be simulated will allow for the mitigation measures presented to be analyzed in advance and, thus, prioritized.

Population growth and the increasing demand of resources will exacerbate these impacts. Focusing on rainfed maize production, we evaluate the socio-ecological risk that municipalities currently face and how climate change could modify it. Municipalities were classified based on their biophysical and socioeconomic traits like temperature, precipitation, population, gross domestic product, marginalization, and agricultural subsidies. The study identifies municipalities that would face higher risk under climate change conditions, and it evaluates whether increases in agricultural subsidies could be effective for reducing the farmers' future risk. Our results show that during the 2010's, 36.8% of the municipalities and 15% of the population were at very high and high risk, respectively. By 2070, under a high-warming scenario these figures increase to 56.5 and 18.5%. We find that a generalized augment in agricultural subsidies is not enough to compensate for the effects of climate change on the socio-ecological risk of rainfed maize producers. We suggest that transformative adaptation is required for managing the agricultural risk that socio-ecological systems experience under climate change conditions. Such adaptation strategies should include poverty alleviation, promotion of resistant and native varieties of crops, capacity building to improve management and water use, sustainable technification, and soil restoration.

Assessing the impact of LULC and climate changes on streamflow is typically done with a calibrated and validated watershed model. However, there is a debate on the degree of calibration required. The objective of this study was to quantify the variation in estimated relative and absolute changes in streamflow associated with LULC and climate changes with different calibration approaches. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied in an uncalibrated (UC), single outlet calibrated (OC), and spatially-calibrated (SC) mode to compare the relative and absolute changes in streamflow at 14 gaging stations within the Santa Cruz River Watershed in southern Arizona, USA. For this purpose, the effect of 3 LULC, 3 precipitation (P), and 3 temperature (T) scenarios were tested individually. For the validation period, Percent Bias (PBIAS) values were >100% with the UC model for all gages, the values were between 0% and 100% with the OC model and within 20% with the SC model. Changes in streamflow predicted with the UC and OC models were compared with those of the SC model. This approach implicitly assumes that the SC model is ""ideal"". Results indicated that the magnitude of both absolute and relative changes in streamflow due to LULC predicted with the UC and OC results were different than those of the SC model. The magnitude of absolute changes predicted with the UC and SC models due to climate change (both P and T) were also significantly different, but were not different for OC and SC models. Results clearly indicated that relative changes due to climate change predicted with the UC and OC were not significantly different than that predicted with the SC models. This result suggests that it is important to calibrate the model spatially to analyze the effect of LULC change but not as important for analyzing the relative change in streamflow due to climate change. This study also indicated that model calibration in not necessary to determine the direction of change in streamflow due to LULC and climate change. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Calibration; Climate change; LULC change; Santa cruz watershed; Streamflow; SWAT","Calibration; Climate models; Gaging; Land use; Stream flow; Watersheds; Land use/land cover; LULC change; Model calibration; River watersheds; Soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; Validation periods; Watershed modeling; Climate change; calibration; climate change; forecasting method; land cover; land use change; numerical model; prediction; streamflow; temperature effect; Argentina; Santa Cruz River [Santa Cruz]; Santa Cruz [Argentina]",Article,Scopus

This study aims at investigating to what extent that rainfall, temperature and runoff could ably transmit significant information needed for analyzing and predicting crop yields under extreme unmitigated climate change conditions (RCP 8.5) in the Nile basin, using mutual information and stepwise regression models. Monthly climate change outputs (2040–2079) were derived from the fifth phase of the coupled inter-comparison project (CMIP5) and six regional climate models of the CORDEX-Africa. Yield time series (1970–2016) of selected crops (sorghum, groundnut, wheat, potato, and sugarcane) were retrieved from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The analysis was carried out using the R package, QGIS, and Excel sheets. The MI results stated the significant interdependency of crop yields on weather variables, especially temperature. Developed stepwise crop yield models managed to explain 9–97% of inter-annual variability in crop yields, depending on location and crop concerned. Unlike predominating results, most crop yields in the Nile basin will be benefited from climate change by 2079. Generally, the crop farming would remain more resilient to global warming in Egypt and vice versa holds for the basin’s tropical countries, especially Rwanda and Burundi.

Accurate, easy-to-implement, and computationally efficient forecast approaches are desirable for broad applications in emerging regimes like Ethiopia. In this study, we develop and test an analog approach for pre-season crop yield prediction conditioned on antecedent precipitation and planting time soil moisture content indices to guide cultivation decision making. Historical planting time soil moisture at four selected sites were simulated using the Coupled Routing and Excess STorage (CREST) hydrological model and classified into five levels. Likewise, a historical crop yield database for each of the five classes of planting time soil moisture were constructed using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) agricultural model. Adopting maize as a representative crop, analog models based on different indexes or predictors with various lead times were constructed and used to conduct hindcasts during 1979–2014 and real-time forecast in 2018 and 2019. Both the hindcast and real-time forecasts were then evaluated against yield observations. To verify the applicability at locations with various environments, the analog models were then applied in different Agroecological Zones. The analog models were shown to be accurate and easy to implement, which may incentivize adoption by local extension agents and regional agricultural agencies to inform farmers’ crop choices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Analog approach; Crop yield forecast; DSSAT; Ethiopia; Precipitation; Soil moisture","agricultural modeling; classification; crop yield; cultivation; decision support system; hindcasting; hydrological modeling; maize; precipitation (climatology); prediction; soil microorganism; water content; Ethiopia",Article,Scopus

For crop yield predictions, the skill in generating realistic distributions of weather for the crop growing season matters more than the skill of forecasting the mean seasonal climate itself. In this regard, the ensemble of daily fields of the Seasonal Prediction Systems (SPSs) output could be a potential alternative to other methods that are available to generate daily weather from the monthly or seasonal mean forecasts. However, the SPSs are not expected to forecast individual weather events at a given grid point (deterministic forecast), but if the statistics of the predicted weather are correct, an ensemble of yield predictions using individual realizations of the ensemble seasonal forecast may produce a more skillful yield forecast. So far, the potential of this new approach has not been tested. The goal of this study was to determine the potential applicability of using daily data from SPSs to predict rice yield through a case study of Nepal's Terai. The study used 28 years (1983–2010) daily hindcasts of the coupled forecast system model version 2 (CFSv2) SPS into a Cropping System Model (CSM)-CERES-Rice. The hindcasts of the CFSv2, initialized at different lead times, were used in various ways to simulate rice yield, which were then compared to the reference yield and to the simulated yield using climatology alone to examine the predictive skill at different lead times. The results from this study indicate that unlike the typical ensemble averaging approach commonly used in seasonal climate forecasting, averaging the simulated yield using individual member does not guarantee better yield prediction. Further analyses should be made, including alternative downscaling methods as well as a similar analysis for an area where quality meteorological and agricultural data are available and where the seasonal forecasts exhibit better skill. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","CFSv2; Climate variability; Daily data; DSSAT","agricultural modeling; climate change; climatology; crop yield; data assimilation; downscaling; ensemble forecasting; forecasting method; growing season; prediction; rice; seasonal variation; Tarai",Article,Scopus

However, due to its long-term nature and heterogeneity across farms and landscapes, it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate its contribution in building the resilience of farming systems to climate change over large areas. In this study, we developed an approach to simulate and emulate the shading, micro-climate regulation and biomass effects of multi-purpose trees agroforestry system on maize yields using APSIM, taking Ethiopia as a case study. Applying the model to simulate climate change impacts showed that at national level, maize yield will increase by 7.5 and 3.1 % by 2050 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively. This projected increase in national-level maize yield is driven by maize yield increases in six administrative zones whereas yield losses are expected in other five zones (mean of −6.8% for RCP2.6 and −11.7% for RCP8.5), with yields in the other four zones remaining stable overtime. Applying the emulated agroforestry leads to increase in maize yield under current and future climatic conditions compared to maize monocultures, particularly in regions for which yield losses under climate change are expected. A 10% agroforestry shade will reduce maize yield losses by 6.9% (RCP2.6) and 4.2 % (RCP8.5) while 20% shade will reduce maize yield losses by 11.5% (RCP2.6) and 11% (RCP8.5) for projected loss zones. Overall, our results show quantitatively that agroforestry buffers yield losses for areas projected to have yield losses under climate change in Ethiopia, and therefore should be part of building climate-resilient agricultural systems.

The time series of maize yield is generally non-stationary and contains different frequency components, such as long-and short-term oscillations. Nevertheless, there is no adequate understanding of the relative importance of climate change. In addition, human activities on maize yield at multiple timescales remain unclear, which help in further improving maize yield prediction. Based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition method (EEMD), the method of dependent variable variance decomposition (DVVD) and the Sen-slope method, the effect of climate change including growing-season precipitation and temperature (i.e., GSP, GEP, CDD, GST, GSMAT, and GSMT) and human activities including effective irrigation area (EIA) and the consumption of chemical fertilizers (CCF) on maize yield were explored at multiple timescales during 1979–2015. The Heilongjiang Province, a highly important maize production area in China, was selected as a case study. The results of this work indicate the following: (1) The original maize yield series was divided into 3.1-, 7.4-, 18.5-, and 37-year timescale oscillations and a residual series with an increasing trend, where the 3.1-year timescale (IMF1), the 18.5-year timescale (IMF3), and the increasing trend (R) were dominant; (2) the original sequence was mainly affected by human activities; (3) climate change and human activities had different effects on maize yield at different timescales: The short-term oscillation (IMF1) of maize yield was primarily affected by climate change. However, human activities dominated the mid-and long-term oscillations (IMF3 and R) of maize yield.

This study assesses the biases in NARCliM (NSW and ACT regional climate modelling) simulations and quantifies the consequence of the climate biases in the downstream assessment of climate change impact on wheat crop system, using the Agricultural Production System sIMulator (APSIM). Results showed that post-processing bias-corrected temperature and rainfall data from NARCliM had small annual mean biases but large biases in the crop growing season (CGS). During the CGS, the mean bias error of rainfall was generally positive for rainfall probability and negative for intensity, which subsequently resulted in APSIM simulating negative biases for runoff and deep drainage and positive bias in soil evaporation. Bias in soil water balance and water availability resulted in less plant transpiration and less N uptake, ultimately, leading to large negative biases in crop yields. A simple bias correction of the simulated crop yield driven by RCMs could result in a largely consistent distribution with those generated with APSIM simulations forced by observed climate. Our results showed that RCM simulation biases could confound with the climate change signal and produced an unreliable estimate of the effects of the changes in climate and farm management variables on crop yields. The results suggested that RCM simulations with the current bias correction on the RCM-simulated outputs applied on an annual basis were inadequate for climate change assessments which involve biophysical models. Our study highlights the need for improved RCM simulations by eliminating the systemic biases associated with rainfall characteristics, although suitable post-processing bias correction on a seasonal or monthly basis may result in improved RCM simulations for agricultural impacts of climate change. © 2018 Royal Meteorological Society","APSIM; bias correction; bias propagation; bio-physical crop model; NARCliM; rainfall intensity; rainfall probability; RCMs; wheat cropping system","Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Plants (botany); Rain; Soil moisture; APSIM; Bias correction; Crop model; NARCliM; Rainfall intensity; RCMs; Wheat cropping; Climate change; biophysics; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; correction; cropping practice; farming system; precipitation intensity; probability; rainfall; regional climate; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Study focus: Climate change is projected to have significant impacts on agricultural production. Therefore, understanding the regional impacts of climate change on irrigation demand for crop production is important for watershed managers and agricultural producers to understand for effective water resources management. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool was used to assess the impact of climate change on corn and soybean irrigation demand in the Kalamazoo River Watershed. Bias-corrected statistically downscaled climate change data from ten global climate models and four emissions scenarios were used in SWAT to develop projections of irrigation demand and yields for 2020-2039 and 2060-2079. Six adaptation scenarios were developed to shift the planting dates (planting earlier and later in the growing season) to take advantage of periods with greater rainfall or lower temperature increases. New hydrological insights for the region: Uncertainty in irrigation demand was found to increase moving from 2020-2039 to 2060-2079, with demand generally decreasing moving further into the future for corn and soybean. A shift in timing of peak irrigation demand and increases in temperature lead to corn yield reductions. However, soybean yield increased under these conditions. Finally, the adaptation strategy of planting earlier increased irrigation demand and water available for transpiration, while delaying planting resulted in demand decreases for both crops. © 2014 The Authors.","Adaptation; Climate change; Crop yield; Irrigation demand; SWAT; Uncertainty","Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Here we provide an assessment of near-term climate change impacts on sorghum yields in West Africa and account for uncertainties both in future climate scenarios and in crop models. Towards this goal, we use simulations of nine bias-corrected CMIP5 climate models and two crop models (SARRA-H and APSIM) to evaluate the robustness of projected crop yield impacts in this area. In broad agreement with the full CMIP5 ensemble, our subset of bias-corrected climate models projects a mean warming of +2.8 °C in the decades of 2031-2060 compared to a baseline of 1961-1990 and a robust change in rainfall in West Africa with less rain in the Western part of the Sahel (Senegal, South-West Mali) and more rain in Central Sahel (Burkina Faso, South-West Niger). Projected rainfall deficits are concentrated in early monsoon season in the Western part of the Sahel while positive rainfall changes are found in late monsoon season all over the Sahel, suggesting a shift in the seasonality of the monsoon. In response to such climate change, but without accounting for direct crop responses to CO2, mean crop yield decreases by about 16-20% and year-to-year variability increases in the Western part of the Sahel, while the eastern domain sees much milder impacts. Such differences in climate and impacts projections between the Western and Eastern parts of the Sahel are highly consistent across the climate and crop models used in this study. We investigate the robustness of impacts for different choices of cultivars, nutrient treatments, and crop responses to CO2. Adverse impacts on mean yield and yield variability are lowest for modern cultivars, as their short and nearly fixed growth cycle appears to be more resilient to the seasonality shift of the monsoon, thus suggesting shorter season varieties could be considered a potential adaptation to ongoing climate changes. Easing nitrogen stress via increasing fertilizer inputs would increase absolute yields, but also make the crops more responsive to climate stresses, thus enhancing the negative impacts of climate change in a relative sense. Finally, CO2fertilization would significantly offset the negative climate impacts on sorghum yields by about 10%, with drier regions experiencing the largest benefits, though the net impacts of climate change remain negative even after accounting for CO2. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Africa; climate change; crop","Crops; Africa; Future climate; West Africa; Climate change; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate modeling; crop yield; cultivar; ecological modeling; numerical model; seasonality; sorghum; West Africa",Article,Scopus

So far, climate change impacts on agriculture for the basin have mostly been assessed for single-cropping systems, which may bias the results considering that the basin is dominated by different cropping systems, with about one-third of the crop area under double cropping. In this study, we simulate single- and double-cropping systems in the Nile basin and assess the climate change impacts on different cropping systems under two scenarios, i.e. “no adaptation” and “adaptation to a late-maturing cultivar”. We find that the mean crop yields of maize, soybean and wheat decrease with future warming without cultivar adaptation. We attribute this to the shortening of the growing season due to increased temperature. The decrease is stronger in all single-cropping systems (12.6–45.5%) than in double-cropping systems (5.9–26.6%). The relative magnitude of yield reduction varies spatially with the greatest reduction in the northern part of the basin experiencing the strongest warming. In a scenario with cultivar adaptation, mean crop yields show a stronger increase in double-cropping systems (14.4–35.2%) than single-cropping systems (8.3–13.7%). In this scenario, farmers could possibly benefit from increasing cropping intensities while adapting to late-maturing cultivars.

It's a hot issue to investigate the response of grain yield to climate change driving water resources change. Taking winter wheat and summer maize in Fenhe River basin as the study object, six machine learning algorithms were used to build the yield prediction models, including Linear Regression, Back Propagation Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine Regression, Random Forest, Radial Basis Function, and Extreme Learning Machine. Based on the response of water resources to climate change by the climate-elasticity coefficient, the comprehensive response of grain yield was analyzed on a catchment scale, which was related to climate change driving water resources change. The results indicated that ① Machine learning algorithms performed well on the simulation yield of the winter wheat and summer maize in Fenhe River basin. ② There was a 19.4% increase in water resources as a 10% increase in precipitation, otherwise, a 1 ℃ increase in temperature might lead to a 4.3% decrease in water resources. ③ If precipitation decreased by 10%-30%, the yields of winter wheat and summer maize would decrease by 6.4%-19.3% and 4.0%-15.0%, respectively. ④ When the temperature increased by 0.5-3.0 ℃, there might be 1.8%-17.1% and 1.2%-7.9% increases in the yields of winter wheat and summer maize, respectively. ⑤ The yield of winter wheat was more sensitive to climate change than that of summer maize in the Fenhe River basin.

Numerous models have been presented to explain such variability in crop yield using data from multiple sources with varying temporal and spatial resolutions. Some of these models are data driven, which focus on approximating the complex relationship between explanatory variables and crop yield from massive data sets. Others are knowledge driven, which focus on integrating scientific understanding of crop growth mechanism in the modeling structure. We propose a new model that leverages the computational efficiency and prediction accuracy of data driven models and incorporates agronomic insights from knowledge driven models. Referred to as the GEM model, this model estimates three independent components of (G)enetics, (E)nvironment, and (M)anagement, the product of which is used as the predicted crop yield. The aim of this study is to produce not only accurate crop yield predictions but also insightful explanations of temporal and spatial variability with respect to weather, soil, and management variables. Computational experiments were conducted on a data set that includes maize yield, weather, soil, and management data covering 2,649 counties in the U.S. from 1980 to 2019.

Here, we have applied the process-based crop model SARRA-H calibrated and validated over multi-year field trials and surveys at eight contrasting sites in terms of climate and agricultural practices in Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. The model gives a reasonable correlation with observed yields of sorghum and millet under a range of cultivars and traditional crop management practices. We applied the model to more than 7000 simulations of yields of sorghum and millet for 35 stations across West Africa and under very different future climate conditions. We took into account 35 possible climate scenarios by combining precipitation anomalies from -20% to 20% and temperature anomalies from +0 to +6 °C. We found that most of the 35 scenarios (31/35) showed a negative impact on yields, up to -41% for +6 °C/ - 20% rainfall. Moreover, the potential future climate impacts on yields are very different from those recorded in the recent past. This is because of the increasingly adverse role of higher temperatures in reducing crop yields, irrespective of rainfall changes. When warming exceeds +2 °C, negative impacts caused by temperature rise cannot be counteracted by any rainfall change. The probability of a yield reduction appears to be greater in the Sudanian region (southern Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, northern Togo and Benin), because of an exacerbated sensitivity to temperature changes compared to the Sahelian region (Niger, Mali, northern parts of Senegal and Burkina Faso), where crop yields are more sensitive to rainfall change. Finally, our simulations show that the photoperiod-sensitive traditional cultivars of millet and sorghum used by local farmers for centuries seem more resilient to future climate conditions than modern cultivars bred for their high yield potential (-28% versus -40% for the +4 °C/ - 20% scenario). Photoperiod-sensitive cultivars counteract the effect of temperature increase on shortening cultivar duration and thus would likely avoid the need to shift to cultivars with a greater thermal time requirement. However, given the large difference in mean yields of the modern versus traditional varieties, the modern varieties would still yield more under optimal fertility conditions in a warmer world, even if they are more affected by climate change. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.","agriculture; climate change; impacts; West Africa","Agriculture; Climate models; Computer simulation; Crops; Plants (botany); Rain; Agricultural practices; Climate change impact; Crop management practices; Effect of temperature; impacts; Precipitation anomalies; Sensitivity to temperatures; West Africa; Climate change; agricultural management; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; cultivar; management practice; millet; model validation; savanna; sorghum; West Africa",Article,Scopus

Pathways for managing those uncertainties are identified and future research directions are discussed. The conclusion is that strengthening experimental studies on the effects of extreme temperatures including their interaction with enhanced atmospheric CO2 concentration on crop production and further improvement, evaluation, and inter-comparison of crop models based on new experimental datasets will contribute to the reduction of uncertainties in projected climate change impacts and evaluated adaptation options.

To fill this knowledge gap, we created a systems understanding of agroecosystem N dynamics and quantified the impact of controllable (management) and uncontrollable (weather, climate) factors on N fluxes and soybean yields. We performed a simulation experiment across 10 soybean production environments in the United States using the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model and future climate projections from five global circulation models. Climate change (2020–2080) increased N mineralization (24%) and N2O emissions (19%) but decreased N fixation (32%), seed N (20%), and yields (19%). Soil and crop management practices altered N fluxes at a similar magnitude as climate change but in many different directions, revealing opportunities to improve soybean systems’ performance. Among many practices explored, we identified two solutions with great potential: improved residue management (short-term) and water management (long-term). Inter-annual weather variability and management practices affected soybean yield less than N fluxes, which creates opportunities to manage N fluxes without compromising yields, especially in regions with adequate to excess soil moisture. This work provides actionable results (tradeoffs, synergies, directions) to inform decision-making for adapting crop management in a changing climate to improve soybean production systems.

This work investigates the biophysical and hydrological effects of future climate change, including trends in CO2, in the St. Joseph River watershed, Eastern Corn Belt. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was first modified to take dynamic CO2 concentration as input. A regional crop leaf development curve from Landsat TM imagery was also used to adjust model performance in corn leaf area development for the historical period. A multi-objective calibration strategy was employed to ensure acceptable simulation of streamflow, seasonal crop growth and interannual crop yield simultaneously. The model was then driven by future climate change and CO2 data from three Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs), which are GFDL-CM2.1.1, NCAR-PCM1.3, and UKMO-HADCM3.1, under three Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES), including B1, A1 B and A2 to investigate crop and streamflow response in two future periods: the near future (2021–2050) and the far future (2061–2090). The St. Joseph River watershed is expected to experience more winter and spring precipitation, but slightly decreasing summer precipitation. Due to increasing temperature and decreasing summer moisture, more drought stress is predicted. Both annual total aeration and drought stress are projected to be more variable in both future periods. Although future CO2 enhancement will benefit the crop growth and final yield by improving radiation use efficiency (RUE) and reducing drought stresses, simulated corn yield still decreased by 6% in the near future period, and 16% in the far future period due to the combined effect of both climate change and CO2 enhancement. Streamflow redistribution is also predicted in the future. Stream discharge is projected to increase for the whole flow range in the near future period. For the far future period, high flows are expected to decrease, while low flows are expected to increase, indicating more hydrologic drought and flood events in the St. Joseph River watershed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; CO2; Crop modeling; Hydrology; SWAT","Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Crops; Drought; Floods; Hydrology; Moisture; Plants (botany); Rivers; Stream flow; Watersheds; Atmosphere ocean general circulation models; Crop model; Increasing temperatures; Multi-objective calibration; Radiation use efficiency; Soil and water assessment tool; Special report on emissions scenarios; SWAT; Climate change; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The eastern part of this region is comprised of the Ohio-Tennessee River Basin (OTRB), which is considered a key contributing area for water pollution and the Northern Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone. A point of crucial importance in this basin is therefore how intensive corn-based cropping systems for food and fuel production can be sustainable and coexist with a healthy water environment, not only under existing climate but also under climate change conditions in the future. To address this issue, a OTRB integrated modeling system has been built with a greatly refined 12-digit subbasin structure based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) water quality model, which is capable of estimating landscape and in-stream water and pollutant yields in response to a wide array of alternative cropping and/or management strategies and climatic conditions. The effects of three agricultural management scenarios on crop production and pollutant loads exported from the crop land of the OTRB to streams and rivers were evaluated: (1) expansion of continuous corn across the entire basin, (2) adoption of no-till on all corn and soybean fields in the region, (3) implementation of a winter cover crop within the baseline rotations. The effects of each management scenario were evaluated both for current climate and projected mid-century (2046-2065) climates from seven global circulation models (GCMs). In both present and future climates each management scenario resulted in reduced erosion and nutrient loadings to surface water bodies compared to the baseline agricultural management, with cover crops causing the highest water pollution reduction. Corn and soybean yields in the region were negligibly influenced from the agricultural management scenarios. On the other hand, both water quality and crop yield numbers under climate change deviated considerably for all seven GCMs compared to the baseline climate. Future climates from all GCMs led to decreased corn and soybean yields by up to 20% on a mean annual basis, while water quality alterations were either positive or negative depending on the GCM. The study highlights the loss of productivity in the eastern Corn Belt under climate change, the need to consider a range of GCMs when assessing impacts of climate change, and the value of SWAT as a tool to analyze the effects of climate change on parameters of interest at the basin scale. © 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The change of cultivated land quality with climate change has become one of the hot research areas in global change in recent years. Based on the meteorological data, soil information and field experimental data were used, utilizing the Wageninngen method recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to calculate the potential productivity of potato and spring wheat from 1989 to 2009 in Wuchuan County, Inner Mongolia, a typical semi-arid climate-sensitive area in North China. We examined the influence of climate change on production potential, the standard cropping system, and the yield. Further, by the method of regulations of Farmland classification, we used the data of potential productivity and land use to analyze the changes of natural quality grades and utilization grades under climate change. The results showed that: (1) The annual temperature of Wuchuan County increased at an average rate of 0.57°C/10a during 1967-2009. The precipitation varied greatly among the years, and the annual precipitation declined slightly over time. The soil relative humidity in soil layers 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm depth in crop growing season (April-September) in the period 1989-2009 had a decreasing trend with an average rate of 1.8%/a and 1.5%/a, respectively. Drought index increased noticeably. In conclusion, Wuchuan County was getting warmer and dryer under climate change. (2) Most of the cultivated lands were the dry lands in Wuchuan county (accounting for more than 90%), but the irrigated lands increased in recent years. The main crop in Wuchuan county was potatoes in 2009 instead of spring wheat in 1989. The planting area of potatoes increased from 8.4% to 39.8%, while spring wheat planting area decreasing from 52.1% to 17.1% in the period 1989-2009. (3) The production potential of the potatoes and spring wheat showed a declining trend under the dry warming climate in Wuchuan county. The production potential of potatoes decreased more obviously than spring wheat. Precipitation was the main factor affecting the production potential of potatoes and spring wheat. The natural quality grade index of dry land and irrigated land in the period 1989-2009 had an obviously decreasing trend with an average rate of 2.1/a and 0.5/a, respectively. The natural quality index of irrigated land was significantly higher than that of dry land. The dry land utilization grade index showed a descending trend, but the irrigated land utilization grade index showed a rising trend. The utilization grade index of the irrigated land was also significantly higher than that of the dry land, and the influence of climate change in the dry land was greater than in the irrigated land. However, the effect of land utilization by human activities in the irrigated land was greater. Therefore, as a comparative system between dry land quality and irrigated land quality, water is the major constraint to the cultivated land quality grade. This research can provide the scientific basis for formulation of the land-use system, protection and improvement of the quality of cultivated land under the background of climate change.","Arid regions; Climate change; Cultivated land quality; Land use; Natural quality grade index; Utilization grade index","Annual precipitation; Annual temperatures; Cultivated land qualities; Experimental datum; Food and agriculture organizations; Meteorological data; Potential productivity; Quality grade; Arid regions; Cultivation; Land use; Meteorology; Productivity; Soils; Climate change",Article,Scopus

The ERA-Interim reanalysis climate data regarding the period from 1981 to 2000 were used for the historical simulation of the watershed. The ArcSWAT simulated data were evaluated against the observed discharge data for the periods with the available data. The statistical evaluation confirmed the ArcSWAT model’s capability in simulating the hydrological process of the research area. The climate change consequences on the hydrological components of the research area until the end of the twenty-first century were estimated by driving the ArcSWAT model with the Regional Climate Model Version 4 (RegCM4) forcing data under the extreme RCP 8.5 scenario, namely the simulations of the MPI and HadGEM2 general circulation models (GCMs), resulted from the spatio-temporal kriging approach. Based on the results, the increase in the minimum and the maximum temperature contributed to an increase in the actual evapotranspiration and the surface runoff. In contrast, the temperature increase caused a reduction in the infiltration. An increase (reduction) in the precipitation led to an increase (reduction) in the hydrological components.

The utility of HadCM3 as a tool in climate change predictions in cross cultural studies is scarce. Therefore, this study sought to investigate and predict climate change induced temperature and precipitation in Iran. The calibration and validation using the HadCM3 was performed during 1961-2001, using daily temperatures and precipitation. The data on temperature and precipitation from 1961 to 1990 were used for calibration, and, for model validation, data from 1991 to 2001 were used. Moreover, in order to downscale general circulation models to station scales, SDSM version 4.2 was utilized. The least difference between observed data and simulation data during calibration and validation showed that the parameter was precisely modeled for most of the year. Simulation under the A2 scenario was performed for three time periods (2020, 2050, and 2080). According to our simulated model, precipitation showed a decreasing trend whereas temperature showed an increasing trend. The result of this research paper makes a significant contribution to climate smart agriculture in Iran. For example, rural development practitioners can devise effective policies and programs in order to reduce the vulnerability of local communities to climate change impacts. Moreover, the result of this study can be used as an optimal model for land allocation in agriculture. Moreover, a shortage of rainfall and decreased temperatures also have implications for agricultural land allocation. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate change; Global circulation model; HadCM3; Iran; Prediction; SDSM","agricultural land; agricultural management; agricultural production; climate change; climate effect; climate prediction; data processing; general circulation model; global climate; model validation; nature-society relations; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; temperature profile; vulnerability; Iran",Article,Scopus

After the successful calibration and validation of the HBV hydrological model, streamflow was simulated for the periods of 2021–2040 and 2041–2060 and compared to streamflow of the baseline period 1996–2015 to investigate the changes. The results suggested that overall, following the precipitation increment, streamflow is expected to increase under both RCPs. The average monthly changes of streamflow are expected to increase by 40.1 and 29.4% under RCP4.5 and 16.9 and 18.5% under RCP8.5 scenarios for 2021– 2040 and 2041–2060, respectively. Annual streamflow would increase by 28.5 and 23.95% under RCP4.5 and 8.5, respectively. The results of this work can help and inform the water resources planner and designer to frame an appropriate plan and management for the effective use of water in the future. © 2022 The Authors.","bias-correction; climate change; climate model; climate scenarios; streamflow","Climate models; Stream flow; Water resources; Bias correction; Climate change impact; Climate scenarios; Daily precipitations; Ethiopia; Historical periods; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Precipitation temperature; River basins; Subbasins; Climate change; climate change; diurnal variation; future prospect; hydrological modeling; precipitation assessment; scenario analysis; streamflow; Awash Basin; Ethiopia",Article,Scopus

Simulations of future crop production show that climate change is likely to reduce the yields of the major grain crops around the world, but the impacts on potato production have yet to be determined. A model ensemble consisting of five process-based and one statistical model was used to estimate the impact of climate change on fully irrigated, well-fertilized potato crop across the USA under the RCP 8.5 scenario of high emissions. Results indicate that increasing temperature will reduce potato yields, but this will be mostly compensated by elevated atmospheric CO2. Yields are predicted to decline with climate change in the current highest-yielding areas, which might experience the highest rises in growing season temperature during short hot summers. Simulated yields increase slightly elsewhere in the southern regions of the USA. Planting potatoes earlier as adaptation to avoid hot summers might improve yields in most regions. Water use by the potato crop is predicted to decline despite higher temperatures, due to a shorter growing season and increased water use efficiency under elevated atmospheric CO2. With higher yields in many regions, crop uptake for (nitrogen + phosphorus + potassium) NPK fertilizer will increase, despite the reduced concentration of nutrients in potatoes due to a growth stimulus from elevated atmospheric CO2. With earlier planting, by 2050 water use will decline by 11.7%, NPK fertilizer uptake will increase by 10.4%, and yields of slightly less nutritious potatoes will increase by 14.9% nationally. © 2022 The Author(s).

Understanding how altered precipitation patterns and magnitudes, coupled with rising growing season temperatures, affect irrigation demand and crop production is a prerequisite for formulating effective water resources management strategies. This study evaluated the effects of near-term climate change (centered on 2035) on irrigation demand, green water scarcity, and row crop yields in a major agricultural watershed in southern New Jersey, USA. Downscaled precipitation and temperature from six General Circulation Models (GCMs) for two representative concentration pathways (RCP-4.5 and 8.5) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) were used to drive the Soil and Water Assessment Tool hydrological model. Temperature and precipitation increases resulted in greater surface runoff, lateral flow, groundwater recharge, and total streamflow. Seasonal ET for corn is projected to alter between −3.0 % to 0.5 %, with irrigation demand between −17 % to −1 %, and yield ranges between −4 % to +9 % depending on the GCMs in the RCP-4.5 scenario, with similar patterns projected by RCP-8.5 scenario. For soybean, the simulation also indicates a declining trend of ET and irrigation demand while increasing yield. Increasing yield for both crops is attributed to changes in agronomic management practices combined with genetically improved cultivars and higher soil fertility due to CO2 fertilization. Green water scarcity analysis under future climate change for corn and soybean display a decreased soil moisture stress due to increased water use efficiency resulting from reduced stomatal conductance under elevated CO2 concentration. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Crop yield; Green water scarcity; Hydrology; Irrigation demand; SWAT model","Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Food supply; Hydrology; Irrigation; Recharging (underground waters); Runoff; Soil moisture; Water supply; Coastal plain; Crop yield; General circulation model; Green water; Green water scarcity; Irrigation demand; New Jersey; Potential impacts; SWAT model; Water scarcity; Climate change; carbon dioxide; water; climate change; climate effect; coastal plain; crop yield; irrigation; quantitative analysis; soil and water assessment tool; agricultural management; agricultural parameters; agronomic trait; Article; basin scale; climate change; climate model; coastal plain; concentration (parameter); coupled model intercomparison project phase 5; crop rotation; cultivar; digital elevation model; environmental stress; environmental temperature; evapotranspiration; general circulation model; green water scarcity; greenhouse gas; groundwater recharge; harvest; harvest index; hydrologic response unit; hydrological model; hydrology; irrigation (agriculture); lateral flow; maize; meteorology; New Jersey; nonhuman; plant growth; plant water use; planting time; precipitation; relative humidity; representative concentration pathway; scoring system; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; Soil and Water Assessment Tool model; soil fertility; soil fertilization; soil moisture; solar radiation; soybean; stomatal conductance; streamflow; subbasin scale; surface runoff; temperature; tillage; topography; validation process; water availability; water flow; water insecurity; water stress; watershed; wind speed; soil; New Jersey; United States; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; New Jersey; Soil; Water; Water Insecurity; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Assessing climate change impacts on the main staple food crops is essential to ensure food security. This study aims to assess climate change impacts on millet and sorghum in Niakhar and Toubacouta, two locations in the Senegalese groundnut basin. Field experiment and climate data from RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 greenhouse gas concentration pathways were used to simulate future crop yield and growth cycle length. For each crop, two varieties were considered, a short (90 days) and a long (120 days) maturation cycle. Projections made using the SARRA–O model showed a downward trend of crop yield for all considered varieties and scenarios. These results were, however, more pronounced for the short-cycle variety. In addition, the short-cycle variety showed greater variability in yield trends with larger confidence intervals. In Niakhar, millet and sorghum yield loss for short duration is estimated around 30% by 2050, while the long-cycle variety yield gap was less than 20% compared to the reference period yield (1976–2005). Millet and sorghum yield reduction by 2050 is less pronounced in Toubacouta with around 20%. A slight relationship was inferred between rainfall and yield change, whereas a significant negative linear relationship was inferred between temperature and yield change. The future impact of climate change on these cereals would be mainly a loss of yield induced by rising temperatures. Thus, a thorough consideration of temperature effects will be essential for better adapting cereal production to future climatic conditions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Crop yields; Millet; Senegal; Sorghum",,Article,Scopus

Most studies have only estimated the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity at a regional or national level. This overlooks localized effects at the subnational level, especially within defined agro-ecological regions. Using 30 years (1981–2011) of crop yield and weather data in Zambia, we apply the Just and Pope framework to determine how rainfall and temperature affect yield and yield variability of beans and maize at the national and agro-ecological region levels. At the national level, we find significant negative effect of a rise in temperature on bean and maize yield, while rainfall increases have a positive effect on bean and maize yields. These results differ by agro-ecological region. Rainfall has a positive and significant effect on maize yield in the low rainfall regions I and II, but it has a negative effect on maize yield in the high-rainfall region III and no significant effect on bean yield. Temperature has varied effects by regions and crops. Predicted impacts using HadGEM-ES2 global circulation model show that major yield decreases (25% for maize and 34% for beans) by 2050 will be in region II and will be driven mainly by temperature increase offsetting the positive gains from rainfall increase. The model predominantly overpredicts bean yield and under predicts maize yields. These results call for agro-ecological region-specific adaptation strategies and inventive agricultural policy interventions which are more robust to climate change. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Beans; Climate change; Crop production; Just and Pope model; Maize; Zambia","agricultural ecosystem; agricultural policy; climate change; crop yield; high temperature; maize; policy making; rainfall; Zambia",Article,Scopus

Future climate change can alter long-term hydroclimatic conditions of national forests and grasslands and lead to negative consequences. This study characterizes shifts in hydroclimatology and basin characteristics of US National Forests (NFs) and National Grasslands (NGs) in response to climate change over the 21st century under the DRY, MIDDLE, and WET climate models with the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 emission scenario. Climatic projections for three climate models ranging from the driest to wettest conditions were obtained from the Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) dataset. Then, the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model was used to model hydrological responses of the selected future climates. Changes in regional hydroclimatic conditions of NFs and NGs were assessed by the magnitude and direction of movements in the Budyko space. The Fu’s equation was applied to estimate changes in basin characteristics. The results indicate that NFs and NGs are likely to experience larger changes in basin characteristics compared to the average of the United States. In general, across the conterminous US, the NFs in mountainous regions are likely to have larger changes in hydroclimatic variables than NFs with lower elevation and NGs. Comparing Forest Service regions, Pacific Northwest, Intermountain, and Northern regions may have a less arid climate with lower freshwater availability. The Southwestern, Northern, Intermountain, and Rocky Mountain regions are likely to experience higher shifts in their basin characteristics.

The evidence is provided by long-term observations of weather and insurance records that are also a foundation for the majority of insurance products covering weather related damages. The insurers around the world are concerned, however, that the past records used to assess and price the risks underestimate the risk and incurred losses in recent years. The growing insurance risks are largely attributed to climate change that brings increasingly more alterations and permanent impact on all aspects of human life and welfare. From floods to hail to excessive wind, adverse atmospheric events are a poignant reminder of how vulnerable our society is across a broad range of threats posed by environmental extremes. Indeed, as climate change effects become more pronounced, we face a new era of risk with increasing weather related damages and losses. This in turn, coupled with challenges of massive climatic data, requires developing innovative analytic approaches that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries of statistical, actuarial and environmental sciences. Nevertheless, the multidisciplinary nature of climate risk assessment and its impact on insurance is often overlooked and neglected. We highlight the most recent developments and interdisciplinary perspectives on diverse statistical and machine learning methodology for modeling and assessing climate risk in agricultural and home insurances, with a particular focus on noncatastrophic events.

These indicators are used to validate the spatial impacts of climate change on grain production. Air pollution data are used as instrumental variables to address the causality between climate and grain production. The regression results show that: First, climatic variables all have a non-linear “increasing then decreasing” effect on food production. Second, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5 have a negative impact on grain production. Based on the model, changes in the climatic production potential of grain crops can be calculated, and the future spatial layout of climate production can also be predicted by using random forests.

Sixteen scenarios were generated using combinations of four periods of climatic data (1974–84; 1985–1995; 1996–2006 and 2007–2016) and four sets of land use maps (1976; 1989; 2000 and 2014).

Protein needs for people in developing countries such as Indonesia have not been fulfilled optimally. Indonesian people's protein consumption is still at 65.7%, much lower than it should be. The development of soybean cultivation as a source of vegetable protein is very potential. This article aims to examine the role of soybean agroforestry to meet human protein needs and as an effort to mitigate climate change.In Indonesia, soybean development is constrained by people's views; soybean is not the main crop and the rate of land conversion. An effort to overcome the limitation of optimum land according to the growing season is the development of soybean cultivation under forest stands as an agroforestry system. In Indonesia, there are production forests, including teak, pine, sengon, and resin, especially in teak, pine, and sengon forests, soybean cultivation with agroforestry systems has developed. The main obstacle to cultivation in the agroforestry system is low light due to the shade of the tree canopy. It requires efforts: tree spacing, especially between rows, trimming the tree canopy when the canopy is getting tighter, and low light tolerant plant varieties. Soybeans are low-light tolerant plants. The national average soybean production of about 1.5 tons ha-1 can be achieved in teak-based agroforestry systems up to 3-4 years old tree, pine-based up to 3 years old, and sengon-based up to 5 years old. The agroforestry system has the potential as land for the cultivation of organic plants in mitigating the impacts of climate change. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","agroforestry; climate change; soybean; vegetable protein",,Conference Paper,Scopus

The combination of GSHM and SOM allows to withdraw the most informative components about our data, by overcoming correlation issues between input data prior to the training process. The improved hybrid algorithm was trained firstly on data that have a correlation problem, and it was compared with another hybrid model based on SOM and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), secondly, it was trained using selected soil parameters related to the atmosphere (e.g. pH, nitrogen, phosphate, potassium, depth, temperature, and rainfall). A comparative study with the standard SOM was conducted. The improved Kohonen-Self Organizing Map when applied to correlated data, demonstrated better results in terms of classification accuracy (8/8), and rapidity = 0.015s compared to a classification accuracy (7/8) and a rapidity = 97,828 s using SOM combined with PCA. Moreover, the proposed algorithm resulted in better results for crop prediction in terms of maximum iteration number of 675, mean error ≤0.00022, and rapidity = 18.422s versus an iteration number of 729, mean error ≤ 0.000916 and rapidity= 23.707s with the standard SOM.

There are several changes faced by the farmers due to various factors such as water shortage, undefined price owing to demand–supply, weather uncertainties, and inaccurate crop prediction. The prediction of crop yield, notably paddy yield, is an intricate assignment owing to its dependency on several factors such as crop genotype, environmental factors, management practices, and their interactions. Researchers are used to predicting the paddy yield using statistical approaches, but they failed to attain higher accuracy due to several factors. Therefore, machine learning methods such as support vector regression (SVR), general regression neural networks (GRNNs), radial basis functional neural networks (RBFNNs), and back-propagation neural networks (BPNNs) are demonstrated to predict the paddy yield accurately for the Cauvery Delta Zone (CDZ), which lies in the eastern part of Tamil Nadu, South India. The performance of each developed model is examined using assessment metrics such as coefficient of determination (R2 ), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of variance (CV), and normalized mean squared error (NMSE). The observed results show that the GRNN algorithm delivers superior evaluation metrics such as R2, RMSE, MAE, MSE, MAPE, CV, and NSME values about 0.9863, 0.2295 and 0.1290, 0.0526, 1.3439, 0.0255, and 0.0136, respectively, which ensures accurate crop yield prediction compared with other methods. Finally, the performance of the GRNN model is compared with other available models from several studies in the literature, and it is found to be high while comparing the prediction accuracy using evaluation metrics. © 2021 by the authors.

In this context, better knowledge of how climate will change in West Africa and how such changes will impact crop productivity is crucial to inform policies that may counteract the adverse effects. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of climate change impacts on agriculture inWest Africa based on the recent scientific literature.West Africa is nowadays experiencing a rapid climate change, characterized by a widespread warming, a recovery of the monsoonal precipitation, and an increase in the occurrence of climate extremes. The observed climate tendencies are also projected to continue in the twenty-first century under moderate and high emission scenarios, although large uncertainties still affect simulations of the future West African climate, especially regarding the summer precipitation. However, despite diverging future projections of the monsoonal rainfall, which is essential for rain-fed agriculture, a robust evidence of yield loss in West Africa emerges. This yield loss is mainly driven by increased mean temperature while potential wetter or drier conditions as well as elevated CO2 concentrations can modulate this effect. Potential for adaptation is illustrated for major crops in West Africa through a selection of studies based on process-based crop models to adjust cropping systems (change in varieties, sowing dates and density, irrigation, fertilizer management) to future climate. Results of the cited studies are crop and region specific and no clear conclusions can be made regarding the most effective adaptation options. Further efforts are needed to improve modeling of the monsoon system and to better quantify the uncertainty in its changes under a warmer climate, in the response of the crops to such changes and in the potential for adaptation. © 2016 Sultan and Gaetani.","Adaptation; Agriculture; Climate change; Impacts; West African monsoon",,Review,Scopus

First, the evolution of rainfall and temperature during the twenty-first century is assessed at the local scale using 17 regional climate model (RCM) simulations. A15%-30% rainfall reduction is expected in the fall combined with a 7%-9% annual reduction by 2030-50. Based on a regression model relating yields to rainfall, residual yields (independent of the increasing trend in the present period and from the biennial fruit bearing of the olive tree) are projected to decrease by 7% and 3.5% by 2030-50 for rainfed and irrigated olive groves, respectively. Substantial uncertainties in these results are discussed. AGIS analysis shows a reduction of ground and surface water resources, which are the basis of the present adaptation to rainfall variability, and an uneven potential for adaptation to climate change in the Sierra Mágina region. Despite the important challenges faced by this rural region, there is no consensus among the local key actors regarding adaptation strategies. This is due in part to the diversity among farmers, but also to the different levels of awareness about climate change among all the stakeholders and farmers. Since the projected decline in medium-range future yields is not very high, there might be time and possibilities, especially in the northern part of the Sierra Mágina, to build a local adaptability strategy within the next 20 years that would take into account improved methods of water management and a better economic valorization of olive oil. But at longer time scales, the adaptability of the olive-growing system to yield and water resource declines seems to be threatened. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.",,"adaptive management; climate change; climate modeling; farming system; fruit; future prospect; GIS; interdisciplinary approach; Mediterranean environment; precipitation intensity; socioeconomic impact; stakeholder; timescale; water management; water resource; Andalucia; Jaen [Andalucia]; Sierra Magina Natural Park; Spain",Article,Scopus

Elevated greenhouse gases (GHG), as well as land cover/land use change (LCLUC), can influence regional climate dynamics. Biophysical factors such as topography, soil type, and seasonal rainfall can strongly affect crop yields. We used a regional climate model derived from the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) to compare the effects of projected future GHG and future LCLUC on spatial variability of crop yields in East Africa. Crop yields were estimated with a process-based simulation model. The results suggest that: (1) GHG-influenced and LCLUC-influenced yield changes are highly heterogeneous across this region; (2) LCLUC effects are significant drivers of yield change; and (3) high spatial variability in yield is indicated for several key agricultural sub-regions of East Africa. Food production risk when considered at the household scale is largely dependent on the occurrence of extremes, so mean yield in some cases may be an incomplete predictor of risk. The broad range of projected crop yields reflects enormous variability in key parameters that underlie regional food security; hence, donor institutions' strategies and investments might benefit from considering the spatial distribution around mean impacts for a given region. Ultimately, global assessments of food security risk would benefit from including regional and local assessments of climate impacts on food production. This may be less of a consideration in other regions. This study supports the concept that LCLUC is a first-order factor in assessing food production risk. © 2011 The Author(s).",,"Biophysical factors; Climate change impact; Climate impacts; Crop yield; East Africa; East africans; First-order; Food production; Food production systems; Food security; Future climate; Key parameters; Land-cover/land-use change; Land-use change; Regional atmospheric modeling systems; Regional climate; Regional climate models; Regional scale; Seasonal rainfall; Simulation model; Soil types; Spatial variability; Sub-regions; Climate models; Computer simulation; Crops; Economics; Food supply; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Climate change; assessment method; atmospheric modeling; climate change; climate modeling; crop yield; environmental factor; food production; food security; greenhouse gas; heterogeneity; land cover; land use change; numerical model; rainfall; regional climate; risk factor; seasonal variation; soil type; spatial distribution; spatial variation; topography; vulnerability; East Africa",Article,Scopus

Timely, accurate, and reliable rice yield prediction in India is crucial for global food security and health issues. Deep learning models have achieved excellent performances in predicting crop yield. However, the interpretation of deep learning models is still rare. In this study, we proposed a transformer-based model, Informer, to predict rice yield across the Indian Indo-Gangetic Plains by integrating time-series satellite data, environmental variables, and rice yield records from 2001 to 2016. The results showed that Informer had better performance (R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 0.41 t/ha) than four other machine learning and deep learning models for end-of-season prediction. For within-season prediction, the Informer model could achieve stable performances (R2 ≈ 0.78) after late September, which indicated that the optimal prediction could be achieved 2 months before rice maturity. In addition, we interpreted the prediction models by evaluating the input feature importance and analyzing hidden features. The evaluation of feature importance indicated that NIRV was the most critical factor, while intervals 6 (mid-August) and 12 (mid-November) were the key periods for rice yield prediction. The hidden feature analysis demonstrated that the attention-based long short-term memory (AtLSTM) model accumulated the information of each growth period, while the Informer model focused on the information around intervals 5 to 6 (August) and 11 to 12 (November). Our findings provided a reliable and simple framework for crop yield prediction and a new perspective for explaining the internal mechanism of deep learning models. © 2022 by the authors.","attention; crop yield prediction; deep learning; feature importance; remote sensing","Crops; Deep learning; Food supply; Learning systems; Remote sensing; Attention; Crop yield; Crop yield prediction; Deep learning; Feature importance; Learning models; Performance; Remote-sensing; Rice yield; Yield prediction; Forecasting",Article,Scopus

This study aimed to develop an approach for rice crop yield prediction in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and leaf area index (LAI). Data processing consisted of four main steps: (1) constructing time-series vegetation indices, (2) noise filtering of time-series data using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), (3) establishment of crop yield models, and (4) model validation. The results indicated that the quadratic model using two variables (EVI and LAI) produced more accurate results than other models (i.e. linear, interaction, pure quadratic, and quadratic with a single variable). The highest correlation coefficients obtained at the ripening period for the spring-winter and autumn-summer crops were 0.70 and 0.74, respectively. The robustness of the established models was evaluated by comparisons between the predicted yields and crop yield statistics for 10 sampling districts in 2006 and 2007. The comparisons revealed satisfactory results for both years, especially for the spring-winter crop. In 2006, the root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean bias error (MBE) for the spring-winter crop were 10.18%, 8.44% and 0.9%, respectively, while the values for the autumn-summer crop were 17.65%, 14.06%, and 3.52%, respectively.

Moreover, future data (2022–2040) were obtained from three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5, and incorporated into DNN prediction set. The findings showed that determination-coefficient between historical-predicted crop evapotranspiration (ETc) varied from 0.92 to 0.97 for two crops. The yield prediction values of wheat-maize deviated within the ranges of −3.21% to 3.47% and −4.93% to 5.88%, respectively. Based on the ensemble of RCP, precipitation was forecasted to decease by 667.40% and 261.73% in winter and summer in western as compared to eastern, respectively, which will ultimately be dropped to 105.02% and 60.87%, respectively parallel to historical. Therefore, the substantial fluctuations in precipitation caused an obvious decrease in green WF of wheat (i.e., 24.96% and 37.44%) in western and eastern, respectively. Additionally, for maize, it induced a 103.93% decrease in western and an 8.96% increase in eastern. Furthermore, increasing ETc by 8.46% and 12.45% gave rise to substantially increasing (i.e., 8.96% and 17.21%) in western for wheat-maize compared to the east, respectively. Likewise, grey wheat-maize WF findings reveals that there was an increase of 3.07% and 5.02% in western as compared to −14.51% and 12.37% in eastern. Hence, our results highly recommend the optimal use of the eastern delta to save blue-water by 16.58% and 40.25% of total requirements for wheat-maize in contrast to others.

For the Kadongjia River watershed (KRW), a poorly gauged watershed located in southern Tibet, China, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was adapted to model streamflow and its responses to climate change. The average annual streamflow was simulated to be roughly 124.6mm with relatively small interannual variation during 1974-2010. The seasonal distribution of streamflow was uneven with a maximum in summer and a minimum in winter. Snowmelt, which was mainly produced in April-May, accounted for 4.0% of annual streamflow. Correlations and regression analysis between the interannual variations of major climatic and hydrological variables indicated that precipitation (temperature) had positive (negative) influence on the annual streamflow variation. For the interannual streamflow variations, warmer temperature was slightly more important than the variation of winter precipitation. Comparing streamflow changes in the current years (1980-99) with the future (2030-49), streamflow variations were more sensitive to changing climate in winter and spring than in the other two seasons.

Today, the rapidly growing field of machine learning (ML) offers a wide range of advanced statistical tools that are increasingly being used for more accurate estimates of this relationship. This study compares LR to a popular ML technique called boosted regression trees (BRTs). We find that BRTs provide a significantly better prediction accuracy compared to various LR specifications, including those fitting quadratic and piece-wise linear functions. BRTs are also able to identify break points where the relationship between climate and yield undergoes significant shifts (for example, increasing yields with precipitation followed by a plateauing of the relationship beyond a certain point). Tests we performed with synthetically simulated climate and crop yield data showed that BRTs can automatically account for not only spatial variation in climate-yield relationships, but also interactions between different variables that affect crop yields. We then used both statistical techniques to estimate the influence of historical climate change on rice, wheat, and pearl millet in India. BRTs predicted a considerably smaller negative impact compared to LR. This may be an artifact of BRTs conflating time and climate variables, signaling a potential weakness of models with excessively flexible functional forms for inferring climate impacts on agriculture. Our findings thus suggest caution while interpreting the results from single-model analyses, especially in regions with highly varied climate and agricultural practices. © 2023 The Author(s).

(sugar beet crops) under future climate change scenarios. RESULTS: A system dynamics model was developed which takes account of the effects of rainfall and temperature on sugar beetyields under limited irrigation conditions. A relationship was also developed between the seasonal evapotranspiration and seasonal growing degree days for sugar beet crops. The proposed model was set to run for the present time period of 1993-2012 and for the future period 2013-2040 for Lethbridge region (Alberta, Canada). The model provides sugar beet yields on a yearly basis which are comparable to the present field data. It was found that the future average yield will be increased at about 14% with respect to the present average yield. CONCLUSION: The proposed model can help to improve the understanding of soil water conditions and irrigation water requirements of an area under certain climatic conditions and can be used for future prediction of yields for any crops in any region (with the required information to be provided). The developed system dynamics model can be used as a supporting tool for decision making, for improvement of agricultural management practice of any region. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.","Climatic variables; Crop yield prediction; Evapotranspiration; Growing degree days; Soil moisture; System dynamics model","Beta vulgaris; Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Rain; Soil; Water; agriculture; alberta; Beta vulgaris; biomass; climate change; crops, agricultural; Environment; Humans; Models, Biological; Plant Roots; Soil; Temperature; Agriculture; Alberta; Beta vulgaris; Biomass; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Environment; Humans; Models, Biological; Plant Roots; Rain; Soil; Temperature; Water",Article,Scopus

We quantified the response of maize yield to projected climate changes in three main maize growing areas of South Africa (Bloemfontein, Lichtenburg and Nelspruit) using two crop modelling solutions: existing (EMS) and modified (MMS) CropSyst. The MMS considers explicitly the impact of extreme heat and drought. Both solutions were run with climate data generated from two radiative forcing scenarios using six general circulation models and three time horizons representing baseline (1990–2020), near future (2021–2050) and far future (2051–2080) time periods. Reduced yields were projected with both modelling solutions especially under far future time period. Simulated maize yield using EMS with high radiative forcing for far future decreased (compared with the simulated baseline for EMS) by 30%, 25.9% and 18.3% at Bloemfontein, Lichtenburg and Nelspruit, respectively. Simulated grain yield with MMS showed reductions of 27.6%, 24.3% and 18.7%, respectively (compared with the simulated baseline for MMS). Grain yield differences between the EMS and MMS ranged between 9 and 21%. This difference showed an increasing trend as time progressed from the baseline to the far future and varied across locations. Accounting explicitly for the impact of extreme weather events (MMS) resulted in lower simulated yields compared with the model without (EMS).

Our objectives were to investigate the relationship between yield-related indices of winter wheat and the related climatic variables (selected using variance inflation factors) at the 20 sites of Xinjiang, China over 1981–2017. The background of climate and yield changes was analyzed from temporal and spatial respects. The number of independent climatic variables was selected with the variance inflation factor method to remove the multicollinear feature. The Pearson correlation was conducted between the first difference values of climatic variables and yield-related indices of winter wheat (namely plant height, growth period duration, 1000-kernel weight, kernel number per ear, biomass and yield) to find the key climatic variables that impacted winter wheat growth and yields. The multi-variate linear and nonlinear functions were established step by step using the selected key climatic variables. The best function was determined for each site (significant for p < 0.05). From the results, there were general wetter and warmer trends of the climatic variables. Corre-spondingly, shortened winter wheat phenology and increased growth and yields were observed for most sites. Still, the climatic trends had mixed effects on winter wheat yields. The effects of precip-itation, mean air temperature and relative humidity on plant height and growth period duration agreed well. Different sites had different major climatic drivers for winter wheat growth or yields, and the best functions of growth and yields could be linearly or nonlinearly, mostly described by multi-variate functions. The winter wheat growth or yield indices were also found to be closely connected with the soil water content status at the eight sites. The relationship between winter wheat growth or yield and climate provided useful references for forecasting crop production and for projecting the impact of future climate changes. © 2021 by the authors.

These inter-relationships necessitate an integrated management approach for surface water, groundwater, and crop yield as a holistic system. This study quantifies the future availability of surface water and groundwater and associated crop production in a large semi-arid agro-urban river basin in which agricultural irrigation is a leader consumer of water. The region of study is the South Platte River Basin (72,000 km2), Colorado, USA. The coupled SWAT-MODFLOW modeling code is used as the hydrologic simulator and forced with five different CMIP5 climate models downscaled by Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA), each for two climate scenarios, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, for 1980–2100. The hydrologic model accounts for surface runoff, soil lateral flow, groundwater flow, groundwater-surface water interactions, irrigation from surface water and groundwater, and crop yield on a per-field basis. In all climate models and emission scenarios, an increase of 3 to 5 °C in annual average temperature is projected. Whereas, variation in the projected precipitation depends on topography and distances from mountains. Based on the results of this study, the worst-case climate model in the basin is IPSL-CM5A-MR-8.5. Under this climate scenario, for a 1 °C increase in temperature and the 1.3% reduction in annual precipitation, the basin will experience an 8.5% decrease in stream discharge, 2–5% decline in groundwater storage, and 11% reduction in crop yield. These results indicate the significant effect of climate change on water and food resources of a large river basin, pointing to the need for immediate implementation of conservation practices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural productivity; Climate change; Coupled SWAT-MODFLOW; Hydrological modeling; Large scale watershed; Water availability","Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Groundwater resources; Irrigation; Productivity; Rivers; Surface water resources; Topography; Watersheds; Agricultural productivity; Coupled SWAT-MODFLOW; Crop yield; Hydrological models; Large-scale watersheds; River basins; Surface water and groundwaters; Urban river; Water availability; Waters resources; Climate change; ground water; surface water; agricultural development; agricultural production; climate change; climate effect; crop production; future prospect; water availability; water resource; Article; climate change; climate warming; crop production; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; evapotranspiration; harvest; hydrology; precipitation; river basin; urban area; water availability; water supply; South Platte River; United States",Article,Scopus

According to the cropping system subdivision in southern rice production area of China during 1980s, this study used climate data from 254 meteorological stations and phonological data from 168 agricultural observation stations in the south of China, and adopted 6 international evaluation indices about the effectiveness of hydrothermal resources to analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of hydrothermal resources during the growing period of single cropping rice system and double cropping rice system for 16 planting zones in the whole study area. The results showed that: in southern rice production area of China, the effectiveness of thermal resources of single cropping rice area (SCRA) was less than that of double cropping rice area (DCRA), whereas the effectiveness of thermal resources of both SARA and DCRA showed a decreasing trend. The index value of effective precipitation satisfaction of SCRA was higher than that of DCRA, nevertheless the index value of effective precipitation satisfaction of both SCRA and DCRA showed a decreasing trend. There was a significant linear relationship between effective thermal resource and water demand, likely water demand increased by 18 mm with every 100°C d increase of effective heat. Effective precipitation satisfaction index (EPSI) showed a negative correlation with effective heat, yet showed a positive correlation with effective precipitation. EPSI reduced by 1% when effective heat resource increased by 125°C d.

This study employed an improved SWAT model with a Management Allowed Depletion (MAD) auto-irrigation method to assess the impacts of future climate change on water cycle and crop growth of irrigated winter wheat and summer maize in the Haihe River Basin, China. A total of 27 Global Climate Models (GCMs) from the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) and two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5) were used to drive the SWAT-MAD model to simulate crop growth and water balance components for two future periods of 2041–2070 (2050s) and 2071–2100 (2080s). Data from almost all GCMs showed an increase in annual mean maximum air temperature, minimum air temperature, total precipitation, and solar radiation across the Haihe River Basin. Winter wheat yields increased by 15.6% (SSP245) and 16.3% (SSP585) by 2050s, and by 17.1% (SSP245) and 10.0% (SSP585) by 2080s, respectively.

The change of leaf area index (LAI) indicated an advance in phenology of crops, which might be related to the increase in temperature. In the four future climate scenarios, precipitation, percolation, and surface runoff increased by 19.16–57.25 mm, 7.26–22.18 mm, and 1.45–4.87 mm during winter wheat growing season, 125.41–205.24 mm, 51.03–96.37 mm, and 33.97–68.69 mm during summer maize growing season.

Theoretically, it has advantages over global climate models in terms of realisation of future climate projections. However, there are few studies that have used dynamical downscaling results to assess climate change impacts on Australian cropping systems. In this study, we used post-processing bias-corrected climate data from the NSW/ACT Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) project to drive the Agricultural Production Systems SIMulator (APSIM) for modelling and evaluating the response of three major crops (wheat, canola and lupin) to projected climate conditions under various farm management practices in south-eastern Australia. Our results showed that historical crop yields from APSIM simulations forced by RCM output tended to underestimate yields from simulations forced by observations due to large biases in the NARCliM simulations. Therefore, bias correction was used to correct the APSIM outputs before conducting future impact analysis. The bias-corrected results showed that ensemble-mean yields based on 12 RCMs were projected to increase over the study area under the A2 emission scenario. However, the magnitude of yield increase depended on the time periods, crop type and location. Multiple linear regression models showed that the changes of radiation, rainfall and temperature and elevated CO2 concentration could explain 60–78% of crop yield changes. It is interesting to note that residue incorporation and nitrogen application had a large effect on percentage yield increases for wheat due to future climate change, but had limited effects on the response of lupin and canola yields. Our study suggests that sufficient bias-correction method is needed when using NARCliM outputs in crop models. Although uncertainties (e.g. the choice of emission scenarios and RCMs) still exist in our study, the results are of central importance in the development of high-yield adaptive strategies for local farmers and policy makers in south-eastern Australia. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; climate modeling; crop production; management practice; regional climate; Australia; Brassica napus var. napus; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Whilst extreme weather conditions may cause extreme impacts, crop failure commonly is induced by the occurrence of multiple and combined anomalous meteorological drivers. For these cases, the explanation of conditions leading to crop failure is complex, as the links connecting weather and crop yield can be multiple and non-linear. Furthermore, climate change is likely to perturb the meteorological conditions, possibly altering the occurrences of crop failures or leading to unprecedented drivers of extreme impacts. The goal of this study is to identify important meteorological drivers that cause crop failures and to explore changes in crop failures due to global warming. For that, we focus on a historical failure event, the extreme low soybean production during the 2012 season in the midwestern US. We first train a random forest model to identify the most relevant meteorological drivers of historical crop failures and to predict crop failure probabilities. Second, we explore the influence of global warming on crop failures and on the structure of compound drivers. We use large ensembles from the EC-Earth global climate model, corresponding to present-day, pre-industrial +2 and 3° C warming, respectively, to isolate the global warming component. Finally, we explore the meteorological conditions inductive for the 2012 crop failure and construct analogues of these failure conditions in future climate settings. We find that crop failures in the midwestern US are linked to low precipitation levels, and high temperature and diurnal temperature range (DTR) levels during July and August. Results suggest soybean failures are likely to increase with climate change. With more frequent warm years due to global warming, the joint hot-dry conditions leading to crop failures become mostly dependent on precipitation levels, reducing the importance of the relative compound contribution. While event analogues of the 2012 season are rare and not expected to increase, impact analogues show a significant increase in occurrence frequency under global warming, but for different combinations of the meteorological drivers than experienced in 2012. This has implications for assessment of the drivers of extreme impact events. © Copyright:",,"Climate models; Crops; Decision trees; Earth (planet); Condition; Crop failures; Crop yield; Extreme weather conditions; Failure events; Meteorological condition; Non linear; Precipitation level; Soybean production; Storylines; Global warming; climate change; climate effect; crop production; extreme event; forest dynamics; global warming; United States",Article,Scopus

A necessary condition is the assessment and analysis of current trends in changing the characteristics of contrasting groups of varieties. The aim of the study is to identify homogeneous groups of varieties of an ampelographic collection and to compare the rates of reaction of their agrobiological parameters to climate changes. Material for the study consists of observations of 21 agrobiological characteristics of 109 grape varieties from the Don ampelographic collection named after Ya.I. Potapenko (Novocherkassk) with an observation period from 10 to 36 years in 1981–2017. The sample included Vitis vinifera L. varieties and the V. vinifera L. × V. labrusca L. and V. vinifera L. × V. amurensis Rupr. interspecific hybrids, and hybrids from crosses between V. vinifera L. and several American species. Homogeneous groups of characteristics and varieties are identified by principal component analysis (PCA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods. Trends in changing the agrobiological characteristics of the varieties and groups of varieties are calculated. PCA revealed that the main differentiating factor of the studied fragment of the ampelographic collection is the size of the bunch; the second, the yield; the third, the time of ripening. The values of the factors are contrasting in varieties of different directions of use and taxonomic origin, which was confirmed by ANOVA. The groups of the V. vinifera × V. labrusca and V. vinifera × V. amurensis hybrids do not differ significantly from each other in most indicators, exceeding V. vinifera varieties in the number of elements of productivity, winter hardiness and yield. Complex hybrids with American species have an intermediate position between these groups exceeding all groups in bunch weight. All groups of cultivars show trends towards a reduction in productive period, an increase in the mass of bunch and yield, sugar content and a decrease in acidity. The V. vinifera × V. labrusca hybrids are distinguished by the highest growth rate of the bunch mass caused by a reduction in the duration of active growth and a decrease in the percentage of fruit-bearing shoots. A higher reduction rate of the production period and a decrease in acidity were observed in later varieties. Regression analysis showed that the acceleration of the ripening of grapes is largely due to rising temperatures. © Novikova L.Yu., Naumova L.G., 2019.","Adaptability; Agrometeorology; Ampelographic collection; Climate change; Information system; Time series",,Article,Scopus

We found that: (1) in the U.S. Midwest, about 45% and 40% of the interannual variability in corn and soybean yield, respectively, can be explained by the climate; (2) the risk level is higher in the southwest and northwest regions of the U.S. Midwest corresponding to 25% yield reduction for both corn and soybean compared to other regions; (3) the severity for the 1988 and 2012 major droughts quantified by our method represent 21-year and 30-year events for corn, and 7-year and 12-year events for soybean, respectively; (4) the crop yield risk will increase under a future climate scenario (i.e., Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 or RCP 8.5 at 2050) compared with the current climate condition, with averaged yield decreases and yield variability increases for both corn and soybean. The framework and the results of this study enable applications for risk management policies and practices for the agriculture sectors. © 2021 The Authors","Climate change; Crop yield prediction; Rainfed corn; Rainfed soybean; Risk assessment; Synthetic climate generation; U.S. Midwest","climate change; crop yield; historical perspective; maize; risk assessment; soybean; yield response; Midwest; United States; Glycine max",Article,Scopus

Crop yield increases due to subirrigation have been demonstrated in numerous studies, but there is limited information regarding yield under future climate conditions when growing season conditions are expected to be drier in the U.S. Corn Belt. DRAINMOD was calibrated and validated for three locations with different soil series in northwest Ohio and used to investigate maize relative yield differences between subirrigation and free subsurface drainage for historic (1984–2013) and future (2041–2070) climate conditions. For historic conditions, the mean maize relative yield increased by 27% with subirrigation on the Nappanee loam soil, but had minimal effect on the Paulding clay and Hoytville silty clay soils. Maize relative yield under free subsurface drainage is predicted to decrease in the future, causing the relative yield difference between free subsurface drainage and subirrigation practices to nearly double from 9% to 16% between the historic and future periods. Consequently, the subirrigation practice can potentially mitigate adverse future climate change impacts on maize yield in northwest Ohio. © 2018","Drainage; DRAINMOD; Hoytville; Maumee; Nappanee; Paulding","Clay; Crops; Drainage; Groundwater flow; Soil moisture; Subirrigation; DRAINMOD; Hoytville; Maumee; Nappanee; Paulding; Climate change; calibration; climate change; crop yield; drainage; growing season; hydrological modeling; irrigation system; maize; model validation; soil water; Ohio; United States; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

While the remote sensing of within-field insights has been a research goal for many years, it is only recently that observations with the required spatio-temporal resolutions, together with efficient assimilation methods to integrate these into modeling frameworks, have become available to advance yield prediction efforts. Here we explore a yield prediction approach that combines daily high-resolution CubeSat imagery with the APSIM crop model. The approach employs APSIM to train a linear regression that relates simulated yield to simulated leaf area index (LAI). That relationship is then used to identify the optimal regression date at which the LAI provides the best prediction of yield: in this case, approximately 14 weeks prior to harvest. Instead of applying the regression on satellite imagery that is coincident, or closest to, the regression date, our method implements a particle filter that integrates CubeSat-based LAI into APSIM to provide end-of-season high-resolution (3 m) yield maps weeks before the optimal regression date. The approach is demonstrated on a rainfed maize field located in Nebraska, USA, where suitable collections of both imagery and in-situ data were available for assessment. The procedure does not require in-field data to calibrate the regression model, with results showing that even with a single assimilation step, it is possible to provide yield estimates with good accuracy up to 21 days before the optimal regression date. Yield spatial variability was reproduced reasonably well, with a strong correlation to independently collected measurements (R2 = 0.73 and rRMSE = 12%). When the field averaged yield was compared, our approach reduced yield prediction error from 1 Mg/ha (control case based on a calibrated APSIM model), to 0.5 Mg/ha (using satellite imagery alone), and then to 0.2 Mg/ha (results with assimilation up to three weeks prior to the optimal regression date). Such a capacity to provide spatially explicit yield predictions early in the season has considerable potential to enhance digital agricultural goals and improve end-of-season yield predictions. © 2021 The Author(s)","APSIM; Crop modeling; Crop yield prediction; CubeSat; Data assimilation; LAI","crop yield; leaf area index; maize; prediction; satellite imagery; yield response; Nebraska; United States",Article,Scopus

One way to cope with future changes in absolute as well as seasonal (irrigation) water amounts can be the adaptation of the agricultural crop pattern in a region, i.e. by planting crops which still provide high yields and so economic benefits to farmers under such varying climate conditions. To do this properly, the whole cascade starting from climate change, effects on hydrology and surface water availability, subsequent effects on crop yield, agricultural areas available, and, finally, economic value of a multi-crop cultivation pattern must be known. To that avail, a complex coupled simulation-optimization tool SWAT-LINGO-MODSIM-PSO (SLMP) has been developed here and used to find the future optimum cultivation area of crops for the maximization of the economic benefits in five irrigation-fed agricultural plains in the south of the Karkheh River Basin (KRB) southwest Iran. Starting with the SWAT distributed hydrological model, the KR-streamflow as well as the inflow into the Karkheh-reservoir, as the major storage of irrigation water, is calibrated and validated, based on 1985–2004 observed discharge data. In the subsequent step, the SWAT-predicted streamflow is fed into the MODSIM river basin Decision Support System to simulate and optimize the water allocation between different water users (agricultural, environmental, municipal and industrial) under standard operating policy (SOP) rules. The final step is the maximization of the economic benefit in the five agricultural plains through constrained PSO (particle swarm optimization) by adjusting the cultivation areas (decision variables) of different crops (wheat, barley, maize and “others”), taking into account their specific prizes and optimal crop yields under water deficiency, with the latter computed in the LINGO-sub-optimization module embedded in the SLMP-tool. For the optimization of the agricultural benefits in the KRB in the near future (2038–2060), quantile-mapping (QM) bias-corrected downscaled predictors for daily precipitation and temperatures of the HadGEM2-ES GCM-model under RCP4.5- and RCP8.5-emission scenarios are used as climate drivers in the streamflow- and crop yield simulations of the SWAT-model, leading to corresponding changes in the final outcome (economic benefit) of the SLMP-tool. In fact, whereas for the historical period (1985–2004) a total annual benefit of 94.2 million US$ for all multi-crop areas in KRB is computed, there is a decrease to 88.3 million US$ and 72.1 million US$ for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, in the near future (2038–2060) prediction period. In fact, this future income decrease is due to a substantial shift from cultivation areas devoted nowadays to high-price wheat and barley in the winter season to low-price maize-covered areas in the future summers, owing to a future seasonal change of SWAT-predicted irrigation water available, i.e. less in the winter and more in the summer. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural benefit; Climate change; Karkheh basin, Iran; Optimization; SWAT-LINGO-MODSIM-PSO","Artificial intelligence; Climate models; Constrained optimization; Crops; Cultivation; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Irrigation; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Reservoirs (water); Rivers; Stream flow; Water; Water management; Watersheds; Agricultural benefit; Crop yield simulations; Daily precipitations; Distributed hydrological model; Karkheh basin, Iran; Multi-crop planning; PSO(particle swarm optimization); SWAT-LINGO-MODSIM-PSO; Climate change; surface water; agricultural management; climate change; climate effect; computer simulation; crop yield; decision support system; future prospect; numerical model; optimization; planning process; Article; barley; calibration; climate change; crop; crop management; environmental impact; environmental policy; environmental temperature; harvest; hydrology; Iran; irrigation (agriculture); maize; nonhuman; precipitation; prediction; priority journal; process optimization; river basin; seasonal variation; simulation; species cultivation; water availability; water management; water supply; wheat; agriculture; procedures; remote sensing; river; season; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; Iran; Karkheh Basin; Khuzestan; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; Agricultural Irrigation; Agriculture; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Hydrology; Iran; Models, Theoretical; Remote Sensing Technology; Rivers; Seasons; Water Supply",Article,Scopus

Using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool, detailed conservation practices (conservation tillage, contour farming, no-tillage, and terracing) are simulated to determine crop yields, sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loss of three crops (winter wheat, irrigated cotton, and pasture) by each land use unit (hydrologic response units) and location in the watershed. An economic model is used to determine the cost-minimizing choice of BMP scenarios for each land-use unit that meets 50%, 75%, and 90% reduction of sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loads and the impact of climate change on the net return to farmers. Results indicate that the effective spatial placement of BMP scenarios is not the same under different climatic conditions. The average optimal net return to farmers ranges from 170.39 to 316.32 $/acre for all the scenarios. The shadow prices vary from 2.36 to 17.78 $/ton/acre of sediment abated. Although individual BMP scenario is effective in reducing sediment loads, combined BMP scenarios achieve higher performance.

Study focus: Several studies have shown a relationship between climate change and changes in sediment yield. However, there are limited modeling applications that study this relationship at regional scales mainly due to data availability and computational cost. This study proposes a methodological framework using the SWAT+ model to predict and project sediment yield at a regional scale in data-scarce regions using global datasets. We implement a framework that (a) incorporates topographic factors from high/medium resolution DEMs (b) incorporates crop phenology data (c) introduces an areal threshold to linearize sediment yield in large model units and (d) apply a hydrological mass balance calibration. We test this methodology in the Nile Basin using a model application with (revised) and without (default) the framework under historical and future climate projections. New hydrological insights for the region: Results show improved sediment yield estimates in the revised model, both in absolute values and spatial distribution when compared to measured and reported estimates. The contemporary long term (1989 – 2019) annual mean sediment yield in the revised model was 1.79 t ha−1 yr−1 and projected to increase by 61 % (44 % more than the default estimates) in the future period (2071 – 2100), with the greatest sediment yield increase in the eastern part of the basin.

The objective of this study was to assess the impacts of climate change on streamflow and therefore on hydropower potential of the Grande river basin headwater region, Southeast Brazil. For this purpose, the SWAT model was used to simulate the hydrological behaviour of the headwaters under the Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, obtained from the Regional Climate Models Eta-HadGEM-ES and Eta-MIROC5 between the years 2007 and 2099. Through power duration curves we estimated the hypothetical average annual energy production at three hydropower plants installed in cascade in the region, being, from upstream to downstream, Camargos, Itutinga and Funil. These plants account for a potential of 277 MW. SWAT was able to simulate the streamflow of the Grande river basin headwaters and, therefore, to reproduce the observed monthly streamflow from the baseline period (1961–2005) reasonably well for all three hydropower plants. In general, the results indicated a significant streamflow reduction and therefore reductions in runoff during all the simulated periods and all radiative forcing analysed, when compared to the baseline period. Thus, these results led to reductions in hydropower potential and hence decreases of the annual energy production varying from 6.1 to 58.6% throughout the 21st Century. © 2017 Royal Meteorological Society","Eta-HadGEM-ES; Eta-MIROC5; headwater basin; hydrological simulation; hydropower potential; SWAT model","Atmospheric radiation; Climate models; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Rivers; Stream flow; Water resources; Watersheds; Eta-MIROC5; Headwater basins; Hydrological simulations; Hydropower potential; SWAT model; Climate change; climate change; computer simulation; headwater; hydroelectric power; hydroelectric power plant; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; numerical model; streamflow; twenty first century; Brazil; Rio Grande Basin [Brazil]",Article,Scopus

The data and methods they used may not be transferable to other crops and locations. On the other hand, operational large-scale systems, such as the European Commission's MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS), do not use machine learning. Machine learning is a promising method especially when large amounts of data are being collected and published. We combined agronomic principles of crop modeling with machine learning to build a machine learning baseline for large-scale crop yield forecasting. The baseline is a workflow emphasizing correctness, modularity and reusability. For correctness, we focused on designing explainable predictors or features (in relation to crop growth and development) and applying machine learning without information leakage. We created features using crop simulation outputs and weather, remote sensing and soil data from the MCYFS database. We emphasized a modular and reusable workflow to support different crops and countries with small configuration changes. The workflow can be used to run repeatable experiments (e.g. early season or end of season predictions) using standard input data to obtain reproducible results. The results serve as a starting point for further optimizations. In our case studies, we predicted yield at regional level for five crops (soft wheat, spring barley, sunflower, sugar beet, potatoes) and three countries (the Netherlands (NL), Germany (DE), France (FR)). We compared the performance with a simple method with no prediction skill, which either predicted a linear yield trend or the average of the training set. We also aggregated the predictions to the national level and compared with past MCYFS forecasts. The normalized RMSE (NRMSE) for early season predictions (30 days after planting) were comparable for NL (all crops), DE (all except soft wheat) and FR (soft wheat, spring barley, sunflower). For example, NRMSE was 7.87 for soft wheat (NL) (6.32 for MCYFS) and 8.21 for sugar beet (DE) (8.79 for MCYFS). In contrast, NRMSEs for soft wheat (DE), sugar beet (FR) and potatoes (FR) were twice as much compared to MCYFS. NRMSEs for end of season were still comparable to MCYFS for NL, but worse for DE and FR. The baseline can be improved by adding new data sources, designing more predictive features and evaluating different machine learning algorithms. The baseline will motivate the use of machine learning in large-scale crop yield forecasting. © 2020 The Authors","Crop yield prediction; Large-scale crop yield forecasting; Machine learning; Modularity; Reusability","Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Helianthus; Hordeum; Solanum tuberosum",Article,Scopus

However, not much is yet understood about the hydrologic behavior of watersheds in the Philippines in response to land cover change and climate variability. This study was designed to simulate the hydrologic responses of eight land cover and climate scenarios of Pagsanjan-Lumban Watershed (PLW) in Laguna, Quiaoit River Watershed (QRW) in Ilocos Norte, and Saug Watershed (SW) in Davao del Norte through the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Streamflow was then used to calibrate and validate the model using SUFI-2 algorithm in SWAT-CUP. The calibration exhibited a good match between observed and simulated streamflow for PLW (R2 = 0.72, NS = 0.69), QRW (R2 = 0.67, NS = 0.62), and SW (R2 = 0.78 NS = 0.77). Simulation results showed that (i) increased (decreased) precipitation in the areas also increased (decreased) water yield, surface runoff, and baseflow; (ii) the moderate shift to forest within the watershed moderately decreased runoff volume and increased evapotranspiration, which consequently decreased baseflow; (iii) urbanization resulted in lower baseflow but higher evapotranspiration; and (iv) presence of forest vegetation is associated with high infiltration and recharge; thus, lower surface runoff with higher baseflow. Hydrologic behavior, therefore, changes as it responds to changes in land cover and climate. Thus, appropriate interventions are vital to attain water security and sustainability in the watersheds. © 2018 by De La Salle University.","Climate change; Hydrologic response; Land use/cover change; Streamflow; SWAT model; SWATCUP",,Article,Scopus

This study aims to understand the impact of climate change on cotton crop change using Regional Climate Model (RCM) in the near and far future. The RCM model considered for the study is RegCM4 from CORDEX-SA experiment for the two RCP scenarios at RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. To refine these projections, we have bias-corrected the data using quantile mapping approach. This study is based on two locations: one in Hisar (mostly irrigated) and the other in Akola (mostly rainfed), located in the northern and central agro-climatic zones for cotton. The daily projected data have been summarised as 1971–2005(1990), 2006–2035(2020), 2036–2065(2050) and 2066–2095(2080). The RCM projections show good agreement with the observed climatology, but still bias exists, which is fine-tuned by bias-correction. The RCM model showed reduced diurnal temperature and night warming as it highly underestimates maximum temperature and slightly the minimum temperature. It also predicts rise in temperature at higher rates in northern than central zones. Also, the amount of rainfall is increasing in the northern region and decreasing in the central region at RCP8.5. The spatial variability is observed as the amount of rainfall is increasing in the northern irrigated region and decreasing in the central rainfed region. The rainfall intensity in Hisar is projected to increase till 2050 and a further decline in 2080. And in the central zone, it is presently higher than the northern region, but projected to decrease further from 1990 to 2080. These daily weather data were then employed in the cotton-CROPGRO model under DSSAT-CSM (v4.6) to assess its impact on future climate. The crop model has been simulated with these weather projections for the three sowing dates under rainfed, irrigated, and potential conditions. It is observed that the simulated crop yields and LAI in Akola are higher at RCP8.5 than RCP4.5, whereas in Hisar, it is lower at RCP8.5 than RCP4.5. So, in the cooler and wetter central zone, temperature may slightly rise at RCP8.5 along with increased rainfall and CO2, favouring the cotton crop. This shows the suitability of crops in this region even at RCP8.5 and far future. Whereas in the hot and dry northern agro-climatic cotton zone, it is projected that the temperature slightly increases from present at RCP4.5 and further at RCP8.5, and the amount of rainfall increases at RCP4.5 and reduces at RCP8.5. So, the crop here could stand the increased temperature at RCP4.5 and is also favoured due to increased CO2 and precipitation. But, at RCP8.5, the comparatively higher rate of increase in temperature and decreasing amount of rainfall may affect cotton crops adversely, with its maximum effects in the far future. Also, in future climate with temporal variability in the amount of precipitation and increasing temperature, late sown cotton crops are favoured, especially with proper irrigation practices in both the regions. The study embraces utilisation of RCMs and crop models to study the vulnerability of crops to climate change, which could help to assess the site-specific adaptive potential and mitigation measures for future climate. © 2022, Indian Academy of Sciences.","bias correction; Climate change; cotton; DSSAT; impacts; quantile mapping; RegCM4","adaptive management; climate change; correction; cotton; crop production; mapping; rainfed agriculture; risk assessment; Akola; Haryana; Hisar; India; Maharashtra",Article,Scopus

In this study, a Machine Learning (i.e. Random Forest, RF) based observational constraining approach is proposed for reducing the uncertainties of future maize yield projections by seven process-based crop models. Based on the observationally constrained crop models, future changes in yield average and yield variability for the period 2080-2099 are investigated for the globe and top ten producing countries. Results show that the uncertainties of crop models for projecting future changes in yield average and yield variability can be largely reduced by 62% and 52% by the RF-based constraint, respectively, while only 4% and 16% of uncertainty reduction is achieved by traditional linear regression-based constraint. Compared to the raw simulations of future change in yield average (-5.13 ± 18.19%) and yield variability (-0.24 ± 1.47%), the constrained crop models project a much higher yield loss (-34.58 ± 6.93%) and an increase in yield variability (3.15 ± 0.71%) for the globe. Regionally, the constrained models show the largest increase in yield loss magnitude in Brazil, India and Indonesia. Our results suggest more agricultural risks under climate change than previously expected after observationally constraining crop models. The results obtained in this study point to the importance for observationally constraining process crop models for robust yield projections, and highlight the added value of using Machine Learning for reducing the associated uncertainties. © 2022 The Author(s).

Such future remarkable drop in Water Table Depths may affect rice yield in the study region. The future water balance in the study area was re-simulated after replacing conventional drainage with Controlled Drainage and an increase in the drain spacing. Simulations revealed that practicing Controlled Drainage and an increase in drain spacing mitigated the future drop in Water Table Depths, thus ensuring better soil moisture conditions for rice. Therefore, Controlled Drainage approaches have the potential to cope with the adverse impacts of climate changes in the paddy fields. © 2022, University of Agriculture.

The current trend can generate favorable conditions for pests, plant diseases and changes in the interaction between pests, natural enemies and hosts. Early blight and late blight are fungal diseases produced by Alternaria and Phytophthora infestans, respectively. Both diseases cause significant economic losses every year in the Northwest Spanish potato sector. This chapter includes an analysis of interannual and seasonal evolution of meteorological parameters and the relationships with fungal pathogen levels. The aim was to evaluate the impact of climate change on these potato diseases in A Limia region. The results showed an increasing trend in temperature and a decrease in the number of rainy days, with more pronounced episodes last years. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the development of both fungal potato pathogens is strongly temperature dependent. The high Alternaria levels were accompanied by high temperatures and low mean relative humidity. The highest P. infestans levels were favored by low temperature, but high mean relative humidity and rain. Considering the daily weather data and the daily levels of airborne pathogens from the days before, it was possible to estimate the concentration of Alternaria and P. infestans with acceptable results. With the current climate forecasting for Spain, a greater intensity of the Alternaria and P. infestans epidemics is expected in potato crops. Therefore, the study and control of both epidemics can be a great challenge for the sustainable management of potato crop in the present and near future. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Climate change; Early blight; Late blight; Potato; Sustainable management",,Book Chapter,Scopus

In a previous article it was argued that there is little merit to the Syria-climate conflict thesis, including no clear evidence that drought-related migration contributed to civil war onset. Building on this earlier work, the present article investigates an issue which was not fully analysed in the previous one: the nature and causes of the pre-civil war agrarian crisis in Syria's northeast Jazira region, and especially in the governorate of Hasakah. This crisis is usually represented as rooted essentially in a severe multi-year drought which, it is claimed, led to multiple crop failures and in turn large-scale migration. Here it is argued, by contrast, that the central causes of Hasakah's agrarian crisis were long-term and structural, involving three main factors: extreme water resource degradation; deepening rural poverty; and underpinning these, specific features of Syria's and Hasakah's politics and political economy. The article contends, most notably, that the exceptional severity of Hasakah's crisis was a function of the nationwide collapse of Syria's agrarian and rentier model of state-building and development, combined with Hasakah's distinctive political geography as an ethnically contested borderland and frontier zone. I thus conclude that rather than supporting narratives of environmental scarcity-induced conflict, the Syrian case actually confirms the opposite: namely, political ecologists’ insistence on the centrality of the political, and of conflict, in causing environmental scarcities and insecurities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Drought; Frontiers; Oil; Political ecology; Syrian civil war","civil war; climate change; drought; political conflict; political economy; poverty; resource scarcity; water resource; Hasakah; Syrian Arab Republic",Article,Scopus

Forty years ago, a tree physiological research tradition in aboveground and belowground resource capture was established with questions and methods on climate-tree-soil-crop interactions in space and time that are still relevant for today’s challenges. After summarising early research contributions, we review recent literature to assess current levels of uncertainty in climate adaptation assessments in and through AF. Quantification of microclimate within and around tree canopies showed a gap between standard climate station data (designed to avoid tree influences) and the actual climate in which crop and tree meristems or livestock operates in real-world AF. Where global scenario modelling of ‘macroclimate’ change in mean annual rainfall and temperature extrapolates from climate station conditions in past decades, it ignores microclimate effects of trees. There still is a shortage of long-term phenology records to analyse tree biological responses across a wide range of species to climate variability, especially where flowering and pollination matter.

The CNRM-CM5 was selected as an appropriate model due to the higher coefficient of determination (R2) value for future the prediction of early century (2021–2045), mid-century (2046–2070), and late century (2071–2095) with baseline period of 1991–2017.

This study modeled upland rice yield responses to climate factors using multiple linear regression, boosted tree regression, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Four ANNs were explored: ANNMLP (multilayer perceptron), ANNPNN (probabilistic neural network), ANNGFF (generalized feedforward), and ANNLR (linear regression). Then the modeled rice yield function was calibrated and tested against the observed yield data and climate variables of three provinces of Burkina Faso, West Africa. The global climate model (GCM) outputs under the AR4-SR-A1B, A2, and B1 mean ensemble CO2 emissions scenarios were then downscaled and used as input of the calibrated yield response model, in order to forecast yield trends over 2052. The results are three-fold: first, rain (R = 0.402) is the most dominant climate driver in Sahel, followed by the maximum and minimum temperatures (R = -0.313 and R = -0.237, respectively), which clearly reduce yield. Second, the ANNPNN (R = 0.952, MSE = 0.033 ton/ha, NMSE = 0.109 ton/ha, MAE = 0.115 ton/ha) has a great capability in rice yield responses function modeling outperforming boosted tree (R = 0.920, MSE = 0.077 ton/ha, NMSE = 0.208 ton/ha, MAE = 0.223 ton/ha) and the multiple linear regression (R = 0.385, MSE = 0.259 ton/ha, NMSE = 0.852 ton/ha, MAE = 0.340 ton/ha). All linear models performed unsatisfactorily. Third, the projected yields showed a gap of 57.29% with the site-recorded maximum average yields over 2052. From application of ANNPNN, we anticipate that site-specific rice yield may substantially decline with climate change, as rainfall is projected to decrease while temperatures increase.

Additionally, climate extremes have recently highlighted the vulnerability of the agricultural system to climate variability. This study seeks to fill two important gaps in current knowledge: how irrigation impacts the large-scale response of crops to varying climate conditions and how we can explicitly account for uncertainty in yield response to climate. To address these, we developed a statistical model to quantitatively estimate historical and future impacts of climate change and irrigation on US county-level crop yields with uncertainty explicitly treated. Historical climate and crop yield data for 1970-2009 were used over different growing regions to fit the model, and five CMIP5 climate projections were applied to simulate future crop yield response to climate. Maize and spring wheat yields are projected to experience decreasing trends with all models in agreement. Winter wheat yields in the Northwest will see an increasing trend. Results for soybean and winter wheat in the South are more complicated, as irrigation can change the trend in projected yields. The comparison between projected crop yield time series for rainfed and irrigated cases indicates that irrigation can buffer against climate variability that could lead to negative yield anomalies. Through trend analysis of the predictors, the trend in crop yield is mainly driven by projected trends in temperature-related indices, and county-level trend analysis shows regional differences are negligible. This framework provides estimates of the impact of climate and irrigation on US crop yields for the 21st century that account for the full uncertainty of climate variables and the range of crop response. The results of this study can contribute to decision making about crop choice and water use in an uncertain future climate. © 2019 The Author(s).

This zone includes the districts such as Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Trichy and Cuddalore. These districts account for about 53% of production of paddy in the state. Increasing the production of paddy in Cauvery Delta Zone would satisfy the requirement of rice in the state on the whole. This will also have a substantial influence on both the farmer's and the nation's economy. Forecasting the production of crops beforehand could assist the farmers in improving their productivity. This necessitates the design of a precise crop yield prediction model. Crop production in agriculture is primarily determined by a variety of factors that falls under three categories: technological (agricultural techniques, managerial decisions, etc.), biological (diseases, insects, pests, etc.), and environmental (climate change, etc.). Among these factors environmental factors pose a great challenge to the decision makers in developing a precise prediction model. Hence, it is proposed to develop a suitable yield prediction model to predict the yield of paddy in Cauvery delta region considering the environmental factors along with the supplied nutrients. The proposed prediction model makes use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm which is a popular deep learning algorithm, to forecast the yield of paddy. LSTM is well known for its better prediction using time series data.

One step further is then the maximization of the agricultural economic benefits, by properly adjusting the irrigated crop area pattern to optimally use the limited amount of water available. To that avail, a sequential hydro-economic model has been developed and applied to the agriculturally intensively used Zarrine River Basin (ZRB), Iran. In the first step, the surface and groundwater resources, especially, the inflow to the Boukan Dam, as well as the potential crop yields are simulated using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model, driven by GCM/QM-downscaled climate predictions for three future 21th-century periods under three climate RCPs. While in all nine combinations consistently higher temperatures are predicted, the precipitation pattern are much more versatile, leading to corresponding changes in the future water yields. Using the basin-wide water management tool MODSIM, the SWAT-simulated water available is then optimally distributed across the different irrigation plots in the ZRB, while adhering to various environmental/demand priority constraints. MODSIM is subsequently coupled with CSPSO to optimize (maximize) the agro-economic water productivity (AEWP) of the various crops and, subsequently, the net economic benefit (NEB), using crop areas as decision variables, while respecting various crop cultivation constraints. Adhering to political food security recommendations for the country, three variants of cereal cultivation area constraints are investigated. The results indicate considerably-augmented AEWPs, resulting in a future increase of the annual NEB of ~16% to 37.4 Million USD for the 65%-cereal acreage variant, while, at the same time, the irrigation water required is reduced by ~38%. This NEB-rise is achieved by augmenting the total future crop area in the ZRB by about 47%-indicating some deficit irrigation-wherefore most of this extension will be cultivated by the high AEWP-yielding crops wheat and barley, at the expense of a tremendous reduction of alfalfa acreage. Though presently making up only small base acreages, depending on the future period/RCP, tomato- and, less so, potato- and sugar beet-cultivation areas will also be increased significantly. © 2018 by the authors.","Agro-economic water productivity; Climate change; CSPSO-MODSIM; Hydro-economic modeling; Iran; Net economic benefits; Optimal crop pattern; Zarrine River Basin","agricultural economics; agricultural production; alfalfa; climate change; crop yield; cultivation; food security; high temperature; twenty first century; water availability; water resource; water use; water use efficiency; wheat; Iran; Zarrineh River; Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Hordeum; Lycopersicon esculentum; Medicago sativa; Solanum tuberosum; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

The precise and prompt spatial categorization of the soil varieties and the forecast of crop yield rooted in the spatial big data have emerged as significant factors for the realistic purposes. In this regard, the spatially explicit crop-type information may be fruitfully utilized so as to evaluate the crop areas for a host of monitoring and decision-making applications like the crop insurance, land rental, supply-chain logistics, and the financial market forecasting. The underlying motive behind the current investigation is to effectively describe a modified support vector machine (MSVM) technique to effectively classify the soil type. The recommended crop and crop yield forecast is solely dependent on the soil type. In this regard, it is highly essential for the effective farm management to have appropriate output forecast in accordance with the amalgamation of several factors having a corresponding impact. In the document, three key functions like the big data decrease, soil categorization, and the crop recommendation including output forecast are performed. As a matter of fact, the crop changes from one farm to another on the basis of the planting dates, diversity, soil environment and the crop organization. With the result, it becomes indispensable to have an effective determination on the category of soil to be used. In the paper, the input is represented by the big data. The category of soil is ascertained by means of the procedure of the map reduce framework. The map reduction, in turn, is effectively attained with the help of the kernel principle component analysis (KPCA). Incidentally, the map reduction involves two key procedures such as the mapper and reducer. While the soil category is decided in the mapper side, the investigating procedure occurs in reducer side. Further, the innovative technique takes due consideration of the recommendation and output forecast of the crop, by elegantly employing an Optimal Artificial Neural Network classifier (OANN). In the document, the crop is recommended and the output forecast is carried out for the future years. © BEIESP.","Crop Yield prediction; KPCA; MSVM; OANN and Map reduction; Soil; Spatial big data",,Article,Scopus

The results indicated the system is more accurate for wheat relative to the other crops. Also, we found that different strategies would be useful in improving the system, depending on the crop. For winter wheat and rice, we need to improve the temperature predictions, particularly over the mid-latitudes, whereas improving rainfall predictions was more important for maize. For spring wheat and soybeans, the crop growth simulation itself should be improved.

Meanwhile, due to the complexity of agricultural systems modeling, their applications in producing practical knowledge for producers are limited. Meanwhile, deep learning techniques have been recognized as the preferred method compared to other machine learning techniques, especially when dealing with large datasets. In addition, deep learning techniques are easily adopted by non-experts due to the feature of learning ability that can automatically discover the classifications from raw data.Meanwhile, one of the drawbacks of using deep learning techniques is the training time, which can last anywhere from a couple of weeks to even a few months. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine the applicability of deep learning techniques to compute a numerical model of crop growth. In this study, an agricultural systems model known as the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) is used to evaluate the impacts of irrigation amount and time of application on crop yield. A deep learning network is utilized and trained by incorporating the large amounts of DSSAT models inputs (i.e., precipitation date, precipitation amount, irrigation date irrigation amount) and output (i.e., maize yield at the end of the growing season). However, in order to simplify the process, we combined the amount of irrigation and rainfall together and presented them in the form of the amount of water per day.

Yields forecasted (2012–2100) showed a noticeable statistically significant difference between scenarios; however, fluctuating with no substantial increase (average below 1.60 ton/ha); suggesting that the increase observed in temperatures and decrease in rains will either reduced or hindered yield to largely increase in Sahel. With no such YIELDCAST tool to support adaptation decision, Sahel will still be under the trap of the broad array of adaptation strategy, which is a trial and error, less specific and costly. The model can help anticipate adaptation decision support on-farm water management, shift to suitable planting periods, and use of improved drought resistant and short duration varieties adapted to a local weather pattern. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation decision support; Climate change; Gene-expression programming; Sahel; Upland rice; YIELDCAST","Climate change; Decision support systems; Drought; Forecasting; Gene expression; Rain; Water management; Adaptation decisions; Adaptation strategies; Climate change adaptation; Climate stressors; Decision support tools; Gene expression programming; Global climate model; Statistically significant difference; Climate models; adaptive management; carbon emission; climate change; climate modeling; crop yield; decision analysis; forecasting method; global climate; rice; water management; yield response; Bobo Dioulasso; Burkina Faso; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; Joturus pichardi",Article,Scopus

Now with the advent of satellite sensors like the MSI from Sentilnel-2 with fine spatial resolution, the possibility of generating frequent information on crop condition at field scale is increasing. This study demonstrated the combined use of high-resolution data from Sentinel-2 (10 m and 20 m); moderate-resolution data from MODIS (500 m) and coarser-resolution radiation data from INSAT-3D (4 km) for estimating yield of three major crops of India at GP and taluka level using a semi-physical model based on crop-specific radiation use efficiency. The novelty of this study lies in the data fusion approach using parameters from multiple spatial resolution of Geostationary and Lower Earth Orbiting satellites within the basic semi-physical model framework. The methodology has been demonstrated in Cuttack district of Odisha for rice; Rajkot district of Gujarat for cotton; and Indore district of MP and Fatehabad district of Haryana for wheat. We validated our result at GP, taluka and district level. At GP level, the root mean square error (RMSE) was found to be 16.5% for rice and 5.8% for wheat in Indore district. At taluka level, the RMSE was found to be 15%, 5.7%, 4.4% and 7.4% for rice, wheat in Indore district, wheat in Fatehabad district and cotton, respectively. The study concluded that high resolution remote sensing data would be of immense use for finer scale yield estimation, which can be aggregated at GP and taluka level with satisfactory accuracy (p = 95%). © 2021, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","Cotton; Crop yield estimation at gram panchayat and taluka level; MODIS; Rice; Semi-physical model; Sentinel-2; Wheat","agricultural management; cotton; crop plant; crop yield; satellite data; spatiotemporal analysis; India",Article,Scopus

In this study, a phenological approach based on a remote sensing vegetation index was explored to predict the yield in 314 counties within the US Corn Belt, divided into semi-arid and non-semi-arid regions. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data product MOD09Q1 was used to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. According to the NDVI time series, we divided the corn growing season into four growth phases, calculated phe-nological information metrics (duration and rate) for each growth phase, and obtained the maximum correlation NDVI (Max-R2). Duration and rate represent crop growth days and rate, respec-tively. Max-R2 is the NDVI value with the most significant correlation with corn yield in the NDVI time series. We built three groups of yield regression models, including univariate models using phenological metrics and Max-R2, and multivariate models using phenological metrics, and multivariate models using phenological metrics combined with Max-R2 in the whole, semi-arid, and non-semi-arid regions, respectively, and compared the performance of these models. The results show that most phenological metrics had a statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) relationship with corn yield (maximum R2 = 0.44). Models established with phenological metrics realized yield prediction before harvest in the three regions with R2 = 0.64, 0.67, and 0.72. Compared with the univariate Max-R2 models, the accuracy of models built with Max-R2 and phenology metrics improved. Thus, the phe-nology metrics obtained from MODIS-NDVI accurately reflect the corn characteristics and can be used for large-scale yield prediction. Overall, this study showed that phenology metrics derived from remote sensing vegetation indexes could be used as crop yield prediction variables and pro-vide a reference for data organization and yield prediction with physical crop significance. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we propose a methodology for the early prediction of rice yield at pixel scale combining a crop model and a deep learning model for different agricultural systems throughout South and North Korea. Initially, satellite-integrated crop models were applied to obtain a pixel-scale reference rice yield. Then, the pixel-scale reference rice yields were used as target labels in the deep learning model to leverage the advantages of crop models. Models of five different deep learning network architectures were employed to help determine the hybrid structure of long-short term memory (LSTM) and one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) layers by predicting the optimal model about two months ahead of harvest time. The suggested model showed good performance [R2 = 0.859, Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency = 0.858, root mean squared error = 0.605 Mg ha−1], with specific spatial patterns of rice yields for South and North Korea. Analysis of the relative importance of the input variables showed the water-related index and maximum temperature in North Korea and the vegetation indices and geographic variables in South Korea to be crucial for predicting rice yields.

In this research, remote sensing driven semi-empirical light use efficiency (LUE) model and a process-based crop simulation model (CSM) approach were attempted to predict cotton yield in the five districts of Maharashtra state, India. Time-series satellite data from different earth observation (EO) missions were retrieved from 2011 to 2017. Satellite-based measurements of fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) data were directly incorporated into the LUE model. The LUE model approach used observed minimum (0.07) and maximum (0.12) lint harvest index (HI) values to predict the cotton yield. On the other hand, the CSM model was parameterized with observed field management, soil, weather, and cultivar data for crop yield prediction. The inter-evaluation of models has revealed that the LUE model with HI value 0.07 (HI0.07) performed better when compared to the LUE model with HI value 0.12 (HI0.12) and CSM model. LUE model HI0.07 had shown better accuracy in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) of 154 kg ha−1 and correlation coefficient value of (R2 = 0.46) when compared with LUE model HI0.12 (RMSE 310 kg ha−1 and R2 = 0.41) and CSM model (RMSE 235 kg ha−1 and R2 = 0.38). The predicted yield from the models was found satisfactory for the normal year with acceptable accuracy. However, overestimation of yield was seen for the years affected by drought.

For CSA we will need greater resilience in agricultural systems and also greater efficiency of resource use for both adaptation and mitigation.

The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model was used to simulate hydrometeorological consequences and crop yields in the Yazoo River Basin (YRB) in northwestern Mississippi. Modeling results of streamflow and soybean and corn yields during the calibration and validation periods were consistent with the observed data. The yields of bioenergy crops were predicted using the calibrated SWAT model. In order to generate future climate change data, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab (GFDL) CM2.1 global coupled climate model was selected as a general circulation model (GCM). The output of the GFDL CM2.1 with the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B emission was downscaled by LARS-WG stochastic weather generator. Eight scenarios including bioenergy crop production and climate change were evaluated using the SWAT model. The results of this study indicate that the bioenergy crops will increase annual evapotranspiration and decrease annual surface water, water yield and streamflow. Furthermore, the future climate change scenarios showed that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations will decrease annual evapotranspiration, which eventually will lead to an increase in annual surface runoff, water yield, and streamflow. However, decreased precipitation in the future periods will be the dominant cause of a decrease in annual evapotranspiration, surface runoff, water yield, and streamflow. Comparison of all scenarios showed that climate change is likely to affect hydrometeorology more significantly than bioenergy crop production, and the scenarios of the conversion of soybean and corn to miscanthus are more significant than the switchgrass scenarios. This study will help to develop future watershed management programs related to bioenergy crop production and climate change conditions within the Yazoo River Basin, which may also be applied in other geographic areas in the country and abroad. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","GFDL CM2.1; LARS-WG; Miscanthus; SWAT; Switchgrass","assessment method; bioenergy; calibration; carbon dioxide; climate effect; climate modeling; crop production; crop yield; energy crop; environmental impact; evapotranspiration; grass; hydrometeorology; maize; model validation; numerical model; runoff; soybean; streamflow; surface water; watershed; Mississippi; United States; Yazoo Basin; Glycine max; Miscanthus; Panicum virgatum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Remote sensing is becoming increasingly important in crop yield prediction. Based on remote sensing data, great progress has been made in this field by using machine learning, especially the Deep Learning (DL) method, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Recent experiments in this area suggested that CNN can explore more spatial features and LSTM has the ability to reveal phenological characteristics, which both play an important role in crop yield prediction. However, very few experiments combining these two models for crop yield prediction have been reported. In this paper, we propose a deep CNN-LSTM model for both end-of-season and in-season soybean yield prediction in CONUS at the county-level. The model was trained by crop growth variables and environment variables, which include weather data, MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) data, and MODIS Surface Reflectance (SR) data; historical soybean yield data were employed as labels. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), all these training data were combined and transformed into histogram-based tensors for deep learning. The results of the experiment indicate that the prediction performance of the proposed CNN-LSTM model can outperform the pure CNN or LSTM model in both end-of-season and in-season. The proposed method shows great potential in improving the accuracy of yield prediction for other crops like corn, wheat, and potatoes at fine scales in the future. © 2019 by the authors.

Crop models (CMs) are powerful tools for predicting yield and water use, but they still have some limitations and uncertainties; therefore, combining them with machine learning algorithms (MLs) could improve predictions and reduce uncertainty. To that end, the DSSAT-CERES-maize model was calibrated in one location and validated in others across Egypt with varying agro-climatic zones. Following that, the dynamic model (CERES-Maize) was used for long-term simulation (1990–2020) of maize grain yield (GY) and evapotranspiration (ET) under a wide range of management and environmental factors. Detailed outputs from three growing seasons of field experiments in Egypt, as well as CERES-maize outputs, were used to train and test six machine learning algorithms (linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, and XGBoost), resulting in more than 1.5 million simulated yield and evapotranspiration scenarios. Seven warming years (i.e., 1991, 1998, 2002, 2005, 2010, 2013, and 2020) were chosen from a 31-year dataset to test MLs, while the remaining 23 years were used to train the models. The Ensemble model (super learner) and XGBoost outperform other models in predicting GY and ET for maize, as evidenced by R2 values greater than 0.82 and RRMSE less than 9%. The broad range of management practices, when averaged across all locations and 31 years of simulation, not only reduced the hazard impact of environmental factors but also increased GY and reduced ET. Moving beyond prediction and interpreting the outputs from Lasso and XGBoost, and using global and local SHAP values, we found that the most important features for predicting GY and ET are maximum temperatures, minimum temperature, available water content, soil organic carbon, irrigation, cultivars, soil texture, solar radiation, and planting date. Determining the most important features is critical for assisting farmers and agronomists in prioritizing such features over other factors in order to increase yield and resource efficiency values. The combination of CMs and ML algorithms is a powerful tool for predicting yield and water use in arid regions, which are particularly vulnerable to climate change and water scarcity. © 2022 by the authors.","DSSAT models; feature importance; hyperparameters tuning; lasso regression; random forest; super learner; water use; XGBoost","Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Environmental management; Evapotranspiration; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Organic carbon; Plants (botany); Soils; Statistical tests; Textures; DSSAT model; Feature importance; Hyper-parameter; Hyperparameter tuning; Lasso regressions; Machine learning algorithms; Random forests; Super learner; Water use; Xgboost; Forecasting; arid environment; climate change; crop yield; environmental factor; evapotranspiration; maize; soil nutrient; yield response; Egypt",Article,Scopus

Accordingly, this work aims to explore both the qualitative and quantitative nexus between climate change, nonclimatic drivers, and agroproduct yield in China. We choose lychee (Litchi chinensis Sonn.), with world's largest production in China and one of the most demanding agroproduct for climatic conditions, as the subject. A two-way fixed-effect Poisson model with robust standard error is developed based on county-level panel data in 39 main producing counties in China along with climatic and cultural festival factors from 2014 to 2019. The main conclusions are as follows: (a) the lychee culture festival, a nonclimatic driver, has negative effect on lychee yield, and this is a novel effect pathway theoretically and we verify it empirically; (b) climate changes in various phenological phases are significantly correlated to lychee yield; precipitation during the exposure phase or flowering phase has negative effect, and minimum temperature during the heading phase has positive effect, which is the first paper in this field; and (c) a new method is developed to analyze nonnegative yield and production, which could also be applied in other industries. © 2022 The Authors.

In this paper a hybrid genetic programing model integrated with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based Copula technique is developed to incorporate climate-based inputs as the predictors of cotton yield, for selected study regions: Faisalabad (31.4504 °N, 73.1350 °E), Multan (30.1984 °N, 71.4687 °E) and Nawabshah (26.2442 °N, 68.4100 °E), as important cotton growing hubs in the developing nation of Pakistan. Several different types of GP-MCMC-copula models were developed, each with the well-known copula families (i.e., Gaussian, student t, Clayton, Gumble Frank and Fischer-Hinzmann functions) to screen and utilize an optimal cotton yield forecast model for the present study region. The results of the GP-MCMC based hybrid copula model were evaluated with a standalone GP and the MCMC based copula model in accordance with statistical analysis of the predicted yield based on correlation coefficient (r), Willmott's index (WI), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE), root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) in the independent test phase. Further performance preciseness was evaluated by the Akiake Information Criterion (AIC), the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the Maximum Likelihood (MaxL) for the GP-MCMC based copula as well as the MCMC based copula model. GP-MCMC-Clayton copula model generated the most accurate result for the Multan station. For the optimal GP-MCMC-Clayton copula model, the acquired model evaluation metrics for Multan were: (LM≈0.952; RRMSE≈2.107%; RRMAE≈1.771%) followed by the MCMC based Gaussian copula model (LM≈0.895; RRMSE≈4.541%; RRMAE≈0.3.214%) and the standalone GP model (LM≈0.132; RRMSE≈23.638%; RRMAE≈22.652%), indicating the superiority of the GP-MCMC-Clayton copula model in respect to the other benchmark models. The performance of GP-MCMC based copula model was also found to be superior in the case of Faisalabad and Nawabshah station as confirmed by AIC, BIC, MaxL metrics, including a larger value of the Legates-McCabe's (LM) index, utilized in conjunction with the relative percentage RRMSE and the relative mean absolute error (RMAE). Accordingly, it is averred that the developed GP-MCMC copula model can be considered as a pertinent data-intelligent tool used for accurate prediction of cotton yield, utilizing the readily available climate datasets in agricultural regions and is of relevance to agricultural yield simulation and sectoral decision-making. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Climate data; Cotton yield; Crop yield prediction; Genetic programming; Markov Chain Monte Carlo based copula model","agricultural technology; benchmarking; climate change; cotton; crop yield; decision making; genetic algorithm; integrated approach; linear programing; Markov chain; Monte Carlo analysis; numerical model; prediction; simulation; Faisalabad; Nawabshah; Pakistan; Punjab [Pakistan]; Sind; Gossypium hirsutum",Article,Scopus

Previous studies mainly focused on the whole crop growth period while different time windows on yield prediction were still unknown. The entire growth period was separated into each month to assess their corresponding predictive ability by taking maize production (silage and grain) in Czechia. We present a thorough assessment of county-level maize yield prediction in Czechia using a machine learning algorithm (extreme learning machine (ELM)) and an extensive set of weather data and maize yields from 2002 to 2018. Results show that sunshine in June and water deficit in July were vastly influential factors for silage maize yield. The two primary climate parameters for grain maize yield are minimum temperature in September and water deficit in May. The average absolute relative deviation (AARD), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient (R2) of the proposed models are 6.565–32.148%, 1.006–1.071%, 0.641–0.716, respectively. Based on the results, silage yield will decrease by 1.367 t/ha (3.826% loss), and grain yield will increase by 0.337 t/ha (5.394% increase) when the max temperature in May increases by 2◦C.

The key to ensuring grain yield is to recognize the risks caused by climate change. In this paper, the trends of temperature and precipitation over the next thirty years in China are analysed using CMIP6 under the SSP1–2.6, SSP2–4.5 and SSP 5–8.5 climate scenarios. The resilience indicators of grain yield are proposed for the first time. We find that the higher the emission concentration is, the greater the temperature increase will be and further northward the precipitation belt will move. Meanwhile, the resilience varies across different climate zones. The temperate monsoon climate zone has a stronger resilience to adapt to climate change compared to that of other areas. The resilience of the temperate continental and plateau alpine climate zones are moderate. However, the resilience of the subtropical and tropical monsoon climates zones are poor. © Copyright © 2021 Chou, Sun, Xu, Yang, Li and Zhao.","adoption; global warming; grain yield; resilience index; risk",,Article,Scopus

As with the green revolution in the last century, plant genetics may offer concrete opportunities to increase yield and crop adaptability. However, the rate at which the threat is happening requires powering new strategies in order to meet the global food demand. In this review, we highlight major recent ‘big data’ developments from both empirical and theoretical genomics that may speed up the identification, conservation, and breeding of exotic and elite crop varieties with the potential to feed humans. We first emphasize the major bottlenecks to capture and utilize novel sources of variation in abiotic stress (i.e., heat and drought) tolerance. We argue that adaptation of crop wild relatives to dry environments could be informative on how plant phenotypes may react to a drier climate because natural selection has already tested more options than humans ever will. Because isolated pockets of cryptic diversity may still persist in remote semi-arid regions, we encourage new habitat-based population-guided collections for genebanks. We continue discussing how to systematically study abiotic stress tolerance in these crop collections of wild and landraces using geo-referencing and extensive environmental data. By uncovering the genes that underlie the tolerance adaptive trait, natural variation has the potential to be introgressed into elite cultivars. However, unlocking adaptive genetic variation hidden in related wild species and early landraces remains a major challenge for complex traits that, as abiotic stress tolerance, are polygenic (i.e., regulated by many low-effect genes). Therefore, we finish prospecting modern analytical approaches that will serve to overcome this issue. Concretely, genomic prediction, machine learning, and multi-trait gene editing, all offer innovative alternatives to speed up more accurate preand breeding efforts toward the increase in crop adaptability and yield, while matching future global food demands in the face of increased heat and drought. In order for these ‘big data’ approaches to succeed, we advocate for a trans-disciplinary approach with open-source data and long-term funding. The recent developments and perspectives discussed throughout this review ultimately aim to contribute to increased crop adaptability and yield in the face of heat waves and drought events. © 2021 by the authors.

It is, however, not well known in which regions these new plantings would be particularly favourable and if specific provenances may be better adapted to the new conditions than others. Therefore, we estimated the potential early height growth under climate conditions in 2040–2060 for 20 beech provenances across a region covering the Czech Republic and Slovakia. This Central European region is expected to experience considerably drier and warmer conditions in the future. For this exercise, we implemented a new neural network model developed from height growth information obtained from the open-access BeechCOSTe52 database. The simulations are driven by past and future climate data obtained from the WorldClim database of historical climate data and future climate projections. Simulations revealed that provenances originating from drier regions performed on average significantly better than those from regions with good water supply. Moreover, provenances originating from drier regions had a particularly large advantage in the relatively arid regions of Central Czechia and Southern Slovakia.

By using SAR data from Sentinel-1, an Artificial Neural Network-based algorithm was implemented for estimating soil moisture and monthly maps for 2018 have been generated to be compared with information derived from optical indices. Moreover, a novel drought severity index was developed and applied to available data. The index was obtained by combining vegetation soil difference index, derived from optical data, and soil moisture content derived from SAR data.

In this study, we compared the original Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and an enhanced version of SWAT model with physically based Freeze-Thaw cycle representation (SWAT-FT) for simulating future annual ET, stream flow, water yield, surface runoff, and subsurface runoff in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). SWAT-FT projected fewer frozen days than the original SWAT model due to its better representation of snow cover insulation effects. Both models derived declining trends in annual streamflow and terrestrial water yield in the late 21st century due to increased ET under warmer climate. However, these two models exhibited contrasting mechanisms underlying the streamflow decline. For original SWAT model, the decrease in surface runoff was the major driver, while for SWAT-FT, reduced subsurface runoff was the main cause. In general, the original SWAT model predicted more surface runoff and less subsurface runoff than SWAT-FT. Further geospatial inspection shows large discrepancies between these two models, particularly in the northern colder parts of the UMRB, where the maximum differences in annual surface and subsurface runoff reached 130 mm yr−1 and 140 mm yr−1, respectively.

Understanding relationship of water extraction of groundwater can lead to better watershed management. The main problem in this study is the complexity of recharge processes and limited observations in groundwater recharge in Malaysia makes it difficult to quantify. This study was done at Baung’s watershed (BW) which can be considered as an ungauged watershed. The estimation of groundwater recharge in BW was done using SWAT. However, BW cannot be calibrated due to lack of streams station availability but the uncalibrated SWAT able to provide satisfactory predictions on hydrologic budget. A framework for SWAT input data including hydrography, terrain, land-use, soil, and weather for BW was then focused in order to achieve the model simulation for ungauged basins. The results emphasize the importance and prospects of using accurate spatial input data for the physically based SWAT model. Normal condition, extreme-low precipitation and future in land-use development represented as scenarios 1, 2, and 3 were evaluated in this study. These conditions give different groundwater recharge rate as different scenarios give different impact to groundwater.

In central North America it has consisted of cropland expansion in the early 1900s, yield intensification starting in the 1930s, and the development of large irrigated areas beginning in the 1950s. The area of this study encompasses the Midwest and Great Plains of the United States not only because significant agricultural change has occurred here but also because of the significant cooling (warming hole) there in the midcentury. This study investigates the relative contribution of agricultural development and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on the observed patterns of regional changes in summer temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration using a long-term twentieth-century reanalysis dataset (CERA-20C) as boundary conditions for simulations with the MIT Regional Climate Model (MRCM). Temperatures in the Great Plains (338–438N, 958–1098W) and the Midwest (388–488N, 828–1098W) would have been significantly higher in the second half of the twentieth century without the influence of agricultural development, largely due to an increase in evaporative cooling. The simulations of precipitation changes reflect a significant influence of global SST teleconnections at decadal time scales. Numerical simulations also demonstrate the competing effects of cropland expansion and yield intensification on shaping the observed pattern of increases in precipitation. Ultimately, a combination of agricultural development and decadal variability of global sea surface temperatures (SST) explains most of the observed variability of summer temperature and precipitation during the twentieth century over central North America. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.",,"Agriculture; Climate models; Evaporative cooling systems; Evapotranspiration; Expansion; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Landforms; Oceanography; Surface waters; Agricultural development; Decadal variability; Evaporative cooling; Precipitation change; Regional climate modeling; Relative contribution; Sea surface temperature (SST); Summer temperature; Climate change; agricultural development; boundary condition; climate change; climate modeling; data set; greenhouse gas; summer; twentieth century; warming; Great Plains; Midwest; United States",Article,Scopus

Water markets can play an important role in reducing the economic losses attributed to droughts by increasing flexibility in responding to water scarcity. Climate change has increased the scarcity and uncertainty of the agricultural water supply in the Mobile River Basin, mainly in Alabama, USA, which has imposed a huge risk to crop production in the region. In this study, agricultural water productivity is used to evaluate the value of irrigation water, and an analytical framework is developed to quantify potential economic efficiency gains within the river basin if water markets were to be implemented under future hydroclimate conditions. This approach circumvents the caveats of the traditional methods of estimating irrigation water demand. The results show that agricultural water markets can reduce the adverse impacts of climate change on the overall catchment-scale agricultural output in economic terms. The scenario approach presented in this study can provide preliminary estimates of the benefits of water trading, particularly in periods of drought and under future conditions of decreasing precipitation.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of projected temperature and precipitation changes on crop yields in the Monocacy River Watershed in the Mid-Atlantic United States based on climate change scenarios. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to simulate watershed hydrology and crop yield. To evaluate the effect of future climate projections, four global climate models (GCMs) and three representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5, 6, and 8.5) were used in the SWAT model. According to all GCMs and RCPs, a warmer climate with a wetter Autumn and Spring and a drier late Summer season is anticipated by mid and late century in this region. To evaluate future management strategies, water budget and crop yields were assessed for two scenarios: current rainfed and adaptive irrigated conditions. Irrigation would improve corn yields during mid-century across all scenarios. However, prolonged irrigation would have a negative impact due to nutrients runoff on both corn and soybean yields compared to rainfed condition. Decision tree analysis indicated that corn and soybean yields are most influenced by soil moisture, temperature, and precipitation as well as the water management practice used (i.e., rainfed or irrigated). The computed values from the SWAT modeling can be used as guidelines for water resource managers in this watershed to plan for projected water shortages and manage crop yields based on projected climate change conditions. © 2020 by the authors.

This study investigates the links between the large-scale atmospheric circulation and crop yields in Europe, providing the basis to develop seasonal crop yield forecasting and thus enabling a more effective and dynamic adaptation to climate variability and change. Four dominant modes of large-scale atmospheric variability have been used: North Atlantic Oscillation, Eastern Atlantic, Scandinavian and Eastern Atlantic-Western Russia patterns. Large-scale atmospheric circulation explains on average 43% of inter-annual winter wheat yield variability, ranging between 20% and 70% across countries. As for grain maize, the average explained variability is 38%, ranging between 20% and 58%. Spatially, the skill of the developed statistical models strongly depends on the large-scale atmospheric variability impact on weather at the regional level, especially during the most sensitive growth stages of flowering and grain filling. Our results also suggest that preceding atmospheric conditions might provide an important source of predictability especially for maize yields in south-eastern Europe. Since the seasonal predictability of large-scale atmospheric patterns is generally higher than the one of surface weather variables (e.g. precipitation) in Europe, seasonal crop yield prediction could benefit from the integration of derived statistical models exploiting the dynamical seasonal forecast of large-scale atmospheric circulation. © 2017 The Author(s)","Atmospheric variability; Crop yield; Grain maize; NAO; Winter wheat","anomaly; atmospheric circulation; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; crop yield; growth; maize; North Atlantic Oscillation; regional pattern; seed; wheat; Europe; Russian Federation; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

However, the effects of soil on crop-climate responses are often ignored in crop yield prediction. We investigated the effects of soil texture and soil organic carbon concentration (SOC) on the yield responses of seven major crops (corn, winter wheat, soybean, cotton, barley, oats, rice) to growing season precipitation and temperature between 1958 and 2019 across the conterminous US. We also evaluated the effects of irrigation and groundwater depth on crop-climate responses. Crop yields were most sensitive to precipitation and temperature variability in coarse-textured soils and less responsive to these weather parameters in medium- and fine- textured soils. Increasing SOC concentration (> 2%) contributed to crop yields being less sensitive to precipitation – due to increased water retention, and less responsive to temperature – presumably due to increased buffering capacity against increased water lost through evapotranspiration. Irrigation and an intermediate depth to groundwater increase the resilience of crops to precipitation and temperature changes and these effects were also dependent on soil texture and SOC. To enhance food security for a rapidly growing global population under a changing climate, best management practices should be adopted that improve soil structure and carbon stocks that can increase soil available water storage (“Green Water”) and nutrient retention and promote energy conservation. The spatial-temporal variations of soil texture, SOC, and depth to groundwater should be considered in agricultural and ecosystem modeling to more accurately capture crop yield response to climate variations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","4 per 1000; Best management practice (BMPs); Climate change; Soil carbon stock; Soil texture; Sustainable development goals","best management practice; climate change; crop plant; crop yield; evapotranspiration; food security; groundwater; growing season; irrigation system; organic carbon; precipitation (climatology); soil carbon; yield response; United States; Glycine max; Gossypium hirsutum; Hordeum; Matthiola",Article,Scopus

Wheat yield models have been developed using linear time-trend yield and weather variables calculated over critical growth phases of the crop on agro-climatic zone basis in Haryana. The time-series wheat yield data of State Department of Agriculture (DOA) pertaining to 21 districts of Haryana categorized into four zones were classified into three groups viz., congenial, normal and adverse using k-means clustering approach. Fortnightly weather parameters corresponding to the pre-defined groups were used to obtain the weather scores for each year through discriminant function technique. The forecasting performance of zonal models developed on the basis of discriminant/weather scores and trend yield as regressors have been compared with the multiple linear regression based on wheat yield forecast models. A perusal of the results favours the use of prediction equations based on discriminant function analysis during the period of model development and the model testing period as well.","Clustering; Discriminant/weather scores; Fortnightly weather parameters; Per cent relative deviations; Regression",,Article,Scopus

This entails diversifying the agricultural system and boosting productivity of major cereal crops through development of climate‐resilient cultivars that can sustainably maintain higher yields under climate change conditions, expanding our focus to crop wild relatives, and better exploitation of underuti-lized crop species. This is facilitated by the recent developments in plant genomics, such as advances in genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation, as well as gene editing technologies, which have increased the availability of high‐quality reference genomes for various model and non‐model plant species. This has necessitated genomics‐assisted breeding of crops, including underutilized species, consequently broadening genetic variation of the available germplasm; improving the discovery of novel alleles controlling important agronomic traits; and enhancing crea-tion of new crop cultivars with improved tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses and superior nu-tritive quality. Here, therefore, we summarize these recent developments in plant genomics and their application, with particular reference to cereal crops (including underutilized species). Par-ticularly, we discuss genome sequencing approaches, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and genome‐wide association (GWAS) studies, directed mutagenesis, plant non‐coding RNAs, precise gene editing technologies such as CRISPR‐Cas9, and complementation of crop genotyping by crop phenotyping. We then conclude by providing an outlook that, as we step into the future, high‐throughput phenotyping, pan‐genomics, transposable elements analysis, and machine learning hold much promise for crop improvements related to climate resilience and nutritional superiority. © 2021 by the authors.

In addition to the role of climate variables and soil characteristics, the actual ET is influenced by dynamic crop characteristics during the growing season. Therefore, accounting for the interaction between crop growth and actual ET can significantly improve the performance of models. In this study, an efficient approach is presented for simultaneous calibration of ET and crop growth parameters for the Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) model for daily, weekly, and monthly ET. The proposed approach involves the development of an objective function based on a compounded time series comprising of scaled annual ET and crop yield data. An efficient search algorithm based on the DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm was implemented in R language to find the parameter values that minimizes the defined objective function. The simultaneous calibration approach, which utilized annual data, improved ET prediction for annual and finer time scales (25% in RMSE reduction for 3-month, 18% for monthly, 17% for 2-week, 19% for weekly, 17% for 3-day, and 13% for daily time scales). The average of absolute relative error for crop yield predictions was also reduced from 43% to 16% for the calibrated model.

The main expected expressions of climate change in Morocco include reduced rainfall, increased temperatures and intensification of extreme risks such as drought, heat waves, frost, floods, etc. Therefore, the development of methods for modeling and early prediction of crop yields in the Gharb plain, located in northwestern Morocco, is essential. Machine learning is a tool that can help make key decisions regarding crop yield prediction. The effects of climate change on the spread of autumn rainfed cereals (durum wheat, soft wheat and, barley), an important agro-food source in the Gharb plain, were assessed in this study. A multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN) and, random forest (RF) model based on the integration of drought indices derived from satellite imagery and reanalysis meteorological data. Model accuracies were calculated and compared. Correlation values suggested that yield decreases with decreasing crop and soil moisture in early spring and with higher thermal conditions near harvest. In general, all drought indices showed the best effect during the stages when yield is most photo-synthetically dynamic (spring), in contrast to the early stages of the vegetative cycle (autumn and winter). The strength of the statistical relationships found by the MLR, ANN, and RF methods were quite similar, with some improvements found by RF.

Against the background of human beings actively responding to climate change, quantitatively revealing the change and migration laws of green biomass loss (GBL) caused by drought in historical and future periods is insufficient. In this regard, we innovatively constructed a joint kNDVI-SPEI (kernel normalized difference vegetation index and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index) distribution based on copula theory to accurately capture GBL dynamic under various drought scenarios unlike previous studies conducted in a deterministic way. Taking the drought-sensitive and ecologically vulnerable Central Asia (CA) as a typical region, we verified that an average 94.4 % of region showed greater vegetation vulnerability in times of water shortage from May to October, which exhibited the greatest probability of GBL under different drought scenarios, mainly in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Significantly intensified drought due to high emissions will cause an 18.16 percentage-point increase in GBL probability in the far future (FFP, 2061–2100) compared to the near future (NFP, 2019–2060), which is much higher than in the lower-emission (0.38 %) and moderate-emission scenarios (9.82 %). In the NFP, the GBL barycenter will shift from Kazakhstan to Xinjiang, China; in the FFP, it will shift back to Kazakhstan due to the measures taken by the Chinese government to conserve energy and reduce emissions. Results illustrate that against the background of worsening drought, active climate change coping strategies can reverse the migration trajectory of the GBL barycenter caused by drought, which provides a new idea for vegetation protection research in response to global climate change. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Central Asia; Drought stress; Global climate change; Green biomass loss","Climate change; Drought; Vegetation; Water supply; Barycenters; Central Asia; Drought stress; Global climate changes; Green biomass loss; Human being; Index distribution; Kazakhstan; Normalized difference vegetation index; Vegetation response; Biomass; accuracy assessment; biomass; climate change; climate effect; drought; emission inventory; evapotranspiration; global change; global climate; precipitation (climatology); vegetation cover; vulnerability; water availability; Article; biomass; central Asia; China; climate change; climate change vulnerability; controlled study; drought; drought stress; environmental parameters; green biomass loss; Kazakhstan; kernel method; kernel normalized difference vegetation index; measurement accuracy; probability; reaction time; sensitivity analysis; standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index; trend study; Uzbekistan; vegetation dynamics; water supply; biomass; climate change; ecosystem; human; Central Asia; China; Kazakhstan; Uzbekistan; Xinjiang Uygur; water; Biomass; China; Climate Change; Droughts; Ecosystem; Humans; Water",Article,Scopus

Previously, several machine learning methods have been applied to predict crop yield using different types of variables. In this study, we propose using the Geographically Weighted Random Forest Regression (GWRFR) approach to improve crop yield prediction at the county level in the US Corn Belt. We trained the GWRFR and five other popular machine learning algorithms (Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression (DTR), and Random Forest Regression (RFR)) with the following different sets of features: (1) full length features; (2) vegetation indices; (3) gross primary production (GPP); (4) climate data; and (5) soil data. We compared the results of the GWRFR with those of the other five models. The results show that the GWRFR with full length features (R2 = 0.90 and RMSE = 0.764 MT/ha) outperforms other machine learning algorithms. For individual categories of features such as GPP, vegetation indices, climate, and soil features, the GWRFR also outperforms other models. The Moran’s I value of the residuals generated by GWRFR is smaller than that of other models, which shows that GWRFR can better address the spatial non-stationarity issue. The proposed method in this article can also be potentially used to improve yield prediction for other types of crops in other regions. © 2022 by the authors.

The goal of this study is to explore spatial and temporal variability of a summer crop (maize)and a winter crop (wheat)yields and its linkages with influential climate oscillations in the United States. The county level yield data over 1960–2016 for maize and winter wheat were aggregated into each of the 260 climate divisions in the rainfed regions of the United States, with the linear yield trend being removed. The rotated Principal Component Analysis (PCA)reveals that the first five principal components explain 79% (maize)and 72% (winter wheat)of the spatial and temporal variability of crop anomalies. The first principal component of crop yield variability is strongly associated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). The results of multiple linear regressions for predicting yield anomalies using climate indices show that, climate indices during the reproductive period of maize explained final yield better than the vegetation period (30% versus 26%), while climate indices for winter wheat during the dormant and reproductive growth periods are similar and not significant (25% versus 28%). Categorical yield forecasts using random forecast techniques show that the low (below 30th percentile)and high (above 70th percentile)yields are well predicted by climate indices. Spatially, AMO is identified as the most important predictor for maize in 46% climate divisions and for wheat in 33% climate divisions.

The data assimilation method which combined crop growth model and multi-source observed data has been proven to be the most effective method to simulate the crop growth process and predict crop yields. Based on the observed LAI, the time-series LAI data sets were obtained by using the smooth unequally spaced interpolation. With the support of amount of related data, the crop model of Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES)-Wheat can be used to simulate the growth of the winter wheat, and the particle filtering-based data assimilation strategy also could be implemented to improve the CERES-Wheat simulation process. Through the assimilation strategy, the incorporation between the observed and modeled LAIs was performed under the dynamic framework of the winter wheat growth process such that the LAI simulation was sequentially optimized, which led to optimal yield estimation. Comparing the measured the data with the assimilation and no assimilation results, it obvious showed that the yield estimations were dramatically improved after assimilation. Then considering the influence of the observed leaf area index on the assimilation process at multi-temporal scale, this paper try to analysis the uncertainty of the assimilation results from three aspects of temporal scale: First, Assimilating the observed LAI data at five kinds of temporal resolution (2-day, 4-day, 8-day, 16-day, 32-day), the results showed that the accuracy of the yield estimation tended to significantly improve as the temporal resolution of assimilating LAI increased from 32-day to 2-day. In addition, as the increasing of the temporal resolution, the computing time increased dramatically. Second, the observed LAI data was applied to assimilation with the four different stages of crop growth (green-jointing, jointing-heading, heading-mature, green-mature). The results showed that the accuracy of the yield estimation by assimilating the LAI at the stages of the green-mature (the whole growth phase) is the highest, while the accuracy during the stages from the green-jointing is the lowest. And also the accuracy during the stages from jointing-heading is the second highest. Third, the observed LAI data was used to assimilation with synthesizing the temporal resolution and the stages of crop growth (three kinds of temporal resolution (2, 4, 8 day) and four stages of crop growth). The results showed that on the premise of the optimal efficiency and accuracy, the optimal plan is to select observed LAI by using the temporal resolution of 8 day during the stages from jointing-heading. This study will be a better influence on decreasing the calculation time and improving the effect for the crop model data assimilation. © 2015 IEEE.","CERES-Wheat; Crop yield; data assimilation; LAI; multi-temporal; particle filtering","Agriculture; Bandpass filters; Food supply; Forecasting; Monte Carlo methods; Signal filtering and prediction; Uncertainty analysis; CERES-Wheat; Crop yield; Data assimilation; Multi-temporal; Particle Filtering; Crops",Conference Paper,Scopus

To increase food security, it is important to optimize agricultural yields, despite the high costs associated with factors such as supplemental feeding, pest control measures, or operating costs.

The study was carried out from 2008 to 2017. Aerobiological data were obtained with a Lanzoni VPPS-2000 volumetric sampler, following the Spanish Aerobiological Network protocol. The pollen and flower production was studied on ten vines of the Godello grapevine cultivar. A HOBO Micro Station and a MeteoGalicia station were used to obtain meteorological information. We observed the detrimental effect of rain on airborne pollen presence, and we statistically corroborated the negative effect of high temperatures on fruit set and ripening. We developed an accurate multiple regression model to forecast the grape yield, applying a Spearman’s correlation test to identify the most influential variables.

Simple linear bias correction methods are used for temperature, and non-linear corrections are used for other meteorological variables. The WOFOST and CROPWAT models are used to predict the crop yield and water requirement of cassava using the scenarios of 2030, 2050, and 2070 for the representative concentration pathway 4.5 derived from the Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG). The percentage change in crop yield predictions with and without bias corrections of meteorological variables ranges from 7.6 to 10.8%, 1.6 to 5.4%, and − 3.0 to 4.0% respectively for 2030, 2050, and 2070.

The outcome of this study indicates that raw meteorological variables directly from the climate models result over-/underestimation of yield and irrigation requirements of cassava, and the bias corrections help to issue reliable crop yield predictions. Results show zero yield reductions of cassava until 2050, and beyond that, there can be reductions in the crop yield. The gross irrigation requirements of cassava increase in the future to achieve higher productivity.

Regional climate models (RCMs) are used as tools for dynamic downscaling of climate scenarios from global climate models (GCMs) to regional scales for climate change impact studies. It is known that running an RCM is more expensive and time consuming at a higher resolution than at a lower resolution. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate how resolutions of an RCM and statistical processing of RCM data may result in differences in projected crop yield changes. We used the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT)–CERES-Wheat model to simulate yield changes of spring wheat at 13 locations across the Canadian Prairies, with climate scenarios from a Canadian RCM (CanRCM4) driven by a Canadian earth system model (CanESM2) with the forcing scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 at 25 and 50 km resolutions. Bias correction and a stochastic weather generator referred to as AAFC-WG were used as statistical processing tools to develop future climate scenarios as input to the crop model. The results showed that when changes were averaged across the locations, whether 25- or 50-km resolution CanRCM4 data were used, the projected yield changes were fairly consistent with those based on its driving GCM–CanESM2, especially if AAFC-WG was used to develop future climate scenarios.

Adverse weather drastically reduces the mustard yield. Weather variables affect the crop differently during different stages of development. Weather influence on crop yield depends not only on the magnitude of weather variables but also on weather distribution pattern over the crop growing period. Hence, developing models using weather variables for accurate and timely crop yield prediction is foremost important for crop management and planning decisions regarding storage, import, export, etc. Machine learning plays a significant role as it has a decision support tool for crop yield prediction. The models for mustard yield prediction was developed using long-term weather data during the crop growing period along with mustard yield data. Techniques used for developing the model were variable selection using stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) and artificial neural network (SMLR-ANN), variable selection using SMLR and support vector machine (SMLR-SVM), variable selection using SMLR and random forest (SMLR-RF), variable extraction using principal component analysis (PCA) and ANN (PCA-ANN), variable extraction using PCA and SVM (PCA-SVM), and variable extraction using PCA and RF (PCA-RF). Optimal combinations of the developed models were done for improving the accuracy of mustard yield prediction. Results showed that, on the basis of model accuracy parameters nRMSE, RMSE, and RPD, the PCA-SVM model performed best among all the six models developed for mustard yield prediction of study areas. Performance of mustard yield prediction done by optimum combinations of the models was better than the individual model. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Society of Biometeorology.","Artificial neural network; Random forest; Stepwise multiple linear regression; Support vector machine; Weather variables",,Article,Scopus

It not only affects the economy of nation but also has impact on the world food grain statistics. For agriculturist obtaining sustainable production of crop is always a challenge. Achieving optimum crop yield has always been a challenge for the farmer due to ever changing environmental conditions. The major reasons for unpredictability of crop yield are: land types, availability of resources, and changing nature of weather. Thus, the scientists all over the world are trying to discover techniques which can efficiently and accurately estimate the crop yield in much advance so that the farmers can take suitable actions to meet the future challenges. The main objectives of the study include: (a) Exploration of various machine learning techniques used in crop yield prediction; (b) Assessment of advanced techniques like deep learning in yield estimations; and (c) To explore the efficiency of hybridized models formed by the combination of more than one technique. The reviews done have shown good inclination towards hybrid models and deep learning techniques as means of crop yield prediction. The study also reviewed the works done by researchers in assessing the influence of various factors on crop yields and temperature and precipitation have been found to have maximum influence on the yields of different crops.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly popular in recent years for agricultural remote sensing applications such as crop yield forecasting and precision agriculture (PA). The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a low-cost UAV-based remote sensing technology for Bambara groundnut yield prediction. A multirotor UAV equipped with a near-infrared sensitive consumer-grade digital camera was used to collect image data during the 2018 growing season (April to August). Flight missions were carried out six times during critical phenological stages of the life-cycle of the monitored crop. Yield was recorded at harvest. Four vegetation indices (VIs) namely normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), and simple ratio (SR) generated from the Red-Green-Near Infrared bands were calculated using the georeferenced orthomosaic UAV images. Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient (r) and Bland–Altman testing showed a significant agreement between remotely and proximally sensed VIs. Significant and positive correlations were found between the four VIs and yield, with the strongest relationship observed between SR and yield at podfilling stage (r = 0.81, P &lt; 0.01). Multi-temporal accumulative VIs improved yield prediction significantly with the best index being ∑SR and the best interval being from podfilling to maturity (r = 0.88, P &lt; 0.01). The accumulated ∑SR from podfilling to maturity resulted in higher prediction accuracy with a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0.71, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.20 and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 14.2% than SR spectral index at a single stage (R 2 = 0.68, RMSE = 0.24, MAPE = 15.1%).

Currently, crop models are widely used for crop yield prediction. However, they are hampered by the uncertainty or similarity of input parameters when extrapolated to field scale. Data assimilation methods that combine crop models and remote sensing are the most effective methods for field yield estimation. In this study, the World Food Studies (WOFOST) model is used to simulate the growing process of spring maize. Common assimilation methods face some difficulties due to the scarce, constant, or similar nature of the input parameters. For example, yield spatial heterogeneity simulation, coexistence of common assimilation methods and the nutrient module, and time cost are relatively important limiting factors. To address the yield simulation problems at field scale, a simple yet effective method with fast algorithms is presented for assimilating the time-series HJ-1 A/B data into the WOFOST model in order to improve the spring maize yield simulation. First, the WOFOST model is calibrated and validated to obtain the precise mean yield. Second, the time-series leaf area index (LAI) is calculated from the HJ data using an empirical regression model. Third, some fast algorithms are developed to complete assimilation. Finally, several experiments are conducted in a large farmland (Hongxing) to evaluate the yield simulation results. In general, the results indicate that the proposed method reliably improves spring maize yield estimation in terms of spatial heterogeneity simulation ability and prediction accuracy without affecting the simulation efficiency. © 2016 by the authors.","Fast assimilation algorithms; Prediction accuracy; Remote sensing; Spatial heterogeneity; WOFOST model; Yield simulation","Agriculture; Crops; Decision making; Digital storage; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Time series; Assimilation algorithms; Prediction accuracy; Spatial heterogeneity; Wofost models; Yield simulation; Algorithms",Article,Scopus

Though successful, machine learning models generated within a specific spatial domain often lose their validity when directly applied to new regions. To address this issue, we designed an unsupervised adaptive domain adversarial neural network (ADANN). Specifically, through domain adversarial training, the ADANN model reduced the impact of domain shift by projecting data from different domains into the same subspace. Also, the ADANN model was designed to be trained in an adaptive way, which guaranteed the model can learn the domain-invariant features and perform accurate yield prediction simultaneously. Informative variables including time-series vegetation indices and sequential weather observations were first collected from multiple data sources and aggregated to the county level. Then, we trained the ADANN model with the extracted features and corresponding reported county-level corn yield from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Finally, the trained model was evaluated in four testing years 2016–2019. The U.S. corn belt was used as the study area and counties under study were grouped into two diverse ecological regions. The experimental results showed that the developed ADANN model had better performance than three other state-of-the-art machine learning models in both local experiments (train and test in the same region) and transfer experiments (train and test in different regions).

Yet, modeling crop yield is challenging because of the complexity of the relationships between crop growth and the interrelated predictor variables. This research work employed artificial intelligence (AI) technique for rice and potato crop yield prediction model in the region of Tarakeswar block, Hooghly District, West Bengal, for rice and potato. The major variables used were climatic factors, static soil parameters, available soil nutrient, agricultural practice parameters, farm mechanization, terrain distribution and socioeconomic condition. The analyzed datasets covered 2017 to 2018 seasons and were split into two parts with seventy percent data used for model training and the remaining thirty percent for validation. The mean rice and potato yield obtained from the seventy-farm plot location was about 4.68 t/ha and 18.67 t/ ha, whereas the artificial neural networks (ANN) model estimated with 97% accuracy and R2 value of both the crop is 0.93 and 0.94 with an RMSE of 0.29 t/ha and 1.34 t/ha, respectively. Deep neural networks (DNN) outperformed among the three model, where only support vector machine (SVM) had a sound performance for the training data but low for the validation dataset due to overfitting problem within RMSE and R2 value. The optimized DNN model produced the highest prediction accuracy 98% for rice and potato crop (RMSE = 0.20 ton/ha and 0.95 t/ ha; R2 = 0.98 and 0.97, respectively), which indicates good correlation between the field-measured crop yield and estimated yield.

There are increasing concerns with respect to how to integrate multi-source data and employ machine learning techniques to establish a simple, timely, and accurate crop yield prediction model at an administrative unit. Many previous studies were mainly focused on the whole crop growth period through expensive manual surveys, remote sensing, or climate data. However, the effect of selecting different time window on yield prediction was still unknown. Thus, we separated the whole growth period into four time windows and assessed their corresponding predictive ability by taking the major winter wheat production regions of China as an example in the study. Firstly we developed a modeling framework to integrate climate data, remote sensing data and soil data to predict winter wheat yield based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The results show that the models can accurately predict yield 1~2 months before the harvesting dates at the county level in China with an R2 &gt; 0.75 and yield error less than 10%. Support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and random forest (RF) represent the top three best methods for predicting yields among the eight typical machine learning models tested in this study. In addition, we also found that different agricultural zones and temporal training settings affect prediction accuracy. The three models perform better as more winter wheat growing season information becomes available.

With wheat being a primary and staple food crop in the Indian community, ensuring the country’s food security is crucial. In this paper, we study the prediction of wheat yield for India overall and the top wheat-producing states with a comparison. To accomplish this, we use Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) after extracting the main features by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) considering the parameters such as area under cultivation and production for the years 1962–2018. The performance is evaluated by error analyses such as RMSE, MAE, and R2 . The best-fitted MARS model is chosen using cross-validation and user-defined parameter optimization. We find that the MARS model is well suited to India as a whole and other top wheat-producing states. A comparative result is obtained on yield prediction between India overall and other states, wherein the state of Rajasthan has a better model than other major wheat-producing states.

Agricultural best management practices (BMPs) are implemented to mitigate the adverse impacts of intensive agricultural production on flow and water quality, thus can potentially protect and improve FWP services. Many studies have assessed BMP effectiveness for improving hydrology/water quality, however the impact of climate changes on BMP effectiveness for protecting FWP is poorly understood. In this study, changes in FWP under 5 BMPs and 6 projected climate change/variability scenarios, were quantified. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool was used to quantify FWP services for baseline (1975–2004) and future climates (2021–2050). We then assessed the climate change impacts on BMP effectiveness for 13 watersheds in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. The results indicated that all 5 BMP scenarios behaved similarly under the historical and future climates, generally resulting in improved FWP services compared to the baseline agricultural management. The combined BMPs was the most effective way to enhance FWP. No-tillage and cover crops performed well in improving FWP in agriculturally-dominated watersheds, while filter strips and grassed waterways had high effectiveness in non-agriculturally dominated watersheds. Results for the climate scenarios indicate that 5 BMPs under future climate were still effective compared to baseline. The increased precipitation and rising temperatures generally improved BMP effectiveness in maintaining and improving FWP services, due to increased freshwater availability under the projected future climate. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Ecosystem service; Streamflow; SWAT; Water quality","Agriculture; Ecosystems; Land use; Stream flow; Water quality; Watersheds; Agricultural best management practices; Agricultural management; Agricultural productions; Climate change impact; Ecosystem services; Rising temperatures; Soil and Water assessment tools; SWAT; Climate change; agricultural management; best management practice; climate change; ecosystem service; freshwater; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; water quality; Mississippi Basin; United States",Article,Scopus

However, past uses of these models have been criticized in part due to a failure of researchers to quantify uncertainties of crop yield prediction. We have developed a method for considering uncertainty in a crop model using a simple sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) model as a case study. A Bayesian Monte Carlo approach generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation was used to estimate model parameters, their uncertainties, and correlations among them using data from five growing seasons at four locations in Brazil where crops received adequate nutrients and good weed control. Some of the model parameters were assumed to be correlated random variables, based on the literature, and varied across their ranges of uncertainty to estimate posterior distributions of parameters. The mean parameter values, parameter ranges, and the parameter covariance-correlation matrix are inputs to this Bayesian approach, which includes a Toeplitz–Cholesky factorization to generate correlated random variable samples and then simulate a distribution of state variables on a daily time step. Correlated random simulation, based on posterior distributions of parameters, was an effective method for including uncertainty in the crop growth and yield estimates. We demonstrated that uncertainty can be reduced with respect to model structure and parameter meaning because the optimization process is heavily dependent on prior knowledge of the parameters. Uncertainty varied with environment even though distributions of parameters remained the same across all environments. © 2017 by the American Society of Agronomy 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711 USA All rights reserved.",,,Article,Scopus

The information on soil moisture content is required for irrigation scheduling, crop yield prediction, studies on weather and climate change, monitoring and forecasting extreme weather events like floods and drought, and estimation of runoff and soil erosion. The accurate and timely estimation and forecasting of soil moisture are necessary for these applications. Machine learning (ML) algorithms, like artificial neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees, random forest, and so on, are widely used for soil moisture assessment due to their ability to model nonlinear and complex relationships between variables. These algorithms are used to develop pedotransfer functions that can predict soil hydraulic properties, like available water capacity, hydraulic conductivity, soil water retention curve, and more. These algorithms are also used for the retrieval of soil moisture through remote sensing. By providing meteorological, vegetation, topographic, and historical input data about soil moisture variation, these ML algorithms can accurately forecast soil moisture after a few days. This information can be used for scheduling irrigation in the automated smart irrigation system. These algorithms are also extensively used for downscaling coarse resolution satellite-derived soil moisture products to finer spatial resolutions so that these products can be applied at the regional or watershed level. ML algorithms are contributing significantly to the progress of soil moisture research.

China contributes nearly one-fifth of the total production alone with its decreasing arable land. Timely and accurate prediction of maize yield in China is critical for ensuring global food security. Previous studies primarily used either visible or near-infrared (NIR) based vegetation indices (VIs), or climate data, or both to predict crop yield. However, other satellite data from different spectral bands have been underutilized, which contain unique information on crop growth and yield. In addition, although a joint application of multi-source data significantly improves crop yield prediction, the combinations of input variables that could achieve the best results have not been well investigated. Here we integrated optical, fluorescence, thermal satellite, and environmental data to predict county-level maize yield across four agro-ecological zones (AEZs) in China using a regression-based method (LASSO), two machine learning (ML) methods (RF and XGBoost), and deep learning (DL) network (LSTM). The results showed that combining multi-source data explained more than 75% of yield variation. Satellite data at the silking stage contributed more information than other variables, and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) had an almost equivalent performance with the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) largely due to the low signal to noise ratio and coarse spatial resolution. The extremely high temperature and vapor pressure deficit during the reproductive period were the most important climate variables affecting maize production in China. Soil properties and management factors contained extra information on crop growth conditions that cannot be fully captured by satellite and climate data.

These watersheds are increasingly facing anthropogenic and climate-related pressures that impact spatial and temporal distribution of water availability. This study evaluates temporal and spatial distribution of water availability including groundwater recharge and quality (non-point nitrate loadings) for a Himalayan watershed, namely, the Upper Yamuna watershed (part of the Ganga River basin). The watershed has an area of 11 600km2 with elevation ranging from 6300 to 600m above mean sea level. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a physically-based, time-continuous model, has been used to simulate the land phase of the hydrological cycle, to obtain streamflows, groundwater recharge, and nitrate (NO3) load distributions in various components of runoff. The hydrological SWAT model is integrated with the MODular finite difference groundwater FLOW model (MODFLOW), and Modular 3-Dimensional Multi-Species Transport model (MT3DMS), to obtain groundwater flow and NO3 transport. Validation of various modules of this integrated model has been done for sub-basins of the Upper Yamuna watershed. Results on surface runoff and groundwater levels obtained as outputs from simulation show a good comparison with the observed streamflows and groundwater levels (Nash-Sutcliffe and R2 correlations greater than +0.7). Nitrate loading obtained after nitrification, denitrification, and NO3 removal from unsaturated and shallow aquifer zones is combined with groundwater recharge. Results for nitrate modeling in groundwater aquifers are compared with observed NO3 concentration and are found to be in good agreement. The study further evaluates the sensitivity of water availability to climate change. Simulations have been made with the weather inputs of climate change scenarios of A2, B2, and A1B for end of the century. Water yield estimates under climate change scenarios have been made and implications on groundwater and groundwater quality have been assessed.

In this study, we assess the skill and the reliability of the Integrated Canadian Crop Yield Forecaster (ICCYF), a regional crop yield forecasting tool, at different temporal (i.e. 1-3 months before harvest) and spatial (i.e. census agricultural region - CAR, provincial and national) scales across Canada. A distinct feature of the ICCYF is that it generates in-season yield forecasts well before the end of the growing season and provides a probability distribution of the forecasted yields. The ICCYF integrates climate, remote sensing derived vegetation indices, soil and crop information through a physical process-based soil water budget model and statistical algorithms. The model was evaluated against yield survey data of spring wheat, barley and canola during the 1987-2012 period. Our results showed that the ICCYF performance exhibited a strong spatial pattern at both CAR and provincial scales. Model performance was better from regions with a good coverage of climate stations and a high percentage of cropped area. On average, the model coefficient of determination at CAR level was 66%, 51% and 67%, for spring wheat, barley and canola, respectively. Skilful forecasts (i.e. model efficiency index. >. 0) were achieved in 70% of the CARs for spring wheat and canola, and 43% for barley (low values observed in CAR with small harvested area). At the provincial scale, the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of the September forecasts ranged from 7% to 16%, 7% to14%, and 6% to 14% for spring wheat, barley and canola, respectively. For forecasts at the national scale, MAPE values (i.e. 8%, 5% and 9% for the three respective crops) were considerably smaller than the corresponding historical coefficients of variation (i.e. 17%, 10% and 17% for the three crops). Overall, the ICCYF performed better for spring wheat than for canola and barley at all the three spatial scales. Skilful forecasts were achieved by mid-August, giving a lead time of about 1 month before harvest and about 3-4 months before the final release of official survey results. As such, the ICCYF could be used as a complementary tool for the traditional survey method, especially in areas where it is not practical to conduct such surveys. © 2015 .","Barley; Canada; Canola; ICCYF; Probabilistic yield forecast; Spring wheat","agricultural land; agricultural modeling; climate change; crop yield; decision making; early warning system; growing season; prediction; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; statistical analysis; survey method; vegetation index; water budget; Canada; Brassica napus var. napus; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Here, we quantify the impact of this 'warming hole' on maize yields by developing alternative, no warming hole, climate scenarios that are used to drive both statistical and process-based crop models. We show that the warming hole increased maize yields by 5%-10% per year, with lower temperatures responsible for 62% of the simulated yield increase and greater precipitation responsible for the rest. The observed cooling and wetting associated with the warming hole produced increased yields through two complementary mechanisms: slower crop development which resulted in prolonged time to maturity, and lower drought stress. Our results underscore the relative lack of climate change impacts on central US maize production to date, and the potential compounded challenge that a collapse of the warming hole and climate change would create for farmers across the Corn Belt. © 2019 The Author(s).

However, these methods have been investigated less for yield prediction of some crops, such as silage maize, which can be cultivated at various times in different fields of an area. Inconsistency between fields for satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) temporal profiles can lead to some difficulties in yield prediction methods using time series of remotely sensed data. Therefore, this research has investigated silage maize yield prediction based on time series of NDVI dataset derived from Landsat 8 OLI. This paper employed advanced ML techniques including boosted regression tree (BRT), random forest regression (RFR), support vector regression, and Gaussian process regression (GPR) approaches and compared their performance with some proposed conventional regression methods. For this purpose, the NDVI values of all silage maize fields were averaged and integrated to produce a two-dimensional dataset for each year. The ML techniques were employed 100 times and their evaluation metrics were used to evaluate their performances and also analyze their stability. Finally, all the results of each ML technique were averaged to produce silage maize yields. The comparisons between the results of these methods indicate that the BRT technique, with the average R value higher than 0.87, outperforms other ones for all years. It was followed by RFR with almost same performance as GPR technique. This research demonstrated that some advanced ML approaches can predict the silage maize yield and they are less sensitive to inconsistency of NDVI time series. The results also showed that RFR was the most stable method to predict the maize yield in 2015, while it was trained using 2013-2014 dataset. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","?-support vector regression (SVR); Boosted regression tree (BRT); crop yield prediction; Gaussian process regression (GPR); Landsat 8 OLI; machine learning (ML); maize; normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series; random forest regression (RFR)","Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Crops; Decision trees; Earth (planet); Forecasting; Forestry; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Learning systems; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Satellites; Time series analysis; Vegetation; Boosted regression trees; Crop yield; Gaussian process regression; LANDSAT; maize; Normalized difference vegetation index time series; Random forests; Regression trees; Support vector regression (SVR); Vegetation mapping; Mapping; crop yield; ground penetrating radar; Landsat; maize; NDVI; prediction; remote sensing; satellite imagery; silage; support vector machine; time series analysis; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

One of the most sensitive areas to climate change is agriculture. Climate change affects precipitation, cyclones, clouds, temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels. All these factors affect plant productivity which poses another grave concern in feeding the ever-increasing population. The productivity in terms of crop yield is reduced due to a direct correlation between phenology and climate change. The reproductive organs of a plant and other parameters that define good fertility of a species are all affected by the increasing temperatures during their vegetative and reproductive phases of growth and development. Thus, this review is an attempt to understand the effect of climate change on the reproductive structures of plants and discuss the short-term and long-term adaptations in plants and agriculture as mitigation measures to combat the significant yield loss in developing countries. © 2022 Technoscience Publications.

Agriculture 4.0, as the fourth evolution in the farming technology, puts forward four essential requirements: increasing productivity, allocating resources reasonably, adapting to climate change, and avoiding food waste. As advanced information systems and Internet technologies are adopted in Agriculture 4.0, enormous farming data, such as meteorological information, soil conditions, marketing demands, and land uses, can be collected, analyzed, and processed for assisting farmers in making appropriate decisions and obtaining higher profits. Therefore, agricultural decision support systems for Agriculture 4.0 has become a very attractive topic for the research community. The objective of this paper aims at exploring the upcoming challenges of employing agricultural decision support systems in Agriculture 4.0. Future researchers may improve the decision support systems by overcoming these detected challenges. In this paper, the systematic literature review technique is used to survey thirteen representative decision support systems, including their applications for agricultural mission planning, water resources management, climate change adaptation, and food waste control. Each decision support system is analyzed under a systematic manner.

As a result, drought hydrology has been receiving much attention. A variety of concepts have been applied to modeling droughts, ranging from simplistic approaches to more complex models. It is important to understand different modeling approaches as well as their advantages and limitations. This paper, supplementing the previous paper (Mishra and Singh, 2010) where different concepts of droughts were highlighted, reviews different methodologies used for drought modeling, which include drought forecasting, probability based modeling, spatio-temporal analysis, use of Global Climate Models (GCMs) for drought scenarios, land data assimilation systems for drought modeling, and drought planning. It is found that there have been significant improvements in modeling droughts over the past three decades. Hybrid models, incorporating large scale climate indices, seem to be promising for long lead-time drought forecasting. Further research is needed to understand the spatio-temporal complexity of droughts under climate change due to changes in spatio-temporal variability of precipitation. Applications of copula based models for multivariate drought characterization seem to be promising for better drought characterization. Research on decision support systems should be advanced for issuing warnings, assessing risk, and taking precautionary measures, and the effective ways for the flow of information from decision makers to users need to be developed. Finally, some remarks are made regarding the future outlook for drought research. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change scenarios; Drought forecasting; Drought planning; Land data assimilation systems; Probability based modeling; Spatio-temporal drought analysis","Climate change scenarios; Climate index; Complex model; Decision makers; Drought planning; Global climate model; Hybrid model; Land data assimilation systems; Leadtime; Modeling approach; Precautionary measures; Spatio-temporal; Spatio-temporal complexity; Spatiotemporal analysis; Spatiotemporal variability; Water demand; Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Climate models; Data processing; Decision making; Decision support systems; Research; Risk assessment; Weather forecasting; Drought; climate change; climate modeling; data assimilation; decision support system; drought; global climate; hydrometeorology; precautionary principle; research work; spatiotemporal analysis; water demand; weather forecasting",Review,Scopus

Projecting crop yield changes under climate change requires future climate scenarios as input to crop yield models. It is widely accepted that downscaling of climate data is required to bridge the gap between large-scale global climate models (GCMs) and climate change impact models, such as crop growth models. Regional climate models (RCMs) are often used to dynamically downscale GCM simulations to smaller regional scales, while statistical methods, such as regression-based transfer functions and stochastic weather generators, are also widely employed to develop future climate scenarios for this purpose. The methods used in developing future climate scenarios often contribute to uncertainties in the projected impacts of climate change, in addition to those associated with GCMs and forcing scenarios. We employed climate scenarios from the state-of-the-art RCMs in the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP), along with climate scenarios generated by a stochastic weather generator based on climate change simulations performed by their driving GCMs, to drive the CERES-Wheat model in DSSAT to project changes in spring wheat yield on the Canadian Prairies. The future time horizon of 2041–2070 and the baseline period of 1971–2000 were considered. The projected changes showed an average increase ranging from 26 to 37 % of the baseline yield when the effects of the elevated CO2 concentration were simulated, but only up to 15 % if the elevated CO2 effect was excluded. In addition to their potential use in climate change impact assessment, the results also demonstrated that the simulated crop yield changes were fairly consistent whether future climate scenarios were derived from RCMs or they were generated by a stochastic weather generator based on the simulated climate change from the GCMs that were used to drive the RCMs, in this case, when they were compared for regional averages. © 2015, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.",,"climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; crop yield; growth response; wheat; Canada; Prairie Provinces; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

In this current research, firefly algorithm has been used for optimizing maize crop yield by considering the various constraints and risks. This research investigates the development of new firefly algorithm module for predicting the optimal climatic conditions and predicts the crop cultivation output. As the pre-processing, the maize crop cultivation data for 96 months have been collected and provided as response to Minitab software to formulate the relational equation. The collected data have been stored in the cloud using IoT and the cloud has to be updated periodically for obtaining accurate results from the algorithm. This equation has been used fitness function to deliver precise forecast of crop yield. The considered noteworthy variables are average amount of rainfall, irrigation facility and atmospheric air temperature to identify best combination which can yield higher maize crop cultivation.

Such a case is the Pinios River delta plain located in central Greece, which also constitutes a significant ecosystem. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and SEAWAT models were combined in order to simulate the impact of current water resources management practices in main groundwater budget components and groundwater salinization of the shallow aquifer developed in the area. Moreover, potential climate change impact was investigated using climate data from Regional Climate Model for two projected periods (2021–2050 and 2071–2100) and two sea level rise scenarios (increase by 0.5 and 1 m). Modeling results are providing significant insight: although the contribution of the river to groundwater inflows is significant, direct groundwater recharge from precipitation was found to be higher, while capillary rise constitutes a major part of groundwater outflows from the aquifer. Moreover, during the simulation period, groundwater flow from the aquifer to the sea were found to be higher than the inflows of seawater to the aquifer. Regarding climate change impact assessment, the results indicate that the variability in groundwater recharge posed by the high variability of precipitation during the projected periods is increasing the aquifer’s deterioration potential of both its quantity and quality status, the latter expressed by the increased groundwater Cl− concentration. This evidence becomes more significant because of the limited groundwater storage capacity of the aquifer. Concerning sea level rise, it was found to be less significant in terms of groundwater salinization impact compared to the decrease in groundwater recharge and increase in crop water needs. © 2021 by the authors.

The West African population is expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years. The responses of crops to short-term climate change is critical to the population and the decision makers tasked with food security. This leads to three questions: how will crop yields change in the near future? What influence will climate change have on crop failures? Which adaptation methods should be employed to ameliorate undesirable changes? An ensemble of near-term climate projections are used to simulate maize, millet and sorghum in West Africa in the recent historic period (1986-2005) and a near-term future when global temperatures are 1.5K above pre-industrial levels to assess the change in yield, yield variability and crop failure rate. Four crop models were used to simulate maize, millet and sorghum in West Africa in the historic and future climates. Across the majority of West Africa the maize, millet and sorghum yields are shown to fall. In the regions where yields increase, the variability also increases. This increase in variability increases the likelihood of crop failures, which are defined as yield negative anomalies beyond 1 standard deviation during the historic period. The increasing variability increases the frequency of crop failures across West Africa. The return time of crop failures falls from 8.8, 9.7 and 10.1 years to 5.2, 6.3 and 5.8 years for maize, millet and sorghum respectively. The adoption of heat-resistant cultivars and the use of captured rainwater have been investigated using one crop model as an idealized sensitivity test. The generalized doption of a cultivar resistant to high-temperature stress during flowering is shown to be more beneficial than using rainwater harvesting. © Author(s) 2018.",,"Agriculture; Climate models; Crops; Decision making; Failure analysis; Food supply; Adaptation methods; Climate projection; Global temperatures; High temperature stress; Pre-industrial levels; Rain water harvesting; Short-term climate changes; Standard deviation; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; decision making; food security; high temperature; maize; millet; sorghum; temperature effect; West Africa; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

A field experiment (2016–2018) was conducted with three conventional subsurface drainage systems to calibrate and validate the CROPGRO-canola model and project climate change impacts on winter canola growth, yield, and water use efficiency (WUE). The outputs of the general circulation model (CanESM2) were downscaled using SDSM software under three representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) for the 2021–2050 period. The DSSAT 4.7.5 crop model was adapted to simulate the responses of winter canola to the projected climate change under different planting dates. Measured phonological data, leaf area index (LAI), total dry matter (TDM), and grain yield were used to calibrate the crop model. The model showed good potential to simulate winter canola (Brassica napus cv. Hyola 401) growth and yield, with 1–2-day differences between observed and predicted phonological dates and nRMSE, d, and R2 of 12–29%, 0.89–0.99, and 0.84–0.99, respectively, across drainage systems and crop indices. Under the three RCP scenarios, climate change will reduce crop yield by 8–33% in different drainage systems at the common planting date. However, planting date management will improve canola yield and WUE by 20–64% and 19–58%, respectively, in different drainage systems, mainly due to an increased transpiration/precipitation ratio. Based on the results, proper drainage management and agronomic operations make it possible to control waterlogging and thus achieve optimal canola yield and acceptable WUE under climate change. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"assessment method; climate change; crop yield; future prospect; prediction; rainfed agriculture; transpiration",Article,Scopus

This LMDZ5B version includes a mass-flux representation of the thermal plumes or rolls of the convective boundary layer, coupled to a bi-Gaussian statistical cloud scheme, as well as a parameterization of the cold pools generated below cumulonimbus by re-evaporation of convective precipitation. The triggering and closure of deep convection are now controlled by lifting processes in the sub-cloud layer. An available lifting energy and lifting power are provided both by the thermal plumes and by the spread of cold pools. The individual parameterizations were carefully validated against the results of explicit high resolution simulations. Here we present the work done to go from those new concepts and developments to a full 3D atmospheric model, used in particular for climate change projections with the IPSL-CM5B coupled model. Based on a series of sensitivity experiments, we document the differences with the previous LMDZ5A version distinguishing the role of parameterization changes from that of model tuning. Improvements found previously in single-column simulations of case studies are confirmed in the 3D model: (1) the convective boundary layer and cumulus clouds are better represented and (2) the diurnal cycle of convective rainfall over continents is delayed by several hours, solving a longstanding problem in climate modeling. The variability of tropical rainfall is also larger in LMDZ5B at intraseasonal time-scales. Significant biases of the LMDZ5A model however remain, or are even sometimes amplified. The paper emphasizes the importance of parameterization improvements and model tuning in the frame of climate change studies as well as the new paradigm that represents the improvement of 3D climate models under the control of single-column case studies simulations. © 2012 The Author(s).","Climate change projections; Climate modeling; Deep convection; Physical parameterizations; Shallow convection","atmospheric convection; atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; climate modeling; cold pool; convective boundary layer; cumulonimbus; cumulus; diurnal variation; parameterization; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; turbulence",Article,Scopus

In this study, the ET-based indicators were computed using two different approaches: (i) a prognostic model, SoilClim, which computes the water balance based on ground weather observations and information about soil and land cover; (ii) the diagnostic Atmosphere–Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) model based primarily on remotely sensed land surface temperature data. The capability of both sets of indicators to predict yields of spring barley and winter wheat was tested using artificial neural networks (ANNs) applied to the adjusting number and timeframe of inputs during the growing season. Yield predictions based on ANNs were computed for both crops for all districts together, as well as for individual districts. The root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) between observed and predicted yields varied with date within the growing season and with the number of ANN inputs used for yield prediction. The period with the highest predictive capability started from early-June to mid-June. This optimal period for yield prediction was identifiable already at the lower number of ANN inputs, nevertheless, the accuracy of the prediction improved as more inputs were included within ANNs.The RMSE values for individual districts varied between 0.4 and 0.7 t ha–1 while R2 reached values of 0.5–0.8 during the optimal period. Results of the study demonstrated that ET-based indicators can be used for yield prediction in real time during the growing season and therefore have great potential for decision making at regional and district levels. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial neural network; Crop yield prediction; Evaporative stress index; Evapotranspiration; Spring barley; Winter wheat","Decision making; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Land surface temperature; Mean square error; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Surface waters; Crop yield prediction; Czech Republic; Evaporative stress index; Growing season; Neural-networks; Root mean square errors; Spring barley; Water balance; Winter wheat; Yield prediction; Crops; barley; crop yield; decision making; evapotranspiration; growing season; land surface; seasonal variation; surface temperature; surface water; water budget; wheat; winter; Czech Republic; Hordeum",Article,Scopus

To some extent, the prediction model for crop yields combining the crop mechanism model with statistical regression model (SRM) can improve the timeliness and robustness of the final yield prediction. In this study, the accumulated biomass (AB) simulated by the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model and multiple climate indices (e.g., climate suitability indices and extreme climate indices) were incorporated into SRM to predict the wheat yield in the North China Plain (NCP). The results showed that the prediction model based on the random forest (RF) algorithm outperformed the prediction models using other regression algorithms. The prediction for the wheat yield at SM (the period from the start of grain filling to the milky stage) based on RF can obtain a higher accuracy (r = 0.86, RMSE = 683 kg ha−1 and MAE = 498 kg ha−1). With the progression of wheat growth, the performances of yield prediction models improved gradually. The prediction of yield at FS (the period from flowering to the start of grain filling) can achieve higher precision and a longer lead time, which can be viewed as the optimum period providing the decent performance of the yield prediction and about one month’s lead time. In addition, the precision of the predicted yield for the irrigated sites was higher than that for the rainfed sites. The APSIM-simulated AB had an importance of above 30% for the last three prediction events, including FIF event (the period from floral initiation to flowering), FS event (the period from flowering to the start of grain filling) and SM event (the period from the start of grain filling to the milky stage), which ranked first in the prediction model. The climate suitability indices, with a higher rank for every prediction event, played an important role in the prediction model. The winter wheat yield in the NCP was seriously affected by the low temperature events before flowering, the high temperature events after flowering and water stress. We hope that the prediction model can be used to develop adaptation strategies to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on crop productivity and provide the data support for food security. © 2022 by the authors.","APSIM model; climate indices; machine learning; North China Plain; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

One question relates to the contribution of downscaling of climate change scenarios on the uncertainties in results obtained using impact models for agriculture. In particular, for large area or regional agricultural impact assessments, the question of bias correction is of high relevance. Relatively few studies exist looking at the quantification of the impacts of BC methods in general circulation model (GCM) and regional climate model (RCM) data on results of such impact studies. Here, we quantify the impact of different BC methods on temperature (T) and precipitation (P) from different CORDEX GCM-RCM combinations, and how the debiased T&P signal may propagate through agricultural impact models. Specifically, we estimate the impact of BC on (i) an empirical P- and fuzzy rule-based algorithm to estimate the crop planting date, and (ii) a mechanistic T&P-based approach to quantify the crop suitability index (CSI) for the main staple crops in West Africa (i.e. groundnut, maize, pearl millet, sorghum). Both approaches serve as a proxy for more complex process-based ecophysiological crop models. Depending on the choice of the BC method, the uncertainties in the assessment of the CSI can be more than twice as high compared to the uncertainties from the GCM-RCM model selection. Comparing the estimated CSI values with observed harvest area, it is found that BC generally improves the performance for models with low hit rates (<30–35%), but decreases the performance for models with relatively high hit rates (>35%). Such consequences can also be expected for process-based crop models, which are developed to operate on field-scale but are driven by coarser scale RCMs. It is concluded that such agriculturally oriented climate impact models as investigated here should be interpreted with great caution if applied without BC or relying on a single BC approach only. Rather, we suggest to include different BC approaches in the generation of climate projections for CCIS and quantify their uncertainties following a super-ensemble probabilistic assessment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bias correction; Climate change impact studies; CORDEX simulations; Crop planting date; Crop suitability; West Africa","assessment method; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; correction; downscaling; ecophysiology; empirical analysis; fuzzy mathematics; general circulation model; precipitation (climatology); sampling bias; West Africa; Pennisetum glaucum",Article,Scopus

Process-based crop models are useful tools to evaluate climate change impacts on crop productivity but are usually limited in modelling the effects of ECEs due to over-simplification or vague description of certain process and uncertainties in parameterization. In this study, we firstly developed a hybrid model by incorporating the APSIM model outputs and growth stage-specific ECEs indicators (i.e. frost, drought and heat stress)into the Random Forest (RF)model, with the multiple linear regression (MLR)model as a benchmark. The results showed that the APSIM + RF hybrid model could explain 81% of the observed yield variations in the New South Wales wheat belt of south-eastern Australia, which had a 33% improvement in modelling accuracy compared to the APSIM model alone and 19% improvement compared to the APSIM + MLR hybrid model. Drought events during the grain-filling and vegetative stages and heat events immediately prior to anthesis were identified as the three most serious ECEs causing yield losses. We then compared the APSIM + RF hybrid model with the APSIM model to estimate the effects of future climate change on wheat yield. It was interesting to find that future yield projected from single APSIM model might have a 1–10% overestimation compared to the APSIM + RF hybrid model. The APSIM + RF hybrid model indicated that we were underestimating the effects of climate change and future yield might be lower than predicted using single APSIM informed modelling due to lack of adequately accounting for ECEs-induced yield losses. Increasing heat events around anthesis and grain-filling periods were identified to be major factors causing yield losses in the future. Therefore, we conclude that including the effects of ECEs on crop yield is necessary to accurately assess climate change impacts. We expect our proposed hybrid-modelling approach can be applied to other regions and crops and offer new insights of the effects of ECEs on crop yield. © 2019","APSIM; Extreme climate events; Hybrid model; Random forest; Wheat yield","agricultural modeling; agricultural practice; agronomy; algorithm; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; drought; extreme event; growth; hybrid; machine learning; wheat; Australia; New South Wales; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

The SPEI was estimated using the climate prediction center (CPC) precipitation, and temperature dataset for the period 1981–2015 are employed. The feasibility of the RF model is validated against some other well-known ML models such as support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbors (K-NN), and bagged CART models.

The SCYP consists of an image preprocessing module (IPM) to determine crop diseases through the Google Vision API and image resizing, a crop disease diagnosis module (CDDM) based on CNN to diagnose the types and extent of crop diseases through photographs, and a crop yield prediction module (CYPM) based on ANN by using information of crop diseases, remaining time until harvest (based on the date), current temperature, humidity and precipitation (amount of snowfall) in the area, sunshine amount, ground temperature, atmospheric pressure, moisture evaporation in the ground, etc. Four experiments were conducted to verify the efficiency of the SCYP. In the CDMM, the accuracy and operation time of each model were measured using three neural network models: CNN, region-CNN(R-CNN), and you only look once (YOLO). In the CYPM, rectified linear unit (ReLU), Sigmoid, and Step activation functions were compared to measure ANN accuracy. The accuracy of CNN was about 3.5% higher than that of R-CNN and about 5.4% higher than that of YOLO. The operation time of CNN was about 37 s less than that of R-CNN and about 72 s less than that of YOLO. The CDDM had slightly less operation time, but in this paper, we prefer accuracy over operation time to diagnose crop diseases efficiently and accurately. When the activation function of the ANN used in the CYPM was ReLU, the accuracy of the ANN was 2% higher than that of Sigmoid and 7% higher than that of Step. The CYPM prediction was about 34% more accurate when using multiple diseases than when not using them. Therefore, the SCYP can predict farm yields more accurately than traditional methods. © 2019 by the authors.","ANN; CNN; Crop disease diagnosis; Image preprocessing; Yield prediction","algorithm; artificial neural network; crop yield; detection method; image processing; prediction; yield response",Article,Scopus

The novelty of this work is Borda Count based fusion strategy on the ranked features obtained from various ranking methodologies. Proposed prediction model works in three phases; in the first phase, three feature ranking approaches such as; Random Forest, Support Vector Regression-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVR-RFE) and F-Test are applied individually on the two datasets of three coastal areas and features are ranked as per the their algorithm. In the second phase; Borda Count as a fusion method has been implemented on those ranked features from the above phase to obtain top five best features. The multiquadratic activation function based Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has been used to predict the rice crop yield using those ranked features obtained from fusion based raking strategy and the number of varying features are obtained which gives prediction accuracy above 99% in the third phase of experimentation. Finally, the statistical paired T-test has been used to evaluate and validate the significance of proposed fusion based ranking prediction model.

Although the potential effects of each of these factors have been discussed in a number of separate studies, no recent synthesis has been published to provide quantitative estimates of climate change impacts on crop yields, with or without adaptation strategies. In this paper, we synthetize a broad range of experimental or modeling studies to estimate, at the global scale, crop yield changes resulting from the marginal and combined effects of temperature, CO2 concentration and precipitation, with and without adaptation strategies. Crop yield sensitivities are estimated by distinguishing between C3 and C4 crops. For C3 crops, our results show that the positive effects of adaptation (+7.25 %) and CO2 (+9% for +100 ppm) are high enough to offset the negative effects of temperature increase (-2.4 % for +1 °C), even at +4 °C. On the other hand, for maize (i.e., the only C4 plant species in our database) the somewhat low positive effect from increased CO2 concentration and the absence of a significant effect of adaptation lead to higher yield losses, in the order of -10 % for +4 °C. The minimum level of CO2 concentration increase requested to achieve a yield gain under increased temperature conditions is much higher for maize than for C3 crops, in particular for wheat. The estimated effects of adaptation are uncertain, especially for soybean and rice, but also for maize, where the absence of a significant adaptation effect is probably at least partly due to limited data availability. Our results demonstrate that CO2 effects on crop yields should not be overlooked in foresight studies on the impacts of climate change. Our analysis also highlights the importance of improving our knowledge of how effective adapation strategies are in mitigating the impact of climate change. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; CO2; Ensemble modelling; Meta-analysis; Yield","adaptive management; agricultural modeling; C4 plant; carbon dioxide; climate change; crop plant; crop yield; global perspective; meta-analysis; rainfall; strategic approach; temperature effect; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The results show that the individual RCM members as well as their ensemble employing the same driving fields exhibit different biases and show mixed results in terms of outperforming the GCM simulation of seasonal temperature and precipitation, indicating a substantial sensitivity of RCMs to regional and local processes. These biases are reduced and GCM simulations improved upon by averaging all four RCM simulations, suggesting that multi-model RCM ensembles based on different driving GCMs help to compensate systematic errors from both the nested and the driving models. This confirms the importance of the multi-model approach for improving robustness of climate change projections. Illustrative examples of such ensemble reveal that the western Sahel undergoes substantial drying in future climate projections mostly due to a decrease in peak monsoon rainfall. Copyright © 2012 I.

Most crop models are single column models, which require individual weather inputs for each site of interest. The objectives of this study were to develop a weather data service client that prepares weather input files for a crop growth model and to examine its application to yield prediction at a national scale. The weather data service client downloads daily weather data from the web-based weather data service portal operated by the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA). The client also prepares weather input files for the ORYZA 2000 model at minimum effort. In total, 4950 input files were prepared to predict rice yield in 2011 and 2012 using the weather data service client. To prepare nearly 5000 weather input files, it would take more than a month for a skilled person to download weather data from the KMA database and to reorganize those data to the input data format for the ORYZA 2000 model manually.

In this situation, NDVI based crop vegetation parameter described a better relationship with crop yield prediction. NDVI values were acquired from optical Sentinel 2B images during a specific phenological time in 2019 and 2020. Fifty agricultural plots are occupied in an area of 300ha for both rice (Kharif) and potato (Rabi) crops, in Tarakeswar Block, Hooghly district, West Bengal, India. The ordinary kriging technique was used to produce NDVI prediction maps using Arc GIS 10.7 software. For validation of NDVI and conforming crop yield, both the crops were verified through geostatistical techniques with the lowest RMSE values. The positive coefficient of correlation between NDVI and crop yield was found as r2=0.406 for NDVI_rice and r2=0.692 for NDVI_potato, respectively. Further, at semivariograms analysis the lowest nugget-to-sill ratio found 2.51% for rice yield and 1.52% for potato yield, respectively, described the strong spatial autocorrelation. In the other hand, the highest nugget-to-sill ratio found 11.41% for NDVI_rice and 25.52% for NDVI_potato, respectively, representing moderate to strong spatial dependence. The outcome of this research proposed that NDVI is a good predictor of crop yield within-field management zones for sustainable agricultural planning. © 2022 IEEE.","and potato; geostatistical environment; NDVI; Ordinary Kriging; rice; yield prediction","Forecasting; Geographic information systems; Interpolation; Remote sensing; And potato; Crop yield; Geostatistical; Geostatistical environment; NDVI; Ordinary kriging; Potato yield; Rice; Rice yield; Yield prediction; Crops",Conference Paper,Scopus

Incorporation of spatially correlated adjacent effects in forecasting models in general, results in accurate forecast. The Space Time Autoregressive Moving Average (STARMA) is the most popular class of model in linear spatiotemporal time series modelling. However, STARMA cannot process nonlinear spatiotemporal relationships in datasets. Alternately, Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) is a most popular machine learning algorithm to model the nonlinear pattern in data. To overcome these limitations, two-stage STARMA approach was developed to predict rice yield in some of the most intensive national rice agroecosystems in India. The Mean Absolute Percentage Errors value of proposed STARMA-II approach is lower compared to Autoregressive Moving Average (ARIMA) and STARMA model in all examined districts, while the Diebold-Mariano test confirmed that STARMA-II model is significantly different from classical approaches. The proposed STARMA-II approach is promising alternative to classical linear and nonlinear spatiotemporal time series models for estimating mixed linear and nonlinear patterns and can be advanced tool for mid-to-long-term sustainable planning and management of crop yields and patterns in agroecosystems, i.e., food supply and demand from local to regional levels. © 2021 by the authors.

Its main purpose is reducing the risk in the decision-making process affecting the yield in terms of quantity and quality. The aim of the following study was to generate a linear and non-linear model to forecast the tuber yield of three very early potato cultivars: Arielle, Riviera, and Viviana. In order to achieve the set goal of the study, data from the period 2010–2017 were collected, coming from official varietal experiments carried out in northern and northwestern Poland. The linear model has been created based on multiple linear regression analysis (MLR), while the non-linear model has been built using artificial neural networks (ANN). The created models can predict the yield of very early potato varieties on 20th June. Agronomic, phytophenological, and meteorological data were used to prepare the models, and the correctness of their operation was verified on the basis of separate sets of data not participating in the construc-tion of the models. For the proper validation of the model, six forecast error metrics were used: i.e., global relative approximation error (RAE), root mean square error (RMS), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). As a result of the conducted analyses, the forecast error results for most models did not exceed 15% of MAPE. The predictive neural model NY1 was characterized by better values of quality measures and ex post forecast errors than the regression model RY1. © 2021 by the authors.

The use of Earth Observation (EO) data allows crop monitoring at a range of spatial scales, but can be hampered by limitations in the data. Crop growth modelling, on the other hand, can be used to simulate the physiological processes that result in crop development. Data assimilation (DA) provides a way of blending the monitoring properties of EO data with the predictive and explanatory abilities of crop growth models. In this paper, we first provide a critique of both the advantages and disadvantages of both EO data and crop growth models. We use this to introduce a solid and robust framework for DA, where different DA methods are shown to be derived from taking different assumptions in solving for the a posteriori probability density function (pdf) using Bayes’ rule. This treatment allows us to provide some recommendation on the choice of DA method for particular applications. We comment on current computational challenges in scaling DA applications to large spatial scales.

Theoretically, NDVI for this period can be used as a proxy of general weedness of crops.

El Niño is the leading mode of SST interannual variability, and its impacts extend worldwide. Nevertheless, the predictability of these impacts is controversial, especially those associated with European climate variability, which have been found to be non-stationary and non-linear. The present study shows how potential crop yield obtained from reanalysis data and crop models serves as an alternative and more effective index of El Niño teleconnections because it integrates the nonlinearities between the climate variables in a unique time series. The relationships between El Niño and crop yield anomalies are more significant than the individual contributions of each of the atmospheric variables used as input in the crop model. Additionally, the non-stationarities between El Niño and European climate variability are more clearly detected when analyzing crop-yield variability. The understanding of this relationship allows for some predictability up to one year before the crop is harvested. This predictability is not constant, but depends on both high and low frequency modulation. These findings enhance the importance of crop models for impact studies, for the improvement of crop forecasting, and as generators of a climate variability index (the potential yield) for analyzing climate variability and change. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Bioclimatic index; Crop forecasting; Crop model; El Niño teleconnections in Europe; Potential yield; Seasonal crop yield prediction","agricultural management; annual variation; bioclimatology; climate modeling; climate prediction; climate variation; crop yield; El Nino; forecasting method; nonlinearity; crop improvement; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; teleconnection; Europe",Review,Scopus

This paper first investigates an innovative approach of yield forecasting using a dynamic factor model. Based on the proposed approach, we then design an enhanced weather index-based insurance (IBI) policy. The dynamic factor approach is motivated by its ability to effectively summarize the information in a large set of explanatory variables with common factors of a much lower dimension. This makes it possible to use an extensive set of variables in crop yield prediction without worrying about identification issues. Using both county-level and state-level crop production data from the state of Illinois, U.S., the empirical results show that the dynamic factor approach produces more accurate in- and out-of-sample forecasting results compared to the classical statistical models. The empirical results also support that the proposed IBI policy based on the dynamic forecasting model has small basis risk. This, in turn, greatly improves the IBI's hedge effectiveness against agricultural production as well as increases its practicality as an insurance policy for agriculture. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Basis risk; Crop yield forecasting; Dimension reduction; Factor model; Index-based insurance ‘",,Article,Scopus

We jointly model multiple functional predictors that are cross-correlated using multivariate functional principal component analysis (mFPCA), and model the nonparametric effects of the principal component scores as additive components in the PLFAM. To address the high-dimensional nature of functional data, we let the number of mFPCA components diverge to infinity with the sample size, and adopt the component selection and smoothing operator (COSSO) penalty to select relevant components and regularize the fitting. A fundamental difference between our framework and the existing high-dimensional additive models is that the mFPCA scores are estimated with error, and the magnitude of measurement error increases with the order of mFPCA. We establish the asymptotic convergence rate for our estimator, while allowing the number of components diverge. When the number of additive components is fixed, we also establish the asymptotic distribution for the partially linear coefficients. The practical performance of the proposed methods is illustrated via simulation studies and a crop yield prediction application.

Results show that nationally averaged corn and soybean yields exhibit large interannual variability of 21% and 22%, of which 35% and 32% can be significantly explained by T and P, respectively. By including R, an additional of 5% in variability can be explained for both crops. Using partial regression analyses, we find that studies that ignore the covariability among T, P, and R can substantially overestimate the sensitivity of crop yields to a single climate factor at the county scale.

SWAT model was run using observed data and then calibrated using observed streamflow of Akeru watershed, Warangal district, India. The R2 and NSE values for calibration (0.72 and 0.84, respectively) and validation periods (0.7 and 0.56, respectively) indicated a significant correlation between observed and simulated streamflow. Then the model was run for historical and future scenarios (early, mid, and end of the 21st century) for four RCMs. Variables such as rainfall, surface runoff, water yield, evapotranspiration, and intensity of rainfall showed an increasing trend under future scenarios, while crop yields (corn, cotton and rice) showed a decreasing trend. The models predicted an increase in the extremity of rainfall events, especially in the months of July and August, for the mid and end of the 21st century. The results showed that the production of cotton is under threat in the district in future.

Meteorological outputs of the seasonal prediction system were used in a crop yield model to assess the performance and usefulness of such a system for crop yield forecasting. An innovative method for supplying s easonal forecast information to crop simulation models was developed. It consisted in running a crop model from each individual downscaled member output of climate models. An ensemble of crop yield was obtained and a probability distribution function (PDF) was derived. Preliminary results of wheat yield simulations in Europe using downscaled DEMETER seasonal weather forecasts suggest that reliable crop yield predictions can be obtained using an ensemble multi-model approach. When compared to the operational system, for the same level of accuracy, earlier crop forecasts are obtained with the DEMETER system. Furthermore, PDFs of wheat yield provide information on both the yield anomaly and the uncertainty of the forecast. Based on the spread of the PDF, the user can directly quantify the benefits and risk of taking weather-sensitive decisions. It is show n that the use of ensembles of seasonal weather forecast brings additional information for the crop yield forecasts and therefore has valuable benefit for decision-making in the management of European Union agricultural production.

County-level corn phenology varies spatially and interannually across the Corn Belt in the United States, where precipitation and heat stress presents a temporal pattern among growth phases (GPs) and vary interannually. In this study, we developed a long short-term memory (LSTM) model that integrates heterogeneous crop phenology, meteorology, and remote sensing data to estimate county-level corn yields. By conflating heterogeneous phenology-based remote sensing and meteorological indices, the LSTM model accounted for 76% of yield variations across the Corn Belt, improved from 39% of yield variations explained by phenology-based meteorological indices alone. The LSTM model outperformed least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and random forest (RF) approaches for end-of-the-season yield estimation, as a result of its recurrent neural network structure that can incorporate cumulative and nonlinear relationships between corn yield and environmental factors. The results showed that the period from silking to dough was most critical for crop yield estimation. The LSTM model presented a robust yield estimation under extreme weather events in 2012, which reduced the root-mean-square error to 1.47 Mg/ha from 1.93 Mg/ha for LASSO and 2.43 Mg/ha for RF. The LSTM model has the capability to learn general patterns from high-dimensional (spectral, spatial, and temporal) input features to achieve a robust county-level crop yield estimation.

We examined responses of nitrate loading to climate change in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) with an enhanced Soil and Water Assessment Tool with physically based Freeze-Thaw cycle representation (SWAT-FT), as compared with the original SWAT model that employs an empirical equation. Driven by future climate projections from five General Circulation Models (GCMs) from 1960 to 2099 under the Representative Concentrations Pathways (RCP) 8.5 scenario, we analyzed changes in riverine nitrate loadings, as well as terrestrial surface and subsurface contributions of the UMRB in the 21st century relative to the baseline period of 1960–1999. By the end of the 21st century, the original SWAT model predicted about a 50% increase in riverine nitrate loadings which is nearly twice as much as that estimated by SWAT-FT (ca. 25%). Such a large difference in projected nitrate changes can potentially mislead mitigation strategies that aim to reduce nitrogen runoff from the UMRB. Further analysis shows that the difference between the original SWAT model and SWAT-FT led to substantial discrepancies in the spatial distribution of surface and subsurface nitrate loadings in the UMRB. In general, SWAT-FT predicted more nitrate leaching for northwestern parts of the UMRB which are more sensitive to freeze-thaw cycle, mainly because SWAT-FT simulated less frequent frozen soils.

This attribute is particularly important as the region also plays a key role in the production of bioenergy feedstock. This study focuses on potential change in streamflow, sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus due to climate change and land management practices in the South Fork Iowa River (SFIR) watershed, Iowa. The watershed is covered primarily with annual crops (corn and soybeans). With cropland conversion to switchgrass, stover harvest, and implementation of best management practices (BMPs) (such as establishing riparian buffers and applying cover crops), significant reductions in nutrients were observed in the SFIR watershed under historical climate and future climate scenarios. Under a historical climate scenario, suspended sediment (SS), total nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) at the outlet point of the SFIR watershed could decrease by up to 56.7%, 32.0%, and 16.5%, respectively, compared with current land use when a portion of the cropland is converted to switchgrass and a cover crop is in place. Climate change could cause increases of 9.7% in SS, 4.1% in N, and 7.2% in P compared to current land use. Under future climate scenarios, nutrients including SS, N, and P were reduced through land management and practices and BMPs by up to 54.0% (SS), 30.4% (N), and 7.1% (P). Water footprint analysis further revealed changes in green water that are highly dependent on land management scenarios. The study highlights the versatile approaches in landscape management that are available to address climate change adaptation and acknowledged the complex nature of different perspectives in water sustainability.

With the wider adoption of precision agriculture - an agriculture management strategy that involves gathering, processing and analyzing temporal, spatial and individual data - in both developed and developing countries, there is an increasing opportunity to harness accumulating, shareable, big data using artificial intelligence (AI) methods, collected from weather stations, field sensor networks, Internet-of-Things devices, unmanned aerial vehicles, and Earth observational satellites. This requires smart algorithms tailored to agricultural data types, integrated into digital solutions that are viable, flexible, and scalable for wide deployment for a wide variety of agricultural users and decision-makers. We discuss a novel AI approach that addresses the real-world problem of developing a viable solution for reliably, timely, and cost-effectively forecasting crop status across large agricultural regions using Earth observational information in near-real-time. Our approach is based on extracting time-conditioned topological features which characterize complex spatio-temporal dependencies between crop production regions and integrating such topological signatures into Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). We discuss utility and limitations of the resulting zigzag persistence-based LSTM (ZZTop-LSTM) as a new tool for developing more informed crop insurance rate-making and accurate tracking of changing risk exposures and vulnerabilities within insurance risk areas.

Of all input data for WXGEN, precipitation is critical due to its sensitivity to the number of wet days. Since global climate model (GCM) data tend to have excessive wet days, use of GCM precipitation data for WXGEN may cause errors in the estimation of climate variables and therefore SWAT predictions. To examine such impacts of GCM data, we prepared two climate data for SWAT using WXGEN with both the original GCM data with the excessive number of wet days (EGCM) and the processed GCM data with the reasonable number of wet days (RGCM). We then compared SWAT simulations from EGCM and RGCM. Results show that because of the excessive wet days in EGCM, solar radiation generated by WXGEN was underestimated, subsequently leading to 143 mm lower ET and 0.6-0.8 m3/s greater streamflow compared to the simulations from RGCM. Simulated crop biomass under EGCM was smaller than RGCM due to less solar radiation. Although use of WXGEN is increasing in projecting climate change impacts using SWAT, potential errors from the combination of WXGEN and GCM have not well investigated. Our findings clearly demonstrate that GCM bias (excessive wet days) leads WXGEN to generate inaccurate climate data, resulting in unreasonable SWAT predictions. Thus, GCM data should be carefully processed to use them for WXGEN. © 2018 by the authors.","Excessive wet days; GCM bias; SWAT; WXGEN","Climate change; Solar radiation; Climate change impact; Excessive wet days; GCM bias; Global circulation model; Global climate model; Soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; WXGEN; Climate models; climate effect; climate modeling; comparative study; hydrological modeling; prediction; soil and water assessment tool; wet season",Article,Scopus

It corrects the complete distribution, but does not correct for errors in the annual cycle. Therefore, QM is often applied separately to temporal subsamples of the data (e.g. each calendar month), which reduces the calibration sample size. The question arises whether this sample size reduction negates the benefit from applying QM to temporal subsamples. We applied four QM methods in a cross-validation approach to 40 years of daily precipitation data from 10 regional climate model (RCM) hindcast runs, without and with (semi-annual, seasonal, and monthly) subsampling. QM subsampling improved the BC of daily RCM precipitation; less distinct for independent data but considerably for the calibration data. The optimal subsampling timescale for the correction of independent data depended on the chosen QM method and ranged between semi-annual and monthly.

Precisely predicting rice yields are of vital importance to ensure the food security in countries like China, where rice accounts for one-fifth of the total agricultural production. Previous studies found that the rice yields had been significantly impacted by climate change. In addition, phenological variables were found to be important factors concerning rice yields due to its fundamental role in carbon allocation between plant organs, but its impacts on rice yields were seldom evaluated. In this study, eleven combinations of phenology, climate and geography data were tested to predict the site-based rice yields using a traditional regression-based method (MLR, multiple linear regression), and more advanced three machine learning (ML) methods: backpropagation neural network (BP), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). The results showed that ML methods were more precise than MLR method. The combination using the integrated phenology, climate during growing season and geographical information was better for yields predictions than other combinations across the ML methods, e.g. the difference RMSE (R2) between prediction and observed rice yields were 800 (0.24), 737 (0.33), and 744 (0.31) kg/ha for BP, SVM and RF, respectively. The SVM had achieved the highest precisions in yield predictions and the phenological variables substantially improved the accuracy of yield predictions, and the relative importance of phenological variables were even similar as climatic variables.

The high resolution of output provided by Regional Climate Models (RCMs) is expected to be a suitable tool to describe regional and local climatic features, although their simulation results may still present biases. For these reasons, we compared several post-processing methods to correct or reduce the biases of RCM simulations from the ENSEMBLES project for the IP. The bias-corrected datasets were also evaluated in terms of their applicability and consequences in improving the results of a crop model to simulate maize growth and development at two IP locations, using this crop as a reference for summer cropping systems in the region. The use of bias-corrected climate runs improved crop phenology and yield simulation overall and reduced the inter-model variability and thus the uncertainty. The number of observational stations underlying each reference observational dataset used to correct the bias affected the correction performance. Although no single technique showed to be the best one, some methods proved to be more adequate for small initial biases, while others were useful when initial biases were so large as to prevent data application for impact studies.

There is limited research regarding the application of these mathematical models for the prediction of rapeseed yield and quality. A four-year study (2015–2018) was carried out in the Republic of Serbia with 40 winter rapeseed genotypes. The field trial was designed as a randomized complete block design in three replications. ANN, based on the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno iterative algorithm, and RFR models were used for prediction of seed yield, oil and protein yield, oil and protein content, and 1000 seed weight, based on the year of production and genotype. The best production year for rapeseed cultivation was 2016, when the highest seed and oil yield were achieved, 2994 kg/ha and 1402 kg/ha, respectively.

This study developed a spatial disaggregation method using improved spatial weights generated from machine learning. When applied to Chinese maize yield, extreme gradient boosting (XGB) derived the best prediction results, with a cross-validation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.81 at the municipal level. The disaggregated yield at 1 km grids could explain 54% of the variance of the county-level statistical yield, which is superior to the existing gridded maize yield dataset in China. At the site level, the disaggregated yields also showed much better agreement with observations than the existing gridded maize yield dataset.

We focus on the six climatic factors that affect crops growth, including temperature, humidity, illumination, carbon dioxide concentration, soil temperature and soil humidity, and propose a GCP_lstm model for greenhouse climate prediction. The climate change in greenhouse is nonlinear, so we use long short-term memory (LSTM) model to capture the dependence between historical climate data. Moreover, the short-term climate has a greater impact on the future trend of greenhouse climate change. Therefore, we added a 5-min time sliding window through the analysis experiment. In addition, sensors sometimes collect wrong climate data. Based on the existence of abnormal data, our model still has good robustness. We experienced our method on the data sets of three vegetables: tomato, cucumber and pepper. The comparison shows that our method is better than other comparison models. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","climate prediction; greenhouse; LSTM; sliding window","Brain; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Crops; Disasters; Forecasting; Greenhouses; Long short-term memory; Predictive analytics; Vegetables; Carbon dioxide concentrations; Climatic factors; Comparison models; Greenhouse climates; Natural disasters; Short term memory; Time sliding windows; Vegetables and fruits; Climate models",Article,Scopus

To explore the implications of nonstationary drought risk, this study combined a calibrated, regional-scale hydrological model with statistically downscaled climate projections and standardized drought indices to identify intra-annual patterns in the response of meteorological, soil moisture, and hydrological drought to climate change. We focus on a historically water-rich, highly agricultural watershed in the US Midwest-theWabash River Basin. The results show likely increases in the frequency of soil moisture and hydrological drought, despite minimal changes in the frequency of meteorological drought. We use multiple linear regression models to interpret these results in the context of climate warming and show that increasing temperatures amplify soil moisture and hydrological drought, with the same amount of precipitation yielding significantly lower soil moisture and significantly lower runoff in the future than in the past. The novel methodology presented in this study can be transferred to other regions and used to understand how the relationship between meteorological drought and soil moisture/hydrological drought will change under continued climate warming. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Drought; Soil moisture; Streamflow; SWAT","Climate models; Drought; Linear regression; Soil moisture; Stream flow; Watersheds; Agricultural watersheds; Climate projection; Hydrological droughts; Hydrological modeling; Increasing temperatures; Meteorological drought; Multiple linear regression models; SWAT; Climate change; climate change; drought; hydrological modeling; runoff; soil and water assessment tool; soil moisture; streamflow; twenty first century; watershed; Midwest; North America; United States; Wabash River",Article,Scopus

Even though there has been a significant technological advancement in the field of agricultural crops production and management, farmers in developing countries still follow the traditional methods of farming which at many times leads them a loss. Moreover, they don't know the correct market value of their crops, and distributors befool them with the price and value. On the other hand, in times of price hikes and crisis, due to the proper channel government failed to buy crops from them. This paper aims to analyze the primitive approach of cultivation and develop a model for crop prediction using machine learning and provide a model for proper crops management after production. We propose an intelligent system that can predict the best possible crops only by providing the present location of a farmer, the overall guideline from soil preparation to crop yielding, and the systemic approach of crops marketing from farmer to consumer. We used Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression and Voting Regression techniques for crop yield prediction and used the real-time data of climate, weather, and soil for the specific region.

Crop selection is depended on several factors like climate, soil nature, market etc. Majorly crop yield production depends on weather conditions and soil types. Yield anticipating is essential for farmers nowadays, which especially adds to the appropriate selection of yield for sowing. There is no framework set up to recommend farmers what type of crops to develop. It is an essential and challenging task to take right farming decisions at a future steady cost and yield balance. In this article, we proposed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for rice crop yield prediction by utilizing weather parameters like rainfall, temperature, sunshine hours and evapotranspiration. Generally, Default-ANN has only one hidden layer but in this work, we designed a Personalized Artificial Neural Network (P-ANN) approach by varying number of hidden layers, number of neurons and learning rate. P-ANN model accuracy is computed in terms of R-Square (R2) and Percentage Forecast Error (PFE). Outcomes demonstrate that P-ANN model performs precisely with a greater R2 and smaller PFE values compared with existing methods.

The major objective of the study is to assess changes in the future water balance by investigating the independent and integrated impacts of climate and land use changes using SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model in a part of the Narmada river basin in Madhya Pradesh, India. This includes the sub-objectives of future projection of rainfall and minimum and maximum temperatures by LS-SVM (Least Square Support Vector Machine) and SDSM (Statistical Downscaling Model) models to estimate climate change impact, and prediction of land use change of the basin area by the Markov Chain model. The present and future climate of the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s have been projected along with the past, present and future land use projection (1990, 2000, 2011, 2020 and 2050). The individual and combined effects on water balance have been shown in 12 sub-watersheds (SW) of the basin projecting increased water yield and decreased ET in the future. Individual impact of climate change shows high water yield, surface runoff and ET, while the individual impact of land use change shows increased water yield and surface runoff but decreased ET in the future. The SW 1–7 indicate comparatively higher surface runoff and water yield due to the presence of bare lands, agricultural lands and settlements and lower ET, while southern SW of 8–12 show low water yield and surface runoff but higher ET due to the presence of more vegetation and forest areas.

The evaporation fraction, calculated as a function of the evapotranspiration and net radiation over heterogeneous land surface, is used as a drought indicator in this study, where areas with low evaporation fraction are under drought danger. A two-source energy balance model has been applied to calculate the fluxes arising from the heterogeneous target, vegetation and soil. The fluxes have been retrieved from the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR2) on board the European Research Satellite (ERS2). The main advantage of the algorithm is the separation of the canopy and soil fluxes. The fluxes have been calculated as a function of the aerodynamic temperatures of the components of the surface (vegetation and soil), retrieved from the ATSR2 satellite data. The relationship between canopy biophysical properties and evaporation are examined, using the ATSR2 observations. All variables are retrieved from the ATSR2 satellite data corrected for the atmospheric effects.

Field-scale models have increased our understanding of rice yield and its estimation under theoretical environmental conditions. However, they offer little information on spatial variability effects on farm-scale yield. Remote Sensing (RS) is a useful tool to upscale yield estimates from farm scales to regional levels. Much research used RS with rice models for reliable yield estimation. As several countries start to operationalize rice monitoring systems, it is needed to synthesize current literature to identify knowledge gaps, to improve estimation accuracies, and to optimize processing. This paper critically reviewed significant developments in using geospatial methods, imagery, and quantitative models to estimate rice yield. First, essential characteristics of rice were discussed as detected by optical and radar sensors, band selection, sensor configuration, spatial resolution, mapping methods, and biophysical variables of rice derivable from RS data. Second, various empirical, process-based, and semi-empirical models that used RS data for spatial estimation of yield were critically assessed–discussing how major types of models, RS platforms, data assimilation algorithms, canopy state variables, and RS variables can be integrated for yield estimation. Lastly, to overcome current constraints and to improve accuracies, several possibilities were suggested–adding new modeling modules, using alternative canopy variables, and adopting novel modeling approaches. As rice yields are expected to decrease due to global warming, geospatial rice yield estimation techniques are indispensable tools for climate change assessments. Future studies should focus on resolving the current limitations of estimation by precise delineation of rice cultivars, by incorporating dynamic harvesting indices based on climatic drivers, using innovative modeling approaches with machine learning. © 2021 Wuhan University.

This dataset was obtained using the cumulative distribution function transform (CDF-t) method, a method that has been applied to several regions and contexts but never to Africa. Here CDF-t has been applied over the period 1950-2099 combining Historical runs and climate change scenarios for six variables: precipitation, mean near-surface air temperature, near-surface maximum air temperature, near-surface minimum air temperature, surface downwelling shortwave radiation, and wind speed, which are critical variables for agricultural purposes. WFDEI has been used as the reference dataset to correct the GCMs. Evaluation of the results over West Africa has been carried out on a list of priority user-based metrics that were discussed and selected with stakeholders. It includes simulated yield using a crop model simulating maize growth. These bias-corrected GCM data have been compared with another available dataset of bias-corrected GCMs using WATCH Forcing Data as the reference dataset. The impact of WFD, WFDEI, and also EWEMBI reference datasets has been also examined in detail. It is shown that CDF-t is very effective at removing the biases and reducing the high inter-GCM scattering. Differences with other bias-corrected GCM data are mainly due to the differences among the reference datasets. This is particularly true for surface downwelling shortwave radiation, which has a significant impact in terms of simulated maize yields. Projections of future yields over West Africa are quite different, depending on the bias-correction method used. However all these projections show a similar relative decreasing trend over the 21st century. © Author(s) 2018.",,"Agriculture; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Distribution functions; Wind; Agricultural impacts; Agricultural purpose; Bias-correction methods; Climate change scenarios; Cumulative distribution function; Global climate model; Near surface air temperature; Short-wave radiation; Climate models; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Crop rotation has been a primary land use change in recent several decades in agro-ecosystem of central United States. Understanding hydrological responses to crop rotation is critical for developing appropriate crop rotation guide strategies for sustainable water resources management and protection of public safety. However, these responses are not well demonstrated and there exists only a few comparison analyses regarding impacts of different rotation patterns on hydrological process. Herein, we show how crop rotation, specifically shifted rotation patterns in various periods, can affect stream flow simulation using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in a typical agro-ecosystem watershed (the Smoky Hill River Watershed) in the Great Plains of the United States. Our results show that, although an accurate crop rotation pattern (2008-2010) slightly improved the simulation performance from 1999 to 2013, precision of stream flow simulation in corresponding and adjacent periods increased significantly. A significant improvement of stream flow simulations in 2006-2008 was also found when applied the corresponding rotation patterns in this period. However, model performance in periods adjacent to 2006-2008 for these two scenarios was not better than that in the periods longer distanced from 2006-2008. The trends of significant improvement to model performance for the corresponding rotation periods suggest that SWAT model capturing more information on crop rotation pattern can lead to a more accurate stream flow prediction. We conclude that selecting various periods of crop rotation patterns has obvious advantage in performance of predicting stream flow.

Results confirmed that the GPR model outperformed all other models for predicting the yield (R2 = 0.87) and dry matter (R2 = 0.86) of winter wheat. The prediction errors of the GPR model for maximum yield and dry matter of winter wheat were 5.8 % and 1.1 %, respectively.

In this study, water, sediment, and nutrient delivery to the stream flow at the Donga-Pont river catchment outlet (586km2) in the Republic of Benin, West Africa were simulated incorporating local management practices including detailed crop systems, fertilization and manure deposition, using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT).At the study scale (586km2), cropping systems are not mapped. Therefore, a land use map was refined for the study area, enabling the evaluation of four management scenarios: crop systems with fertilizer supplied only to cotton, rice and maize, as is common in Benin (Sc0); crop systems without the use of fertilizer (Sc0a); the original land use map with similar fertilizer inputs to all cropping systems (Sc1); and the original land use map without fertilizer inputs (Sc1a). Compared to the first scenario, the latter two scenarios, commonly used in regional scale modeling, exhibited distinct biases in plant growth parameters, crop yields, water yield, sediment yield and nitrogen load.Finally, it was apparent that at the catchment scale, decreases in water yield and nutrient loading were induced by reductions in rainfall (as the result of climate change scenarios), but the effects of the decline in precipitation were counteracted by the effects of changes in land use (land use scenarios). This indicates the strength of the relationship between agriculture and water quality (sediment and nutrient loads) within the Donga-Pont catchment. It was clear that management practices such as fertilizer inputs are among the principal factors controlling this dynamic.

In this scenario, the extensive exploration of available wild, resistant or susceptible germplasms and unraveling the genetic diversity remains vital for breeding programs. The dawn of next-generation sequencing technologies and omics approaches has accelerated plant breeding by providing the genome sequences and transcriptomes of several plants. The availability of decoded plant genomes offers an opportunity at a glance to identify candidate genes, quantitative trait loci (QTLs), molecular markers, and genome-wide association studies that can potentially aid in high throughput marker-assisted breeding. In recent years genomics is coupled with marker-assisted breeding to unravel the mechanisms to harness better better crop yield and quality.

Because the reliability of crop yield predictions based on seasonal weather forecasts depends on the quality of the forecasts, it is essential to evaluate forecasts prior to agricultural applications. This study analyses the potential of Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) in predicting the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) for producing meteorological variables relevant to crop modeling. The focus area was Nepal’s Terai region, and the local hindcasts were compared with weather station and reanalysis data. The results showed that the CFSv2 model accurately predicts monthly anomalies of daily maximum and minimum air temperature (Tmax and Tmin) as well as incoming total surface solar radiation (Srad). However, the daily climatologies of the respective CFSv2 hindcasts exhibit significant systematic biases compared to weather station data. The CFSv2 is less capable of predicting monthly precipitation anomalies and simulating the respective intra-seasonal variability over the growing season. Nevertheless, the observed daily climatologies of precipitation fall within the ensemble spread of the respective daily climatologies of CFSv2 hindcasts. These limitations in the CFSv2 seasonal forecasts, primarily in precipitation, restrict the potential application for predicting the interannual variability of crop yield associated with weather variability. Despite these limitations, ensemble averaging of the simulated yield using all CFSv2 members after applying bias correction may lead to satisfactory yield predictions. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","CFSv2; ISM; Nepal; Terai","agricultural management; climate prediction; crop yield; decision making; ensemble forecasting; monsoon; seasonal variation; summer; weather forecasting; Nepal; Tarai",Article,Scopus

Even though superior bias correction methods can correct the distribution of daily precipitation amounts, as well as the wet-day frequency, they usually fail to correct the temporal sequence or structure of precipitation occurrence. To solve this problem, we presented a hybrid bias correction method for simulating the temporal sequence of daily precipitation occurrence. We did this by combining a first-order two-state Markov chain with a quantile-mapping (QM) based bias correction method. Specifically, a QM-based method was used to correct the distributional attributes of daily precipitation amounts and the wet-day frequency simulated by climate models. Then, the sequence of precipitation occurrence was simulated using the first-order two-state Markov chain with its parameters adjusted based on linear relationships between QM-corrected mean monthly precipitation and the transition probabilities of precipitation occurrence. The proposed Markov chain-based bias correction (MCBC) method was compared with the QM-based method with respect to reproducing the temporal structure of precipitation occurrence over 10 meteorological stations across China. The results showed that the QM-based method was unable to correct the temporal sequence, with the cumulative frequency of wet-and dry-spell length being considerably underestimated for most stations. The MCBC method can could reproduce the temporal sequence of precipitation occurrence, with the generated cumulative frequency of wet-and dry-spell lengths fitting that of the observation well. The proposed method also performed reasonably well with respect to reproducing the mean, standard deviation, and the longest length of observed wet-and dry-spells. Overall, the MCBC method can simulate the temporal sequence of precipitation occurrence, along with correcting the distributional attributes of precipitation amounts. This method can be used with crop and hydrological models in climate change impact studies at the field and small watershed scales. © 2020 by the authors.

It put further challenges to achieve regional-level sustainable development targets. This is particularly true for countries like India where water, land, and climate problems are very complex and interconnected starting from the watershed level to the regional level. Interlinked synergies work as the key to achieving collective action to target multiple sustainable development goals (SDG). The land, water, and climate components are prioritized in SDG 6, 13, and 15 goals respectively, which are assessed through an integrated approach using a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. A semi-arid ungauged Khari basin is selected for the sustainability assessment and hydrologic response study. As the region is critical in terms of shortage of water, land conversions, and climate change and can present a way to address challenges in regional-level sustainability assessments. SWAT model is considered for two land-use scenarios, 1990 and 2015, for the period 1990–2019 and two climate scenarios, Representative Concentrated Pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), for the period 2021–2050 while keeping the slope and soil data same in both models. The simulated discharge data matched well with the observed discharge data, with NSE of 0.72, PBIAS of − 1.9, R2 of 0.72 during calibration, and NSE of 0.72, PBIAS of − 4.7, and R2 of 0.73 during validation. It can be observed from the Land use change scenario assessment that an increase in the fallow agriculture land area shows a positive relation with surface runoff and a negative relation with percolation. Similarly, climate change scenario assessment shows that in future scenarios temperature will increase in both the RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 but hydrological components are more responsive to the changes in rainfall than temperature changes. Study results pointed out that both land use change and climate change can significantly affect the surface as well as groundwater availability of the region and it also highlights the functionality of an integrated assessment approach that assesses land, water, and climate components of SDGs through a hydrological model.

The present study aims to project future soil erosion and sediment deposition in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) using climate projections by five Global Circulation Models (GCMs) under the Representative Concentrations Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario. To understand the importance of freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) for soil erosion and sediment deposition estimation with climate change, this study compared two Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models with different representations of the FTCs, with the standard SWAT using a simple regression method and SWAT-FT employing a physically based method. Modeling results show that future climate change can pronouncedly intensify soil erosion and increase sediment deposition, and the impacts are sensitive to how FTCs are represented in the model. The standard SWAT projected an increase in soil erosion by nearly 40% by the end of the 21st century, which is much lower than the projected over 65% increase in soil erosion by SWAT-FT. For sediment deposition, the projected percent changes by the standard SWAT and SWAT-FT also deviate from each other (i.e., about 70% by the standard SWAT vs about 120% by SWAT-FT). Overall, these results demonstrate the important roles of FTCs in projecting future soil erosion and sediment deposition and underline the need to consider the effects of conservation practices on FTCs to realistically assess the effectiveness of those measures. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","climate change; economic cost; global circulation model; soil erosion; watershed modeling","Climate models; Deposition; Ecosystems; Erosion; Freezing; Regression analysis; River basin projects; Sediments; Soil conservation; Soils; Thawing; Watersheds; Climate projection; Conservation practices; Ecosystem services; Freeze-thaw cycles; Global circulation model; Sediment deposition; Soil and water assessment tool; Upper Mississippi; Climate change; freeze-thaw cycle; future prospect; river basin; soil erosion; article; climate change; comparative effectiveness; freeze thawing; human; Mississippi; river basin; sediment; Soil and Water Assessment Tool model; soil erosion; watershed; climate change; ecosystem; river; soil; Mississippi River; United States; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Humans; Rivers; Soil; Soil Erosion",Article,Scopus

We evaluate here whether this computationally intensive approach significantly alters projections of agricultural yield, one of the greatest concerns under climate change. Our results suggest that it does not. We simulate US maize yields under current and future CO2 concentrations with the widely used Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer crop model, driven by a variety of climate inputs including two GCMs, each in turn downscaled by two RCMs. We find that no climate model output can reproduce yields driven by observed climate unless a bias correction is first applied. Once a bias correction is applied, GCM- and RCM-driven US maize yields are essentially indistinguishable in all scenarios (&lt;10% discrepancy, equivalent to error from observations). Although RCMs correct some GCM biases related to fine-scale geographic features, errors in yield are dominated by broad-scale (100s of kilometers) GCM systematic errors that RCMs cannot compensate for. These results support previous suggestions that the benefits for impacts assessments of dynamically downscaling raw GCM output may not be sufficient to justify its computational demands. Progress on fidelity of yield projections may benefit more from continuing efforts to understand and minimize systematic error in underlying climate projections.","Agriculture; CORDEX; Food security; NARCCAP","agriculture; article; climate change; decision support system; environmental impact; general circulation model; harvest; maize; measurement error; model; priority journal; simulation; agriculture; CORDEX; food security; NARCCAP; Agriculture; Algorithms; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Conservation of Natural Resources; Crops, Agricultural; Food Supply; Forecasting; Geography; Models, Theoretical; North America; Probability; Reproducibility of Results; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Vegetation is an extremely important component of our global ecosystem and a necessary indicator of land cover dynamics and productivity. Vegetation phenology is influenced by lifecycle patterns, seasonality and weather conditions, leading to changes in their spectral reflectance. Various relevant information, such as vegetation indices (VIs), can be extracted from RS data for vegetation forecasting. Therefore, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is known as one of the most widely recognized indices for vegetation related studies. This paper reviews the related works on DL-based spatio-temporal vegetation forecasting using RS data over the period between 2015 and 2021. In this review, we present several DL-based studies and discuss DL algorithms and various sources of data that have been used in these studies.

These farmers are financially incapable of equipping themselves with irrigation systems and other agricultural technologies that can assist in improving their farm yields. One of the challenges facing them is that they rely heavily on rain-fed agriculture which makes them extremely vulnerable in the face of climate change. They have continued to consult their indigenous knowledge systems to predict the onset of rains and in making critical decisions such as when to prepare land for crop cultivation. Evidence shows that this knowledge is no longer as precise as it used to be – among other reasons, this is due to the effects of climate change and deforestation. The second problem is that the only sources of weather information these farmers have (e.g. the media) are general and not scaled down to the specific locations where they reside. On the other hand, most of the small-scale farmers are educationally and technologically semi-literate and are financially crawling when it comes to adoption of the likes of sensors and other technologies that could help in predicting and monitoring crop health.

To this aim, SWAT+ was applied on digital terrain models (DTMs) from close-range photogrammetry, land-cover mapping, real crop rotations and a detailed calendar of farming practices. NBSs behaviour was investigated in two test areas, namely the Studiati and the Gioia areas, with uniform geomorphological settings but different soil types and annual crop rotations. NBS effects were compared with a baseline control scenario (without NBSs) and assessed under future climate conditions (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). Specifically, VBSs and CCs showed different capabilities in mitigating runoff and sediment losses, and their combination provided maximum effectiveness. For the current climate scenarios, the implementation of VBSs produced a reduction of runoff depth of about 41% and 64% in the Studiati and Gioia areas, respectively, whereas showing a limited with the CCs implementation. Under the future climate conditions, similar patterns were observed, even if predicting significantly lower runoff depths. The sediment loss reduction was in the order of 79% and 64% in Studiati and Gioia areas, respectively. Concerning soil and water dynamics, the study remarked that slight topographic irregularities on flat morphologies can trigger concentrated flows responsible for high runoff and sediment losses. Furthermore, the differences in soil texture and organic matter content affected soil erodability rate on a local scale, driving the consistency of NBS mitigating effects. Future climate changes scenarios, exhibiting higher temperature and rarer but more concentrated rainfall events, emphasize the impact of different soil types. Results observed at a very local scale, with a spatialization of a few square meters - which clearly relates to the types of crop rotations, NBSs and soil distribution - noticed that SWAT+ is a suitable tool to aid farmers in cropping systems management and design. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Climate changes; Cover crops; Lake Massaciuccoli (Italy); Runoff; Soil erosion; SWAT+; Vegetative buffer strips","Catchments; Climate change; Crop rotation; Erosion; Lakes; Land reclamation; Land use; Mapping; Reclamation; Rotation; Runoff; Sediments; Soils; Textures; Buffer strip; Cover crops; Crop rotation; Future climate; Lake massaciuccoli (italy); Sediment loss; Soil erosion; Solution effects; SWAT+; Vegetative buffer strip; SWAT; agricultural land; climate change; cover crop; erodibility; permeability; photogrammetry; runoff; soil and water assessment tool; soil erosion; soil type",Article,Scopus

Although various statistical models and machine learning models have been developed to enhance prediction accuracy, spatial and temporal non-stationarity, an intrinsic attribute of many geographical processes, is still rarely considered in crop yield modeling. From a statistical point of view, this study respectively provided evidence for the existence of spatial non-stationarity and temporal non-stationarity in winter wheat yield prediction based on geographically weighted regression (GWR) and temporally weighted regression (TWR). Then, a geographically and temporally weighted neural network (GTWNN) model was proposed by integrating artificial neural network (ANN) into geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) using publicly available data sources, including satellite imagery and climate data. For a more credible evaluation, the leave-one-year-out strategy was adopted to make out-of-sample prediction resulting in a total of 12 test years from 2008 to 2019. The experiment results showed that the proposed GTWNN outperformed ANN, GTWR and support vector regression (SVR) achieving the average coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.766, 0.759 and 0.720 at the three prediction times of end of July, end of June and end of May. Moreover, an extended Moran's I was adopted to assess the degree of spatiotemporal autocorrelation of the prediction errors. The error aggregation of GTWNN was lower than other models, indicating that GTWNN is applicable to addressing spatial non-stationarity in modeling the relationship between predictors and yield response. The methodology proposed in this paper can be extended to handle spatiotemporal non-stationarity in other crop yield predictions and even other environmental phenomena. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Geographically and temporally weighted neural network; Remote sensing; Spatiotemporal non-stationarity; Winter wheat; Yield prediction","Climate models; Food supply; Forecasting; Learning systems; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Risk management; Satellite imagery; Crop yield; Geographically and temporally weighted neural network; Neural-networks; Non-stationarities; Remote-sensing; Spatiotemporal non-stationarity; Weighted regression; Winter wheat; Winter wheat yields; Yield prediction; Crops; agricultural market; artificial neural network; crop yield; experimental study; food security; machine learning; prediction; wheat; winter",Article,Scopus

The study also simulates runoff characteristics as a response to hypothetical climatic scenarios. The scope of the study involves, first, to quantify the relative contribution of climate change and land-use change to runoff response and second, to simulate runoff characteristics as a response to hypothetical climatic scenarios. Using a combination of the SWAT model, SWAT Cup, Sequential Mann Kendall Trend Tests, surface and total runoff were generated for 1982–2017, and the mutation point was identified. The results indicate that post-2010, climate change has an overwhelming impact on runoff with its contribution being as high as 99% in the case of total runoff and 89% for surface runoff. And this finding is cemented by dynamic contribution analysis which indicates over-arching climatic impact for every decade, with a sudden increase post-2010. Change in temperature and rainfall has an expected impact on runoff, with a rise in rainfall and decrease in temperature resulting in the higher runoff than the normal, except beyond 2 °C, post which there is a sudden increase in surface runoff response, even in scenarios where there is a decrease in rainfall. While surface runoff rises 2% for every 1% increase in precipitation and decreases by 1.7% for every 1% decrease, the corresponding change for total runoff is 1.4%. The novelty of the work lies in its capacity to provide a rapid framework to the immediate stakeholders in understanding runoff response to different change-based scenario independently and in combination. © 2021, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","Climate change; Contribution analysis; Hypothetical climatic scenarios; Land-use change; Runoff response","catchment; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; hydrological modeling; land use change; river basin; runoff; scenario analysis; soil and water assessment tool; India; West Bengal",Article,Scopus

They were not always able to predict the crop and its yield solely on that idea alone. Second, seed firms frequently monitor how well new plant varieties would grow in certain settings. Third, predicting agricultural production is critical for solving emerging food security concerns, especially in the face of global climate change. Accurate production forecasts not only assist farmers in making informed economic and management decisions but they also aid in the prevention of famine. This results in farming systems’ efficiency and productivity gains, as well as reduced risk from environmental factors. Design/methodology/approach: This research paper proposes a machine learning technique for effective autonomous crop and yield prediction, which makes use of solution encoding to create solutions randomly, and then for every generated solution, fitness is evaluated to meet highest accuracy. Major focus of the proposed work is to optimize the weight parameter in the input data. The algorithm continues until the optimal agent or optimal weight is selected, which contributes to maximum accuracy in automated crop prediction. Findings: Performance of the proposed work is compared with different existing algorithms, such as Random Forest, support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed method support vector neural network (SVNN) with gravitational search agent (GSA) is analysed based on different performance metrics, such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, CPU memory usage and training time, and maximum performance is determined. Research limitations/implications: Rather than real-time data collected by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, this research focuses solely on historical data; the proposed work does not impose IoT-based smart farming, which enhances the overall agriculture system by monitoring the field in real time. The present study only predicts the sort of crop to sow not crop production. Originality/value: The paper proposes a novel optimization algorithm, which is based on the law of gravity and mass interactions. The search agents in the proposed algorithm are a cluster of weights that interact with one another using Newtonian gravity and motion principles.

Indeed, food shortages in this region are often caused by rainfall deficits and an early access to data available for the entire region can help to provide credible and timely information for better decision making. This study assesses the accuracy of state-of-the-art satellite rainfall retrievals for agriculture applications in two sites in Niger and Benin. Although these satellite data are widely used instead of rain gauge data for such applications, we found that, in a crop-modelling framework, their use can introduce large biases in crop yield simulations. Biases differ strongly among the four cultivars considered in both sites and are not simple extrapolation of each satellite product cumulative rainfall amount biases. In particular, we found that if an accurate estimation of the annual cumulative rainfall amount is important for yield simulations of pearl millet 'Souna 3' and 'Somno' cultivars in Niger, a realistic distribution of rainfall is also very important for predicting pearl millet 'Somno' and 'HK' yields in Niger as well as maize yields in Benin. Overall the satellite products tested, 3B42v6 appears to be the most suitable satellite product for our specific agricultural application since it minimizes both biases in rainfall distribution and in annual cumulative rainfall amount.

Recent advances in big data analytics and computing power have popularized the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms to upscale site measurements of ecosystem processes, and in some cases forecast the response of these processes to climate change. Due to data limitations, however, ML model predictions of these processes are almost never validated with independent datasets. To better understand and characterize the limitations of these methods, we develop an approach to independently evaluate ML upscaling and forecasting. We mimic data-driven upscaling and forecasting efforts by applying ML algorithms to different subsets of regional process-model simulation gridcells, and then test ML performance using the remaining gridcells. In this study, we simulate C fluxes and environmental data across Alaska using ecosys, a process-rich terrestrial ecosystem model, and then apply boosted regression tree ML algorithms to training data configurations that mirror and expand upon existing AmeriFLUX eddy-covariance data availability. We first show that a ML model trained using ecosys outputs from currently-available Alaska AmeriFLUX sites incorrectly predicts that Alaska is presently a modeled net C source. Increased spatial coverage of the training dataset improves ML predictions, halving the bias when 240 modeled sites are used instead of 15. However, even this more accurate ML model incorrectly predicts Alaska C fluxes under 21st century climate change because of changes in atmospheric CO2, litter inputs, and vegetation composition that have impacts on C fluxes which cannot be inferred from the training data. Our results provide key insights to future C flux upscaling efforts and expose the potential for inaccurate ML upscaling and forecasting of high-latitude C cycle dynamics. © 2023 The Author(s).

The SUFI-2 method was used for the calibration and validation of the SWAT model. The model was calibrated for the period of five years (1982–1986) and validated for the next five years (1987–1991). The values of R2, NSE, bR2, PBIAS, and RSR were, respectively, 0.78, 0.77, 0.61, 47.4 and 0.48 during the calibration period, and 0.71, 0.65, 0.60, 72.1 and 0.59 during the validation period.

Our approach is applied to state-scale maize yield and meteorological data for the US Corn Belt from 1981 to 2014 as an exemplar, but would be readily transferable to other crops, locations and spatial scales. Experimentation with a number of models shows that maize growth rates can be characterised by a two-dimensional Gaussian function of temperature and precipitation with monthly contributions accumulated over the growing period. This approach accounts for non-linear growth responses to the individual meteorological variables, and allows for interactions between them. Our models correctly identify that temperature and precipitation have the largest impact on yield in the six months prior to the harvest, in agreement with the typical growing season for US maize (April to September). Maximal growth rates occur for monthly mean temperature 18 °C–19 °C, corresponding to a daily maximum temperature of 24 °C– 25 °C (in broad agreement with previous work) and monthly total precipitation 115 mm. Our approach also provides a self-consistent way of investigating climate change impacts on current US maize varieties in the absence of adaptation measures. Keeping precipitation and growing area fixed, a temperature increase of 2 °C, relative to 1981–2014, results in the mean yield decreasing by 8%, while the yield variance increases by a factor of around 3. We thus provide a flexible, data-driven framework for exploring the impacts of natural climate variability and climate change on globally significant crops based on their observed behaviour. In concert with other approaches, this can help inform the development of adaptation strategies that will ensure food security under a changing climate. © 2020 The Author(s).

It is a well-known fact that climate change has been accelerated over the past decades due to various human induced activities. In addition, demand for the food is increasing day-by-day due to the rapid growth of population. Therefore, understanding the relationships between climatic factors and paddy production has become crucial for the sustainability of the agriculture sector. However, these relationships are usually complex nonlinear relationships. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are extensively used in obtaining these complex, nonlinear relationships. However, these relationships are not yet obtained in the context of Sri Lanka; a country where its staple food is rice. Therefore, this research presents an attempt in obtaining the relationships between the paddy yield and climatic parameters for several paddy grown areas (Ampara, Batticaloa, Badulla, Bandarawela, Hambantota, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, and Puttalam) with available data. Three training algorithms (Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), Bayesian Regularization (BR), and Scaled Conjugated Gradient (SCG)) are used to train the developed neural network model, and they are compared against each other to find the better training algorithm. Correlation coefficient (R) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) were used as the performance indicators to evaluate the performance of the developed ANN models. The results obtained from this study reveal that LM training algorithm has outperformed the other two algorithms in determining the relationships between climatic factors and paddy yield with less computational time. In addition, in the absence of seasonal climate data, annual prediction process is understood as an efficient prediction process. However, the results reveal that there is an error threshold in the prediction. Nevertheless, the obtained results are stable and acceptable under the highly unpredicted climate scenarios. The ANN relationships developed can be used to predict the future paddy yields in corresponding areas with the future climate data from various climate models. © 2020 Vinushi Amaratunga et al.",,"Agricultural robots; Climate models; Complex networks; Forecasting; Mean square error; Neural networks; Population statistics; Bayesian regularization; Correlation coefficient; Efficient predictions; Levenberg-Marquardt; Neural network model; Non-linear relationships; Performance indicators; Seasonal climate data; Climate change",Article,Scopus

This study estimated the potential impacts of the projected precipitation and temperature based on the downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP-5) on hydrology and crop yield of a rural watershed in Oklahoma, USA. The Soil andWater Assessment Tool was used to model the watershed with 43 sub-basins and 15,217 combinations of land use, land cover, soil, and slope. The model was driven by the observed climate in the watershed and was first calibrated and validated against the monthly observed streamflow. Three statistical matrices, coefficient of determination (R 2 ), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and percentage bias (PB), were used to gauge the model performance with satisfactory values of R 2 = 0.64, NS = 0.61, and PB = +5% in the calibration period, and R 2 = 0.79, NSE = 0.62, and PB = -15% in the validation period for streamflow. The model parameterization for the yields of cotton (PB = -4.5%), grain sorghum (PB = -27.3%), and winter wheat (PB = -6.0%) resulted in an acceptable model performance. The CMIP-5 ensemble of three General Circulation Models under three Representative Concentration Pathways for the 2016-2040 period indicated an increase in both precipitation (+1.5%) and temperature (+1.8 °C) in the study area. This changed climate resulted in decreased evapotranspiration (-3.7%), increased water yield (23.9%), decreased wheat yield (-5.2%), decreased grain sorghum yield (-9.9%), and increased cotton yield (+54.2%) compared to the historical climate. The projected increase in water yield might provide opportunities for groundwater recharge and additional water to meet future water demand in the region. The projected decrease in winter wheat yield-the major crop in the state-due to climate change, may require attention for ways to mitigate these effects. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Crop yield; Global climate models; Southern Great Plains; Surface runoff; SWAT","Climate change; Cotton; Crops; Grain (agricultural product); Land use; Recharging (underground waters); Stream flow; Watersheds; Crop yield; Global climate model; Southern great plains; Surface runoffs; SWAT; Climate models; climate change; climate modeling; CMIP; cotton; crop yield; evapotranspiration; global climate; groundwater; precipitation (climatology); runoff; soil analysis; soil and water assessment tool; sorghum; streamflow; water demand; water yield; watershed; wheat; winter; Oklahoma [United States]; United States; Gossypium hirsutum; Sorghum bicolor bicolor; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Selected regression models were compared with Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, and other non-tree algorithms to prove the R2 driven performance superiority of tree-based ensemble models. In addition, the learning process of the models was examined using model-based feature importance, learning curve, validation curve, residual analysis, and prediction error. Results indicated that rainfall frequency, root-zone soil moisture, and temperature could make a significant impact on oil palm yield. Most influential features that contributed to the prediction process are rainfall, cloud amount, number of rain days, wind speed, and root zone soil wetness. It is concluded that the means of machine learning have great potential for the application to predict oil palm yield using weather and soil moisture data. © 2022 by the authors.

The future projections for 2030, 2050, and 2070 were derived using the Long Ashton Research Station-Weather Generator (LARS-WG) with integrated global climate models (GCMs). The projections for the representative concentration pathway-4.5 (RCP-4.5) were tested in the crop model, World Food Studies (WOFOST) to assess the resilience of cassava varieties. The future projections in the study region indicated an increase of up to 2.1 and 2.3 °C for maximum and minimum temperatures respectively, followed by solar dimming. The crop yield predictions based on the outputs from the GCMs indicated that the yield of the long duration cassava var. H-226 increased during 2030 from 8.6 to 12% and that of short duration var. Sree Vijaya increased from 3.6 to 5.5%. With the 2050 scenario, the yield increased from 3.3 to 6.7% for var. H-226 and −4.3 to 1.9% for var. Sree Vijaya, respectively. Whereas, during 2070 was a decrease in the yield for vars H-226 and Sree Vijaya ranging from −9 to 3.8% and −10 to −5.2% respectively. The results indicated that var. H-226 is more resilient to the changing climate than var. Sree Vijaya. As an outcome of this study, the var. H-226 can be considered as climate-resilient, and this information can assist the decision makers in selecting an appropriate crop variety to ensure food security. © 2021, NAAS (National Academy of Agricultural Sciences).","Projections; Tuber initiation; Weather generator; WOFOST; Yield","Crops; Decision making; Food supply; Plants (botany); Value engineering; Cassava varieties; Future projections; Global climate model; Manihot esculenta; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Research stations; Weather generator; World food studies; Climate models; cassava; climate conditions; climate modeling; crop yield; food security; high yielding variety; tuber; weather; India; Kerala",Article,Scopus

Thus, researchers have focused on developing models for estimating soil quality based on artificial intelligence techniques for the processing of multidimensional data from agro-industrial systems, which provide useful information for farmers about soil management and crop conditions. However, a model for the application of these new technologies in medium and low-scale agricultural systems has not been identified. Therefore, a review of recent studies of crop yield prediction based on the estimation of chemical, physical, and biological soil quality indicators (SQI), which incorporate different machine learning (ML) techniques to process data from remote sensing (RS) systems, is presented. The advantages and disadvantages are also analyzed for: SQI estimates at regional and local scale, spectral bands used for analysis of plowed soils (bare soils) of cultivation plots, selection of minimun data set (MDS), use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite platforms, data pre-processing, and selection of ML algorithms for processing biological systems databases (agro-industrial systems). Finally, we present a model to help estimate soil quality in agricultural systems at a local scale, based on ML to process RS data, in the model the inputs to the ML unit come from four different class data sets (RS, SQI, environmental data and crop management data). Crop management uses the production of the ML unit to adjust agricultural management practices and therefore improve crop yield. © 2021","Agricultural systems; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Soil quality indicators","Antennas; Bioinformatics; Crops; Cultivation; Data handling; Indicators (chemical); Information management; Productivity; Remote sensing; Soils; Sustainable development; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Agricultural system; Crop managements; Crop yield; Data set; Industrial systems; Local scale; Remote sensing techniques; Remote-sensing; Soil quality indicators; Soils qualities; Machine learning; agricultural management; agricultural soil; artificial intelligence; crop yield; cultivation; intensive agriculture; machine learning; physicochemical property; remote sensing; soil management; soil quality",Review,Scopus

A multi-site-year study was conducted across eastern Canada with the objectives to (1) construct machine-learning random forest regression (RFR) models for canola yield prediction; and (2) develop site-specific N recommendations using the RFR modelling approach. Soil characteristics, weather, plant growth and spectral index data collected from 2013 to 2015 were used to train the RFR models and the 2016 data for model validation in terms of making N decisions. Results showed that canola yields responded positively to N application rates in 16 out of the 18 site-year environments, with sometimes higher yields and an average of 8% higher N use efficiency for the split-N strategy than for the same amount of N applied only at preplant. Heat stress and precipitation distribution were identified as of critical importance in total yield variation. The RFR model by combining weather, soil and plant growth features with the spectral indices displayed highly improved prediction reliability, up to 85%, with 53–57% lower root mean square errors, compared with the model based only on leaf chlorophyll or normalized difference vegetation index. Based on the RFR algorithm, an average economic optimum N rate of 150 kg N ha−1 was recommended for most canola production scenarios in the test year. This study demonstrated that the machine learning-based RFR modelling approach can be used to implement optimal nutrient management strategies for sustainable crop production, which is sensitive and better adapted to environment-induced abiotic stresses. © Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada 2021 as represented by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.","Brassica napus; Precision N fertilization; Random forest regression model; Vegetation index; Yield estimation","canola; chlorophyll; crop production; crop yield; detection method; fertilizer application; growth; machine learning; model validation; soil nitrogen; Canada; Brassica napus; Brassica napus var. napus",Article,Scopus

Yield forecasting gives an alert regarding economic trading, food production monitoring, and global food security. This research was conducted to investigate whether active optical sensors could be utilized for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) yield prediction at the mid.le of the growing season. Three potato cultivars (Russet Burbank, Superior, and Shepody) were planted and six rates of N (0, 56, 112, 168, 224, and 280 kg ha−1), ammonium sulfate, which was replaced by ammonium nitrate in the 2nd year, were applied on 11 sites in a randomized complete block design, with four replications. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and chlorophyll index (CI) measurements were obtained weekly from the active optical sensors, GreenSeeker (GS) and Crop Circle (CC). The 168 kg N ha−1 produced the maximum potato yield. Indices measurements obtained at the 16th and 20th leaf growth stages were significantly correlated with tuber yield. Multiple regression analysis (potato yield as a dependent variable and vegetation indices, NDVI and CI, as independent variables) could make a remarkable improvement to the accuracy of the prediction model and increase the determination coefficient. The exponential and linear models showed a better fit of the data. Soil organic matter content increased the yield significantly but did not affect the prediction models.

However, ground-based recording networks are not available at spatial and temporal scales needed to drive the models at many critical places on earth. An alternative would be to employ satellite-based observations of either precipitation or soil moisture. Satellite observations of precipitation are currently not considered capable of forcing the models with sufficient accuracy for crop yield predictions. However, deduction of soil moisture from space-based platforms is in a more advanced state than are precipitation estimates so that these data may be capable of forcing the models with better accuracy. In this study, a mature two-source energy balance model, the Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) model, was used to deduce root zone soil moisture for an area of North Alabama, USA. The soil moisture estimates were used in turn to force the state-of-the-art Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop simulation model. The study area consisted of a mixture of rainfed and irrigated cornfields. The results indicate that the model forced with the ALEXI moisture estimates produced yield simulations that compared favorably with observed yields and with the rainfed model. The data appear to indicate that the ALEXI model did detect the soil moisture signal from the mixed rainfed/irrigation corn fields and this signal was of sufficient strength to produce adequate simulations of recorded yields over a 10 year period. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","ALEXI; Crop modeling; DSSAT; Maximum entropy; Remote sensing; Soil moisture","Agrotechnology transfer; ALEXI; Crop modeling; DSSAT; Root zone soil moistures; Satellite observations; Spatial and temporal scale; Two-source energy balance model; Artificial intelligence; Crops; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Estimation; Maximum entropy methods; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Space platforms; Computer simulation",Article,Scopus

Although water issues alone have not been the sole trigger for warfare in the past, tensions over freshwater management and use represent one of the main concerns in political relations between riparian states and may exacerbate existing tensions, increase regional instability and social unrest. Previous studies made great efforts to understand how international water management problems were addressed by actors in a more cooperative or confrontational way. In this study, we analyze what are the pre-conditions favoring the insurgence of water management issues in shared water bodies, rather than focusing on the way water issues are then managed among actors. We do so by proposing an innovative analysis of past episodes of conflict and cooperation over transboundary water resources (jointly defined as “hydro-political interactions”). On the one hand, we aim at highlighting the factors that are more relevant in determining water interactions across political boundaries. On the other hand, our objective is to map and monitor the evolution of the likelihood of experiencing hydro-political interactions over space and time, under changing socioeconomic and biophysical scenarios, through a spatially explicit data driven index. Historical cross-border water interactions were used as indicators of the magnitude of corresponding water joint-management issues. These were correlated with information about river basin freshwater availability, climate stress, human pressure on water resources, socioeconomic conditions (including institutional development and power imbalances), and topographic characteristics. This analysis allows for identification of the main factors that determine water interactions, such as water availability, population density, power imbalances, and climatic stressors. The proposed model was used to map at high spatial resolution the probability of experiencing hydro-political interactions worldwide. This baseline outline is then compared to four distinct climate and population density projections aimed to estimate trends for hydro-political interactions under future conditions (2050 and 2100), while considering two greenhouse gases emission scenarios (moderate and extreme climate change). The combination of climate and population growth dynamics is expected to impact negatively on the overall hydro-political risk by increasing the likelihood of water interactions in the transboundary river basins, with an average increase ranging between 74.9% (2050 – population and moderate climate change) to 95% (2100 - population and extreme climate change). Future demographic and climatic conditions are expected to exert particular pressure on already water stressed basins such as the Nile, the Ganges/Brahmaputra, the Indus, the Tigris/Euphrates, and the Colorado. The results of this work allow us to identify current and future areas where water issues are more likely to arise, and where cooperation over water should be actively pursued to avoid possible tensions especially under changing environmental conditions. From a policy perspective, the index presented in this study can be used to provide a sound quantitative basis to the assessment of the Sustainable Development Goal 6, Target 6.5 “Water resources management”, and in particular to indicator 6.5.2 “Transboundary cooperation”. © 2018 The Authors","Hydro-political risk; Random Forest regression; Transboundary water interactions; Water cross-border issues","climate change; climate conditions; data set; political boundary; population density; population dynamics; population growth; regression analysis; resource management; risk assessment; river basin; socioeconomic conditions; spatial resolution; sustainable development; transboundary cooperation; water availability; water management; water resource; Brahmaputra River; Colorado River [North America]; Euphrates River; Ganges River; Indus River; Tigris River",Article,Scopus

A point of crucial importance in this region is therefore how intensive corn (Zed mays L.)-based cropping systems for food and fuel production can be sustainable and coexist with a healthy water environment, not only under existing climate conditions but also under a changed climate in the future. To address this issue, a UMRB integrated modeling system has been built with a greatly refined 12-digit subbasin structure based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) water quality model, which is capable of estimating landscape and in-stream water and pollutant yields in response to a wide array of alternative cropping and/or management strategies and climatic conditions. The effects of the following four agricultural management scenarios on crop production and pollutant loads exported from the cropland of the UMRB to streams and rivers were evaluated: (1) expansion of continuous corn across the entire basin, (2) adoption of no-till on all corn and soybean ( Glycine max L.) fields in the region, (3) substitution of the traditional continuous corn and corn-soybean rotations with an extended five-year rotation consisting of corn, soybean, and three years of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), and (4) implementation of a winter cover crop within the baseline rotations. The effects of each management scenario were evaluated both for current climate and a projected midcentury (2046 to 2065) climate from a General Circulation Model (GCM). All four scenarios behaved similarly under the historical and future climate, generally resulting in reduced erosion and nutrient loadings to surface water bodies compared to the baseline agricultural management. Continuous corn was the only scenario which resulted in increased N pollution while no-till was the most environmentally effective and able to sustain production at almost the same levels. Rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop within the fallow period was also effective in reducing erosion and both sediment-bound and soluble forms of nutrients. The results indicated that alternative management practices could reduce sediment, N, and P exports from UMRB cropland by up to 50% without significantly affecting yields. Results for the climate change scenario showed that the effectiveness of the management scenarios was strongly linked to the reduced water availability predicted under the future climate, which assisted in mitigating pollutant transport, although with a small loss of production.","Agricultural management scenarios-; Climate change-corn based systems-; Nonpoint pollution-; Soil and water assessment tool-; Upper mississippi river basin","climate change; cropping practice; environmental management; river basin; surface water; water management; water quality; Mississippi Basin; United States; Glycine max; Medicago sativa; Secale cereale; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Although solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is more sensitive than traditional remotely sensed vegetation indices to photosynthetic capacity, the performance of SIF in wheat yield prediction should be further explored. In this study, five satellite variables (i.e., Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) SIF at 0.5° spatial resolution, global spatially contiguous SIF (CSIF) at 0.05° resolution, and three vegetation indices at 1 km resolution) from 2007 to 2018 were used to predict wheat yield using two linear regression methods (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO) and ridge regression (RIDGE)), three machine learning methods (support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)), and one deep learning method (long short-term memory (LSTM)) to predict wheat yield across the Indo-Gangetic Plains. The results showed that machine learning and deep learning methods outperformed the two linear regression methods in predicting wheat yield, while the LSTM did not perform better than SVR. The prediction using the high-resolution SIF product had better performance than that using the coarse-resolution SIF product among all years. Moreover, the high-resolution SIF had better performance than the three vegetation indices in yield prediction in 2010, which indicated that the SIF data had great superiority in predicting wheat yield under extreme weather events.

However, little is known on the effects of combined change in temperature, CO2 concentration, and extreme events on barley grain quality and how capable are the current process-based crop models capture the signal of climate change on quality traits. Here in this review, we initially explored the response of quality traits of barley to heat, drought, and CO2 concentration from experiential studies. Next, we reviewed the state of the art of some of the current modeling approaches to capture grain quality. Lastly, we suggested possible opportunities to improve current models for tracking the detailed quality traits of barley. Heat and drought stress increase the protein concentration which has a negative effect on malting quality. The rise of CO2 concentration significantly reduces the grain protein, again resulting in a decline of the malting and brewing quality since the nitrogen concentration of grains needs to be kept at a specific level. The current crop models that simulate barley grain quality are limited to simulation of grain nitrogen concentration, size, and number in response to climate extremes and CO2. Nevertheless, crop models fail to account for the complex interactions between the conflicting effects of rising temperatures and droughts as well as increasing CO2 concentrations on grain protein. They have mainly adapted wheat models that cannot capture barley's protein composition and whole grain malting quality. Implementation of experiments from gene to canopy scales which are explicitly designed to detect the interactions among environmental variables on detailed quality traits and couple the remote sensing plus data-driven approaches to crop models are possible opportunities to improve modeling of barley grain quality. The development of modeling routines can capture the detailed grain quality provide valuable tools for forming climate adaptive strategies. Equally important, they can guide breeding programs to develop climate-resilient but high-quality barley genotypes. © 2022 The Authors","Barley; Climate warming; Extreme events; Process-bases modeling; Quality traits","agricultural modeling; barley; climate change; drought stress; extreme event; remote sensing",Review,Scopus

Rice is one of the major crops of this state, and it contributes a significant proportion to the rice production of India. The present study deals with the prediction of Kharif rice over Gangetic West Bengal using forecast products from IITM-IMD extended range prediction (ERP) system. It is a multi-model ensemble prediction system that comprises 16 different ensemble members obtained from the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2) and the stand-alone atmospheric component of CFSv2 (i.e., GFSv2). The performance of ERP rainfall forecast has been assessed over a relatively larger domain covering Indian landmass before its utilization in crop yield prediction. Satisfactory skills, e.g., higher correlation and lower normalized root mean squared error (nRMSE), have been found in ERP rainfall forecast during the first 3 weeks for most of the initial conditions (ICs). Next, bias-corrected ERP weekly forecast data of incoming solar radiation, rainfall, and maximum and minimum temperatures have been incorporated into a process-based crop model (CERES-rice) available in the Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT). ERP-driven crop model has performed better to reproduce inter-annual variability of observed rice yield compared to yield simulated using crop model driven by climatology alone. Also, the ERP-driven model has been able to capture the below- and above-normal yield categories relatively better than the climatology-driven model. Hence, the incorporation of ERP in crop models may provide value-added prediction, which will be helpful for the stakeholders and decision-makers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"climate prediction; correlation; crop production; crop yield; decision support system; paddy field; rainfall; India; West Bengal",Article,Scopus

Accurate crop prediction results in increased crop production. This is where machine learning playing a crucial role in the area of crop prediction. Crop prediction depends on the soil, geographic and climatic attributes. Selecting appropriate attributes for the right crop/s is an intrinsic part of the prediction undertaken by feature selection techniques. In this work, a comparative study of various wrapper feature selection methods are carried out for crop prediction using classification techniques that suggest the suitable crop/s for land. The experimental results show the Recursive Feature Elimination technique with the Adaptive Bagging classifier outperforms the others. © 2021 The Author(s).

Any changes in agro-climatic conditions will have a profound influence on the productivity of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) yield and, as a result, the total pulse production of the country. In this context, weather-based crop yield prediction will enable farmers, decision-makers, and administrators in dealing with hardships. The current study examines the application of the stepwise linear regression method, supervised machine learning algorithms (support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF)), shrinkage regression approaches (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) or elastic net (ENET)), and artificial neural network (ANN) model for pigeon pea yield prediction using long-term weather data. Among the approaches, ANN resulted in a higher coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.88–0.99), model efficiency (0.88–1.00) with subsequent lower normalised root mean square error (nRMSE) during calibration (1.13–12.55%), and validation (0.33–21.20%) over others. The temperature alone or its interaction with other weather parameters was identified as the most influencing variables in the study area. The Pearson correlation coefficients were also determined for the observed and predicted yield. Those values also showed ANN as the best model with correlation values ranging from 0.939 to 0.999 followed by RF (0.955–0.982) and LASSO (0.880–0.982). However, all the approaches adopted in the study were outperformed the statistical method, i.e. stepwise linear regression with lower error values and higher model efficiency. Thus, these approaches can be effectively used for precise yield prediction of pigeon pea over different districts of Karnataka in India. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Society of Biometeorology.","Artificial neural network; Pigeon pea yield prediction; Random forest; Support vector machines; Weather variables","Cajanus; India; machine learning; weather; Cajanus; India; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Weather",Article,Scopus

The integrated use of climate and remote sensing data for predicting yield at regional and national scales has been previously investigated in various parts of the world. However, such attempts for national scale yield prediction, particularly in different planting zones in China have been rarely reported. For this purpose, this study explored the potential of nine climate variables, three remote sensing-derived metrics, and three machine learning methods (random forest, support vector machine, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) for predicting wheat yield based on data acquired during 2002–2010 from 1582 counties across China's three wheat planting zones. Our results illustrated large spatial divergences for yield prediction. The best performance (R2 = 0.79 and R2 = 0.66) was achieved for the northern winter wheat and northern spring wheat planting zones, respectively. Water-related climatic variables outperformed temperature-related variables, with the best individual predictive performance (R2 = 0.67). Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence had better performance (R2 = 0.60) for predicting the crop yield than NDVI and EVI. Climate data across the whole growing season has provided additional information for yield prediction as compared to remote sensing data. The additional contribution for yield prediction in winter wheat planting zones benefiting from climate data decreased from sowing to maturity, which was the opposite in remote sensing data. Typically, the support vector machine outperformed other models and the prediction in winter wheat planting zones performed better than the spring wheat planting zone. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating climate and remote sensing data for accurate county-level yield prediction in China. These kinds of simple and scalable machine learning methods could be targeted for further work by agricultural researchers and advisors. © 2022","Artificial intelligence; Climate data; Large scale; Remote sensing; Wheat yield prediction","artificial intelligence; crop yield; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; wheat; yield response; China",Review,Scopus

Temperature, rainfall amount, and reference evapotranspiration are major climatic factors affecting maize yield. They are not only interdependent but also have significantly changed due to climate change, which causes nonlinearity and nonstationarity in weather data. Hence, there exists a need for a stochastic process for predicting maize yield with higher precision. To solve the problem, this paper constructs a joint stochastic process that acquires joints effects of the three weather processes from joint a probability density function (pdf) constructed using copulas that maintain interdependence. Stochastic analyses are applied on the pdf and process to account for nonlinearity and nonstationarity, and also establish a corresponding stochastic differential equation (SDE) for maize yield. The trivariate stochastic process predicts maize yield with R2=0.8389 and MAPE=4.31% under a deep learning framework. Its aggregated values predict maize yield with R2 up to 0.9765 and MAPE=1.94% under common machine learning algorithms. Comparatively, the R2 is 0.8829% and MAPE=4.18%, under the maize yield SDE.

However, weather ensembles containing the unknown future weather conditions occurring after prediction dates are essential for such predictions using crop models. Two strategies were established for selecting analogue weather years as the target growing season based on a five-year maize experiment conducted at eight sites in the Loess Plateau of China. The first strategy tried weather data from different lengths of years ahead the planting year. The second strategy used the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm to select analogue weather according to different combinations of weather variables with daily or accumulative values. The results showed that satisfactory predictions could be obtained after maize tasseling (about 50 d prior to maturity). The mean absolute relative error (ARE) and coefficient of variation (CV) of the daily yield predictions after tasseling were 6.6% and 5.7%, respectively, in 2010 at the Yulin site. In the leading-year strategy, the most reliable predictions were obtained by the weather data from the 10 years ahead of planting, with an overall average ARE of 11.7%. In the k-NN strategy, the most reliable predictions were obtained by using the analogue weather selected with only accumulative precipitation, with an overall average ARE of 11.5%. Additionally, both of the two optimal strategies improved the original predictions in most cases. However, the k-NN strategy was more likely to generate worse predictions in the early part of the growing season. Generally, it was more convenient to use the weather data of 10 leading years before the planting year to represent the unknown weather data after the prediction dates.

A data assimilation method that combines crop growth models with remotely sensed data has been proven to be the most effective method for regional yield estimates. This paper describes an assimilation method that integrates a time series of leaf area index (LAI) retrieved from ETM+ data and a coupled hydrology-crop growth model which links a crop growth model World Food Study (WOFOST) and a hydrology model HYDRUS-1D for regional maize yield estimates using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The coupled hydrology-crop growth model was calibrated and validated using field data to ensure that the model accurately simulated associated state variables and maize growing processes. To identify the parameters that most affected model output, an extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (EFAST) was applied to the model before calibration. The calibration results indicated that the coupled hydrology-crop growth model accurately simulated maize growth processes for the local cultivation variety tested. The coefficient of variations (CVs) for LAI, total above-ground production (TAGP), dry weight of storage organs (WSO), and evapotranspiration (ET) were 13%, 6.9%, 11% and 20%, respectively. The calibrated growth model was then combined with the regional ETM+ LAI data using a sequential data assimilation algorithm (EnKF) to incorporate spatial heterogeneity in maize growth into the coupled hydrology-crop growth model. The theoretical LAI profile for the near future and the final yield were obtained through the EnKF algorithm for 50 sample plots. The CV of the regional yield estimates for these sample plots was 8.7%. Finally, the maize yield distribution for the Zhangye Oasis was obtained as a case study.

In the first phase, ACO is adopted to search for suitable, statistically relevant data stations for model training, and the corresponding test station by virtue of a feature selection strategy. An annual wheat yield time-series input dataset is constructed utilizing data from each selected training station (1981–2013) and applied against 6 test stations (with each case modelled with 26 station data as the input) to evaluate the hybrid ACO-OSELM model. The partial autocorrelation function is implemented to deduce statistically significant lagged data, and OSELM is applied to generate Wpred. The two-phase hybrid ACO-OSELM model is tested within the 6 agricultural districts (represented as stations) of Punjab province, Pakistan and the results are benchmarked with extreme learning machine (ELM) and random forest (RF) integrated with ACO (i.e., hybrid ACO-ELM and hybrid ACO-RF models, respectively). The performance of the ACO-OSELM model was proven to be good in comparison to ACO-ELM and ACO-RF models. The hybrid ACO-OSELM model revealed its potential to be implemented as a decision-making system for crop yield prediction in areas where a significant association with the historical agricultural crop is well-established. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"ant colony optimization; article; autocorrelation; decision making; feature selection; harvest; machine learning; nonhuman; Pakistan; prediction; random forest; time series analysis; wheat; algorithm; crop; education; machine learning; Algorithms; Crops, Agricultural; Education, Distance; Machine Learning; Triticum",Article,Scopus

This study used leaf reflectance from a spectroradiometer to model grain yield (GY) and aboveground biomass yield (ABY) of maize (Zea mays L.) at Aba Gerima catchment, Ethiopia. A FieldSpec IV (350–2,500 nm wavelengths) spectroradiometer was used to estimate the spectral reflectance of crop leaves during the grain-filling phase. The spectral vegetation indices, such as enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference VI (NDVI), green NDVI (GNDVI), soil adjusted VI, red NDVI, and simple ratio were deduced from the spectral reflectance. We used regression analyses to identify and predict GY and ABY at the catchment level. The coefficient of determination (R2), the root mean square error (RMSE), and relative importance (RI) were used for evaluating model performance. The findings revealed that the best-fitting curve was obtained between GY and NDVI (R2 = 0.70; RMSE = 0.065; P &lt; 0.0001; RI = 0.19), followed by EVI (R2 = 0.65; RMSE = 0.024; RI = 0.61; P &lt; 0.0001). While the best-fitting curve was obtained between ABY and GNDVI (R2 = 0.71; RI = 0.24; P &lt; 0.0001), followed by NDVI (R2 = 0.77; RI = 0.17; P &lt; 0.0001). The highest GY (7.18 ton/ha) and ABY (18.71 ton/ha) of maize were recorded at a soil bunded plot on a gentle slope. Combined spectral indices were also employed to predict GY with R2 (0.83) and RMSE (0.24) and ABY with R2 (0.78) and RMSE (0.12). Thus, the maize’s GY and ABY can be predicted with acceptable accuracy using spectral reflectance indices derived from spectroradiometer in an area like the Aba Gerima catchment. An estimation model of crop yields could help policy-makers in identifying yield-limiting factors and achieve decisive actions to get better crop yields and food security for Ethiopia. © 2022 Tiruneh et al.

Daily precipitation output from various sources for 7 years (2000–2007) was obtained and compared with corresponding ground-observed precipitation data for 16 ground stations across the northeast of Iran. Comparisons of ground-observed daily precipitation with corresponding data recorded by different sources of datasets showed a root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 3.5 for all data. AgMERRA and APHRODITE showed the highest correlation (0.68 and 0.87) and index of agreement (d) values (0.79 and 0.89) with ground-observed data. When daily precipitation data were aggregated over periods of 10 days, the RMSE values, r, and d values increased (30, 0.8, and 0.7) for AgMERRA, APHRODITE, PERSIANN, and TRMM precipitation data sources. The simulations of rainfed wheat leaf area index (LAI) and dry matter using various precipitation data, coupled with solar radiation and temperature data from observed ones, illustrated typical LAI and dry matter shape across all stations. The average values of LAImax were 0.78, 0.77, 0.74, 0.70, and 0.69 using PERSIANN, AgMERRA, ground-observed precipitation data, APHRODITE, and TRMM. Rainfed wheat grain yield simulated by using AgMERRA and APHRODITE daily precipitation data was highly correlated (r2 ≥ 70) with those simulated using observed precipitation data.

Therefore, this study addresses the effects of urban spatial temperatures considering anthropogenic heat release factors, with a focus on the mobility sector. An average summer temperature (avS) estimating model was developed with deep neural network (DNN) and random forest (RF) in detailed spatial units within a city (1 km spatial resolution) using eight mobility sector and four static sector indicators as input variables. The feasibility of introducing mobility indicators was verified by performing a correlation analysis between temperature and traffic flows. Mobility exhibited a higher correlation with the climate sector than with static road indicators. The RF model with mobility indicators effectively estimated spatial distribution of air temperatures, with an RMSE of 0.0777 and R2 of 0.9121, and outperformed the DNN model.

Previous studies have reported that conventional ML models fail to accurately simulate extreme flows which are crucial for design flood estimation and associated risk analysis in the context of climate change. Therefore, this study proposes a joint probabilistic rainfall-runoff model (JPRR) for improving high-to-extreme flow projection. With the aid of paired copula constructions, bootstrap aggregation, and multi-model ensemble approaches, the proposed model is able to effectively characterize the dependence relationships of predictors (i.e., precipitation time series with different moving sums) with various probability distributions. JPRR has been applied to four pristine basins in China, representing different climate zones and landscapes. The results reveal that JPRR significantly outperforms three well-known ML models (i.e., random forest, artificial neural networks, and long short-term memory) in high-to-extreme flow simulations. In JPRR, the copulas exhibiting the right tail dependence play a more important role in streamflow simulations at mountainous basins. Moreover, a significant difference in streamflow projections (from 2030 to 2099) derived from JPRR and benchmark models imply that flood risks from conventional ML models may be underestimated under changing climatic conditions. © 2022.

The results showed that GGCMs better simulated maize yields than those of other crops in the northeast, north, northwest, east, and center. GEPIC (CLM-CROP) performed best in simulating maize (wheat) yield in the north, east, and northwest (southwest and south), due to reasonable parameter (cultivar and phenology parameters) settings. Because the rice phenology parameters were calibrated against phenological observation networks and a simple nitrogen limitation index was introduced, ORCHIDEE-CROP performed well in rice yield simulation and soybean yield simulation (center and southwest). Among four crops, wheat has the largest yield gap (7.3-14.1%), in which the poor soil of northwest (14.1%) exposes wheat to relatively high nutritional stress.

We consider five drivers and apply the method to three forest sites in the United States. Besides performing the prediction in each site, we also conduct transfer learning by using the iLSTM model trained in one site to predict at other sites. Results show that the iLSTM model produces good NEE predictions for all three sites and, more importantly, it provides reasonable interpretations on the input driver's importance as well as their temporal importance on the NEE prediction. Additionally, the iLSTM model demonstrates good across-site transferability in terms of both prediction accuracy and interpretability.

However, empirical evidence regarding the effects of extreme weather conditions on crop yields remains incomplete. We examine the contribution of climate and weather to winter wheat yields in Ukraine, a leading crop exporter with some of the highest yield variabilities observed globally. We used machine learning to link daily climatic data with annual winter wheat yields from 1985 to 2018. We differentiated the impacts of long-term climatic conditions (e.g., temperature) and weather extremes (e.g., heat waves) on yields during the distinct developmental stages of winter wheat. Our results suggest that climatic and weather variables alone explained 54% of the wheat yield variability at the country level. Heat waves, tropical night waves, frost, and drought conditions, particularly during the reproductive and grain filling phase, constitute key factors that compromised wheat yields in Ukraine. Assessing the impacts of weather extremes on crop yields is urgent to inform strategies that help cushion farmers against growing production risks because these extremes will likely become more frequent and intense with climate change. © 2021, The Author(s).","Agriculture; Climatic change; Extreme events; Random forests; Ukraine; Yield variability","Climate change; Decision trees; Machine learning; Risk assessment; Climatic changes; Crop yield; Developmental stage; Extreme events; Heatwaves; Ukraine; Weather extremes; Wheat yield; Winter wheat yields; Yield variability; Crops; climate change; crop yield; drought; machine learning; weather forecasting; wheat; Ukraine",Article,Scopus

This review focuses on the use of recent technological advances in remote sensing and AI to improve the resilience of agricultural systems, and we will present a unique opportunity for the development of prescriptive tools needed to address the next decade's agricultural and human nutrition challenges. © 2020 The Authors",,"Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Climate change; Food supply; Information management; Remote sensing; Sustainable development; Agricultural system; Agriculture productions; Economic sustainability; Food production systems; Modern agricultures; Scientific advances; Scientific and technological innovations; Technological advances; Artificial intelligence; agriculture; artificial intelligence; big data; human; nutrition; quantitative analysis; remote sensing; review; agriculture; catering service; climate change; Agriculture; Artificial Intelligence; Climate Change; Food Supply; Humans; Remote Sensing Technology",Review,Scopus

In Agriculture, farmers have to do new learning to improve the economics of the country. In the old days, farmers automatically examine the weather conditions and start cropping, but at present due to illiteracy so many farmers are getting losses. In-order to overcome the problem, IoT and Machine learning are utilized to analyze climatic conditions like temperature, soil moisture levels, and pH levels, etc. with the help of sensors. But it possesses a problem with sensors there is an absence of communication between adjacent sensors, so to remove this 'Kalman-Filter' algorithm is used. Whenever the climate change, the information is updated to the farmers using Google Assistant with the help of vigilant messages and voice calls in the regional language. These sensor values are stored in the 'Adafruit' cloud storage.

Timely and reliable wheat yield prediction at a large scale is essential for the agricultural supply chain and global food security, especially in China as an important wheat producing and consuming country. The conventional approach using either climate or satellite data or both to build empirical and crop models has prevailed for decades. However, to what extent climate and satellite data can improve yield prediction is still unknown. In addition, socio-economic (SC) factors may also improve crop yield prediction, but their contributions need in-depth investigation, especially in regions with good irrigation conditions, sufficient fertilization, and pesticide application. Here, we performed the first attempt to predict wheat yield across China from 2001 to 2015 at the county-level by integrating multi-source data, including monthly climate data, satellite data (i.e., Vegetation indices (VIs), and SC factors. The results show that incorporating all the datasets by using three machine learning methods (Ridge Regression (RR), Random Forest (RF), and Light Gradient Boosting (LightGBM) can achieve the best performance in yield prediction (R2: 0.68~0.75), with the most individual contributions from climate (~0.53), followed by VIs (~0.45), and SC factors (~0.30). In addition, the combinations of VIs and climate data can capture inter-annual yield variability more effectively than other combinations (e.g., combinations of climate and SC, and combinations of VIs and SC), while combining SC with climate data can better capture spatial yield variability than others. Climate data can provide extra and unique information across the entire growing season, while the peak stage of VIs (Mar.~Apr.) do so. Furthermore, incorporating spatial information and soil proprieties into the benchmark models can improve wheat yield prediction by 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. The optimal wheat prediction can be achieved with approximately a two-month leading time before maturity. Our study develops timely and robust methods for winter wheat yield prediction at a large scale in China, which can be applied to other crops and regions. © 2020 by the authors.

The aim of this study is to develop and assess a coffee yield forecasting method at the regional scale in Dak Lak province in the central highlands of Vietnam using the Crop Growth Monitoring System Statistical Tool (CGMSstatTool— CST) software and vegetation biophysical variables (NDVI, LAI, and FAPAR) derived from satellite remote sensing (SPOT-VEGETATION and PROBA-V). There has been no research to date applying this approach to this specific crop, which is the main contribution of this study. The findings of this research reveal that the elaboration of multiple linear regression models based on a combination of information from satellite-derived vegetation biophysical variables (LAI, NDVI, and FAPAR) corresponding to the first six months of the years 2000–2019 resulted in coffee yield forecast models presenting satisfactory accuracy (Adj.R2 = 64 to 69%, RMSEp = 0.155 to 0.158 ton/ha and MAPE = 3.9 to 4.7%). These results demonstrate that the CST may efficiently predict coffee yields on a regional scale by using only satellite-derived vegetation biophysical variables.

Considering the efforts to establish a framework towards quantifying the crop yield prediction at regional scales are limited, we investigated the utility of combining crop model with the regional weather prediction model to forecast winter wheat yields over space. The exercise was performed for various lead-times in the regions of Punjab and Haryana for the years 2008–2009. A numerical weather prediction (NWP) model was used to generate micro-meteorological variables at different lead times (1-week, 2-weeks, 3-weeks and 5-weeks) ahead of crop harvest and used within the CERES-Wheat crop simulation model gridded framework at a spatial resolution of 10 km. Various scenarios of the yield forecasts were verified with district-wide reported yield values. Average deviations of −12 to 3% from the actual district-wise wheat yields were observed across the lead times. The 3-weeks-ahead yield forecasts yielded a maximum agreement index of 0.86 with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 327.75 kg/ha and a relative deviation of −5.35%. The critical crop growth stages were found to be highly sensitive to the errors in the weather forecast, and thus made a huge impact on the predicted crop yields. The 5-weeks-ahead weather forecasts generated anomalous meteorological data during flowering and grain-filling crop growth stages, and thus had the highest negative impact on the simulated yields. The agreement index of the 5-week-ahead forecasts was 0.41 with an RMSE of 415.15 kg ha−1 and relative deviation of −2.77 ± 5.01. The proposed methodology showed significant forecast skill for extended space and time scale crop yield forecasting, offering scope for further research and practical applicability. © 2022 by the authors.","CERES-wheat model; crop-climate model integration; spatial crop yield modelling; winter wheat yield forecasts; WRF weather model",,Article,Scopus

Consequently, model simulations can be obtained only at a limited number of locations, i.e. at weather stations with long-term records of daily data. To estimate the potential crop production at country level, we present in this study a geostatistical approach for spatial interpolation and aggregation of crop growth model outputs. As case study, we interpolated, simulated and aggregated crop growth model outputs of sorghum and millet in West-Africa. We used crop growth model outputs to calibrate a linear regression model using environmental covariates as predictors. The spatial regression residuals were investigated for spatial correlation. The linear regression model and the spatial correlation of residuals together were used to predict theoretical crop yield at all locations using kriging with external drift. A spatial standard deviation comes along with this prediction, indicating the uncertainty of the prediction. In combination with land use data and country borders, we summed the crop yield predictions to determine an area total. With spatial stochastic simulation, we estimated the uncertainty of that total production potential as well as the spatial cumulative distribution function. We compared our results with the prevailing agro-ecological Climate Zones approach used for spatial aggregation. Linear regression could explain up to 70% of the spatial variation of the yield. In three out of four cases the regression residuals showed spatial correlation. The potential crop production per country according to the Climate Zones approach was in all countries and cases except one within the 95% prediction interval as obtained after yield aggregation. We concluded that the geostatistical approach can estimate a country's crop production, including a quantification of uncertainty. In addition, we stress the importance of the use of geostatistics to create tools for crop modelling scientists to explore relationships between yields and spatial environmental variables and to assist policy makers with tangible results on yield gaps at multiple levels of spatial aggregation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..","Geostatistics; Spatial aggregation; Spatial prediction; Uncertainty; Yield gap; Yield potential","aggregation behavior; agricultural modeling; agrometeorology; crop production; data acquisition; geostatistics; growth rate; millet; planning method; policy making; prediction; sorghum; spatial analysis; uncertainty analysis; West Africa",Article,Scopus

Growing research investigation to establish climate change, implications in the sectors are influencing the connection. Forecasting maize output with some lead time can help producers to prepare for requirement and, in many cases, limited human resources, as well as support in strategic business decisions. The major purpose is to illustrate the relationship between various climatic characteristics and maize production, as well as to predict forecasts using ARIMA and machine learning approaches. When compared to ARIMA, the proposed method performs better in forecasting maize yields. Consequently, the neural network provides the majority of the prospective talents for forecasting maize production. Seasonal growth is susceptible of forecasting crop yields with tolerable competencies, and efforts are essential to quantify the proposed methodology that forecasts overall crop yield in diverse neighbourhoods in Saudi Arabia’s regions. The proposed combined ARIMA-LSTM model requires less training, with parameter adjustment having less effect on data prediction without bias. To monitor progress, the model may be trained repeatedly using roll back. The correlations between estimated yield and measured yield at irrigation and rain-fed sites were analysed to further validate the robustness of the optimal ARIMA-LSTM method, and the results demonstrated that the proposed model can serve as an effective approach for different types of sampling sites and has better adaptability to inter-annual fluctuations in climate with findings indicating a dependable and viable method for enhancing yield estimates. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences & Polish Academy of Sciences.","Agriculture; Maize; Prediction; Saudi Arabia; Time series","Climate change; Climate models; Long short-term memory; Time series; Time series analysis; Weather forecasting; Crop yield; Extreme weather events; Human support; Leadtime; Machine-learning; Maize; Maize production; Maize yield; Saudi Arabia; Times series; Crops; crop production; crop yield; forecasting method; machine learning; maize; prediction; statistical analysis; Saudi Arabia",Article,Scopus

Agricultural systems that rely on monsoon rainfall are especially vulnerable to changes in climate variability. This paper uses machine learning to deepen understanding of how monsoon variability impacts agricultural productivity. We demonstrate that random forest modelling is effective in representing rice production variability in response to monsoon weather variability. Our random forest modelling found monsoon weather predictors explain similar levels of detrended anomaly variation in both rice yield (33%) and area harvested (35%). The role of weather in explaining harvested rice area highlights that production area changes are an important pathway through which weather extremes impact agricultural productivity, which may exacerbate losses that occur through changes in per-area yields. We find that downwelling shortwave radiation flux is the most important weather variable in explaining variation in yield anomalies, with proportion of area under irrigation being the most important predictor overall. Machine learning modelling is capable of representing crop-climate variability in monsoonal agriculture and reveals additional information compared to traditional parametric models. For example, non-linear yield and area responses of irrigation, monsoon onset and season length all match biophysical expectations. Overall, we find that random forest modelling can reveal complex non-linearities and interactions between climate and rice production variability. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"agriculture; article; climate change; crop; expectation; India; machine learning; nonhuman; nonlinear system; plant yield; productivity; random forest; rice; season; weather",Article,Scopus

This challenge is even more complex, particularly in the recent years where climate change is also continuously changing the weather patterns, against which, drainage systems are designed to cope with. Addressing these challenges using conventional agricultural drainage approaches may not be effective, as they do not provide a means of projecting future drainage system performance levels. Of importance is also to use drainage design approaches that consider inputs and experiences from water managers, planners, and designers with various levels of skills. In this regard, two issues need to be balanced when designing agricultural drainage systems; first, to ensure the design approach is user-friendly and inclusive of both middle and higher level decision makers, and, secondly, that the designed drainage system copes with future drainage needs. Using a sugarcane field in Pongola, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, as an experimental field, this study assessed the performance of EnDrain model to inform drainage design-related decisions.

Inspired by video prediction and exploiting the availability of Copernicus Sentinel-2 images, recent studies have attempted to forecast the land surface evolution as a function of past land surface evolution, elevation, and weather. Further extending this paradigm, we propose a model based on convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) that is computationally efficient (lightweight), however obtains superior results to the previous baselines. By introducing a ConvLSTM-based architecture to this problem, we can not only ingest the heterogeneous data sources (Sentinel-2 time-series, weather data, and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM)) but also explicitly condition the future predictions on the weather. Our experiments confirm the importance of weather parameters in understanding the land cover dynamics and show that weather maps are significantly more important than the DEM in this task.

It is the primary source of food for the whole world's population. It does, however, confront a significant challenge: producing more and better while also boosting sustainability via prudent use of natural resources, decreasing environmental damage, and responding to climate change. As a result, it is critical to the transition from old to contemporary farming practices. Precision agriculture is one of the options for addressing the increased need for food while also maintaining sustainability. The importance of information is growing in Precision Agriculture. Information about weather conditions, soils, illnesses, insects, seeds, fertilizers, and other factors contribute significantly to the sector's economic and long-term development. The collection, transmission, selection, and analysis of data are all part of Precision management. As the amount of agricultural data grows, powerful analytical approaches capable of processing and evaluating enormous volumes of data to acquire more trustworthy information and much more precise forecasts are becoming increasingly important for handling real-time data analysis with vast data, Data Mining is projected to play a critical role in Precision Agriculture.

Extreme wheat price volatility can contribute to broader social risks in terms of food security, human development and have a significant influence on farmers' incomes in the coming years especially in developing countries like Pakistan. Wheat is not only the major staple crop of the country's food security, but it also contributes about 10.3% in agriculture which accounts for 2.2% of domestic GDP. However, the presumable intensification in climate change and macroeconomic instability is reputed as a threat to wheat price stability nationwide. Against this backdrop, this research develops a precise wheat price puzzle forecasting model using the Long- Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNN) - an application of Artificial Intelligence. LSTM-RNN are proficient in handling non-linear complex systems owing to their special LSTM nodes. An assessment of the planned framework with a handful of prevailing models is also discussed. Results showed that LSTM-RNN outperformed in terms of accuracy and uncovered that wheat prices will progressively swell and shrink by 2030, which will pose menaces to the whole economy. Moreover, our proposed methodology may be used as a guiding principle for other crops as well, to fortify sustainable agriculture development by 2030. © 2022 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; LSTM-RNN; Pakistan; wheat price puzzle","Climate change; Crops; Developing countries; Economics; Food supply; Epicentre; Food security; Global food security; Human development; Long- short term memory recurrent neural network; Pakistan; Price puzzles; Price volatility; Social risks; Wheat price puzzle; Long short-term memory",Conference Paper,Scopus

Despite the fact that deep neural network (DNN) models are increasingly applied across a wide range of fields, there are very few attempts to predict leaf photosynthetic capacity (indicated by maximum carboxylation rate, Vcmax, and maximum electron transport rate, Jmax) from reflected information. In this study, we have built a DNN model that uses leaf reflected spectra, alone or together with other leaf traits, for the reliable estimation of photosynthetic capacity, accounting for leaf types and growing periods in cool–temperate deciduous forests. Our results demonstrate that even though DNN models using only the reflectance spectra are capable of estimating both Vcmax and Jmax acceptably, their performance could nevertheless be improved by including information about other leaf biophysical/biochemical traits. The results highlight the fact that leaf spectra and leaf biophysical/biochemical traits are closely linked with leaf photosynthetic capacity, providing a practical and feasible approach to tracing functional traits. However, the DNN models developed in this study should undergo more extensive validation and training before being applied in other regions, and further refinements in future studies using larger datasets from a wide range of ecosystems are also necessary. © 2021 by the authors.

Effective disaster management to cope with future climate change, especially extreme precipitation, requires a robust framework to estimate such damage. For this study, we develop a model based on a convolutional neural network to estimate the area (in acres) of cropland damaged by flooding at the county level. Then we demonstrate the model's performance for the period 2008-2019 over corn and soybean fields in the midwestern United States, which suffer frequent damage from recurrent flooding. We fed the network with remote sensing images and weather fields and divide the growing season into two windows, the early season (May-June) and the late season (July-November) for better performance. The results show mean relative error within ± 25% and relative root mean square error within 35%-75% in majority of the counties for most years. Finally, we show that the model forced with meteorological variables alone can provide acceptable accuracy, which indicates it can be applied to forecasting crop damage area in the upcoming season or the studying of future climate impact on crop productivity.

The material used in the study were taste scores of 232 grape varieties from the Don Ampelographic Collection (47°250 N 40°030 E) 1981-2019. The correlation analysis, ANOVA, and regression were used. It was shown that GS negatively correlated with productivity, and WS with the berry mass of variety. In recent decades, GS have increased in groups of varieties of various interspecies origin, and WS have not changed. Regression models revealed that the reason for GS improvement was in the growth of average temperature above 15 _C, while WS varied depending on the sum of precipitation for the period with temperatures above 20 °C, which did not have a reliable trend.

Research has been conducted to estimate crop biophysical parameters by destructive and non-destructive approaches. In particular, researchers have investigated the potential of various analytical methods to determine a range of crop parameters using remote sensing data and methods. To this end, they have investigated diverse sources of Earth observations, including radar and optical images with various spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. This paper reviews and analyzes publications from the past 30 years to identify trends in crop monitoring research using remote sensing data and tools. This analysis is accomplished through a systematic review of 277 papers and documents the methods, challenges, and opportunities frequently cited in the scientific literature. The results revealed that research in this field had increased dramatically over this study period.

To inform decisions, it is also crucial to quantify the forecasting uncertainty and prove its relevance for food security. Yet, in previous studies both these aspects have been largely overlooked. This paper develops a methodology to anticipate the agricultural Vegetation Health Index (VHI) while making the underlying prediction uncertainty explicit. To achieve this aim, a probabilistic machine learning framework modelling weather and climate determinants is introduced and implemented through Quantile Random Forests. In a second step, a statistical link between VHI forecasts and monthly food price variations is established. As a pilot implementation, the framework is applied to nine countries of South-East Asia (SEA) with consideration of national monthly rice prices. Model benchmarks show satisfactory accuracy metrics, suggesting that the probabilistic VHI predictions can provide decision-makers with reliable information about future cropland health and its impact on food price variation weeks or even months ahead, albeit with increasing uncertainty as the forecasting horizon grows. These results - ultimately allowing to anticipate the impact of weather shocks on household food expenditure - contribute to advancing the multidisciplinary literature linking vegetation health, probabilistic forecasting models, and food security policy. © 2022 The Authors","Food security; Probabilistic machine learning; Remote sensing of the environment; Vegetation health; Vulnerability analysis","Agriculture; Climate change; Decision trees; Food supply; Forecasting; Health; Machine learning; Population statistics; Remote sensing; Food security; Machine-learning; Probabilistic forecasting; Probabilistic machine learning; Probabilistic machines; Remote sensing of the environment; Remote-sensing; Vegetation health; Vegetation health indices; Vulnerability analysis; Vegetation; agricultural land; food security; forecasting method; machine learning; probability; remote sensing; vegetation; vulnerability; Article; climate change; controlled study; cropland; food security; forecasting; household; household food expenditure; machine learning; quantile random forest; random forest; reliability; remote sensing; vegetation; Vegetation Health Index; weather; agriculture; climate change; crop; food security; forecasting; Agriculture; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Food Security; Forecasting",Article,Scopus

These local farmers contribute towards food security and they are part of organic food producers here in South Africa since most of them relied only on natural resources to grow crops. However, many technological developments are not paying enough attention on them. They are not equipped with irrigation systems and agricultural machineries to help with cropping. Most of them are technological and educationally semi-literate and financially volatile. Because of rapid increase and unpredictability of climate, these local farmers are severely suffering. They are constantly experiencing poor crop yield because of season transition variations caused by climate change. Due to these variations, it becomes difficult for farmers to spot the onset of agricultural season to enable good establishment of crops. A transition to agricultural season can be foreseen by using indigenous knowledge indicators and observing the movement of temperature and vegetation cover. During the onset of the warm agricultural season, healthy vegetation cover increases as the temperature increases and vis-versa during the onset of the cold agricultural season. This is because many plants are vulnerable to cold temperature. In this paper we optimize local farmers' agricultural season transition predictions by integrating the indigenous knowledge with satellite imagery data, climate data and ARIMA family models. © 2020 IEEE.","auto regressive integrated moving average; indigenous knowledge; season transition assurance operator","Agricultural robots; Autoregressive moving average model; Climate change; Crops; Data integration; Food supply; Satellite imagery; Small satellites; Vegetation; Indigenous knowledge; Irrigation systems; Rain fed agriculture; Satellite imagery data; Small scale farmers; Technological development; Temperature increase; Transition prediction; Climate models",Conference Paper,Scopus

Given these challenges, food security is included in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based method is employed to evaluate crop condition by inter-annual comparisons of both spatial variability (using NDVI images) and seasonal dynamics (based on crop condition profiles). Since this type of method will generate false information if there are changes in crop rotation, cropping area or crop phenology, information on cropped/uncropped arable land is integrated to improve the accuracy of crop condition monitoring. The study proposes a new method to retrieve adjusted NDVI for cropped arable land during the growing season of winter crops by integrating 16-day composite Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data at 250-m resolution with a cropped and uncropped arable land map derived from the multi-temporal China Environmental Satellite (Huan Jing Satellite) charge-coupled device (HJ-1 CCD) images at 30-m resolution. Using the land map's data on cropped and uncropped arable land, a pixel-based uncropped arable land ratio (UALR) at 250-m resolution was generated. Next, the UALR-adjusted NDVI was produced by assuming that the MODIS reflectance value for each pixel is a linear mixed signal composed of the proportional reflectance of cropped and uncropped arable land. When UALR-adjusted NDVI data are used for crop condition assessment, results are expected to be more accurate, because: (i) pixels with only uncropped arable land are not included in the assessment; and (ii) the adjusted NDVI corrects for interannual variation in cropping area. On the provincial level, crop growing profiles based on the two kinds of NDVI data illustrate the difference between the regular and the adjusted NDVI, with the difference depending on the total area of uncropped arable land in the region. The results suggested that the proposed method can be used to improve the assessment of early crop condition, but additional evaluation in other major crop producing regions is needed to better assess the method's application in other regions and agricultural systems. © 2014 by the authors.","Crop condition assessment; Cropped and uncropped arable land; Linear unmixing; NDVI; North China Plain","Agriculture; Charge coupled devices; Condition monitoring; Cultivation; Forestry; Image reconstruction; Land use; Pixels; Radiometers; Reflection; Satellite imagery; Arable land; Crop condition; Linear unmixing; NDVI; North China Plain; Crops",Article,Scopus

The results of earlier techniques of data collecting and analysis for yield forecasts were typically delayed, expensive, time-consuming, site-specific, and riddled with errors and uncertainties. This study is a novel approach to using high-resolution satellite data in conjunction with environmental and topographic data to predict wheat yield variability at the farm scale using machine learning. In this research, winter wheat yield prediction was based on 36 indicators in machine learning using correlation and different regression models. Winter wheat yield was predicted using linear regression (LR), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) regression models with scikit-learn in machine learning. More than 10,000 data points from 45 farms were trained and validated in Fergana valley, Central Asia. Results indicate that at 10 m resolution using Sentinel-2 and other secondary data such as topographic, soil, environmental, and filed data can generate an accurate wheat yield prediction map. The accuracy of all regressions is lowest for LR (R2:95, RMSE: 2.31), highest for RF (R2:98, RMSE: 1.40), and intermediate for DT regression (R2:97, RMSE: 1.85). Results also indicate that prediction in the early stage of the crop is less accurate in comparison to harvesting time as LR (R2:85, RMSE: 2.66), DT (R2:95, RMSE: 2.06), RF (R2:97, RMSE: 1.54) have different R2 and RMSE values. Appling the RF model, the winter wheat prediction is 3.29 to 4.30 t/ha therefore the total wheat production is approximately 100 t in the study area. Thus this study will demonstrate the capability of high-resolution satellite imagery and secondary data for highly accurate real-time crop yield prediction at the field scale, which can be used to assist precision agriculture and will provide a point of reference for crop area extraction, mapping, monitoring, and sustainable development with food security. © 2022 The Authors","Food security; Machine learning; Phenology; Precision agriculture; Regression; Sentinel-2; Spectral-indices; Yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

Compared to most wheat producing areas, this island is characterized by wet climate owing to greater annual precipitation and abundant snowmelt water supply in spring. Based on yield statistics collected from 119 municipalities for 14 years (N = 1,516) and high-resolution surface meteorological data, correlation analyses showed that precipitation, daily minimum air temperature, and irradiance during the grain-filling period had significant effects on the yield throughout the island while the effect of snow depth in early winter and spring was dependent on sites. Using 10-d mean meteorological data within a certain period between seeding and harvest as predictor variables and one-year-leave-out cross-validation procedure, performance of machine learning models based on neural network (NN), random forest (RF), support vector machine regression (SVR), partial least squares regression (PLS), and cubist regression (CB) were compared to a multiple linear regression model (MLR) and a null model that returns an average yield of the municipality. The root mean square errors of PLS, SVR, and RF were 872, 982, and 1,024 kg ha−1 and were smaller than those of MLR (1,068 kg ha−1) and null model (1,035 kg ha−1). These models outperformed the controls in other metrics including Pearson's correlation coefficient and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. Variable importance analysis on PLS indicated that minimum air temperature and precipitation during the grain-filling period had major roles in the prediction and excluding predictors in this period (i.e. yield forecast with a longer lead-time) decreased forecast performance of the models. These results were consistent with our understanding of meteorological impacts on wheat yield, suggesting usefulness of explainable machine learning in meteorological crop yield prediction under wet climate.

Early estimation of yield at field or plot scale also contributes to high-throughput plant phenotyping and precision agriculture. New developments in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms and sensor technology facilitate cost-effective data collection through simultaneous multi-sensor/multimodal data collection at very high spatial and spectral resolutions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the power of UAV-based multimodal data fusion using RGB, multispectral and thermal sensors to estimate soybean (Glycine max) grain yield within the framework of Deep Neural Network (DNN). RGB, multispectral, and thermal images were collected using a low-cost multi-sensory UAV from a test site in Columbia, Missouri, USA. Multimodal information, such as canopy spectral, structure, thermal and texture features, was extracted and combined to predict crop grain yield using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), input-level feature fusion based DNN (DNN-F1) and intermediate-level feature fusion based DNN (DNN-F2). The results can be summarized in three messages: (1) multimodal data fusion improves the yield prediction accuracy and is more adaptable to spatial variations; (2) DNN-based models improve yield prediction model accuracy: the highest accuracy was obtained by DNN-F2 with an R2 of 0.720 and a relative root mean square error (RMSE%) of 15.9%; (3) DNN-based models were less prone to saturation effects, and exhibited more adaptive performance in predicting grain yields across the Dwight, Pana and AG3432 soybean genotypes in our study. Furthermore, DNN-based models demonstrated consistent performance over space with less spatial dependency and variations. This study indicates that multimodal data fusion using low-cost UAV within a DNN framework can provide a relatively accurate and robust estimation of crop yield, and deliver valuable insight for high-throughput phenotyping and crop field management with high spatial precision. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Data fusion; Deep learning; Multimodality; Phenotyping; Remote sensing; Spatial autocorrelation; Yield prediction","autocorrelation; crop yield; data set; food security; machine learning; numerical model; phenotype; policy making; prediction; remote sensing; soybean; spectral resolution; unmanned vehicle; Columbia [Missouri]; Missouri; United States; Glycine max",Article,Scopus

However, weather conditions and relatively long revisit cycles often result in an insufficient number of continuous medium-high resolution images over large areas for many years. In addition, the cropland pattern changes frequently in the fallow rotation area. A novel rapid mapping model for winter wheat based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series coefficient of variation (NDVI_COVfp) and peak-slope difference index (PSDI) is proposed in this study. NDVI_COVfp uses the time-series index volatility to distinguish cultivated land from background land-cover types. PSDI combines the key growth stages of winter wheat phenology and special bimodal characteristics, substantially reducing the impact of abandoned land and other crops. Taking the Heilonggang as an example, this study carried out a rapid mapping of winter wheat for four consecutive years (2014–2017), and compared the proposed COV_PSDI with two state-of-the-art methods and traditional methods (the Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM) and the Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm (ISODATA)). The verification results revealed that the COV_PSDI model improved the overall accuracy (94.10%) by 4% compared with the two state-of-art methods (90.80%, 89.00%) and two traditional methods (90.70%, 87.70%). User accuracy was the highest, which was 93.74%. Compared with the other four methods, the percentage error (PE) of COV_PSDI for four years was the lowest in the same year, with the minimum variation range of PE being 1.6–3.6%. The other methods resulted in serious overestimation. This demonstrated the effectiveness and stability of the method proposed in the rapid and accurate extraction of winter wheat in a large area of fallow crop rotation region.

A typical machine learning algorithm often uses real data to predict crop yield. In this study, we used data generated by the Wild Blueberry Pollination Model, a spatially explicit simulation model validated by field observation and experimental data collected in Maine USA during the last 30 years. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the relative importance of bee species composition and weather factors in regulating wild blueberry agroecosystems. Specifically, we sought to reveal how bee species composition and weather affect yield and to predict optimal bee species composition and weather conditions that achieve the best yield using computer simulation and machine learning algorithms. Multiple linear regression (MLR), boosted decision trees (BDT), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were evaluated as predictive tools. We also performed a predictor selection before submitting our data to the learning algorithms. In this way, we are able to reduce the dimension of the input without a significant drop in prediction accuracy. As a result, clone size, honeybee, bumblebee, Andrena bee species, Osmia bee species, maximum of upper-temperature ranges, and the number of days with precipitation were chosen as the best predictor variable subset. The results showed that the XGBoost outperformed other algorithms in all measures of model performance for predicting the yield of wild blueberry by achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.938, root mean square error (RMSE) of 343.026, mean absolute error (MAE) of 206 and relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of 5.444%. The results are consistent with previous work on predicting wild blueberry fruit yield using digital color photography by (Zaman et al., 2008).

However, it is still challenging to predict the grassland degradation status on a large scale because it is a multi-factorial phenomenon with complex changes in ecosystem structure and function, which is hard to be fully characterized through mechanism models. The emergence of machine learning algorithms provides a potential to model complex systems and mine information from multi-source data without elucidating underlying mechanisms. Here, we utilized random forest and neural network algorithms to predict the grassland degradation represented by the net primary productivity (NPP) changing rate based on multi-source data including geographic, meteorological, plant traits, land use type and microbial variables in the Chinese Northern grassland. Particularly, the microbial roles in determining the degradation status were concerned. Results show that a high prediction precision was achieved by random forest model, rather than by neural network model, with a mean relative error of 16.9% and a mean square error of 9.273e-05.

Accordingly, the objective of this investigation was to develop a method that can accurately define the most suitable environment in the greenhouse for an optimal yield of roses. Herein, an optimal and highly accurate BO-DNN surrogate model was developed (based on 300 experimental data points) for a quick and reliable classification of the rose yield environment considering some of the most influential variables including soil humidity, temperature and humidity of air, CO2 concentration, and light intensity (lux) into its architecture. Initially, two BO techniques (GP and GBRT) are used for the tuning process of the hyper-parameters (such as learning rate, batch size, number of dense nodes, number of dense neurons, number of input nodes, activation function, etc.). After that, an optimal and simple combination of the hyper-parameters was selected to develop a DNN algorithm based on 300 data points, which was further used to classify the rose yield environment (the rose yield environments were classified into four classes such as soil without water, correct environment, too hot, and very cold environments). The very high accuracy of the proposed surrogate model (0.98) originated from the introduction of the most vital soil and meteorological parameters as the inputs of the model. The proposed method can help in identifying intelligent greenhouse environments for efficient crop yields. © 2021 by the authors.

An important outcome of this reality is the qualitative and quantitative degradation of groundwater, which clearly indicates the need to exploit surface runoff. This study presents an integrated Geographic Information System (GIS)-based methodological framework for revealing and selecting suitable locations to build small-scale reservoirs and exploit surface runoff. In this framework, the SWAT model was used to quantify surface runoff, followed by the simulation of reservoir scenarios through reservoir simulation software. Andros Island (located in Cyclades Prefecture), Greece was selected as the study area. The obtained results indicated the most suitable location for creating a reservoir for maximizing exploitation of surface runoff, based on the specific water demands of the nearby areas and the existing meteorological, hydrological, and geological background potential. Thus, two selected dam locations are analyzed by using the proposed framework. The findings showed that the first dam site is inappropriate for creating a reservoir, as it cannot meet the demand for large water extraction volumes. In addition, the outcomes confirmed the efficiency of the proposed methodology in optimum selection of locations to construct small-scale water exploitation works.

Irrigation plays an essential role in sustaining crop production in water-limited regions, as irrigation water not only benefits crops through fulfilling crops' water demand but also creates an evaporative cooling that mitigates crop heat stress. Here we use satellite remote sensing and maize yield data in the state of Nebraska, USA, combined with statistical models, to quantify the contribution of cooling and water supply to the yield benefits due to irrigation. Results show that irrigation leads to a considerable cooling on daytime land surface temperature (−1.63°C in July), an increase in enhanced vegetation index (+0.10 in July), and 81% higher maize yields compared to rainfed maize. These irrigation effects vary along the spatial and temporal gradients of precipitation and temperature, with a greater effect in dry and hot conditions, and decline toward wet and cool conditions. We find that 16% of irrigation yield increase is due to irrigation cooling, while the rest (84%) is due to water supply and other factors. The irrigation cooling effect is also observed on air temperature (−0.38 to −0.53°C) from paired flux sites in Nebraska. This study highlights the non-negligible contribution of irrigation cooling to the yield benefits of irrigation, and such an effect may become more important in the future with continued warming and more frequent droughts. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","cooling; irrigation; LST; maize yield; water","climate change; crop production; crop yield; global climate; irrigation; maize; remote sensing; vegetation index; water demand; water supply; Midwest; Nebraska; United States; Zea mays; climate change; crop; drought; irrigation (agriculture); maize; temperature; Agricultural Irrigation; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Droughts; Temperature; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

A classification of carbon models was developed; global (carbon-nitrogen and multi-element) and ecosystem models were singled out. The latter ones fall into carbon cycle models (agroecosystem, phytocenosis, and greenhouse gases (CO2and CH4) emissions) and carbon-nitrogen cycle models (various ecosystems, forest, and microbiological). The following difficulties arising when mathematical methods are used for description of the carbon cycle were discussed: multiple methods of calculation; high requirements to input data; limited availability of input information; necessity to consider climate change; errors in description of the functional dependence of CO2emission on temperature. The challenges of quantitative evaluation of components of the carbon biogeochemical cycle were analyzed, i.e., the dual role of soil both as a carbon stock and a source of car-bon compounds, which are greenhouse gases, as well as the interaction of carbon and nitrogen cycles, separation of the pool of soil organic carbon into fractions, and the ratio of microbial and root respirations. Further development of the obtained models will help to better assess greenhouse gases fluxes, to properly determine the effect of climatic and anthropogenic factors on them, and to create a strategy for reducing their emissions. © 2020 Kazan Federal University.

The agriculture industry is one of the most challenging areas for these changes, especially in Northern Ireland, as agriculture is one of the larger industries. Research has been carried out across the island of Ireland into methods of improving farm efficiency in multiple areas of farming, including livestock health, machinery improvements, and crop growth. Research has been carried out in this study into grass growth in the dairy farming sector, specifically within Northern Ireland. Grass growth prediction aims to inform farmers and policy makers in their decision-making process regarding sustainable land management in agriculture. The present work focuses on analysing and evaluating how data-driven classifiers can be used for grass growth prediction using the data related to soil content, weather, grass quality components etc. Four classifiers, namely Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and Neural Networks, are chosen for this purpose. Classification results based on a real-world data set are analysed and compared to evaluate and illustrate the performance and robustness of the classifiers. The results indicate that it is difficult to declare a single classifier with the highest performance and robustness. Nevertheless, it indicates that tree classification methods are better suited to the data to be studied, as opposed to probabilistic methods and weighted methods, e.g., the naïve Bayes classifier obtained a predictive performance of 78% when classifying spring seasonal grass growth data. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change; Data-driven classifier; Grass growth prediction","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Decision making; Decision trees; Forecasting; Forestry; Information management; Knowledge based systems; Land use; Machinery; Agriculture industries; Classification methods; Classification results; Decision making process; Predictive performance; Probabilistic methods; Quality components; Sustainable land managements; Classification (of information)",Conference Paper,Scopus

Five estimation methods developing with RS information for energy crop biomass are summarized in this paper. Firstly, the statistical analysis with vegetation index can be regarded as the commonest method. But it is faulted for the deficiency of sample data and the vulnerability to the influence of many factors such as cloudy days. Secondly, the longer wavelength makes SAR information popular for crop biomass estimation. But many limitations lead to measurement uncertainty and bring about poor classification. Thirdly, NPP can directly reflect accumulated biomass production through photosynthesis and measure the consequences caused by climate change and human activities. But, actual LUE, the results of environmental stresses such as light intensity, temperature, water, and nutrients, is usually considered as a constant. Fourthly, crop height information is vitally important for biomass estimation. Yet the corresponding application is often subject to many factors e.g. crop variety, growth period, and farmland management practices limits. Lastly, the most promising approach lies in the possibility of assimilating state variables from RS data into CGMs. And the advent of latest instruments with better characteristics offer a unique chance to overcome current limitations. In the end, the main challenges and opportunities for energy crop biomass estimation using RS information in the future are listed. © 2019","Crop height; Data assimilation; Energy crop biomass; NPP; SAR; Vegetation index","Biomass; Climate change; Remote sensing; Uncertainty analysis; Vegetation; Crop height; Data assimilation; Energy crops; Environmental stress; Management practices; Measurement uncertainty; Remote sensing information; Vegetation index; Crops; agricultural land; agricultural management; biomass; climate change; comparative study; crop plant; data assimilation; energy crop; environmental stress; estimation method; growth; management practice; NDVI; net primary production; photosynthesis; remote sensing; synthetic aperture radar",Review,Scopus

Accurate tracking and quantification of wildfires are important for climate modeling and ecological studies in this region. Remote sensing platforms (e.g., MODIS, Landsat) are valuable tools for mapping wildfire events (burned or burning areas) in Alaska. Deep neural networks (DNN) have exhibited superior performance in many classification problems, such as high-dimensional remote sensing data. Detection of wildfires is an imbalanced classification problem where one class contains a much smaller or larger sample size, and performance of DNNs can decline. We take a known weight-selection strategy during DNN training and apply those weights to MODIS variables (e.g., NDVI, surface reflectance) for binary classification (i.e., wildfire or no-wildfire) across Alaska during the 2004 wildfire year, when Alaska experienced a record number of large wildfires. The method splits the input training data into subsets, one for training the DNN to update weights and the other for performance validation to select the weights based on the best validation-loss score. This approach was applied to two sampled datasets, such as where the no-wildfire class can significantly outweigh the wildfire class. The normal DNN training strategy was unable to map wildfires for the highly imbalanced dataset; however, the weight-selection strategy was able to map wildfires very accurately (0.96 recall score for 78,702 wildfire pixels (500 × 500 m)). © 2018 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Imbalanced Classification; MODIS; Wildfire","Climate change; Data mining; Deep learning; Fires; Mapping; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Binary classification; Imbalanced classification; Imbalanced Data-sets; MODIS; Performance validation; Remote sensing data; Remote sensing platforms; Wildfire; Deep neural networks",Conference Paper,Scopus

Due to limitations of scale at which techniques can be applied and erosion processes assessed, this study describes a multi-process and multi-scale approach for soil erosion risk assessment under South African conditions. The framework includes assessment of sheet-rill erosion at a national scale based on the principles and components defined in the Universal Soil Loss Equation; gully erosion in a large catchment located in the Eastern Cape Province by integrating 11 important factors into a GIS; and sediment migration for a research catchment near Wartburg in KwaZulu-Natal by means of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool. Three hierarchical levels are presented in the framework, illustrating the most feasible erosion assessment techniques and input datasets that are required for application at a regional scale with proper incorporation of the most important erosion contributing factors.

The challenge of increasing crop yield while ensuring sustainable development of environmentally friendly agriculture is a common issue through-out the world. Autonomous systems, sensing technologies, and artificial intelligence offer great opportunities to tackle this issue. In precision agriculture (PA), non-destructive and non-invasive remote and proximal sensing methods have been widely used to observe crops in visible and invisible spectra. Nowadays, the integration of high-performance imagery sensors (e.g., RGB, multispec-tral, hyperspectral, thermal, and SAR) and unmanned mobile platforms (e.g., satellites, UAVs, and terrestrial agricultural robots) are yielding a huge number of high-resolution farmland images, in which rich crop information is compressed. However, this has been accompanied by challenges, i.e., ways to swiftly and efficiently making full use of these images, and then, to perform fine crop management based on information-supported decision making. In the past few years, deep learning (DL) has shown great potential to reshape many industries because of its powerful capabilities of feature learning from massive datasets, and the agriculture industry is no exception. More and more agricultural scientists are paying attention to applications of deep learning in image-based farmland observations, such as land mapping, crop classification, biotic/abiotic stress monitoring, and yield prediction. To provide an update on these studies, we conducted a comprehensive investigation with a special emphasis on deep learning in multiscale agricultural remote and proximal sensing. Specifically, the applications of convolutional neural network-based supervised learning (CNN-SL), transfer learning (TL), and few-shot learning (FSL) in crop sensing at land, field, canopy, and leaf scales are the focus of this review. We hope that this work can act as a reference for the global agricultural community regarding DL in PA and can inspire deeper and broader research to promote the evolution of modern agriculture. © 2022 by the authors.

The aim of this study is to develop an effective model for predicting crop yields in advance that is accessible and easy to use by the farmer or farm manager from a web-based application. In this case, an olive orchard in the Andalusia region of southern Spain was used. The model was estimated using spatio-temporal training data, such as yield data from eight consecutive years, and more than twenty meteorological parameters data, automatically charged from public web services, belonging to a weather station located near the sample farm.

In this study, a geostatistical approach for bias correction of daily precipitation at ungauged locations is presented. The method utilizes a double quantile mapping with dry day correction for future periods. The transfer function of the bias correction for the ungauged locations is established using distribution functions estimated by ordinary kriging with anisotropic variograms. The methodology was applied to the daily precipitation simulations of the entire CORDEX-Africa ensemble for a study region located in the West African Sudanian Savanna. This ensemble consists of 23 regional climate models (RCM) that were run for three different future scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5). The evaluation of the approach for a historical 50-year period (1950–2005) showed that the method can reduce the inherent strong precipitation bias of RCM simulations, thereby reproducing the main climatological features of the observed data. Moreover, the bias correction technique preserves the climate change signal of the uncorrected RCM simulations. However, the ensemble spread is increased due to an overestimation of the rainfall probability of uncorrected RCM simulations. The application of the bias correction method to the future period (2006–2100) revealed that annual precipitation increases for most models in the near (2020–2049) and far future (2070–2099) with a mean increase of up to a-1 (18%).

Regional maize production in Northeast China is critical for national or even global food security. In order to take preventive measures in combating the potential impacts of climate change on maize yield, it is imperative to evaluate historical climatic maize yield variation at finer scales in Northeast China. Previous scholars have achieved some good results in crop yield projection by using machine learning methods. However, climatic crop yield variation has rarely been addressed by considering the geographical factors (i.e., elevation, latitude, and longitude) of the meteorological stations used. In this study, based on 18 climatic elements during the period of 2003–2016, we compared the performance of three machine leaching methods, including neural network, support vector machine, and random forest, with multiple linear regression in evaluating climatic maize yield variation. Overall, machine learning methods are superior to traditional multilinear regression, particularly the neural network (with an R2 of 0.43 and an annual average MAE of 1.22 ton·ha−1). We selected the best machine learning methods and used the Bayesian method to integrate them as a new model.

Here we designated the lowest 10th percentile of the relative yield anomaly as yield shock and analyzed subnational wheat yield shocks across Europe during the last four decades. We applied a data-driven attribution framework to quantify primary climate drivers of wheat yield shock probability based on machine learning and game theory, and used this framework to infer the most critical climate variables that will contribute to yield shocks in the future, under two climate change scenarios. During the period 1980–2018, our attribution analysis showed that 32% of the observed wheat yield shocks were primarily driven by water limitation, making it the leading climate driver. Projection to future climate scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 suggested an increased risk of yield shock and a paradigm shift from water limitation dominated yield shock to extreme warming induced shocks over 2070–2099: 46% and 54% of areas were primarily driven by extreme warming under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively.

The study used an ensemble of nine bias-corrected EURO-CORDEX projections for two future horizons: 2021–2050 and 2071–2100 under two Representative Concentration Pathways: RCP4.5 and 8.5. Historical simulation results showed that SWAT was capable of capturing major SM deficit and excess episodes for different crops in Poland. For spring cereals, potato and maize, despite a large model spread, projections generally showed increase of severity of soil moisture deficits, as well as of total area affected by them. Ensemble median fraction of land with extreme soil moisture deficits, occupied by each of these crops, is projected to at least double in size. The signals of change in soil moisture excesses for potato and maize were more dependent on selection of RCP and future horizon. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"annual variation; climate change; crop yield; modeling; moisture content; rainfed agriculture; reconstruction; soil moisture; Poland [Central Europe]; Solanum tuberosum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Recent observations and modeling studies have suggested that the ice sheet contribution to future sea level rise could have been underestimated in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. The ensuing freshwater discharge coming from ice sheets could have significant impacts on global climate, and especially on the vulnerable tropical areas. During the last glacial/deglacial period, megadrought episodes were observed in the Sahel region at the time of massive iceberg surges, leading to large freshwater discharges. In the future, such episodes have the potential to induce a drastic destabilization of the Sahelian agro-ecosystem. Using a climate modeling approach, we investigate this issue by superimposing on the Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 (RCP8.5) baseline experiment a Greenland flash melting scenario corresponding to an additional sea level rise ranging from 0.5 m to 3 m. Our model response to freshwater discharge coming from Greenland melting reveals a significant decrease of the West African monsoon rainfall, leading to changes in agricultural practices. Combined with a strong population increase, described by different demography projections, important human migration flows could be potentially induced. We estimate that, without any adaptation measures, tens to hundreds million people could be forced to leave the Sahel by the end of this century. On top of this quantification, the sea level rise impact over coastal areas has to be superimposed, implying that the Sahel population could be strongly at threat in case of rapid Greenland melting.","Climate change; Ice sheet melting; Impact; Sahel; Vulnerability","fresh water; rain; sea water; Article; climate change; demography; Greenland; human; ice sheet; melting point; migration; population density; population migration; precipitation; priority journal; rural population; Sahel; surface area; vulnerable population; climate change; computer simulation; freezing; greenhouse effect; ice cover; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; time factor; water flow; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Freezing; Fresh Water; Global Warming; Greenland; Humans; Ice Cover; Models, Theoretical; Seawater; Time Factors; Water Movements",Article,Scopus

Assessing weather effects by statistical methods is a classical approach, but for obtaining robust results many details deserve attention and require individual decisions as is demonstrated in this paper. We evaluated regression models for annual yield changes of winter wheat and silage maize in more than 300 German counties and revised them to increase their predictive power. A major effort of this study was, however, aggregating separately estimated time series models (STSM) into panel data models (PDM) based on cluster analyses. The cluster analyses were based on the per-county estimates of STSM parameters. The original STSM formulations (adopted from a parallel study) contained also the non-meteorological input variables acreage and fertilizer price. The models were revised to use only weather variables as estimation basis. These consisted of time aggregates of radiation, precipitation, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration. Altering the input variables generally increased the predictive power of the models as did their clustering into PDM. For each crop, five alternative clusterings were produced by three different methods, and similarities between their spatial structures seem to confirm the existence of objective clusters about common model parameters. Observed smooth transitions of STSM parameter values in space suggest, however, spatial autocorrelation effects that could also be modeled explicitly. Both clustering and autocorrelation approaches can effectively reduce the noise in parameter estimation through targeted aggregation of input data. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cluster analysis; Crop yield estimation; Germany; Multivariate regression; Silage maize; Winter wheat","adaptive management; agricultural modeling; climate change; cluster analysis; crop yield; maize; model test; prediction; regression analysis; silage; wheat; winter; Germany; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The site was chosen as it consists of soil types being representative for many agricultural areas along the coast in Western Norway. The main objective of the experimental field was to investigate the effect of a subsurface drainage system on yield, runoff and nitrogen loss, nitrogen use efficiency and trafficability of ley production along the western coast of Norway and as such provide detailed information/knowledge about drainage criteria under present condition but not least under future condition with climate change. The experiment consists of four alternatives each having 4 subsurface drains. Two alternatives have a drain spacing of 6 m while the remaining two alternatives have a drain spacing of 12 m. Each of the 4 plots is divided into two subplots with two and three ley harvest respectively and two different levels of fertilizer application, being 190 and 290 kg ha1 nitrogen(N) respectively. The first results indicated that both drainage alternatives function satisfactorily. The measurements indicate that a part of the excess precipitation passes the subsurface drainage system towards the groundwater which implies also drainage of excess nitrogen towards the groundwater. The observations at Askvoll show large diurnal variations in discharge resulting in a significant difference in flashiness index (FI) when using hourly or average daily discharge values. The FI-values indicate that a narrower drain spacing has a higher FI, and thereby faster response to excess precipitation compared to a larger spacing. © 2016 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

The objective of this ongoing study is to assess the combined impacts of climate and land use changes on hydrologic processes including precipitation, streamflow, groundwater flow, and evapotranspiration in the 6, 417 km2 Salt River Basin (SRB) in Northeast Missouri. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to characterize hydrology in the SRB under varying future climate and land use scenarios. Model parameters were calibrated using streamflow data at ten USGS stations within the SRB, with model calibration from 2004-2008 and validation from 2009-2013. For future simulation, climate data from 2014-2060 were obtained from Downscaled CMIP5 Climate Projections. Two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) reflecting the range of radiative forcing levels, RCP 8.5 and 4.5 with 20 different model outputs for each RCP, were considered. Statistical downscaling methods, including delta method for temperature and quantile mapping for precipitation, were used to further downscale these data to the climate station level. Two land use scenarios were created with worst-case and best-case scenario and mapped by CLUE-S model to produce 30m × 30m resolution land use maps for the future period. The wide range of combinations of land use and climate change scenarios were examined to indicate possible outcomes useful for local and national agency application within the near (2020-2039) and far (2040-2059) future periods.","Climate change; CLUE-S; CMIP5; Land use change; Statistical downscale; Streamflow; SWAT; Watershed","Atmospheric radiation; Climate models; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Land use; Stream flow; Water resources; Watersheds; CLUE-S; CMIP5; Land-use change; Statistical downscale; SWAT; Climate change",Conference Paper,Scopus

Developing, calibrating and validating these models require a number of critical decisions that will influence the ability of the model to represent real world conditions. Understanding how these decisions influence model performance is crucial, especially when making science-based policy decisions. This study used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in West Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) to examine the influence of several of these decisions on hydrological processes and streamflow simulations. Specifically, this study addressed the following objectives (1) demonstrate the importance of considering intra-watershed processes during model development, (2) compare and evaluated spatial calibration versus calibration at outlet and (3) evaluate parameter transfers across temporal and spatial scales. A coarser resolution (HUC-12) model and a finer resolution model (NHDPlus model) were used to support the objectives. Results showed that knowledge of watershed characteristics and intra-watershed processes are critical to produced accurate and realistic hydrologic simulations. The spatial calibration strategy produced better results compared to outlet calibration strategy and provided more confidence. Transferring parameter values across spatial scales (i.e. from coarser resolution model to finer resolution model) needs additional fine tuning to produce realistic results. Transferring parameters across temporal scales (i.e. from monthly to yearly and daily time-steps) performed well with a similar spatial resolution model. Furthermore, this study shows that relying solely on quantitative statistics without considering additional information can produce good but unrealistic simulations. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Intra-watershed processes; NHD plus model; Spatial and temporal scale parameter transfer; Spatial calibration; SWAT","Calibration; Climate change; Lakes; Water pollution; Watersheds; Best management practice (BMPs); Calibration and validations; Soil and water assessment tool; Spatial calibration; SWAT; Temporal scale; Watershed process; Watershed simulation models; Climate models; calibration; decision analysis; flow modeling; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; model validation; spatiotemporal analysis; streamflow; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Erie",Article,Scopus

Developing parallel computing software to improve calibration efficiency has received growing attention of the watershed modeling community as it is very time demanding to run iteratively complex models for calibration. In this research, we introduce a Python-based parallel computing package, PP-SWAT, for efficient calibration of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. This software employs Python, MPI for Python (mpi4py) and OpenMPI to parallelize A Multi-method Genetically Adaptive Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm (AMALGAM), allowing for simultaneously addressing multiple objectives in calibrating SWAT. Test results on a Linux computer cluster showed that PP-SWAT can achieve a speedup of 45-109 depending on model complexity. Increasing the processor count beyond a certain threshold does not necessarily improve efficiency, because intensified resource competition may result in an I/O bottleneck. The efficiency achieved by PP-SWAT also makes it practical to implement multiple parameter adjustment schemes operating at different scales in affordable time, which helps provide SWAT users with a wider range of options of parameter sets to choose from for model(s) selection. PP-SWAT was not designed to address errors associated with other sources (e.g. model structure) and cautious supervision of its power should be exercised in order to attain physically meaningful calibration results. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Evolutionary multi-objective optimization; High performance computer; Parallel processing; Parameter calibration; Soil and water assessment tool","Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; High performance computers; Parallel processing; Parameter calibration; Soil and Water assessment tools; Algorithms; Calibration; Computer operating systems; Efficiency; High level languages; Iterative methods; Multiobjective optimization; Parallel architectures; Water resources; Watersheds; Climate models; calibration; climate change; human activity; hydrological modeling; multiobjective programming; numerical model; parallel computing; software; water resource; watershed",Article,Scopus

The duration of flower induction (DFI) for litchi plays determinative role for the success and the quality of flowering. It is hard to be reliably predicted because multiple factors including ages of trees, variety and dynamically environmental and climate variables have important impacts. Here we predicted the DFI for four litchi varieties using random forest (RF) implicit and stepwise regression (STR) explicit machine learning models. These models were trained and validated from the data consisting phenological phases from the mature of the last autumn shoots to the flower shedding, and the corresponding meteorological factors from 2009 to 2020. The DFI predictive models consider timescales from 1 h up to 10 days, and the determination coefficients from the 5-fold cross validation achieves 0.96 to 0.99. The high accuracy was maintained in the blind test, with the determination coefficients of 0.97–0.98 for the data in 2019 and 0.78–0.88 for 2020. The reliability is still sufficient to guide the cultivation of litchi although the dramatic climate change weaken the inherent multiple correlations for DFI. From these robust predictive models, we found ten important features that can be used to determine the DFI with consistent positive or negative contributions. They are the minimum cooling rate, the maturity time of the last autumn shoot, the maximum heating rate, the mean of minimum temperature, the mean of maximum temperature, the amount of heat accumulation at hot day with the minimum daily temperature above 22 °C, the maximum daily temperature below 26 °C, the minimum daily temperature below 6 °C, age, and the atmospheric relative humidity. © 2022","Chilling accumulation; Flower induction; Heat accumulation; Machine learning; Phenological phase; Prediction; Relative humidity","Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Forestry; Induction heating; Chilling accumulation; Daily temperatures; Determination coefficients; Flower induction; Heat accumulation; Litchi chinensis; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Phenological phase; Predictive models; Machine learning; accuracy assessment; bioaccumulation; climate change; cooling; high temperature; induced response; machine learning; model validation; prediction; relative humidity; shoot",Article,Scopus

Farmers can adapt their management, traders or insurers their pricing schemes, suppliers their stocks, logistic companies their routes, national authorities their food balance sheets to guide import or export and, finally, international aid organizations can mobilize reliefs. Evidence has grown in the literature that such forecasts with a meaningful lead time are possible on various geographic scales and for a broad range of crops. Here, we present a systematic review of the methods applied in end-of-season yield forecasting and three frequently used data sources: weather data, satellite data and crop masks. Our literature database comprises 362 studies (2004–2019) which were evaluated regarding methods, crops, regions, data sources, lead time and performance. Moreover, we present 24 sources of real-time and predictive weather data, 21 sources of remote sensing data and 16 crop masks. Yield forecasting in our literature sample has been performed for 44 crops in 71 countries, also including many non-staple crops, but with an apparent bias in regions and crops. Forecasting performance depends on various factors, including crop, region, method, lead time to harvest and input diversity. Our systematic review supports a broader application of locally successful approaches at larger scales by providing a comprehensive, accessible compendium of necessary information for yield forecasting. We discuss improvement potentials with respect to methodological approaches and available data sources. We additionally suggest standardization procedures for future forecasting studies and encourage studying additional crops and geographic regions.

Thus, advance and accurate information on weather variables, and their quantitative relations to the crop processes (agro-weather informatics) as well as quantification of role of climate conditions in agricultural processes (agro-climate informatics) can play critical to enabling roles in sustainable and smart (optimal in terms of planning, resource utilization and adaptability) agriculture. In particular, agro-weather-climate informatics have scopes and challenges including but beyond those in agriculture or weather informatics in isolation. This review examines principles and the scope of applications of weather and climate informatics in some of the key areas of agriculture such as crop choice, irrigation, energy management and long-term sustainability. While a serious bottleneck in application of forecast-based agro-advisories is low reliability of the forecasts, methodology combining optimization of forecast model, assimilation of data, multi-scale modelling and design of evaluation strategy for specific farm advisories is possible, so that the forecasts are risk-free and yet useful in spite of their errors. We provide a brief overview of weather and climate forecasting at different scales and the general methodology used; this is followed by an overview of status of these applications at different timescales such as daily, seasonal and beyond for a variety of issues such as precision agriculture and pro-active control of crop diseases.

Since impact models are highly sensitive to input climate data, GCM skill is crucial for getting better short-, medium- and long-term outlooks for agricultural production and food security. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) phase 5 ensemble is likely to underpin the majority of climate impact assessments over the next few years. We assess 24 CMIP3 and 26 CMIP5 simulations of present climate against climate observations for five tropical regions, as well as regional improvements in model skill and, through literature review, the sensitivities of impact estimates to model error. Climatological means of seasonal mean temperatures depict mean errors between 1 and 18 ° C (2-130% with respect to mean), whereas seasonal precipitation and wet-day frequency depict larger errors, often offsetting observed means and variability beyond 100%. Simulated interannual climate variability in GCMs warrants particular attention, given that no single GCM matches observations in more than 30% of the areas for monthly precipitation and wet-day frequency, 50% for diurnal range and 70% for mean temperatures. We report improvements in mean climate skill of 5-15% for climatological mean temperatures, 3-5% for diurnal range and 1-2% in precipitation. At these improvement rates, we estimate that at least 5-30 years of CMIP work is required to improve regional temperature simulations and at least 30-50 years for precipitation simulations, for these to be directly input into impact models. We conclude with some recommendations for the use of CMIP5 in agricultural impact studies. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.","adaptation; agriculture; climate change; climate model; skill","Agriculture; Climate change; Computer simulation; Errors; Food supply; Isomers; adaptation; Agricultural productions; Climate impact assessment; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Interannual climate variability; Seasonal precipitations; skill; Temperature simulations; Climate models; adaptive management; agricultural practice; annual variation; climate modeling; climate variation; climatology; ecological impact; global climate; literature review; technological development",Article,Scopus

Temperature, radiation, water availability and other environmental conditions influence crop growth, development, and final grain yield in a complex nonlinear manner. Machine learning (ML) techniques, and deep learning (DL) methods in particular, can account for such nonlinear relations between yield and its covariates. However, they typically lack transparency and interpretability, since the way the predictions are derived is not directly evident. Yet, in the context of yield forecasting, understanding which are the underlying factors behind both a predicted loss or gain is of great relevance. Here, we explore how to benefit from the increased predictive performance of DL methods while maintaining the ability to interpret how the models achieve their results. To do so, we applied a deep neural network to multivariate time series of vegetation and meteorological data to estimate the wheat yield in the Indian Wheat Belt. Then, we visualized and analyzed the features and yield drivers learned by the model with the use of regression activation maps. The DL model outperformed other tested models (ridge regression and random forest) and facilitated the interpretation of variables and processes that lead to yield variability. The learned features were mostly related to the length of the growing season, and temperature and light conditions during this time. For example, our results showed that high yields in 2012 were associated with low temperatures accompanied by sunny conditions during the growing period. The proposed methodology can be used for other crops and regions in order to facilitate application of DL models in agriculture. © 2020 The Author(s).

However, it still remains unclear the ability of satellite SIF data to predict crop yields at the regional scale, comparing to widely used satellite vegetation index (VI), such as the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Additionally, few attempts have been made to verify if SIF products from the new Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite could be applied for regional corn and soybean yield estimates. With the deep neural networks (DNN) approach, this study investigated the ability of OCO-2 SIF, MODIS EVI, and climate data to estimate county-level corn and soybean yields in the U.S. Corn Belt. Monthly mean and maximum SIF and MODIS EVI during the peak growing season showed similar correlations with corn and soybean yields. The DNNs with SIF as predictors were able to estimate corn and soybean yields well but performed poorer than MODIS EVI and climate variables-based DNNs. The performance of SIF and MODIS EVI-based DNNs varied with the areal dominance of crops while that of climate-based DNNs exhibited less spatial variability. SIF data could provide useful supplementary information to MODIS EVI and climatic variables for improving estimates of crop yields. MODIS EVI and climate predictors (e.g., VPD and temperature) during the peak growing season (from June to August) played important roles in predicting yields of corn and soybean in the Midwestern 12 states in the U.S. The results highlighted the benefit of combining data from both satellite and climate sources in crop yield estimation. Additionally, this study showed the potential of adding SIF in crop yield prediction despite the small improvement of model performances, which might result from the limitation of current available SIF products. The framework of this study could be applied to different regions and other types of crops to employ deep learning for crop yield forecasting by combining different types of remote sensing data (such as OCO-2 SIF and MODIS EVI) and climate data. © 2020, by the authors.","Corn; Crop yield; Deep neural network; Soybean; Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence","Chlorophyll; Crops; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Fluorescence; Forecasting; Orbits; Remote sensing; Satellites; Vegetation; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Crop yield forecasting; Enhanced vegetation index; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Remote sensing data; Satellite vegetation; Spatial variability; Supplementary information; Radiometers",Article,Scopus

Here, multiple machine learning (ML) techniques are employed to predict sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) seed yields (SSY) using agro-morphological features. Various ML models were applied, coupled with the PCA (principal component analysis) method to compare them with the original ML models, in order to evaluate the prediction efficiency. The Gaussian process regression (GPR) and radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) models exhibited the most accurate SSY predictions, with determination coefficients, or R2 values, of 0.99 and 0.91, respectfully. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) obtained using the ML models ranged between 0 and 0.30 t/ha (metric tons/hectare) for the varied modeling process phases. The estimation of the sesame seed yield with the coupled PCA-ML models improved the performance accuracy. According to the k-fold process, we utilized the datasets with the lowest error rates to ensure the continued accuracy of the GPR and RBF models. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the capsule number per plant (CPP), seed number per capsule (SPC), and 1000-seed weight (TSW) were the most significant seed yield determinants. © 2022 by the authors.","agro-morphological; data-driven; machine learning; seed yield; sensitivity analysis",,Article,Scopus

The advances in precision agriculture over the past few years have substantially enhanced the efficiency of applying spatially variable agronomic inputs for irrigation, such as fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, and water, and we can attribute them to the increasing number of innovations that utilize new technologies that are capable of monitoring field crops for varying spatial and temporal changes. Remote sensing technology is the primary driver of success in precision agriculture, along with other technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), robotic systems, weather forecasting technology, and global positioning systems (GPSs). More specifically, multispectral imaging (MSI) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) have made the monitoring of the field crop health to aid decision making and the application of spatially and temporally variable agronomic inputs possible. Furthermore, the fusion of remotely sensed multisource data—for instance, HSI and LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data fusion—has even made it possible to monitor the changes in different parts of an individual plant. To the best of our knowledge, in most reviews on this topic, the authors focus on specific methods and/or technologies, with few or no comprehensive reviews that expose researchers, and especially students, to the vast possible range of remote sensing technologies used in agriculture. In this article, we describe/evaluate the remote sensing (RS) technologies for field crop monitoring using spectral imaging, and we provide a thorough and discipline-specific starting point for researchers of different levels by supplying sufficient details and references.

Numerous vegetation indices (VIs) based on satellite data have participated in the construction of GPP models. However, the relative performance of various VIs in predicting GPP and what additional factors should be combined with them to reveal the photosynthetic capacity of vegetation mechanistically better are still poorly understood. We constructed two types of models (universal and plant functional type [PFT]-specific) for solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and Leaf Area Index (LAI) based on two widely used machine learning algorithms, i.e., the random forest (RF) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) algorithms. A total of thirty plant traits and environmental factors with legacy effects are considered in the model. We then systematically investigated the ancillary variables that best match each vegetation index in estimating global GPP. Four types of models (universal and PFT-specific, RF and BPNN) consistently show that SIF performs best when modeled using a single vegetation index (R2 = 0.67, RMSE = 2.24 g C·m−2·d−1); however, NIRv combined with CO2, plant traits, and climatic factors can achieve the highest prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 1.40 g C·m−2·d−1). Plant traits effectively enhance all prediction models’ accuracy, and climatic variables are essential factors in improving the accuracy of NIRv- or LAI-based GPP models, but not the accuracy of SIF-based models. Our findings provide valuable information for the configuration of the data-driven models to improve the accuracy of predicting GPP and provide insights into the physiological and ecological mechanisms underpinning GPP prediction. © 2022 by the authors.","gross primary productivity; leaf area index; machine learning; NIRv; solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence","Budget control; Carbon; Chlorophyll; Climate change; Ecosystems; Fluorescence; Forestry; Infrared devices; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Neural networks; Photosynthesis; Physiological models; Vegetation; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Environmental factors; Gross primary productivity; Leaf Area Index; Machine-learning; NIRv; Plant traits; Productivity model; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Vegetation index; Forecasting",Article,Scopus

For example, drought-induced increases in plant diseases and rainfall caused a decrease in food production. Machine Learning and Agricultural Big Data are high-performance computing technologies that allow analyzing a large amount of data to understand agricultural production. Machine Learning and Agricultural Big Data are high-performance computing technologies that allow the processing and analysis of large amounts of heterogeneous data for which intelligent IT and high-resolution remote sensing techniques are required. However, the selection of ML algorithms depends on the types of data to be used. Therefore, agricultural scientists need to understand the data and the sources from which they are derived. These data can be structured, such as temperature and humidity data, which are usually numerical (e.g., float); semi-structured, such as those from spreadsheets and information repositories, since these data types are not previously defined and are stored in No-SQL databases; and unstructured, such as those from files such as PDF, TIFF, and satellite images, since they have not been processed and therefore are not stored in any database but in repositories (e.g., Hadoop). This study provides insight into the data types used in Agricultural Big Data along with their main challenges and trends. It analyzes 43 papers selected through the protocol proposed by Kitchenham and Charters and validated with the PRISMA criteria. It was found that the primary data sources are Databases, Sensors, Cameras, GPS, and Remote Sensing, which capture data stored in Platforms such as Hadoop, Cloud Computing, and Google Earth Engine. In the future, Data Lakes will allow for data integration across different platforms, as they provide representation models of other data types and the relationships between them, improving the quality of the data to be integrated. © 2022 by the authors.","agriculture; big data; data source; data type; machine learning","climate change; data set; humidity; machine learning; processing",Review,Scopus

The goal of this work is to develop state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms for image-based crop evaluation and weather-related risk assessment to support real-time decision-making for growers. We develop a cranberry bog monitoring system that maps cranberry density and also predicts short-term cranberry internal temperatures. We have two important algorithm contributions. First, we develop a method for cranberry instance segmentation that provides the number of sun-exposed cranberries (not covered by the crop canopy) that are at risk of overheating. The algorithm is based on a novel weakly supervised framework using inexpensive point-click annotations, avoiding time-consuming annotations of fully-supervised methods. The second algorithmic contribution is an in-field joint solar irradiation and berry temperature prediction in an end-to-end differentiable network. The combined system enables over-heating risk assessment to inform irrigation decisions. To support these algorithms, we employ drone-based crop imaging and ground-based sky imaging systems to obtain a large-scale dataset at multiple time points. Through extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate high accuracy in cranberry segmentation, irradiance prediction and internal berry temperature prediction. This work is a pioneering step in using computer vision and machine learning for rapid, short-term decision-making that can assist growers in irrigation decisions in response to complex time-sensitive risk factors. Datasets collected over two growing seasons are made publicly available to support further research. The methods can be extended to additional crops beyond cranberries, such as grapes, olives, and grain, where irrigation management is increasingly challenging as climate changes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","AI; Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Cranberry risk assessment; Deep learning; Differentiable; Drone imaging; End-to-end; Internal temperature prediction; Irradiance prediction; Machine learning; Point supervision; Precision agriculture; Sky imaging","Climate change; Computer vision; Decision making; Deep learning; Drones; Forecasting; Fruits; Irrigation; Large dataset; Learning systems; Plants (botany); Precision agriculture; Risk assessment; Wetlands; Cranberry risk assessment; Deep learning; Differentiable; Drone imaging; End to end; Internal temperature; Internal temperature prediction; Irradiance prediction; Machine-learning; Point supervision; Precision Agriculture; Risks assessments; Sky imaging; Temperature prediction; Crops; artificial intelligence; climate prediction; computer vision; machine learning; precision agriculture; risk assessment",Article,Scopus

The main aim of this work was to develop a method of detection of Xcc infection on broccoli leaves. Such method is based on the use of imaging sensors that capture information about the optical properties of leaves and provide data that can be implemented on machine learning algorithms capable of learning patterns. Based on this knowledge, the algorithms are able to classify plants into categories (healthy and infected). To ensure the robustness of the detection method upon future alterations in climate conditions, the response of broccoli plants to Xcc infection was analyzed under a range of growing environments, taking current climate conditions as reference. Two projections for years 2081–2100 were selected, according to the Assessment Report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Thus, the response of broccoli plants to Xcc infection and climate conditions has been monitored using leaf temperature and five conventional vegetation indices (VIs) derived from hyperspectral reflectance. In addition, three novel VIs, named diseased broccoli indices (DBI1-DBI3), were defined based on the spectral reflectance signature of broccoli leaves upon Xcc infection. Finally, the nine parameters were implemented on several classifying algorithms. The detection method offering the best performance of classification was a multilayer perceptron-based artificial neural network. This model identified infected plants with accuracies of 88.1, 76.9, and 83.3%, depending on the growing conditions. In this model, the three Vis described in this work proved to be very informative parameters for the disease detection. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that future climate conditions have been taken into account to develop a robust detection model using classifying algorithms.

However, it requires high-quality daily weather data for the model establishment and verification, and the low data availability limits the application of CGM at the regional scale. With the rapid development of machine learning techniques, adapting data-driven machine learning algorithms to build a meta-model with environmental feature variables at the desired spatio-temporal scale provides a new method for regional yield simulation. In this study, we developed four machine-learning-based meta-models to simulate regional yield potential (RYP) of wheat in China with the selected environmental feature variables and assessed four different machine learning algorithms, including multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural networks (ANN), random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR). The research aimed to verify whether these meta-models can outperform CGM in simulating RYP. The results showed that the meta-models could reduce the requirements of the number of input variables and the amount of data for RYP simulation and maintain the simulation accuracy because monthly weather variables could replace daily weather variables in the meta-models. Although all four meta-models can well reveal the mean RYP, the meta-model based on RF has the best performance. In the RF-based meta-model, longitude, latitude, altitude, and the averaged maximum temperature in March are the top four ranked essential variables. However, the generalizability of meta-models is affected by the training dataset, and the meta-models cannot adapt appropriately to new unseen data. Moreover, there is no unique optimal machine learning algorithm used for building meta-models, and this will increase the workload of similar research in the future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Crop growth model; Environmental variables; Machine learning; Regional yield potential","climate change; crop yield; growth modeling; growth rate; machine learning; regional climate; spatiotemporal analysis; China",Article,Scopus

The current study evaluated the impacts of major hydrological interventions of the Zhikong and Pangduo hydropower dams on the Lhasa River, which was exposed in the form of break and change points during the double-mass curve analysis. The coefficient of variability (CV) for the hydro-meteorological variables revealed an enhanced climate change phenomena in the Lhasa River Basin (LRB), where the Lhasa River (LR) discharge varied at a stupendous magnitude from 2000 to 2016. The Mann-Kendall trend and Sen’s slope estimator supported aggravated hydro-meteorological changes in LRB, as the rainfall and LR discharge were found to have been significantly decreasing while temperature was increasing from 2000 to 2016. The Sen’s slope had a largest decrease for LR discharge in relation to the rainfall and temperature, revealing that along with climatic phenomena, additional phenomena are controlling the hydrological regime of the LR. Reservoir functioning in the LR is altering the LR discharge. The Soil andWater Assessment Tool (SWAT) modeling of LR discharge under the reservoir’s influence performed well in terms of coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE), and percent bias (PBIAS). Thus, simulation-based LR discharge could substitute observed LR discharge to help with hydrological data scarcity stress in the LRB. The simulated-observed approach was used to predict future LR discharge for the time span of 2017-2025 using a seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The predicted simulation-based and observation-based discharge were closely correlated and found to decrease from 2017 to 2025. This calls for an efficient water resource planning and management policy for the area. The findings of this study can be applied in similar catchments. © 2021 by the authors.

For satellite data, we compared the contiguous solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), a newly emerging satellite retrieval, with a traditional vegetation index (enhanced vegetation index, EVI). The results showed that LSTM (with R2 ranging from 0.77 to 0.87, RMSE from 298.11 to 724kg/ha) and RF (with R2 ranging from 0.76 to 0.82, RMSE from 366 to 723.3 kg/ha) models outperformed LASSO (with R2 ranging from 0.33 to 0.42, RMSE from 633.46 kg/ha to 1231.39 kg/ha) in yield prediction; and LSTM was better than RF. Besides, ESI (combining EVI and SIF together) could slightly improve the model performance compared with only using EVI or SIF as the single input, primarily due to the ability of satellite-based SIF in capturing extra information on drought and heat stress.

We show that both regression and machine learning models can well reproduce the observed pattern of yield averages, while large bias is found for process-based crop models even fed with harmonized parameters. As for the probability distribution of yields, machine learning shows the best skill, followed by regression model and process-based models. For the country as a whole, machine learning can explain 93% of observed yield variability, followed by regression model (51%) and process-based models (42%).

Statistical or process-based crop models can be used to quantify how yields will respond to these events and future climate change. However, the accuracy of weather-yield relationships derived from crop models, whether statistical or process-based, is dependent on the quality of the underlying input data used to run these models. In this context, a major challenge in many developing countries is the lack of accessible and reliable meteorological datasets. Gridded weather datasets, derived from combinations of in situ gauges, remote sensing, and climate models, provide a solution to fill this gap, and have been widely used to evaluate climate impacts on agriculture in data-scarce regions worldwide. However, these reference datasets are also known to contain important biases and uncertainties. To date, there has been little research to assess how the choice of reference datasets influences projected sensitivity of crop yields to weather. We compare multiple freely available gridded datasets that provide daily weather data over the Indian sub-continent over the period 1983-2005, and explore their implications for estimates of yield responses to weather variability for key crops grown in the region (wheat and rice). Our results show that individual gridded weather datasets vary in their representation of historic spatial and temporal temperature and precipitation patterns across India. We show that these differences create large uncertainties in estimated crop yield responses and exposure to variability in growing season weather, which in turn, highlights the need for improved consideration of input data uncertainty in statistical studies that explore impacts of climate variability and change on agriculture. © 2019 The Author(s).

The estimation of leaf area index (LAI) in tropical savanna ecosystems is therefore fundamental for the proper planning and management of this natural capital. In this study, we assess the spatio-temporal seasonal LAI dynamics (dry and wet seasons) as a proxy for rangeland condition and productivity in the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. The 30 m Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) spectral bands, derived vegetation indices and a non-parametric approach (i.e., random forest, RF) were used to assess dry and wet season LAI condition and variability in the KNP. The results showed that RF optimization enhanced the model performance in estimating LAI. Moderately high accuracies were observed for the dry season (R2 of 0.63-0.72 and average RMSE of 0.60 m2/m2) and wet season (0.62-0.63 and 0.79 m2/m2). Derived thematic maps demonstrated that the park had high LAI estimates during the wet season when compared to the dry season. On average, LAI estimates ranged between 3 and 7 m2/m2 during the wet season, whereas for the dry season most parts of the park had LAI estimates ranging between 0.00 and 3.5 m2/m2. The findings indicate that Kruger National Park had high levels of productivity during the wet season monitoring period. Overall, this work shows the unique potential of Landsat 8-derived metrics in assessing LAI as a proxy for tropical savanna rangelands productivity.

By this means, impacts of land use changes on the water balance components are assessed for the near future (2009-2028) employing four different climate conditions (baseline, IPCC A1B, dry, wet). The land use change modeling results in an increase of urban area by + 23.1% at the fringes of Pune and by + 12.2% in the upper catchment, whereas agricultural land (- 14.0% and - 0.3%, respectively) and semi-natural area (- 9.1% and - 11.9%, respectively) decrease between 2009 and 2028. Under baseline climate conditions, these land use changes induce seasonal changes in the water balance components. Water yield particularly increases at the onset of monsoon (up to + 11.0 mm per month) due to increased impervious area, whereas evapotranspiration decreases in the dry season (up to - 15.1 mm per month) as a result of the loss of irrigated agricultural area. As the projections are made for the near future (2009-2028) land use change impacts are similar under IPCC A1B climate conditions. Only if more extreme dry years occur, an exacerbation of the land use change impacts can be expected. Particularly in rapidly changing environments an implementation of both dynamic land use change and climate change seems favorable to assess seasonal and gradual changes in the water balance. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Hydrologic modeling; India; Land use change; SLEUTH; SWAT","Agriculture; Catchments; Land use; Runoff; Urban growth; Water resources; Water supply; Hydrologic modeling; India; Land-use change; SLEUTH; SWAT; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; hydrological modeling; land cover; land use change; urban growth; water budget; water resource; agricultural land; Article; catchment; climate change; dry season; dynamics; environmental change; environmental impact; evapotranspiration; fluid balance; hydrology; India; irrigation (agriculture); land use; priority journal; season; seasonal variation; statistical model; urban area; urbanization; water supply; India; Maharashtra; Pune",Article,Scopus

In this work, we analyze if and to what extent the bias in the simulated crop yield can be reduced by using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model to downscale ERA-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis) rainfall and radiation data. Then, we evaluate the uncertainties resulting from both the choice of the physical parameterizations of the WRF model and its internal variability. Impact assessments were performed at two sites in Sub-Saharan Africa and by using two crop models to simulate Niger pearl millet and Benin maize yields. We find that the use of the WRF model to downscale ERA-Interim climate data generally reduces the bias in the simulated crop yield, yet this reduction in bias strongly depends on the choices in the model setup. Among the physical parameterizations considered, we show that the choice of the land surface model (LSM) is of primary importance. When there is no coupling with a LSM, or when the LSM is too simplistic, the simulated precipitation and then the simulated yield are null, or respectively very low; therefore, coupling with a LSM is necessary. The convective scheme is the second most influential scheme for yield simulation, followed by the shortwave radiation scheme. The uncertainties related to the internal variability of the WRF model are also significant and reach up to 30% of the simulated yields. These results suggest that regional models need to be used more carefully in order to improve the reliability of impact assessments. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.","crop model; EPIC; regional climate model; SARRA-H; West Africa; WRF","Agriculture; Climate change; Crops; Weather forecasting; Crop model; EPIC; Regional climate modeling; SARRA-H; West Africa; WRF; Climate models; assessment method; climate effect; climate modeling; crop yield; error analysis; regional climate; uncertainty analysis; weather forecasting; West Africa; Pennisetum glaucum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The objective of this research was to narrow the range of values characterizing the limits within which estimates are expected to fall in the diagnostics of agroclimatic risks. Assessments were made by analyzing historical observations and evaluating the influence of heat stress and rainfall variability on crop water demand, biomass and grain yields of short-cycle cultivars of pearl millet and maize. We used a wide range of consistent and practical sets of crop model ensemble analyses (based on crop management practices such as plant density, fertilization levels, early/late sowing dates and soil types) and climate model ensembles from 2 climate change hypothesis (A1b and RCP8.5) over the West African Sudan-Sahel. Recent rainfall developments show that hazardous intra-seasonal rainfall distribution affects crop productivity, with increased frequency and intensity of daily rainfall, false start and early cessation of the rainy season and decreasing diurnal temperature range. In 2011-2050 perspectives, relative to the 1981-2010 baseline, a slight in - crease in temperature (i.e. +0.6 to +0.8°C) combined with a stationary to moderate decrease in precipitation leads to a 10 to 15% (8 to 15%) decrease in aboveground biomass production (grain yield). When the warming is moderate (i.e. +1.4 to 1.8°C), the decline in grain yield worsens (10 to 20%), despite a slight increase in rainfall projections. At these rates of loss in crop production, resilience can be reinforced. However, it will require that climate-smart crop management practices be embedded in sub-seasonal and interannual monitoring and early warning systems. © Inter-Research 2015.","Agroclimatic risks; Ensemble scenarios; Maize; Pearl millet; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty management; West African Sudan-Sahel","baseline conditions; biomass; climate change; crop production; crop yield; early warning system; ecosystem resilience; environmental impact; hypothesis testing; millet; precipitation intensity; water demand; Eritrea; Northern Red Sea; Sahel [Northern Red Sea]; Sudan; Pennisetum glaucum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

However, the spatial pattern and strength of terrestrial C sinks and sources remain uncertain. In this study, we designed a spatially-explicit agroecosystem modeling system by integrating the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model with multiple sources of geospatial and surveyed datasets (including crop type map, elevation, climate forcing, fertilizer application, tillage type and distribution, and crop planting and harvesting date), and applied it to examine the sensitivity of cropland C flux simulations to two widely used soil databases (i.e. State Soil Geographic-STATSGO of a scale of 1:250,000 and Soil Survey Geographic-SSURGO of a scale of 1:24,000) in Iowa, USA. To efficiently execute numerous EPIC runs resulting from the use of high resolution spatial data (56m), we developed a parallelized version of EPIC. Both STATSGO and SSURGO led to similar simulations of crop yields and Net Ecosystem Production (NEP) estimates at the State level. However, substantial differences were observed at the county and sub-county (grid) levels. In general, the fine resolution SSURGO data outperformed the coarse resolution STATSGO data for county-scale crop-yield simulation, and within STATSGO, the area-weighted approach provided more accurate results. Further analysis showed that spatial distribution and magnitude of simulated NEP were more sensitive to the resolution difference between SSURGO and STATSGO at the county or grid scale. For over 60% of the cropland areas in Iowa, the deviations between STATSGO- and SSURGO-derived NEP were larger than 1MgCha-1yr-1, or about half of the average cropland NEP, highlighting the significant uncertainty in spatial distribution and magnitude of simulated C fluxes resulting from differences in soil data resolution. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; EPIC; Net Ecosystem Production; Parallel computing; Spatial resolution; SSURGO; STATSGO","Budget control; Carbon; Climate models; Crops; Distributed database systems; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Parallel processing systems; Scales (weighing instruments); Soil surveys; Soils; Spatial distribution; EPIC; Net ecosystem production; Spatial resolution; SSURGO; STATSGO; Climate change; carbon; carbon dioxide; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural soil; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; climate change; concentration (composition); ecosystem modeling; environmental policy; net ecosystem production; parallel computing; spatial data; spatial resolution; accuracy; article; carbon footprint; chemical analysis; climate change; concentration (parameters); controlled study; data base; environmental monitoring; environmental policy integrated climate; experimental design; geographic distribution; intermethod comparison; model; multi scale geospatial agroecosystem modeling; nonbiological model; priority journal; process development; process model; sensitivity analysis; soil analysis; soil pollution; soil survey geographic database; state soil geographic database; Climate change; EPIC; Net Ecosystem Production; Parallel computing; Spatial resolution; SSURGO; STATSGO; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Geography; Models, Theoretical; Soil",Article,Scopus

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model has been applied worldwide to support sustainable land and water management in a changing climate. However, the inadequacies of the existing carbon algorithm in SWAT limit its application in assessing impacts of human activities on CO2 emission, one important source of greenhouse gasses (GHGs) that traps heat in the earth system and results in global warming. In this research, we incorporate a revised version of the CENTURY carbon model into SWAT to describe dynamics of soil organic matter (SOM)-residue and simulate land-atmosphere carbon exchange. We test this new SWAT-C model with daily eddy covariance (EC) observations of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and evapotranspiration (ET) and annual crop yield at six sites across the U.S. Midwest. Results show that SWAT-C simulates well multi-year average NEE and ET across the spatially distributed sites and capture the majority of temporal variation of these two variables at a daily time scale at each site. Our analyses also reveal that performance of SWAT-C is influenced by multiple factors, such as crop management practices (irrigated vs. rainfed), completeness and accuracy of input data, crop species, and initialization of state variables. Overall, the new SWAT-C demonstrates favorable performance for simulating land-atmosphere carbon exchange across agricultural sites with different soils, climate, and management practices. SWAT-C is expected to serve as a useful tool for including carbon flux into consideration in sustainable watershed management under a changing climate. We also note that extensive assessment of SWAT-C with field observations is required for further improving the model and understanding potential uncertainties of applying it across large regions with complex landscapes. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon; Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Net ecosystem exchange; Spatial and Temporal Variation; Watershed modeling","Crop management practices; Management practices; Net ecosystem exchange; Soil and water assessment tool; Soil and Water assessment tools; Spatial and temporal variation; Sustainable watershed management; Watershed modeling; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Environmental engineering; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Rain; Water management; Water supply; Climate models; carbon; carbon dioxide; rain; soil organic matter; algorithm; carbon flux; climate change; crop yield; evapotranspiration; global warming; greenhouse gas; modeling; net ecosystem exchange; soil organic matter; soil water; spatial variation; temporal variation; article; atmosphere; carbon cycle; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; crop management; cropland; dynamics; evapotranspiration; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; harvest; human activities; human impact (environment); irrigation (agriculture); landscape; priority journal; simulation; Soil and Water Assessment Tool; soil management; United States; water management; watershed management; Carbon; Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Net ecosystem exchange; Spatial and Temporal Variation; Watershed modeling; Agriculture; Biomass; Carbon Cycle; Climate; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Midwestern United States; Models, Theoretical; Soil; Water Quality",Article,Scopus

There is a pressing need for a watershed model to better understand the interaction between land use activities and hydrologic processes and to support sustainable water use planning. In this study, we evaluated the performance of SWAT for hydrologic modeling in the Xixian River Basin, located at the headwaters of the Huaihe River, and compared its performance with the Xinanjiang (XAJ) model that has been widely used in China. Due to the lack of publicly available data, emphasis has been put on geospatial data collection and processing, especially on developing land use-land cover maps for the study area based on ground-truth information sampling. Ten-year daily runoff data (1987-1996) from four stream stations were used to calibrate SWAT and XAJ. Daily runoff data from the same four stations were applied to validate model performance from 1997 to 2005. The results show that both SWAT and XAJ perform well in the Xixian River Basin, with percentage of bias (PBIAS) less than 15%, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) larger than 0.69 and coefficient of determination (R2) larger than 0.72 for both calibration and validation periods at the four stream stations. Both SWAT and XAJ can reasonably simulate surface runoff and baseflow contributions. Comparison between SWAT and XAJ shows that model performances are comparable for hydrologic modeling. For the purposes of flood forecasting and runoff simulation, XAJ requires minimum input data preparation and is preferred to SWAT. The complex, processes-based SWAT can simultaneously simulate water quantity and quality and evaluate the effects of land use change and human activities, which makes it preferable for sustainable water resource management in the Xixian watershed where agricultural activities are intensive. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Huaihe River; Hydrologic modeling; Multi-site calibration; SWAT; Water resource; Xinanjiang model","Huaihe river; Hydrologic modeling; Multi-site calibration; SWAT; Xinanjiang model; Calibration; Climate change; Data handling; Flood control; Human resource management; Land use; Landforms; Quality control; Rivers; Runoff; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Watersheds; Weather forecasting; Climate models; headwater; human activity; hydrological modeling; land use planning; model validation; runoff; water management; water resource; water use; watershed; China; Huai River",Article,Scopus

India is one of the major rice producer and consumer in South Asia; more than 50% of the Indian population depends on rice as staple food. Rice is mainly grown in kharif season, which contributed 84% of the total annual rice production of the country. Rice cultivation in India is rainfed, which depends largely on rains, so reliability of the rainfall forecast plays a crucial role for planning the kharif rice crop. In the present study, an attempt has been made to test the reliability of seasonal and sub-seasonal ERFS summer monsoon rainfall forecasts for kharif rice yield predictions at Kharagpur, West Bengal by using CERES-Rice (DSSATv4.5) model. These ERFS forecasts are produced as monthly and seasonal mean values and are converted into daily sequences with stochastic weather generators for use with crop growth models. The daily sequences are generated from ERFS seasonal (June–September) and sub-seasonal (July–September, August–September, and September) summer monsoon (June to September) rainfall forecasts which are considered as input in CERES-rice crop simulation model for the crop yield prediction for hindcast (1985–2008) and real-time mode (2009–2015). The yield simulated using India Meteorological Department (IMD) observed daily rainfall data is considered as baseline yield for evaluating the performance of predicted yields using the ERFS forecasts. The findings revealed that the stochastic disaggregation can be used to disaggregate the monthly/seasonal ERFS forecasts into daily sequences. The year to year variability in rice yield at Kharagpur is efficiently predicted by using the ERFS forecast products in hindcast as well as real time, and significant enhancement in the prediction skill is noticed with advancement in the season due to incorporation of observed weather data which reduces uncertainty of yield prediction. The findings also recommend that the normal and above normal yields are predicted well in advance using the ERFS forecasts. The outcomes of this study are useful to farmers for taking appropriate decisions well in advance for climate risk management in rice production during different stages of the crop growing season at Kharagpur. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria.",,"crop production; crop yield; growth modeling; growth response; precipitation assessment; rice; risk assessment; seasonal variation; stochasticity; weather forecasting; India; Kharagpur; West Bengal",Article,Scopus

Multitemporal satellite observations allow analyzing vegetation seasonal dynamics over large areas by using vegetation indices or by deriving biophysical variables. The Nile Delta represents about half of all agricultural lands of Egypt. In this region, intensifying farming systems are predominant and multi-cropping rotations schemes are increasing, requiring a high temporal and spatial resolution monitoring for capturing successive crop growth cycles. This study presents a workflow for cropland phenology characterization and mapping based on time series of green Leaf Area Index (LAI) generated from NASA’s Harmonized Landsat 8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) surface reflectance dataset from 2016 to 2019. LAI time series were processed for each satellite dataset, which were used separately and combined to identify seasonal dynamics for a selection of crop types (wheat, clover, maize and rice). For the combination of L8 with S2 LAI products, we proposed two time series smoothing and fitting methods: (1) the Savitzky–Golay (SG) filter and (2) the Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR) fitting function. Single-sensor and L8-S2 combined LAI time series were used for the calculation of key crop Land Surface Phenology (LSP) metrics (start of season, end of season, length of season), whereby the detection of cropland growing seasons was based on two established threshold methods, i.e., a seasonal or a relative amplitude value. Overall, the developed phenology extraction scheme enabled identifying up to two successive crop cycles within a year, with a superior performance observed for the seasonal than for the relative threshold method, in terms of consistency and cropland season detection capability. Differences between the time series collections were analyzed by comparing the phenology metrics per crop type and year. Results suggest that L8-S2 combined LAI data streams with GPR led to a more precise detection of the start and end of growing seasons for most crop types, reaching an overall detection of 74% over the total planted crops versus 69% with S2 and 63% with L8 alone. Finally, the phenology mapping allowed us to evaluate the spatial and temporal evolution of the croplands over the agroecosystem in the Nile Delta. © 2022 by the authors.

The increasing scarcity of rain gauges in West Africa generally limits assessments of the degree and spatial extent of hardship arising from rainfall deficiency. However, the improved availability and robustness of satellite-based rainfall products since the early 1980s, offers an alternative source of rainfall data which is spatially, and often temporally, more complete than rain gauges. This research evaluates four satellite-based rainfall products for their ability to represent both long term rainfall trends such as recovery from decadal droughts, and trends in seasonal rainfall variables relevant to crop yield prediction. The Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) rainfall product at 5 km resolution, was observed to be consistently most representative of ground station rainfall across northern Nigeria over a 35-year period 1981–2015, followed by TARCAT. CHIRPS was found to give a good overall prediction of rainfall amounts at dekadal, monthly and seasonal time scales, and was therefore used in the study to represent the typical performance of satellite rainfall datasets. The CHIRPS-observed increase in growing season length since the 1970s and 80s drought decades, was accompanied by significant rainfall increases in the later part of the growing season, especially marked in northern and northeastern states. This is especially important for the main subsistence crops sorghum and millet as the risk of late drought impedes swelling of the grain, affecting dry weight production. The CHIRPS data also indicate a significant decrease in dry spells in the northwest and southern parts of the study area, which would have favourable outcomes for crop production in the densely populated rural hinterlands of the cities of Sokoto, Jos and Abuja. In view of the continued intra-and inter-annual rainfall variability across northern Nigeria, and amid rapid rural population growth recently, a return to the rainfall levels of the drought decades, would require informed response. The study suggests that satellite rainfall estimates can offer such information, especially since we observed high spatial variability in rainfall distributions and trends. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Northern Nigeria; Rainfall recovery; Satellite rainfall products; Season rainfall variables; Spatio-temporal analysis; Sudano-Sahelian","crop yield; drought; growing season; millet; prediction; rainfall; raingauge; satellite data; seasonal variation; sorghum; spatiotemporal analysis; trend analysis; Nigeria; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; Sudan; West Africa",Article,Scopus

The increasing temperatures and decreasing precipitation in many parts of the world have enhanced the frequency and severity of drought events. Therefore, a detailed analysis is required in order to determine the drought frequency and take the necessary precautions. In this study, the climatic conditions in the agricultural region of Çukurova (Turkey) were analysed. Meteorological data for the three provinces of Adana, Mersin, and Osmaniye were used. The aim was to calculate the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for each of the three provinces analysed, and to use these values to detect drought during the different growth periods of maize. We also investigated whether the SPI values for the last 30 years differ significantly between the provinces. Furthermore, indicators such as the duration, magnitude, severity, recurrence, and drought frequency were also calculated. Using linear regression analysis, we determined whether there were trends in the multi-year data for the total precipitation and mean temperature. In addition, the water deficiency was determined by examining the amount of water required by maize and the adequacy of the precipitation in each development period. As a result, it was found that the Çukurova region is prone to droughts, but they follow a mild course in most cases. However, no statistically significant differences were observed between the SPI values in the three provinces. The calculated average approximate drought recurrences (Tr) and expected intensities (Iave) were Tr ~ 1.036 years and Iave ~ 5.634 mm year−1 in 3 years for Adana, Tr ~ 1.031 years and Iave ~ −0.312 mm year−1 in 3 years for Mersin, and Tr ~ 1.052 years and Iave ~ −0.084 mm year−1 in 3 years Osmaniye.

Yield precision maps, an application of precision agriculture, can be used by farmers to address these challenges by reducing input costs and optimizing yield. These maps can be created using machine learning models trained on field data (e.g., imagery data). Although performing satellite-based remote sensing to gather imagery has some advantages, using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)s is favorable over satellite-based approaches due to the higher spatial and temporal resolutions of the imagery. Vegetation indices (VI)s can be computed from the imagery and can represent the state or condition of vegetation. The present work performed yield prediction regression experiments that analyzed the effects of image spatial resolution (satellite vs. UAV) on prediction results, compared and ranked the prediction power of 33 VIs (and 5 raw-bands) over the growing season, and explored the optimal image acquisition date that produced the best prediction results. We gathered yield data and UAV-based multispectral imagery from a Canadian smart farm and trained random forest (RF) and linear regression (LR) machine learning models. High spatial resolution data generally led to better prediction results than lower spatial resolution data, especially for the RF model, where regardless of the VI choice or image acquisition date, good results were obtained. VIs that included the near-infrared and/or red-edge band generally performed better than the red-green-blue (RGB) VIs. The best performing VIs were: simple ratio index (near-infrared (NIR) & red-edge), normalized difference vegetation index with red-edge instead of red, normalized green index, green chlorophyll index, and simple ratio index (NIR & green).

The adaptability of trees to drought is likely to be of increasing importance as climate changes occur around the world. Modelling stomatal regulation can help improve our understanding of how forests respond to their environment. Traditionally, empirical models have been used to model stomatal responses, however these models cannot always capture nonlinear responses and their parameters are often difficult to measure. In this study various machine learning (ML) models were able to capture stomatal responses of multiple tree species. We showed that ML can be a useful tool for predicting stomatal response based on climate variables and species traits. A random forest model performed the best with an R2 of 75 %, compared to the empirical Ball-Berry stomatal conductance model (BWB) (R2 = 41 %). In this study, the use of a combined dataset consisting out of data from multiple studies were successfully used, showcasing the use of data across studies. This also allowed for an ML model to be trained on 36 tree species from 5 forest biomes, from measurements taken across 6 continents, instead of being limited to one species, increasing the versatility of the model. The importance of species-specific stomatal responses was highlighted, with the drought strategies used by plants significantly influencing stomatal responses and predictions. ML models were able to capture these trends parsimoniously without prior knowledge of the underlying physiology of the tree species. The quality of combined datasets are however still not desirable, and long-term data collection using standardized measuring protocols are required to increase the strength of ML models. Data taken across different climatic regions and vegetation types can also help improve the adaptability of ML models. Regardless of limitations on data accessibility, ML shows promise in modelling plant responses to changes in climate. Focus on the use of ML together with traditional models can help give further insight into various ecological mechanisms. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate data; Machine learning; Stomatal conductance","climate change; drought; drought resistance; drought stress; environmental factor; forest management; machine learning; numerical model; physiological response; regional climate; stomatal conductance",Article,Scopus

Food security is a matter of concern for stakeholders and policymakers as the global population is predicted to bypass 10 billion in the coming years. Crop improvement via modern breeding techniques along with efficient agronomic practices innovations in microbiome applications, and exploiting the natural variations in underutilized crops is an excellent way forward to fulfill future food requirements. In this review, we describe the next-generation breeding tools that can be used to increase crop production by developing climate-resilient superior genotypes to cope with the future challenges of global food security. Recent innovations in genomic-assisted breeding (GAB) strategies allow the construction of highly annotated crop pan-genomes to give a snapshot of the full landscape of genetic diversity (GD) and recapture the lost gene repertoire of a species. Pan-genomes provide new platforms to exploit these unique genes or genetic variation for optimizing breeding programs. The advent of next-generation clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR/Cas) systems, such as prime editing, base editing, and de nova domestication, has institutionalized the idea that genome editing is revamped for crop improvement. Also, the availability of versatile Cas orthologs, including Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14, improved the editing efficiency. Now, the CRISPR/Cas systems have numerous applications in crop research and successfully edit the major crop to develop resistance against abiotic and biotic stress. By adopting high-throughput phenotyping approaches and big data analytics tools like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), agriculture is heading toward automation or digitalization. The integration of speed breeding with genomic and phenomic tools can allow rapid gene identifications and ultimately accelerate crop improvement programs. In addition, the integration of next-generation multidisciplinary breeding platforms can open exciting avenues to develop climate-ready crops toward global food security. © Copyright © 2021 Razzaq, Kaur, Akhter, Wani and Saleem.","abiotic stress; climate change; CRISPR/Cas; crop improvement; food security; genome editing; genomics; next-generation breeding",,Review,Scopus

Machine learning methods can be used to predict crop yield based on a combination of remote sensing data and data collected by ground weather stations. This paper argues that forecasting drylands farming yield can be reliable for management purpose under uncertain conditions using machine learning methods and remote sensing data and determines which indicators are most important in predicting the yield of chickpea. In this study, the yield of rainfed chickpea farms in 11 top chickpea producing counties in Kermanshah province, Iran, was predicted using three machine learning methods, namely support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). To improve prediction accuracy, for each county, remote sensing data were overlaid by the satellite images of rainfed farms with a suitable slope and altitude for rainfed farming. An integrated database was created by combining weather data, remote sensing data, and chickpea yield statistics. The methods were evaluated using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) technique and compared in terms of multiple measures. Given the sensitivity of rainfed chickpea yield to the time of data, the predictions were made in two scenarios: (1) using the averages of the data of all growing months, and (2) using the data of a combination of months. The results showed that RF provides more accurate yield predictions than other methods. The predictions of this method were 7–8% different from the statistics reported by the Statistical Center and the Ministry of Agriculture of Iran. It was found that for pre-harvest prediction of rainfed chickpea yield, using the data of the March–April period (the averages of two months) offers the best result in terms of the correlation coefficient for the relationship between the yield and the predictor indices. © 2021 by the authors.

However, very few studies have been performed to adapt crop models to simulate these systems. The aim of this study was to parameterize the CROPGRO-Perennial Forage model for estimating Piatã palisade grass growth in monoculture and in a silvopastoral system with eucalyptus. To generate the dataset required for that, two field experiments were carried out. The first experiment was conducted between February 2011 and July 2012 with Piatã palisade grass under irrigated and rainfed conditions and cut-and-carry management. The second experiment was conducted from December 2014 to January 2016, in a single pasture of Piatã palisade grass and in a silvopastoral system with the same forage species and eucalypt trees. The trees were arranged in single rows, in East-West orientation, with 15 m between rows and 2 m between trees in the rows. This experiment was conducted under grazing management and rainfed conditions, during 11 growth cycles, with the pasture variables being assessed at four distances from the North row of eucalypt (0.00 m, 3.75 m, 7.50 m and 11.25 m), in the silvopastoral system, and in the single pasture. CROPGRO testing for the silvopastoral system considered only the competition for solar radiation since the model does not allow simulating belowground competition. For this, measured data of incoming solar radiation at each position were used as input for the simulations. The model was able to simulate forage live mass in the single pastures (R2 from 0.72 to up to 0.89, Agreement index from 0.88 to up to 0.95, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency between 0.65 and 0.85), and in the silvopastoral system (R2 from 0.76 to up to 0.89, Agreement index between 0.93 and 0.96, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency between 0.71 and 0.86). Despite these results, improvements should be performed in the model for simulating the effect of flowering on pasture growth, changes on pasture canopy caused by animals trampling, and competition for resources in silvopastoral systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agroforestry; Brachiaria brizantha; DSSAT; grazing; Pasture modeling; Shading","agricultural modeling; agroforestry; biological production; climate change; evergreen tree; experimental study; forage; grass; grazing management; growth; monoculture; parameterization; pastoralism; rainfed agriculture; shading; silviculture; simulation; Animalia; Eucalyptus; Urochloa brizantha",Article,Scopus

MELA is capable of extending temporally limited local hydroclimatic measurements at fine spatial resolution to longer periods, using remotely-sensed hydroclimatic data readily available for longer periods but at coarse spatial resolution. We demonstrate the implementation of MELA to extrapolate the monthly local soil moisture measurements at multiple depths from 2015–2021 to 1958–2021 in a semi-arid region. Such data extrapolators are imperative to generate longer historical data needed to adequately train and test AI models while enhancing the chance of capturing the effects of extreme climates on spatially variable soil moisture. The MELA-extrapolated local soil moisture subsequently allowed the construction of monthly time-series of field-scale soil moisture distributions with a normalized accuracy of 72% and prediction of countywide annual winter wheat yields – using MELA-extrapolated soil moisture data and eXplainable AI (XAI) – with a normalized accuracy of 81%. Furthermore, the XAI model ranked the predictors based on their importance in estimating winter wheat yields, in which the soil moisture near the surface and in the root zone and precipitation totals were found to be more influential than temperature on crop yields in the semi-arid region. The XAI model also unveiled the inflection points of the predictors beyond which crop yields would increase or decrease.

High-resolution remote sensing imageries have emerged as an innovative solution to investigate the spatial variation in agricultural soils with machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, the predictive power of the individual and combined effects of Sentinel-1 (S1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral images for mapping soil properties, especially STN, STP, and STK, have rarely been investigated. Moreover, single ML model may achieve unstable performance for predicting multiple soil properties due to strong spatial heterogeneity. This study explored the combine use of S1, S2, and DEM derivatives to map SOM, STN, STP, and STK content of a sloped cropland of northeastern China. A two-step method with a weighted sum of four ML models was proposed to improve the accuracy and robustness in predicting multiple soil properties. Our results showed that single ML model has various performance in predicting the four soil properties. The optimal ML models could explain approximately 56 %, 53 %, 56 % and 37 % of the variability of SOM, STN, STP, and STK, respectively. Using the weights estimated through a 10-fold cross-validation procedure, the two-step ensemble learning model was retrained and showed more robust performance than the four ML models, in which the prediction accuracy was improved by 2.38 %, 1.40 %, 3.52 %, and 3.29 % for SOM, STN, STP, and STK, respectively. Our results also showed that the optical S2 derived features, especially the two S2 short-wave infrared bands, enhanced vegetation index, and soil adjusted vegetation index, were more important for soil property prediction than S1 data and DEM derivatives. Compared with individual sensor, a combination of S1 and S2 data yielded more accurate predictions of STN and STP but not for SOM and STK.

It plays an important role in guiding policy makers to plan and implement adaptation practices to mitigate potential climate risks to crop. However, due to the diversity in the methodology of vulnerability assessment, there are still knowledge gaps in assessing and comparing crop vulnerability to climate in different regions of the world, including Australia. OBJECTIVE: Our main objectives were to: (1) present a vulnerability analytical method for wheat yield, which can be applied to different areas where long-term crop yield and climate data are available. (2) quantify temporal changes of the vulnerability of wheat yield to historical climate. (3) identify the most vulnerable region in study area to provide guidance for climate mitigation. METHODS: Our study developed an indicator-based method using exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to assess the vulnerability of crop yield. We used the long-term recorded wheat yield data, combining with comprehensive exposure index to assess climate vulnerability of historical yield with a case study area of south-eastern Australia's wheat belt. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that from the 1930s to the 1990s, both climate exposure and sensitivity had large inter-annual variations with no significant trends detected. However, adaptive capacity increased by 34% from 1930s to 1950s, 54% from 1950s to 1970s, and 54% from 1970s to 1990s. By contrast, climate vulnerability across the wheat belt decreased by 13% from 1930s to 1950s, 15% from 1950s to 1970s, and 33% from 1970s to 1990s. This is mainly due to increased adaptive capacity with the improvement of agronomic management practices, technological and socio-economic progress. We identified the areas with the highest vulnerability were in the northwestern parts of wheat belt while the least vulnerable areas located in the southeast. SIGNIFICANCE: We expect that these identified vulnerable hotspots can be used by different landholders to allocate natural resources and policymakers to plan the priority mitigation to adapt to climate change in the local scale. Moreover, the method of vulnerability assessment used in this study can be applied to other regions around the world where long-term crop yield and climate data are available. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive capacity; Climate vulnerability; Exposure index; South-eastern Australia; Wheat belt; Wheat yield","agricultural management; analytical method; assessment method; climate change; crop yield; farmers knowledge; vulnerability; wheat; Australia; Indicator indicator",Article,Scopus

In Brazil, the agricultural areas offer an opportunity to mitigate this effect, especially with the sugarcane crop, since, depending on the management system, sugarcane stores large amounts of carbon, thereby removing it from the atmosphere. The CO2 production in soil and its transport to the atmosphere are the results of biochemical processes such as the decomposition of organic matter and roots and the respiration of soil organisms, a phenomenon called soil CO2 emissions (FCO2). The objective of the study was to investigate the use of neural networks with backpropagation algorithm to predict the spatial patterns of soil CO2 emission during short periods in sugarcane areas. FCO2 values were collected in three commercial crop areas in the São Paulo state, southeastern Brazil, registered through the LI-8100 system during the years 2008 (Motuca), 2010 (Guariba city), and 2012 (Pradópolis), in the period after the mechanical harvesting (green cane). A neural network multilayer perceptron with a backpropagation algorithm was applied to estimate the FCO2 in 2012, using data from 2008 and 2010 as training for the neural network. The neural network initially presented a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 18.3852 and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9188. Data obtained from the observed and estimated values of FCO2 present moderate spatial dependence, and it is observed from the maps of the spatial pattern of the CO2 flow that the results from the neural network show considerable similarity to the observed data. The model results identify the higher and lower characteristics in sample points of CO2 emissions and produce an overestimation of the range of spatial dependence (0.45 m) and an underestimation of the interpolated values in the field (R2 = 0.80; MAPE = 12.0591), when compared to the actual soil CO2 emission values. Therefore, the results indicate that the artificial neural network provides reliable estimates for the evaluation of FCO2 from data of the soil’s physical and chemical attributes and describes the spatial variability of FCO2 in sugarcane fields, thereby contributing to the reduction of uncertainties associated with FCO2 accountings in these areas. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Green harvest; Neural techniques; Soil respiration","Article; artificial neural network; biomass; carbon footprint; greenhouse gas; mathematical computing; nonhuman; perceptron; pH; pore volume; principal component analysis; radial based function; soil analysis; soil moisture; soil respiration; soil temperature; spatiotemporal analysis; sugarcane; agriculture; analysis; atmosphere; Brazil; chemistry; climate change; environmental monitoring; forecasting; gas; greenhouse effect; metabolism; procedures; soil; carbon; carbon dioxide; Agriculture; Atmosphere; Brazil; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Forecasting; Gases; Greenhouse Effect; Neural Networks (Computer); Saccharum; Soil",Article,Scopus

It is therefore common to correct (or adjust) those simulations before using them as inputs into impact models. However, most bias correction (BC) methods are univariate and so do not account for the statistical dependences linking the different locations and/or physical variables of interest. In addition, they are often deterministic, and stochasticity is frequently needed to investigate climate uncertainty and to add constrained randomness to climate simulations that do not possess a realistic variability. This study presents a multivariate method of rank resampling for distributions and dependences (R2D2) bias correction allowing one to adjust not only the univariate distributions but also their inter-variable and inter-site dependence structures. Moreover, the proposed R2D2 method provides some stochasticity since it can generate as many multivariate corrected outputs as the number of statistical dimensions (i.e., number of grid cell × number of climate variables) of the simulations to be corrected. It is based on an assumption of stability in time of the dependence structure - making it possible to deal with a high number of statistical dimensions - that lets the climate model drive the temporal properties and their changes in time. R2D2 is applied on temperature and precipitation reanalysis time series with respect to high-resolution reference data over the southeast of France (1506 grid cell). Bivariate, 1506-dimensional and 3012-dimensional versions of R2D2 are tested over a historical period and compared to a univariate BC. How the different BC methods behave in a climate change context is also illustrated with an application to regional climate simulations over the 2071-2100 period. The results indicate that the 1d-BC basically reproduces the climate model multivariate properties, 2d-R2D2 is only satisfying in the inter-variable context, 1506d-R2D2 strongly improves inter-site properties and 3012d-R2D2 is able to account for both. Applications of the proposed R2D2 method to various climate datasets are relevant for many impact studies. The perspectives of improvements are numerous, such as introducing stochasticity in the dependence itself, questioning its stability assumption, and accounting for temporal properties adjustment while including more physics in the adjustment procedures. © Author(s) 2018.",,"Climate change; Digital storage; Sampling; Dependence structures; Historical periods; Multivariate methods; Physical variables; Realistic variability; Regional climate simulation; Statistical dependence; Univariate distributions; Climate models; climate change; climate modeling; multivariate analysis; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; sampling; sampling bias; simulation; temperature effect; France",Article,Scopus

Improvements in the timeliness and accuracy of yield forecasting by incorporating near real-time remote sensing data and the use of sophisticated statistical methods can improve our capacity to respond effectively to these challenges. The objectives of this study were (i) to investigate the use of derived vegetation indices for the yield forecasting of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) from the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at the ecodistrict scale across Western Canada with the Integrated Canadian Crop Yield Forecaster (ICCYF); and (ii) to compare the ICCYF-model based forecasts and their accuracy across two spatial scales-the ecodistrict and Census Agricultural Region (CAR), namely in CAR with previously reported ICCYF weak performance. Ecodistricts are areas with distinct climate, soil, landscape and ecological aspects, whereas CARs are census-based/statistically-delineated areas. Agroclimate variables combined respectively with MODIS-NDVI and MODIS-EVI indices were used as inputs for the in-season yield forecasting of spring wheat during the 2000-2010 period. Regression models were built based on a procedure of a leave-one-year-out. The results showed that both agroclimate + MODIS-NDVI and agroclimate + MODIS-EVI performed equally well predicting spring wheat yield at the ECD scale. The mean absolute error percentages (MAPE) of the models selected from both the two data sets ranged from 2% to 33% over the study period. The model efficiency index (MEI) varied between ??1.1 and 0.99 and ??1.8 and 0.99, respectively for the agroclimate + MODIS-NDVI and agroclimate + MODIS-EVI data sets. Moreover, significant improvement in forecasting skill (with decreasing MAPE of 40% and 5 times increasing MEI, on average) was obtained at the finer, ecodistrict spatial scale, compared to the coarser CAR scale. Forecast models need to consider the distribution of extreme values of predictor variables to improve the selection of remote sensing indices. Our findings indicate that statistical-based forecastingerror could be significantly reduced by making use of MODIS-EVI and NDVI indices at different times in the crop growing season and within different sub-regions. © 2014 by the authors.","Ecodistrict; ICCYF; MODIS; Spring wheat; Yield forecasting","Agriculture; Climate change; Crops; Cultivation; Forecasting; Image reconstruction; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Surveys; Ecodistrict; ICCYF; MODIS; Spring wheat; Yield forecasting; Radiometers",Article,Scopus

The assessment of changes in regional and larger scale crop variability requires high resolution and spatially consistent future weather, matching a specific climate scenario. Such data could be derived from regional climate models (RCMs), which provide changes in weather patterns. In general, RCM output is heavily biased with respect to observations. Due to the strong nonlinear relation between meteorological input and crop yields, the application of this biased output may result in large biases in the simulated crop yield changes. The use of RCM output only makes sense after sufficient bias correction. This study explores how RCM output can be bias corrected for the assessment of changes in European and subregional scale crop yield variability due to climate change. For this, output of the RCM RACMO of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute was bias corrected and applied within the crop simulation model WOrld FOod STudies to simulate potential and water limited yields of three divergent crops: winter wheat, maize and sugar beets. The bias correction appeared necessary to successfully reproduce the mean yields as simulated with observational data. It also substantially improved the year-to-year variability of seasonal precipitation and radiation within RACMO, but some bias in the interannual variability remained. This is caused by the fact that the applied correction focuses on mean and daily variability. The interannual variability of growing season length, and as a consequence the potential yields too, appeared even deteriorated. Projected decrease in mean crop yields is well in line with earlier studies. No significant change in crop yield variability was found. Yet, only one RCM is analysed in this study, and it is recommended to extend this study with more climate models and a slightly adjusted bias correction taking into account the variability of larger time scales as well. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bias correction; CGMS; Climate change; Crop yields; Interannual variability; RACMO; Spatial coherence",,Article,Scopus

However, although gas exchange between croplands and the atmosphere is measurable in the field, it is difficult to quantify at the plot scale over relatively large areas because of the heterogeneous character of landscapes and differences in crop management. However, assessing accurate carbon and water budgets over croplands is essential to promote sustainable agronomic practices and reduce the water demand and the climatic impacts of croplands while maintaining sufficient yields. From this perspective, we developed a crop model, SAFYE-CO2, that assimilates high spatial- and temporal-resolution (HSTR) remote sensing products to estimate daily crop biomass, water and CO2 fluxes, annual yields, and carbon budgets at the parcel level over large areas. This modeling approach was evaluated for sunflower against two in situ datasets. First, the model's output was compared to data acquired during two cropping seasons at the Auradé integrated carbon observation system (ICOS) instrumented site in southwestern France. The model accurately simulated the daily net CO2 flux (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.97 gC·m-2·d-1 and determination coefficient (R2) = 0.83) and water flux (RMSE = 0.68 mm·d-1 and R2 = 0.79). The model's performance was then evaluated against biomass and yield data collected from 80 plots located in southwestern France. The model was able to satisfactorily estimate biomass dynamics and yield (RMSE = 66 and 54 g·m-2, respectively). To investigate the potential application of the proposed approach at a large scale, given that soil properties are important factors affecting the model, a sensitivity analysis of two existing soil products (GlobalSoilMap and SoilGrids) was carried out. Our results show that these products are not sufficiently accurate for inclusion as inputs to the model, which requires more accurate information on soil water retention capacity to assess water fluxes. Additionally, we argue that no water stress should be considered in the crop growth computation since this stress is already present because of remote sensing information in the proposed approach. This study should be considered a first step to fulfill the existing gap in quantifying carbon budgets at the plot scale over large areas and to accurately estimate the effects of management practices, such as the use of cover crops or specific crop rotations on cropland C and water budgets. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon budget; Crop modeling; Remote sensing; Soil properties; Water budget","Biogeochemistry; Biomass; Budget control; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Crops; Ecology; Mean square error; Plants (botany); Sensitivity analysis; Soil moisture; Determination coefficients; High resolution remote sensing; Management practices; Remote sensing information; Root mean square errors; Soil water retention; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Water budget components; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

Most models are described by dis-crete dynamic systems in general state-space representation with important domain-specific characteristics: First, plant model parameters have usually clear functional meanings and may be of genetic origins, thus necessitating a precise estimation. Second, critical growth variables, specifically biomass production and dynamic allocation to organs, are hidden variables not acces-sible to measure. Finally, the difficulty to assess the local plant environment may imply the introduction of process noises in models. Therefore, a precise understanding of the system’s behavior requires the joint estimation of functional parameters, hidden states, and noise parameters. In this paper we describe how a full Bayesian method of estimation can accurately estimate all these key model variables using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) tech-niques. In the presence of both process and observation noises, it requires to use adequate particle MCMC (PMCMC) algorithms to efficiently sample the hidden states which, consequently, allows for a precise estimation of all noise parameters involved. Thanks to the Bayesian framework, appropriate choices of prior distributions for the noise parameters have enabled analytical pos-terior distributions and only simple updates are required. Furthermore, this estimation strategy can be easily generalized and adapted to different types of plant growth models, such as organ-scale or compartmental, provided that they are formulated as hidden Markov models. Our estimation method im-proves on those classically used in plant growth modeling in several aspects: First, by building upon a general probabilistic framework the estimation results allow proper statistical analyses. It is useful in prediction, no only for uncertainty and risk analysis (e.g., for crop yield prediction) but also to an-alyze the results of experimental trials, for example, to compare genotypes in breeding. Moreover, the care taken in the estimation of hidden variables opens new perspectives in the understanding of inner growth processes, no-tably the balance and interaction between biomass production and allocation (referred to as source-sink dynamics). Applications of this estimation proce-dure are demonstrated on the GreenLab model for Arabidopsis thaliana and the Log-Normal Allocation and Senescence (LNAS) model for sugar beet, on both synthetic and real data. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2022.","Bayesian inference; hidden Markov model; particle MCMC; plant growth",,Article,Scopus

The remote sensing data and technique have been widely used for the estimation of crop yield and production in the world. For the current research, nine remote sensing indices were tested that include normalized difference drought index (NDDI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature condition index (TCI), vegetation health index (VHI), normalized multi-band drought index (NMDI), visible and shortwave infrared drought index (VSDI), and vegetation supply water index (VSWI). These nine indices derived from MODIS/Terra satellite have so far not been used for crop yield prediction in Mongolia. The primary objective of this study was to determine the best remote sensing indices in order to develop an estimation model for spring wheat yield using correlation and regression method. The spring wheat yield data from the ground measurements of eight meteorological stations in Darkhan and Selenge provinces from 2000 to 2017 have been used. The data were collected during the period of the growing season (June-August). Based on the analysis, we constructed six models for spring wheat yield estimation. The results showed that the range of the root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of estimated spring wheat yield was between 4.1 (100 kg ha-1) to 4.8 (100 kg ha-1), respectively. The range of the mean absolute error (MAE) values was between 3.3 to 3.8 and the index of agreement (d) values was between 0.74 to 0.84, respectively. The conclusion was that the best model would be (R2 = 0.55) based on NDWI, VSDI, and NDVI out of the nine indices and could serve as the most effective predictor and reliable remote sensing indices for monitoring the spring wheat yield in the northern part of Mongolia. Our results showed that the best timing of yield prediction for spring wheat was around the end of June and the beginning of July, which is the flowering stage of spring wheat in this study area. This means an accurate yield prediction for spring wheat can be achieved two months before the harvest time using the regression model. © 2019 by the authors.","MODIS; Northern Mongolia; Remote sensing indices; Spring wheat; Yield estimation","Crops; Drought; Forecasting; Mean square error; Radiometers; Regression analysis; Vegetation; MODIS; Mongolia; Remote sensing index; Spring wheat; Yield estimation; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

The dynamical downscaling model used in this study is the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with varying land-surface models and resolutions (20 and 50 km) and the statistical tool is the Cumulative Distribution Function-transform (CDF-t). To achieve a spatially resolved downscaling over the Mediterranean basin, the European Climate Assessment and Dataset (ECA&D) gridded dataset is used for calibration and evaluation of the downscaling models. In the frame of HyMeX and MED-CORDEX international programs, the downscaling is performed on ERA-I reanalysis over the 1989-2008 period. The results show that despite local calibration, CDF-t produces more accurate spatial variability of near-surface temperature and rainfall with respect to ECA&D than WRF which solves the three-dimensional equation of conservation. This first suggests that at 20-50 km resolutions, these three-dimensional processes only weakly contribute to the local value of temperature and precipitation with respect to local one-dimensional processes. Calibration of CDF-t at each individual grid point is thus sufficient to reproduce accurately the spatial pattern. A second explanation is the use of gridded data such as ECA&D which smoothes in part the horizontal variability after data interpolation and damps the added value of dynamical downscaling. This explains partly the absence of added-value of the 2-stage downscaling approach which combines statistical and dynamical downscaling models. The temporal variability of statistically downscaled temperature and rainfall is finally strongly driven by the temporal variability of its forcing (here ERA-Interim or WRF simulations). CDF-t is thus efficient as a bias correction tool but does not show any added-value regarding the time variability of the downscaled field. Finally, the quality of the reference observation dataset is a key issue. Comparison of CDF-t calibrated with ECA&D dataset and WRF simulations to local measurements from weather stations not assimilated in ECA&D, shows that the temporal variability of the downscaled data with respect to the local observations is closer to the local measurements than to ECA&D data. This highlights the strong added-value of dynamical downscaling which improves the temporal variability of the atmospheric dynamics with regard to the driving model. This article highlights the benefits and inconveniences emerging from the use of both downscaling techniques for climate research. Our goal is to contribute to the discussion on the use of downscaling tools to assess the impact of climate change on regional scales. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Climate extremes; CORDEX; Downscaling; HyMeX; MED-CORDEX; Mediterranean climate; Seasonal variability","accuracy assessment; calibration; climate change; climate modeling; downscaling; Mediterranean environment; performance assessment; precipitation assessment; regional climate; research work; seasonal variation; spatial variation; temperature profile; three-dimensional modeling; weather forecasting; Mediterranean Region",Article,Scopus

Furthermore, wheat and mustard yields were predicted as ~ 1.75 and 0.74 ton/ha, respectively using a regression-based yield model. These estimated yields were quite close to reported crop statistics with a mean yield of 1.7 (for wheat) and 0.6 (for mustard) ton/ha.

Soil carbon credit is the additional change in soil carbon stock under certain farming practices compared with the business-as-usual practices. Accurately calculating cropland carbon budget and soil carbon credit is critical to assessing climate change mitigation potential in agroecosystems. The calculation of cropland carbon budget and soil carbon credit is sensitive to local soil and climatic conditions, especially initial soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, which is determined by both SOC concentration (SOC%) and bulk density (Bulk_Density). SOC stock data are either from soil sampling or gridded public survey data. In agroecosystem models, SOC stock data are a key model input for quantifying cropland carbon budget and soil carbon credit. However, various types and degrees of uncertainties exist in SOC stock datasets, which propagate to the quantification of SOC stock change. In particular, a large discrepancy is found in two widely used SOC stock datasets — Rapid Carbon Assessment dataset (RaCA) and Gridded Soil Survey Geographic Database (gSSURGO) — in the U.S. Midwest, with a relative difference (quantified using Normalized Root Mean Square Error, NRMSE) of 48.0% for 0–30 cm SOC stock between the two datasets. It remains largely unclear how uncertainty in SOC stocks affects the calculation of cropland carbon budget and soil carbon credit. To address this question, we used a well-validated process-based agroecosystem model, ecosys, to assess the impacts of SOC stock uncertainty on carbon budget and soil carbon credit calculation in the U.S. Midwestern corn-soybean rotation systems. Our results reveal the following findings: (1) A sizable discrepancy exists in simulated cropland carbon budget between using gSSURGO and using RaCA for their SOC% and Bulk_Density as model inputs, with a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of only 0.4 for simulated change of SOC stock (ΔSOC) using these two different soil datasets. (2) Simulated cropland carbon budget components were more sensitive to initial SOC% than to Bulk_Density. For example, the upper and lower quartiles of multi-year averaged ΔSOC were −29.8 and 4.8 gC/m2/year for the selected counties respectively, with an uncertainty of 13.7 and 0.7 gC/m2/year induced by uncertainties in initial SOC% and Bulk_Density, respectively. (3) Both simulated ΔSOC and its uncertainty were negatively correlated with initial SOC%, whereas ΔSOC was negatively correlated with air temperature, and ΔSOC uncertainty was positively correlated with air temperature. (4) The uncertainty of calculated soil carbon credits was much smaller compared with the uncertainty of calculated absolute carbon budgets assuming the same SOC stock uncertainty level in the inputs. Specifically, in our assessment comparing planting cover crops vs no cover crop, the uncertainty of calculated soil carbon credits induced by initial SOC% uncertainty was less than 4% (relative to the quantified value of the soil carbon credits) for 90% of the cases. Our analysis highlights that high accuracy measurement of SOC% as inputs is needed for the calculation of cropland carbon budgets; however, soil carbon credit quantification is much less sensitive to the initial SOC% inputs, and the current publicly available soil datasets (e.g., gSSURGO) are largely suitable for the calculation of soil carbon credits. © 2022 The Author(s)","Agroecosystem; Carbon budgets; Process-based model; Soil carbon credits; Soil organic carbon; Uncertainty","Budget control; Climate change; Correlation methods; Ecosystems; Large dataset; Mean square error; Organic carbon; Soils; Uncertainty analysis; Agro-ecosystems; Carbon budgets; Carbon credits; Initial soils; Process-based modeling; Soil carbon; Soil carbon credit; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic Carbon stocks; Uncertainty; Soil surveys; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural land; bulk density; carbon budget; climate change; organic carbon; Midwest; United States",Article,Scopus

In fine-textured, low-permeability soil profiles, moles can be installed to supplement an underlying tile drain system. However, moles are often not included in such designs. The objective of this modeling study was to investigate the performance impacts of variations in mole integrity and design in such a soil profile during a range of rainfall event scenarios. A finite element software package (SEEP/W) was used to model a field site having (system 1) subsurface tile drains (0.9 m depth, 15 m spacing) with gravel aggregate(10 to 50 mm) and intersecting mole drains (0.6 m depth, 1.4 m spacing). The field site was subjected to a pedological survey to characterize the soil profile, while an on-site weather station and end-of-pipe flowmeters provided rainfall and discharge data from which the model could be calibrated. The calibrated model showed close agreement between modeled and observed subsurface discharge in the validation period (coefficient of mass residual = 0.12, index of agreement = 0.94, model efficiency = 0.74). The model was then used to evaluate the impact of three alternative designs: tile drains only, a common practice in similar soils (system 2); a design similar to system 1 but with the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) of the mole-drained layer decreased to mimic a reduction in mole drain integrity and effectiveness (system 3); and a design similar to system 1 but with Ks of the mole-drained layer increased to mimic improved soil disturbance and fissuring during installation (system 4). These systems were analyzed using the calibration (event A) and validation (event B) rainfall events as well as two notional rainfall scenarios: a ""fixed rainfall"" scenario (event C) with a rainfall rate of 2 mm h-1 applied to all systems for 50 h and a ""historical rainfall"" scenario (event D) with annual (30 year) average daily values for the area (taken as the average monthly totals divided by the number of days per month) applied over a year. Results showed that the modeled designs exhibited similar relative behavior in all simulated rainfall scenarios. Systems 1 and 4 consistently outperformed systems 2 and 3 in terms of average and peak discharge and water table control capacity. Across rainfall events, system 2 (without mole drains) was the least effective and was seen to decrease drain discharge by an average of 63% and reduce mean water table depth by an average of 72% relative to systems 1 and 4. Results showed the importance of mole channels in supplementing tile drainage on fine soils, as well as the importance of mole integrity for optimal performance. Such a tool could provide decision support in the drainage system design process and assess the implications of design variations on cost, expected performance, and likely returns to the landowner by estimating seasonal variations in drainage discharge and water table position. Identifying and characterizing the major soil types on a farm through soil profile pedological descriptions and collation of real soil physical and meteorological data is essential to prescribe appropriate drainage designs and prioritize areas for drainage installation in light of technical feasibility and cost estimates. With highresolution data, the software can be calibrated for other drainage system and climate change scenarios. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Mole drainage; Rainfall; SEEP/W; Simulation; Soil physical properties; Subsurface drainage","Climate change; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Cultivation; Decision support systems; Decision tables; Drainage; Finite element method; Forestry; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Hydraulic conductivity; Meteorology; Rain; Soil testing; Soils; Systems analysis; Mole drainage; SEEP/W; Simulation; Soil physical property; Subsurface drainages; Soil surveys; calibration; design; hydraulic conductivity; installation; model validation; modeling; peak discharge; pedology; physical property; rainfall; seasonal variation; simulation; software; soil drainage; soil profile; soil property; subsurface flow; tile drain; water table",Conference Paper,Scopus

Adoption of climate-smart soil and crop management practices could buffer future extreme weather effects on maize yield. To test this hypothesis, the overarching aim of our study was to (i) calibrate and evaluation the DSSAT model for maize and parameterize the DSSAT tillage module for different tillage practices (contour ridge tillage and reduced tillage), and (ii) simulate the effects of different management options (tillage and crop residue incorporation) to buffer future extreme climate events on maize yield in four soil types (Lixisols and Plinthosols) located in two landscape positions (upslope and footslopes) of Benin and Burkina-Faso in West Africa, using two climate scenarios (baseline and 2 °C above pre-industrial period). Scenario analysis was performed using factorial combination of two tillage operations (contour ridge and reduced tillage), one crop residue treatment (with crop residue), and two N fertilizer rates (recommended N rate: 60 kg ha−1 and double recommended N rate: 120 kg ha−1) using HAPPI dataset. Model performance (calibration, evaluation and tillage model parameterization) was good as indicated by the lower normalized root mean square error (nRMSE, 12 %–18 %) and mean root absolute error (MRAE, 10 %–16 %), and higher D-index (0.78−0.93) depending on tillage practices and soil types. Long term future climate simulations and cumulative probability distribution confirmed that with both fertilization cases (recommended and double recommended), contour ridge tillage along with crop residue application could enhance maize yield (4 %–7 %) at upslope field sites under a future 2 °C warming scenario, where soil erosion and loss of water and nutrients through runoff is a serious risk. Simultaneously, reduced tillage with crop residue application under both fertilization cases could be a valuable alternative to farmer's practice in fields with deep soils at footslope position (St1 and St3), as it resulted in a higher increase of maize yield (14.5 %) under future 2 °C warming scenario compared to the baseline and could be preferred by risk-averse farmers. Maize production on gravelly soils with low water retention capacity (St1, 63−66 mm) may suffer (-11 %) from future 2 °C warming regardless of the tillage practice. However, despite the significant site-specific tillage effects, intensified N fertilizer application could reduce maize yield losses on St2, St3, and St4, irrespective of tillage practices by improving maize N uptake under elevated CO2 during future warming period. Hence, the application of site-specific tillage operations and crop residue application has the potential to buffer future warming effects on maize yield as confirmed by DSSAT simulations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CERES-Maize; Climate change adaptation; Extreme weather; Modelling","Agricultural runoff; Agricultural wastes; Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Extreme weather; Fertilizers; Mean square error; Parameter estimation; Probability distributions; Risk perception; Soils; Crop management practices; Cumulative probability distribution; Landscape positions; Management options; Model parameterization; Root mean square errors; Scenario analysis; Tillage practices; Soil surveys; buffer zone; climate change; crop production; crop residue; crop yield; fertilizer application; future prospect; maize; soil degradation; soil erosion; soil type; tillage; Benin [West Africa]; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

First, coarse-resolution global climate models that realistically capture the mean monsoon characteristics were selected. Second, lateral and boundary conditions taken from selected global models’ projections are employed to run a high-resolution regional climate model. Third, climate variables from regional model being fed into panel data regression model. For different scenarios and for mid and end of century projections, in conjunction with projected rainfall, a comprehensive assessment is carried out to underscore the sensitivities of maximum and minimum temperatures under different stages of rice production, viz. vegetative, reproductive and maturity phases, and to the concept of growing degree days (GDD, cumulative heat effect). Irrespective of scenarios, in response to an increase in projected monsoon rainfall and surface temperature conditions, the regression model estimates an increase of rice yield of about 10–12% by mid-century and 5–33% by the end of the century. In the regression model, the baseline coefficients were estimated from observed rainfall and temperature available from India Meteorological Department (IMD). The projected changes in rice yield, however, remain unchanged for baseline coefficients estimated from regional climate model outputs (forced by reanalysis products) rainfall and temperature.

Remote sensing techniques have become popular in estimating actual crop evapotranspiration and hence crop water requirements in recent decades due to the advantages they offer to users, e.g. low cost, regional data and use of maps instead of point measurements as well as saving time. The use of earth observation data supports models' accuracy in the procedure for assessing water footprint, since no average values are used: instead, users have real values for the specific parameters. The present study provides two examples of how remote sensing techniques are used essentially for estimating evapotranspiration along with crop yield, two basic parameters, for assessing water footprint. Two different case studies have been illustrated to define the methodology proposed, which refers to Mediterranean conditions and can be applied after inferring the necessary field data of each crop. The first case study refers to the application of Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) for estimating evapotranspiration, while the second refers to the Crop Yield prediction. Both elements, such as evapotranspiration and crop yield, are vital for water footprint accounting. Firstly, the SEBAL was adopted, under the essential adaptations for local soil and meteorological conditions for estimating groundnut water requirements. Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ and Landsat 8 OLI images were used to retrieve the required spectral data. The SEBAL model is enhanced with empirical equations regarding crop canopy factors, in order to increase the accuracy of crop evapotranspiration estimation. Maps were created for evapotranspiration (ET) using the SEBAL modified model for the area of interest. The results were compared with measurements from an evaporation pan, used as a reference. Statistical comparisons showed that the modified SEBAL can predict ETc in a very effective and accurate way and provide water footprint modellers with high-level crop water data. Yield prediction plays a vital role in calculating water footprint. Having real values rather than taking reference (or averaged) values from FAO is an advantage that Earth Observation means can provide. This is very important in econometric or any other prediction models used for estimating water footprint because using average data reduces accuracy. In this context, crop and soil parameters along with remotely sensed data can be used to develop models that can provide users with accurate yield estimations. In a second step, crop and soil parameters along with the normalized difference vegetation index were correlated to examine whether crop yield can be predicted and to define the actual time-window to predict the yield. Statistical and remote sensing techniques were then applied to derive and map a model that can predict crop yield. The algorithm developed for this purpose indicates that remote sensing observations can predict crop yields effectively and accurately. Using the statistical Student's t test, it was found that there was no statistically significant difference between predicted and real values for crop yield. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2017.",,"algorithm; crop yield; energy balance; EOS; evapotranspiration; Landsat; Mediterranean environment; model test; NDVI; prediction; remote sensing; surface energy; water footprint; water use",Article,Scopus

Crop growth models have been widely used for crop growth process description and yield prediction. In particular, the accurate simulation of important state variables, such as leaf area index (LAI) and root zone soil moisture (SM), is of great importance for yield estimation. Data assimilation is a useful tool that combines a crop model and external observations (often derived from remote sensing data) to improve the simulated crop state variables and consequently model outputs like crop total biomass, water use and grain yield. In spite of its effectiveness, applying data assimilation for monitoring crop growth at the regional scale in China remains challenging, due to the lack of high spatiotemporal resolution satellite data that can match the small field sizes which are typical for agriculture in China. With the accessibility of freely available images acquired by Sentinel satellites, it becomes possible to acquire data at high spatiotemporal resolution (10–30 m, 5–6 days), which offers attractive opportunities to characterize crop growth. In this study, we assimilated remotely sensed LAI and SM into the Word Food Studies (WOFOST) model to estimate winter wheat yield using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) algorithm. The LAI was calculated from Sentinel-2 using a lookup table method, and the SM was calculated from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 based on a change detection approach. Through validation with field data, the inverse error was 10% and 35% for LAI and SM, respectively. The open-loop wheat yield estimation, independent assimilations of LAI and SM, and a joint assimilation of LAI + SM were tested and validated using field measurement observation in the city of Hengshui, China, during the 2016–2017 winter wheat growing season. The results indicated that the accuracy of wheat yield simulated by WOFOST was significantly improved after joint assimilation at the field scale. Compared to the open-loop estimation, the yield root mean square error (RMSE) with field observations was decreased by 69 kg/ha for the LAI assimilation, 39 kg/ha for the SM assimilation and 167 kg/ha for the joint LAI + SM assimilation. Yield coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.41, 0.65, 0.50, and 0.76 and mean relative errors (MRE) of 4.87%, 4.32%, 4.45% and 3.17% were obtained for open-loop, LAI assimilation alone, SM assimilation alone and joint LAI + SM assimilation, respectively. The results suggest that LAI was the first-choice variable for crop data assimilation over SM, and when both LAI and SM satellite data are available, the joint data assimilation has a better performance because LAI and SM have interacting effects. Hence, joint assimilation of LAI and SM from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 at a 20 m resolution into the WOFOST provides a robust method to improve crop yield estimations. However, there is still bias between the key soil moisture in the root zone and the Sentinel-1 C band retrieved SM, especially when the vegetation cover is high. By active and passive microwave data fusion, it may be possible to offer a higher accuracy SM for crop yield prediction. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Cultivation began by the last quarter of the 19th Century occupying 50% of the surface at present. Low input agriculture, in combination with livestock production, was performed till 1970, afterwards soybean (Glicyne max (L). Merr.) crop was introduced. This crop replaced pastures and at present it accounts for 60% of the grain crop seeded surface. During the 2007-2008 growing season 382 sites, widespread over the region, were sampled up to 1 m depth and carbonate R. Alvarez, J. L. carbon, organic carbon, and total nitrogen stocks were determined in these soil samples. Land use had no effect on inorganic carbon content, which accounted for one third of total soil carbon. Aggregation of soil map information showed that the carbonate carbon stock of the region was estimated to be 1.9 Gt. Organic carbon was affected by land use. Cropped soils lost 16% of their organic carbon stock up to 50 cm depth. The overall organic carbon stock of the Pampas was estimated to be 4.2 Gt. This estimation was achieved combining an artificial neural network model for carbon estimation that used as inputs climate, textural, and land use information, and satellite image classification that referred to land use per pampean county. The net flux of C-CO2 from soils to the atmosphere as the consequence of cultivation was estimated to be 0.33 Gt. Cropping effect on total nitrogen stock was similar to the effect on organic carbon. The average C/N ratio of the soils was 8.9, with only small differences between land use types and depth layers. When comparing present organic carbon and nitrogen stocks with those estimated from soil maps corresponding to surveys performed ca. 40 years ago, we observed that areas with high carbon and nitrogen contents tended to loose carbon and nitrogen and areas with low levels tended to maintain the levels or increase them. The maintenance or increase of carbon could be explained by increases in rainfall due to climate change and the increase of crop residue inputs of higher yielding crops, despite the soybean adoption in rotations. Additionally, the adoption of no-till as the most common tillage system favored carbon gain of many soils. The Pampean agroecosystems have a positive nitrogen balance with an annual gain of ca. 1 Mt N yr-1. The main nitrogen input to soils is through biological nitrogen fixation, both by leguminous pasture and soybean, which represents ca. 5 times the fertilizer input. In sites with annual crop rotations the nitrogen balance is near neutral. Productivity of Pampean soils is regulated by available water holding capacity and organic carbon content. Changes in carbon levels produced by the agricultural use have little impact on productivity. The effects of different management practices on organic carbon and some labile fractions (microbial biomass, in vitro mineralized carbon, particulate carbon, light fraction carbon) were assessed in numerous field experiments, performed mainly in the humid portion of the Pampas. The labile fractions of organic matter are not good indicators of future changes in the carbon content of Pampean soils. These fractions change more pronounced than organic carbon only when carbon changes are greater than 25-50% but vary in equal measure or even with an opposite trend below this threshold. Neither these fractions, nor the potentially mineralizable nitrogen or the organic matter/clay+silt ratio are good predictors of the nitrate level at planting or crop yields. Crop yield prediction could not be improved by using the mentioned labile fractions instead of organic carbon in models. Conversely, biological fractionations, determined by in vitro nitrogen mineralization, allowed a better soil nitrogen mineralization prediction under field conditions than using only carbon and nitrogen stocks. An artificial neural network model was fitted that predicted field nitrogen mineralization using as inputs, land use informatiooil texture, temperature, water content, total nitrogen stock, and the in vitro mineralization test results, with very good performance (R2= 0.76). The impact of cultivation on soil nitrogen supplying capacity was assessed for by applying this network. In average, cultivation produced an 80% decrease in the nitrogen mineralization capacity of soils. Despite soil nitrogen was only moderately affected by cropping, the biological fractionation method, coupled with artificial intelligence modeling, showed great significant soil degradation in the Pampas. Present levels of nitrogen mineralization capacity of soils are not enough to sustain high to medium wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and corn (Zea mayz L.) yield and fertilization has become a required practice. Our results show that pampean soils loose only a small fraction of their organic matter content, but this fraction had a deep impact on soil fertility. Biological fractionation, not physical fractionation of organic matter, allowed to asses cropping effects on soil quality, and resulted in the development of suitable methods for agronomic purposes in the Pampas. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Satellite remote sensing provides an effective means for regional and global cropland monitoring, particularly in data-sparse regions that lack reliable ground observations and reporting. The conventional approach of using visible and near-infrared based vegetation index (VI) observations has prevailed for decades since the onset of the global satellite era. However, other satellite data encompass diverse spectral ranges that may contain complementary information on crop growth and yield, but have been largely understudied and underused. Here we conducted one of the first attempts at synergizing multiple satellite data spanning a diverse spectral range, including visible, near-infrared, thermal and microwave, into one framework to estimate crop yield for the U.S. Corn Belt, one of the world's most important food baskets. Specifically, we included MODIS Enhanced VI (EVI), estimated Gross Primary Production based on GOME-2 solar-induced fluorescence (SIF-GPP), thermal-based ALEXI Evapotranspiration (ET), QuikSCAT Ku-band radar backscatter, and AMSR-E X-band passive microwave Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) in this study, benchmarked on USDA county-level crop yield statistics. We used Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), an effective statistical model for dimension reduction, to distinguish commonly shared and unique individual information from the various satellite data and other ancillary climate information for crop yield estimation. In the PLSR model that includes all of the satellite data and climate variables from 2007 to 2009, we assessed the first two major PLSR components and found that the first component (an integrated proxy of crop aboveground biomass) explained 82% variability of modelled crop yield, and the second component (dominated by environmental stresses) explained 15% variability of modelled crop yield. We found that most of the satellite derived metrics (e.g. SIF-GPP, radar backscatter, EVI, VOD, ALEXI-ET) share common information related to aboveground crop biomass (i.e. the first component). For this shared information, the SIF-GPP and backscatter data contain almost the same amount of information as EVI at the county scale. When removing the above shared component from all of the satellite data, we found that EVI and SIF-GPP do not provide much extra information; instead, Ku-band backscatter, thermal-based ALEXI-ET, and X-band VOD provide unique information on environmental stresses that improves overall crop yield predictive skill. In particular, Ku-band backscatter and associated differences between morning and afternoon overpasses contribute unique information on crop growth and environmental stress. Overall, using satellite data from various spectral bands significantly improves regional crop yield predictions. The additional use of ancillary climate data (e.g. precipitation and temperature) further improves model skill, in part because the crop reproductive stage related to harvest index is highly sensitive to environmental stresses but they are not fully captured by the satellite data used in our study. We conclude that using satellite data across various spectral ranges can improve monitoring of large-scale crop growth and yield beyond what can be achieved from individual sensors. These results also inform the synergistic use and development of current and next generation satellite missions, including NASA ECOSTRESS, SMAP, and OCO-2, for agricultural applications. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Crop yield; Fluorescence; Microwave; Optical; Partial least square regression6; Radar; Thermal","Agriculture; Backscattering; Climate models; Crops; Ecology; Fluorescence; Infrared devices; Microwaves; NASA; Radar; Remote sensing; Satellites; Vegetation; Video on demand; Crop yield; Microwave satellite data; Optical; Partial least square (PLS); Partial least square regression; Solar-induced fluorescences; Thermal; Visible and near infrared; Space-based radar; AMSR-E; backscatter; crop yield; environmental stress; estimation method; fluorescence; GOME; least squares method; MODIS; NSCAT; OCO; optical depth; optical method; QuikSCAT; radar altimetry; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite mission; vegetation index; Corn Belt; United States; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Agriculture is strongly affected by climate change due to increasing temperatures, water shortage, heavy rainfall and variations in the frequency and intensity of excessive climatic events such as floods and droughts. Farmers need to adapt to climate change by developing advanced and sophisticated farming systems instead of simply farming at lower intensity and occupying more land. Integrated agricultural systems constitute a promising solution, as they can lower reliance on external inputs, enhance nutrient cycling and increase natural resource use efficiency. In this context, the concept of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) emerged as a promising solution to secure the resources for the growing world population under climate change conditions. This work proposes a CSA architecture for fostering and supporting integrated agricultural systems, such as Mixed Farming Systems (MFS), by facilitating the design, the deployment and the management of crop–livestock-=forestry combinations towards sustainable, efficient and climate resilient agricultural systems. Propelled by cutting-edge technology solutions in data collection and processing, along with fully autonomous monitoring systems, e.g., smart sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the proposed architecture called MiFarm-CSA, aims to foster core interactions among animals, forests and crops, while mitigating the high complexity of these interactions, through a novel conceptual framework. © 2021 by the authors.","climate smart agriculture; internet of things; mixed farming systems; participatory learning; socio-economic modelling; unmanned aerial vehicles",,Article,Scopus

However, due to weather extremes and uncertainties, most forecasting models for crop yield are not reliable and accurate. For measuring the uncertainty in crop yield forecast, a probabilistic forecasting model based on quantile random forest and Epanechnikov kernel function (QRF-E) is proposed. The non-linear structure of random forest is applied to build the non-linear quantile regression forecast model and to capture the non-linear relationship betweeen the weather variables and crop yield. Epanechnikov kernel function and solve-the equation plug-in approach of Sheather and Jones are used in the density estimation. A case study using groundnut and millet yield in Ghana were presented to illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed technique. The values of the prediction interval coverage probability and prediction interval normalized average width for the two crops showed that, the constructed prediction intervals captured the observed yields with high coverage probability. The probability density curves show that QRF-E method has a very high ability to forecast quality prediction intervals with a higher coverage probability. The feature importance gave a score of the importance of each weather variable in building the quantile random forest model. The farmer and other stakeholders are able to realize the specific weather variable that affects the yield of a selected crop through feature importance.

It can be determined by different parameters such as temperature/humidity, soil mineral contents, soil pH level, salinity level, climatic conditions, moisture of the soil, etc. These parameters must meet the optimum level to make a desirable environment to sustain productivity. Failure to provide the required condition from any of the parameters will lead the plant to stress and deteriorate, potentially leading to a loss in productivity. Laborious ways of monitoring the agricultural parameters are inefficient and time-consuming. An automated irrigation system is essential for the proper growth of crops. Excessive watering of crops and crop water dehydration can lead to stresses that affect the growth of plants. Supplying an optimum amount of water is essential for the healthy development of plants. The IoT and artificial intelligence technologies are the most viable alternative solution for traditional yield prediction and irrigation because of the remote accessibility, interoperability, cognitive capability, etc. These technologies aid the farmers in monitoring agricultural parameters remotely from embedded devices, drastically reducing human efforts. It makes farming much efficient and a smarter farming experience and also increases crop productivity exponentially. This chapter has manifested the current environmental problems and the potential future challenges that may decrease crop productivity of the crops. It also shows how the sensor technology has gradually evolved the traditional farming experience to solve problems and the possibilities of transforming the current farming practices into much more innovative and eco-friendly with the emergence of artificial intelligence technologies.

Crop models are a key tool used to assess the potential of adaptation options and to identify their sensitivity to climate. However, the decision on which options to include in modelling studies is often driven by data availability, rather than an assessment of which options are most likely to be transformative. The ability of agricultural models to assess a wider range of options has improved in recent years, but the application of crop models in assessing adaptation effectiveness remains limited with some of the most effective options underrepresented (e.g. agroforestry or climate services). Here, we call for agricultural modelling studies to include a broader range of adaptation options (inclusive of agronomic, nature-based, technological and financial adjustments) and outline solutions that would allow for better representation of these options within integrated agricultural models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",,"adaptive management; agricultural modeling; climate change; cropping practice; environmental factor",Review,Scopus

In this study, we provided a risk management framework for a rainfed paddy rice field in Savannakhet province of Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) that allows achieving the national target yield (5.0Mg ha-1) under climatic uncertainty. We collected the multi-model ensemble (MME) tercile hindcasts of 3-month (September to November, SON) and 5-month (July to November, JASON) rainfall for 1991–2010 from the international collaborative archive of the APEC Climate Center (APCC). The monthly probabilistic hindcasts were temporally downscaled by a stochastic weather generator to daily meteorological inputs for the CERES-Rice crop model. Then, the lowland rainfed rice yields at the field scale were simulated by the process-based crop model with different nitrogen (N) fertilizing strategies, and compared the outcomes against the observed rice yields. The results showed that the simulated rice yields from the 3-month hindcasts with the N-fertilizer application rate of level 1 (60 kg ha-1) were closer to the observed than those from the 5-month hindcasts. About 3.05Mg ha-1 of rice yields were estimated under the 3-month seasonal forecasts in 2020 with the N-fertilizer application rate. We found that additional 40 kg ha-1 of N-fertilizer rate may be required to achieve the national target rice yield (5.0Mg ha-1) under climatic uncertainty conditioned by the seasonal forecasts. We also suggest that the proposed crop modeling approach underpinned by seasonal climate forecasts can be useful to reduce impacts of climate variability on rice yield by providing various agricultural management practices. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","APCC MME seasonal forecasts; Climatic risks, Stochastic weather generator; Crop yield modeling; Lao People's Democratic Republic; Nitrogen fertilizer management","Climate models; Crops; Nitrogen fertilizers; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Weather forecasting; APEC climate center multi-model ensemble seasonal forecast; Climatic risk, stochastic weather generator; Climatic risks; Crop yield; Crop yield modeling; Fertilizer management; Lao people democratic republic; Multi-model ensemble; Nitrogen fertilizer management; Seasonal forecasts; Stochastic weather generator; Yield models; Risk management; agricultural management; climate change; crop yield; fertilizer application; management practice; paddy field; rainfed agriculture; rice; seasonal variation; soil nitrogen; strategic approach; Laos",Article,Scopus

Here we present a study that combines twenty-years of Landsat and MODIS data, climate and weather records, municipality-level crop yield statistics, random forests and linear regression models for mapping crop yield in a multi-temporal, multi-scale modeling framework. The study was conducted for soybean in Brazil. Using a recently developed 30 m resolution, annual (2001–2019) soybean classification map product, we aggregated multi-temporal phenological metrics derived from Landsat and MODIS data over soybean pixels to the municipality scale. We combined phenological metrics with topographic features, long-term climate data, in-season weather data and soil variables as inputs to machine learning models. We trained a multi-year random forests model using yield statistics as reference and subsequently applied linear regression to adjust the biases in the direct output of the random forests model. This model combination achieved the best performance with a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 344 kg/ha (12% relative to long-term mean yield) and an r2 of 0.69, on the basis of 20% withheld test data. The RMSE of the leave-one-year-out model assessment ranged from 259 kg/ha to 816 kg/ha. To eliminate the artifacts caused by the coarse-resolution climate and weather data, we developed multiple models with different categories of input variables. Employing the per-pixel uncertainty estimates of different models, the final soybean yield maps were produced through per-pixel model composition. We applied the models trained on 2001–2019 data to 2020 data and produced a soybean yield map for 2020, demonstrating the predictive capability of trained machine learning models for operational yield mapping in future years. Our research showed that combining satellite, climate and weather data and machine learning could effectively map crop yield at high resolution, providing critical information to understand yield growth, anomaly and food security. © 2022","Climate; Crop yield map; Landsat; MODIS; Random forests; Weather","climate change; crop yield; Landsat; machine learning; mapping method; MODIS; satellite data; soybean; Brazil",Article,Scopus

Physically-based crop models have been designed, which require large sets of input variables, besides being timeworn, tedious, and not user-friendly in the current situation. There is a rapid advancement in the modeling approaches in agricultural practices. But, still, there is a shortage of comprehensive information related to the recent technological advancement in the modeling applications toward CSA and its prospects. The paper reviews, critically assess, and discusses the present state-of-art modeling technologies related to the CSA. Special emphasis is placed on highlighting the current research trends in the different crop simulation models and their CSA applications. The assessment and analysis of the combined implications of crop simulation and hydrological models form another vital area of our review. Subsequently, the suitability and future scope of AI in crop simulation models is thoroughly assessed. Finally, the ways to address future challenges for CSA through the models and AI-based approaches are evaluated. We have selected and critically reviewed the literature to deliberate on the various aspects of modeling and their impact on CSA. Overall, we attempted to distinctly bring out the different latest and advanced technologies and their potential roles in modeling exercises towards CSA. The current review also collates and presents new and innovative modeling approaches toward CSA with techno-feasible solutions. The review involves the simulation-optimization framework for coupling hydrological and climate models with crop models that presently have the utmost importance for the CSA. Concurrently it also highlights the overarching significance of different models and suggests refined solutions that enable better crop and environment estimation, field management, and decision-making. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural systems management; Climate change impact; Crop modeling; Hydrological models; Remote sensing applications","food production",Review,Scopus

Three global climate models (GCMs; HadGEM2-ES, NorESM1 and MPI-ESM) were dynamically downscaled using three high resolution (0. 22 ∘) regional climate models (RCMs; RegCM4, REMO2015 and CCLM5-0-15). These simulations were from the Coordinated Output for Regional Evaluations within the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment framework (CORDEX-CORE) publicly available through the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) web portals. The capabilities of the RCMs in the representation of maximum consecutive wet day (CWD), maximum consecutive dry days (CDD), number of dry days (NDD), and number of wet days (NWD) were compared with observation/satellites datasets obtained from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Tropical Applications of Meteorology using SATellite data and ground-based observations (TAMSAT). The reference datasets showed similar spatial pattern and magnitude of analyzed precipitation extremes but models exhibit different pronounced discrepancies relative to them. All RCMs consistently captured the spatial patterns of the indices but with some pronounced biases along the Guinean coast and northern parts of Niger. There exists little or no biases in the representation of annual cycle along the Guinea and Sahel for all the indices based on each of the RCMs ensemble, with the exception of RegCM4 which has a more pronounced bias in CWD. Statistical evaluation of the performance of the models over the entire West Africa with respect to the 4 indices revealed that REMO2015 models and its ensemble have overall lowest root mean square error followed by the choice of MPI-ESM GCM downscaled with either of the RCMs. REMO-HAD was found to have the best performance in the representation of consecutive dry days and number of wet days with RMSE values of 25.74 and 18.91 respectively. REMO-MPI has superior performance in the estimation of consecutive wet days and number of dry days with RMSE values of 5.38 and 20.51 respectively. Generally, REMO RCMs ensemble was found to be the best ensemble in all indices except consecutive dry days where REG4 ensembles had better performance. Operational use of these 3 RCMs are recommended with compensation for over-and underestimations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change; CORDEX-CORE; Dry spell; Extreme precipitation; West Africa; Wet spell","annual variation; climate modeling; data set; downscaling; extreme event; precipitation assessment; regional climate",Article,Scopus

However, limited consideration has been given to its critical effects on soil biogeochemistry (e.g., soil microorganisms, soil organic carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions), land desertification, and biodiversity loss. This article is based on synthesis of information in 238 articles published between 1989 and 2022 on these effects of soil salinity. Principal findings are as follows: (1) salinity affects microbial community composition and soil enzyme activities due to changes in osmotic pressure and ion effects; (2) soil salinity reduces soil organic carbon (SOC) content and alters GHG emissions, which is a serious issue under intensifying agriculture and global warming scenarios; (3) soil salinity can reduce crop yield up to 58 %; (4) soil salinity, even at low levels, can cause profound alteration in soil biodiversity; (5) due to severe soil salinity, some soils are reaching critical desertification status; (6) innovate mitigation strategies of soil salinity need to be approached in a way that should support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs). Knowledge gaps still exist mainly in the effects of salinity especially, responses of GHG emissions and biodiversity. Previous experiences quantifying soil salinity effects remained small-scale, and inappropriate research methods were sometimes applied for investigating soil salinity effects. Therefore, further studies are urgently required to improve our understanding on the effects of salinity, address salinity effects in larger-scale, and develop innovative research methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Climate change; Desertification; Greenhouse gas emissions; Soil microorganisms; Soil salinity","Crops; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Microorganisms; Organic carbon; Osmosis; Productivity; Soils; Agricultural productivity; Critical effects; Crop yield; Desertification; Effect on soils; Greenhouse gas emissions; Research method; Salinity effects; Soil micro-organisms; Soil salinity; Biodiversity; fertilizer; magnesium sulfate; carbon; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; biodiversity; carbon emission; climate change; crop yield; desertification; enzyme activity; greenhouse gas; salinity; soil chemistry; soil microorganism; Bacteroidetes; biodiversity; climate change; crop management; desertification; enzyme activity; evapotranspiration; Firmicutes; Gammaproteobacteria; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; greenhouse gas emission; harvest; humic substance; hydraulic conductivity; lactic acid bacterium; methanogenesis; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; osmotic pressure; osmotic stress; phytoremediation; Planctomycetes; plant growth; Proteobacteria; quantitative analysis; Review; salt stress; seasonal variation; soil acidification; soil acidity; soil analysis; soil fertility; soil moisture; soil salinity; soil texture; systematic review; volatilization; water availability; agriculture; biodiversity; chemistry; environmental protection; greenhouse gas; procedures; salinity; soil; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation of Natural Resources; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Salinity; Soil",Review,Scopus

In Saudi Arabia (SA), agriculture relies on groundwater, seasonal water, desalinated water, and recycled water due to a lack of surface water resources, a dry environment, and scanty rainfall. Estimating water consumption to plan crop water requirements (CWR) in changing environments is difficult due to a lack of micro-level data on water consumption, particularly in agricultural systems. High-resolution satellite data combined with environmental data provides a valuable tool for computing the CWR. This study aimed to estimate the CWR with a greater spatial and temporal resolution and localized field data and environmental variables. Obtaining this at the field level is appropriate, but geospatial technology can produce repeatable, time-series phenomena and align with environmental data for wider coverage regions. The CWR in the study area has been investigated through two methods: firstly, based on the high-resolution PlanetScope (PS) data, and secondly, using the FAO CROPWAT model v8.0. The analysis revealed that evapotranspiration (ETo) showed a minimum response of 2.22 mm/day in January to a maximum of 6.13 mm/day in July, with high temperatures (42.8). The humidity reaches a peak of 51%, falling to a minimum in June of 15%. Annual CWR values (in mm) for seven crops studied in the present investigation, including date palm, wheat, citrus, maize, barley, clover, and vegetables, were 1377, 296, 964, 275, 259, 1077, 214, respectively. The monthly averaged CWR derived using PS showed a higher correlation (r = 0.83) with CROPWAT model results. The study was promising and highlighted that such analysis is decisive and can be implemented in any region by using Machine Learning and Deep Learning for in-depth insights. © 2022 by the authors.","agriculture; CWR; evapotranspiration; Saudi Arabia","arid region; climate change; evapotranspiration; machine learning; water use; Saudi Arabia",Article,Scopus

Prior knowledge on yield helps coffee farmers in their decision-making and planning for the future harvest, avoiding unnecessary costs and losses during the harvesting process. Thus, we sought to predict coffee yield with regressive models using meteorological data of the state of Paraná, Brazil. This study was carried out in 15 localities that produce Coffea arabica in this Brazilian state. The climate data were collected using the NASA/POWER platform from 1989 to 2020, while the data of arabica coffee yield (bags/ha) were obtained by CONAB from 2003 to 2018. The Penman–Monteith method was used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration and the climatological water balance (WB) was calculated based on Thornthwaite and Mather (1955). Multiple linear regression was used in the data modeling, in which C. arabica yield was the dependent variable and air temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, water deficit, water surplus, and soil water storage were the independent variables. The comparison between the estimation models and the actual data was performed using the statistical indices RMSE (accuracy) and adjusted coefficient of determination (R2adj) (precision). Multiple linear regression models can predict arabica coffee yield in the state of Paraná 2 to 3 months before harvest. The maximum air temperature is the climate element that most influences coffee plants, especially during fruit formation (March). Maximum air temperatures of 31.01 °C in March can reduce coffee production. Wenceslau Braz, Jacarezinho, and Ibaiti presented the highest yields, with mean values of 32.5, 29.9, and 29.3 bags ha−1, respectively. The models calibrated for localities that have Argisol had the highest mean accuracy, with an RMSE of 2.68 bags ha−1. The best models were calibrated for Paranavaí (Latosol), with an RMSE of 0.78 bags ha−1 and R2adj of 0.89, and Ibaiti (Argisol), with RMSE and R2adj values of 3.09 bags ha−1 and 0.83, respectively. Paranavaí has a mean difference between the actual and estimated coffee yield of only 0.86 bags ha−1. The highest deviations were observed in Wenceslau Braz (9.17 bags ha−1) and the lowest deviations were found in Paranavaí (0.86 bags ha−1).

The present study applies a model cascade capable of simultaneously considering the interactions between agricultural and hydrological droughts. The study area covers all river basins in the Czech Republic and includes the periods of 1956–2015 (baseline) and 2021–2080 (future). The model cascade was shown to explain 91% of the variability in the seasonal and annual accumulated runoff and allows for the analysis of increasing/maintaining/decreasing available water capacity (AWC) across the 133 defined basins with a total area of c. 78,000 km2. The study reports that the probability and extent of agricultural drought increased over the entire period with higher AWC scenario showing slower pace of such increase especially from April to June. The trends in the extent or severity of hydrological droughts were of low magnitude. The future climate has been projected through the use of ensembles of five global (CMIP5) and five regional (EURO-CORDEX) climate models. The results showed a significant increase in the duration of agricultural drought stress and in the area affected throughout the year, particularly in July–September. The hydrological drought response showed a marked difference between areas with a negative and positive climatic water balance, i.e., areas where long-term reference evapotranspiration exceeds long-term precipitation (negative climatic water balance) and where it does not (positive climatic water balance). The overall results indicate that increasing soil AWC would decrease the frequency and likely also impact of future agricultural droughts, especially during spring. This result would be especially true if the wetter winters predicted by some of the models materialized. Hydrological droughts at the country level are estimated to become more pronounced with increasing AWC, particularly in catchments with a negative climatic water balance. © 2022","Agricultural drought; Available water capacity; Climate change; Climate models; Hydrological drought; Soil water retention","Agriculture; Catchments; Climate change; Drought; Soil moisture; Water resources; Agricultural drought; Available water capacities; Climate condition; Climatic water balance; Future climate; Hydrological droughts; Over water; Potential conflict; Soil water retention; Waters resources; Climate models; adaptive management; available water capacity; climate conditions; drought; drought stress; evapotranspiration; runoff; water resource; Czech Republic",Article,Scopus

Despite tremendous technological advancements, fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil) continue to be the world’s primary source of energy. Global energy scenarios indicate a change in coal consumption trends in the future, which in turn will have commercial, geopolitical, and environmental consequences. We investigated coal consumption up to 2030 using a new hybrid method of WOANFIS (whale optimization algorithm and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system). The WOANFIS method’s performance was assessed by the MSE (Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), STD (error standard deviation), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and coefficient of correlation (R2) among the real dataset and the WOANFIS result. For the prediction of global coal consumption, the proposed WOANFIS had the best MAE, RMSE, and correlation coefficient (R2) values, which were 0.00113, 0.0047, and 0.98, respectively. Lastly, future global coal consumption was predicted up to 2030 by WOANFIS. Following 150 years of coal dominance, the results demonstrate that WOANFIS is a suitable method for estimating worldwide coal consumption, which makes it possible to plan for the transition away from coal. © 2022 by the authors.

Within the context of Russian agricultural history, the recent high growth in grain production is exceptional. This growth however is not fully replicated by the “weather-yield” crop models, which project only moderate yield increase in the twenty-first century and fail to predict the most recent record growth in grain yields. The difference between the projected climate-dependent yields and observations is especially high in two of the most important agricultural regions, the Central Black Earth and Northern Caucasus regions while the remaining agricultural zones show good agreement with the regression models. Similar differences were observed in the late 1960s, which we interpret in terms of the rapid changes in agricultural technology during the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR) agricultural reforms followed by periods of reversal. We also interpret the current period of high differentiation between weather-yield model results and collected yields as evidence of a higher than usual contribution of agricultural reforms in yield improvements, which, however, primarily benefit the large-scale producers located in the most productive areas of Russia. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Agriculture; Climate change; Grain export; Grain yields; Russia; Statistical models","Climate models; Earth (planet); Grain (agricultural product); Regression analysis; Agricultural zones; Caucasus; Crop modeling; Grain export; Grain production; Grain yield; High growth; Russia; Statistic modeling; Yield increase; Climate change; agricultural technology; differentiation; Earth; regression; Caucasus; Central Department; Northern Caucasus; Russian Federation; Russian Federation; USSR",Article,Scopus

Added water also cools crop plants through transpiration; irrigation might thus play an important role in a warmer climate by simultaneously moderating water and high temperature stresses. Here we used satellite-derived evapotranspiration estimates, land surface temperature (LST) measurements, and crop phenological stage information from Nebraska maize to quantify how irrigation relieves both water and temperature stresses. Unlike air temperature metrics, satellite-derived LST revealed a significant irrigation-induced cooling effect, especially during the grain filling period (GFP) of crop growth. This cooling appeared to extend the maize growing season, especially for GFP, likely due to the stronger temperature sensitivity of phenological development during this stage. Our analysis also revealed that irrigation not only reduced water and temperature stress but also weakened the response of yield to these stresses. Specifically, temperature stress was significantly weakened for reproductive processes in irrigated maize. Attribution analysis further suggested that water and high temperature stress alleviation was responsible for 65±10% and 35±5.3% of the irrigation yield benefit, respectively. Our study underlines the relative importance of high temperature stress alleviation in yield improvement and the necessity of simulating crop surface temperature to better quantify heat stress effects in crop yield models. Finally, considering the potentially strong interaction between water and heat stress, future research on irrigation benefits should explore the interaction effects between heat and drought alleviation. © 2022 The Author(s).",,"Atmospheric temperature; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Satellites; Surface properties; Thermal stress; Water supply; Yield stress; Grain-filling periods; Heat stress; High temperature stress; Irrigation effects; Land surface temperature; Satellite data; Stress alleviation; Temperature stress; Water stress; Water temperatures; Crops; air temperature; climate change; crop yield; drought; evapotranspiration; food production; irrigation; land surface; maize; satellite data; stress analysis; surface temperature; water demand; Nebraska; United States",Article,Scopus

A number of previous studies that analyzed changes in precipitation across the Great Lakes and Midwest for a variety of time periods and using a range of quality-control standards and methods observed increased precipitation rates and totals, although there was considerable site-to-site variability, even for sites in close physical proximity. Biases and discontinuities in precipitation observations may contribute to this variability. This study identifies and examines changes in precipitation utilizing a unique approach to observation series screening over a region encompassing the Great Lakes and broader Midwestern region of the United States for the period 1951–2019. A multiple tier procedure was utilized to identify high quality input data series from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset. Annual and seasonal time series of precipitation indicators were calculated and subjected to breakpoint analysis as further quality control. Trends were analyzed across a broad range of related indicators, from totals and frequencies of threshold events to event duration and potential linkages with total precipitable water. Results indicate that annual precipitation has generally increased across the region in terms of totals, although there is substantial variation across the study domain in the significance and magnitude of annual trends by indicator. Annual trends were spatially most consistent across eastern areas of the study domain while relatively greater station-to-station variability in trend significance and magnitude was observed across northern and western portions. Significant trends were generally fewer in number for seasonal precipitation indicators and less spatially coherent. The greatest number of significant trends occurred in fall with the fewest in spring. Correlation of indicator trends with trends of mean total precipitable water suggests weak correlations annually and moderate correlations at the seasonal scale. The trends of the precipitation indicators in our study exhibited more coherent spatial patterns when compared with studies with different quality control criteria, illustrating the importance of quality control of observations in climatic studies and highlighting the complexity of the changing character of precipitation.

A theory-grounded, normalized measure of systemic risk, R2, is developed and made amenable to empirical analysis through the logit link. The measure is estimated on a large-scale, unit-level corn yield dataset. We find that systemic risk explains less than half of total unit yield variability on average, suggesting that the risk management effectiveness of area yield insurance is low. By relating natural resource endowments with systemic risk, we find that more excessive heat and drought events lead to larger while more excessive precipitation events lead to smaller systemic risk. We then study whether current area yield insurance subsidy rates provide farmers with sufficient subsidy transfers to compensate for the uncovered risk exposure associated with area yield insurance. A new concept, the threshold relative area subsidy rate (TRASR), quantifies a lower bound on the ratio of area yield insurance subsidy rate over individual yield insurance subsidy rate below which risk-averse farmers should always prefer individual yield insurance to area yield insurance. The calibrated TRASR values indicate that current area yield insurance subsidy rates discourage farmers from choosing area yield insurance over individual yield insurance, especially at low area yield insurance coverage levels. We also find that TRASR is positively correlated with systemic risk at the unit-level of analysis, suggesting that farmers who like area yield insurance's risk management features will dislike its transfer implications and vice versa. © 2022 The Authors.

In this work, to consider the farmers’ risk-aversion behavior, we slightly shifted the typical focus to the risk associated with a crucial farming decision in a rainfed paddy rice field, the transplanting timing. Using a simple crop model and a semi-parametric weather generator, we tested hypothetical and real sets of climate forecasts for the rice field under nutrient deficiency in Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). Results showed that the first climatic risk in the study field was an occational dry conditions, and the traditional timing of transplanting seemed to minimize the worst effect of potential dry conditions. It was found that the transplanting timing needs to be 5–10 days earlier than the farming tradition when fertility stress delays foliage development. The tests with hypothetical climate forecasts suggest that duration of a potential dry condition needs to be reliably forecasted to manage the climatic risk by adjusting the transplanting timing. The yield simulations for the 2015 El-Niño event also implcate that adjusting the transplanting timing could effectively reduce the potential impact of dry climate at a cost of slightly reduced yield expectation.

This study investigates the predicting WF of maize based on meteorological variables including maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), mean temperature (Tmean), solar radiation (SR), wind speed (WS), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), Extraterrestrial radiation (Ra) relative humidity (RH) and crop coefficient (Kc) by applying ten scenarios of climate variables in the Egyptian Nile Delta, Ad Daqahliyah Governorate for predicting blue WF of maize during 2000–2019. The main findings are following as, firstly; based on developing four kernels, the performance of the PUK kernel in predicting blue WF is far better than the other three kernels followed by the Poly kernel. Secondly; for PUK kernel, model 7 (Tmax, Tmin, Tmean, WS, Sunshine Hours (SH), VPD and SR) has good performance which is close to models 8 (model 7 + Ra), model 9 (model 7 + Ra and RH) and model 10 (all inputs). Thirdly; in all four kernels, the error rate in small blue WF values is higher than the other values, moreover, the error value decreases at the medium blue WF values, while, it increases again at large WF values.

Field observations and remote sensing both show that tundra “greening” has been widespread, but heterogeneity in regional and landscape-scale trends suggest that additional controls are mediating the response of tundra vegetation to warming. In this study, we examined the relationship between changes in vegetation productivity in the western Canadian Arctic and biophysical variables by analyzing trends in the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) obtained from nonparametric regression of annual Landsat surface reflectance composites. We used Random Forests classification and regression tree modelling to predict the trajectory and magnitude of greening from 1984 to 2016 and identify biophysical controls. More than two-thirds of our study area showed statistically significant increases in vegetation productivity, but observed changes were heterogeneous, occurring most rapidly within areas of the Southern Arctic that were: (1) dominated by dwarf and upright shrub cover types, (2) moderately sloping, and (3) located at lower elevation. These findings suggest that the response of tundra vegetation to warming is mediated by regional- and landscape-scale variation in microclimate, topography and soil moisture, and physiological differences among plant functional groups.

The Upper Mississippi River Basin was selected to evaluate the effects of subbasin and/or hydrologic response unit (HRU) delineations and the density of climate dataset on the simulated streamflow and water balance components using the Hydrologic and Water Quality System (HAWQS) platform. Five scenarios were examined with the same parameter set, including 8- and 12-digit hydrologic unit codes, two levels of HRU thresholds and two climate data densities. Results showed that statistic evaluations of monthly streamflow from 1983 to 2005 were satisfactory at some gauge sites but were relatively worse at others when shifting from 8-digit to 12-digit subbasins, revealing that the hydrologic response to delineation schemes can vary across a large basin. Average channel slope and drainage density increased significantly from 8-digit to 12-digit subbasins. This resulted in higher lateral flow and groundwater flow estimates, especially for the lateral flow. Moreover, a finer HRU delineation tends to generate more runoff because it captures a refined level of watershed spatial variability. The analysis of climate datasets revealed that denser climate data produced higher predicted runoff, especially for summer months. © 2021 by the authors.

In many models, the climate projections are downscaled to individual map units represented by grid cells or subbasins. Uncertainty of downscaled climate projections are a product of uncertainties arising mainly from the model itself, from the representative concentration pathway (RCP), and from the downscaling procedure. Other sources of uncertainty may include the historical observations used for GCM bias correction and data aggregation from GCM grids to map (often subbasin) units. This study evaluated effects of three sources of historical data (ground-based weather station network, NCDC, and two gridded datasets, NEXRAD and PRISM) on historical variability, and shifts and uncertainty in precipitation and temperature projections. Climate projections from six GCMs and three RCPs were evaluated in 54 subbasins of the Smoky Hill River watershed in the U.S. Central Great Plains. Bias correction of GCM projections reduced bias of watershed-average annual precipitation in the historical period to near zero, but subbasin-specific variability remained in future projections with little difference among bias-correction data sources. For minimum and maximum temperatures, the GCM ensemble statistics for basin-average and subbasin-specific future projections were similar for all bias-correction data sources. Increase in RCP forcing was found to widen the uncertainty in future projections. Overall, the uncertainty due to data source selection was smaller than the uncertainty due to GCM model and RCP forcing selection. The results demonstrate that statistical downscaling is essential to account for local climate factors within a watershed, and that both weather station-based and gridded bias-correction data sources can be used effectively, but that future climate projections may inherit the historical bias in a selected data source. These inherent uncertainties associated with application of GCMs in hydrological and geospatial modeling should be carefully considered for understanding climate projections when building watershed models and interpreting the results. © 2021 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

Uncertainty in historical, current and future effectiveness of actions hampers decisions about how to mitigate changes to prevent biodiversity loss and species extinctions. Research in resource management, agriculture and health indicates that forecasts predicting the effects of near-term or seasonal environmental conditions on management greatly improve outcomes. Such forecasts help resolve uncertainties about when and how to operationalize management. We reviewed the scientific literature on environmental management to investigate whether near-term forecasts are developed to inform biodiversity decisions in Australia, a nation with one of the highest recent extinction rates across the globe. We found that forecasts focused on economic objectives (e.g. fisheries management) predict on significantly shorter timelines and answer a broader range of management questions than forecasts focused on biodiversity conservation. We then evaluated scientific literature on the effectiveness of 484 actions to manage seven major terrestrial threats in Australia, to identify opportunities for near-term forecasts to inform operational conservation decisions. Depending on the action, between 30% and 80% threat management operations experienced near-term weather impacts on outcomes before, during or after management. Disease control, species translocation/reintroduction and habitat restoration actions were most frequently impacted, and negative impacts such as increased species mortality and reduced recruitment were more likely than positive impacts. Drought or dry conditions, and rainfall, were the most frequently reported weather impacts, indicating that near-term forecasts predicting the effects of low or excessive rainfall on management outcomes are likely to have the greatest benefits. Across the world, many regions are, like Australia, becoming warmer and drier, or experiencing more extreme rainfall events. Informing conservation decisions with near-term and seasonal ecological forecasting will be critical to harness uncertainties and lower the risk of threat management failure under global change. © 2020 The Authors.

A major challenge is to detect changes in the atmospheric circulation patterns associated with those extreme events. The emergence of patterns depends on the chaotic behavior of the atmospheric flow and can also be modified by anthropogenic emissions. By embedding the circulation patterns observed during selected extremes into historical climate simulations and projections based on emission scenarios, we find major changes in probability, predictability, and persistence of atmospheric patterns observed during extreme events using an analog-based method. The results highlight the need to take into account the role of atmospheric circulation in attribution studies as future extremes will be associated with modified circulation patterns. ©2020.

Our study focuses on quantifying the uncertainty due to ICV in projections of crop productions in Canada. We utilize climate scenarios from two large ensembles (LEs, CanESM2-LE and CanRCM4-LE with 25 members each) as inputs to the crop models in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer. We simulate crop yields for canola, maize and spring wheat under the future climates of four global warming levels. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the projected crop production across the LE members is used to quantify the uncertainty related to ICV and this is compared with the CVs generated using the 20 GCMs in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Crop production in Canada could increase with global warming, e.g. spring wheat production could increase by up to 21% at the warming level of 3.0 °C. The projections often produce larger uncertainty associated with the GCMs than from ICV at all warming levels above 2.0 °C. The results from an asymptotic test for the equality of CVs show a significant difference in CVs of projections of canola production between CanESM2-LE/CanRCM4-LE and CMIP5 for the warming level of 3.0 °C. However, the test results do not indicate a significant difference among the ensembles at all four warming levels for maize and spring wheat. The uncertainty due to ICV is often comparable to that associated with GCMs at the warming level of 1.5 °C, e.g. a CV of 6.0 and 6.4% for CanESM2-LE and CanRCM4-LE and 6.6% for CMIP5 in the projections of spring wheat production. We conclude there is a need to account for uncertainty related to ICV in projections of Canadian crop production, especially at lower warming levels. © 2020 Canadian Crown Copyright.

Thus, crop yield forecasting based on seasonal weather information remains a challenge for the agricultural sector. In this study, non-linear regression analysis was carried out to model long-term meteorological data. To assess the predictability of weather based on long-term meteorological data representing a continental climate with four seasons, principal component analysis was done. Predictability of crop yield based on previous long-term yield data was tested with the Wald-Wolfowitz Runs method. Finally, non-linear regression analysis was applied to investigate the predictability of maize yield based on winter wheat yield. The hypothesis that the weather of a season would be predictable based on long-term daily temperature and precipitation dataset was disproved, although results showed that for the investigated region, if winter is warm, spring can be expected to be warm, as well. It was also statistically disproved that crop yield would be predictable based on time series analysis of previous yield data. However, a cross effect between the yields of maize and wheat as model crops was proved; when the crop yield of winter wheat is low, that of maize is expected also to be low, while in case of high winter wheat yield, maize yield can be high in cases where there is no climate stress in the flowering and ripening periods. However, as an overall conclusion, even if relations are found between weather variabilities and responding crop yield variations, crop yield cannot be estimated, since weather represented by a chaotic model with scale-independent distribution cannot be predicted in advance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate; Crop yield; Prediction; Principal component analysis; Season; Weather","Agricultural robots; Climate models; Crops; Forecasting; Meteorology; Principal component analysis; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Weathering; Agricultural sector; Climate; Continental climate; Crop yield; Crop yield forecasting; Non-linear regression analysis; Season; Weather information; Weather forecasting; climate change; climate conditions; crop yield; principal component analysis; seasonal variation; Central Europe; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Here, we evaluate a modified version of SWAT2012 (referred to as SWAT-EC hereafter), which integrates an energy balanced soil temperature module (STM) and the CENTRUY-based soil organic matter algorithm, for simulating water quality parameters in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB), and compare it against the original SWAT2012. Model evaluation was performed for simulating streamflow, sediment, and nitrate-N (NO3-N) and total nitrogen (TN) loadings at three stations near the outlets of UMRB. The model comparison was conducted without parameter calibration in order to assess their performance under ungauged conditions. The results indicate that SWAT-EC outperformed SWAT2012 for stream flow and NO3-N and TN loading simulation on both monthly and annual scales. For sediment, SWAT-EC performed better than SWAT2012 on a monthly time step basis, but no noticeable improvement was found at the annual scale. In addition, the performance of the uncalibrated SWAT-EC was comparable to other calibrated SWAT models reported in previous publications with respect to sediment and NO3-N loadings.

Forecasting yields of bioenergy crops at fine spatial resolutions can help to evaluate near-term and long-term pathways for scaling up bio-based fuel and chemical production, and for understanding the impacts of abiotic stressors such as severe droughts and temperature extremes on potential biomass supply. We used a large dataset of 28,364 Sorghum bicolor yield samples (uniquely identified by county and year of observation), environmental variables, and multiple approaches to analyze historical trends in sorghum productivity across the USA. We selected the most accurate machine learning approach (a variation of the random forest approach) to predict future trends in sorghum yields under four greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios and two irrigation regimes. We identified irrigation practices, vapor pressure deficit, and time (a proxy for technological improvement) as the most important predictors of sorghum productivity. Our results showed a decreasing trend of sorghum yields over future years (on average 2.7% from 2018 to 2099), with greater decline under a high GHG emissions scenario (3.8%) and in the absence of irrigation (4.6%). Geographically, we observed the steepest predicted declines in the Great Lakes (8.2%), Upper Midwest (7.5%), and Heartland (6.7%) regions. Our study demonstrates the use of machine learning to identify environmental controllers of sorghum biomass yield and predict yields with reasonable accuracy. These results can inform the development of more realistic biomass supply projections for bioenergy if sorghum production is scaled up. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","bioenergy; biofuels; climate change; machine learning; sorghum; yield modeling","Biofuels; Chemical industry; Climate change; Crops; Decision trees; Forecasting; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Large dataset; Learning systems; Machine learning; Productivity; Agricultural productions; Bio-energy; Environmental variables; Future climate scenarios; Machine learning approaches; sorghum; Technological improvements; Yield modeling; Biomass",Article,Scopus

The sustainability of groundwater is uncertain, as little is known about its extent and availability, a challenge that requires a quantitative assessment of its current use. This study assessed groundwater use for irrigated agriculture in the Venda-Gazankulu area of Limpopo Province in South Africa using crop evapotranspiration and irrigated crop area derived from the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). Evapotranspiration data was derived from the Water Productivity through Open access of Remotely sensed Actual Evapotranspiration and Interception (WaPOR) dataset (250 m resolution), and irrigated areas were characterised using dry season NDVI data derived from Landsat 8. Field surveys were conducted for four years to assess accuracy and for post-classification correction. Daily ET for the dry season (May to September) was developed from the actual ET for the irrigated areas. The irrigated areas were overlaid on the ET map to calculate ET for only irrigated land parcels. Groundwater use during the 2015 dry period was 3627.49 billion m3 and the irrigated area during the same period was 26% of cultivated land. About 82 435 ha of cultivated area was irrigated using 44 million m3/ha of water, compared to 186.93 million m3/ha on a rainfed area of 237 847 ha.

The analysis uses 30 years of datasets of rainfall, surface temperature and wind parameters (from 1980 to 2009). We performed a simulation at a spatial resolution of 50 km with the RegCM4.5 model driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis. The rainfall amount is weaker over the Sahel (western and central) and the Guinea region for the warmest years compared to the coldest ones. The analysis of heat fluxes show that the sensible (latent) heat flux is stronger (weaker) during the warmest (coldest) years. When considering the rainfall events, there is a decrease of the number of rainy days over the Guinea Coast (in the South of Cote d'Ivoire, of Ghana and of Benin) and the western and eastern Sahel during warm years. The maximum length of consecutive wet days decreases over the western and eastern Sahel, while the consecutive dry days increase mainly over the Sahel band during the warm years. The percentage of very warm days and warm nights increase mainly over the Sahel domain and the Guinea region. The model also simulates an increase of the warm spell duration index in the whole Sahel domain and over the Guinea Coast in warm years.

We assess the performance of these forecasts for soft wheat, durum wheat, grain maize, rapeseed, sunflower, potato and sugar beet, and sought to answer three questions. First, how good has the system performed? This was investigated by calculating several accuracy indicators (e.g. the mean absolute percentage error, MAPE) for the first forecasts during a season, forecasts one month pre-harvest, and the end-of-campaign (EOC) forecasts during 2006–2015 using reported yields. Second, do forecasts improve during the season? This was evaluated by comparing the accuracy of the first, the pre-harvest, and the EOC forecasts. Third, have forecasts systematically improved year-to-year? This was quantified by testing whether linear models fitted to the median of the national level absolute relative forecast errors for each crop at EU-12 (EU-27) level from 1993 to 2015 (2006–2015) were characterized by significant negative slopes. Encouragingly, the lowest median MAPE across all crops is obtained for Europe's largest producer, France, equalling 3.73%. Similarly, the highest median MAPE is obtained for Portugal, at 14.37%. Forecasts generally underestimated reported yields, with a systematic underestimation across all MS for soft wheat, rapeseed and sugar beet forecasts. Forecasts generally improve during the growing season; both the forecast error and its variability tend to progressively decrease. This is the case for the cereals, and to a lesser extent for the tuber crops, while seasonal forecast improvements are lower for the oilseed crops. The median EU-12 yield forecasts for rapeseed, potato and sugar beet have significantly (p-value < 0.05) improved from 1993 to 2015. No evidence was found for improvements for the other crops, neither was there any significant improvement in any of the crop forecasts from 2006 to 2015, evaluated at EU-27 level. In the early years of the MCYFS, most of the yield time series were characterized by strong trends; nowadays yield growth has slowed or even plateaued in several MS. In addition, an increased volatility in yield statistics is observed, and while crop yield forecasts tend to improve in a given year, in recent years, there is no evidence of structural improvements that carry-over from year-to-year. This underlines that renewed efforts to improve operational crop yield forecasting are needed, especially in the light of the increasingly variable and occasionally unprecedented climatic conditions impacting the EU's crop production systems. © 2018 The Authors","AMIS; Climate change; Crop production; Crop yield forecasting","accuracy assessment; assessment method; canola; climate change; climate conditions; crop improvement; crop plant; crop production; crop yield; European Union; growing season; growth; sugar beet; tuber; France; Portugal; Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Brassica napus; Helianthus; Solanum tuberosum; Triticum aestivum; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

We propose the use of t-conorm or fuzzy union for climate suitability assessment of a grass species using annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) as an example and evaluate the performance for alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.). The ORF and ANDF models, which are fuzzy logic systems based on t-conorm and t-norm between temperature and moisture conditions, respectively, were developed to assess the quality of climate conditions for crops. The parameter values for both models were obtained from existing knowledge, e.g., the EcoCrop database. These models were then compared with the EcoCrop model, which is based on the t-norm. The ORF model explained greater variation (54%) in the yield of annual ryegrass at 84 site-years than the ANDF model (43%) and the EcoCrop model (5%). The climate suitability index of the ORF model had the greatest likelihood of occurrence of annual ryegrass compared to the other models. The ORF model also had similar results for alfalfa and sorghum. We emphasize that the fuzzy logic system for climate suitability assessment can be developed using knowledge rather than presence-only data, which can facilitate more complex approaches such as the incorporation of biotic interaction into species distribution modeling. © 2018 The Author(s).",,"alfalfa; article; climate; crop; fuzzy logic; grass; Lolium multiflorum; moisture; nonhuman; open reading frame; sorghum; species distribution; adaptation; alfalfa; algorithm; climate change; Lolium; physiology; sorghum; Adaptation, Physiological; Algorithms; Climate Change; Fuzzy Logic; Lolium; Medicago sativa; Sorghum",Article,Scopus

We applied a scaling approach to capture changes in climate extremes with increase in global mean temperature in several subregions within the WAF domain: Western Sahel, Central Sahel, Eastern Sahel, Guinea Coast and Central Africa including Congo Basin. While there are several uncertainties and large ensemble spread in the projections of temperature and precipitation indices, most models show high-impact changes in climate extremes at subregional scale. At these smaller scales, temperature increases within the WAF domain are projected to be higher than the global mean temperature increase (at 1.5 °C and at 2 °C) and heat waves are expected to be more frequent and of longer duration. The most intense warming is observed over the drier regions of the Sahel, in the central Sahel and particularly in the eastern Sahel, where the precipitation and the soil moisture anomalies have the highest probability of projected increase at a global warming of 1.5 °C. Over the wetter regions of the Guinea Coast and Central Africa, models project a weak change in total precipitation and a decrease of the length of wet spells, while these two regions have the highest increase of heavy rainfall in the WAF domain at a global warming of 1.5 °C. Western Sahel is projected by 80% of the models to experience the strongest drying with a significant increase in the length of dry spells and a decrease in the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index. This study suggests that the 'dry gets drier, wet gets wetter' paradigm is not valid within the WAF domain. © 2018 The Author(s).

However, their impacts and links to terrestrial water storage (TWS) in general, have not been studied. This study presents the pioneer results of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) of TWS derived from both global reanalysis data (1980–2015) and GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) (2002–2014) with SST fields. The main issues discussed include, (i) oceanic hot spots that impact on TWS over tropical West Africa (TWA) based on CCA, (ii) long term changes in model and global reanalysis data (soil moisture, TWS, and groundwater) and the influence of climate variability on these hydrological indicators, and (iii) the hydrological characteristics of the Equatorial region of Africa (i.e., the Congo basin) based on GRACE-derived TWS, river discharge, and precipitation. Results of the CCA diagnostics show that El-Niño Southern Oscillation related equatorial Pacific SST fluctuations is a major index of climate variability identified in the main portion of the CCA procedure that indicates a significant association with long term TWS reanalysis data over TWA (r = 0.50, ρ &lt; 0.05). Based on Mann-Kendall's statistics, the study found fairly large long term declines (ρ &lt; 0.05) in TWS and soil moisture (1982 − 2015), mostly over the Congo basin, which coincided with warming of the land surface and the surrounding oceans. Meanwhile, some parts of the Sahel show significant wetting (rainfall, soil moisture, groundwater, and TWS) trends during the same period (1982–2015) and aligns with the ongoing narratives of rainfall recovery in the region. Results of singular spectral analysis and regression confirm that multi-annual changes in the Congo River discharge explained a considerable proportion of variability in GRACE-hydrological signal over the Congo basin (r = 0.86 and R2 = 0.70, ρ &lt; 0.05).

However, these conditions are not the only factors that influence a crop growth; dimensions like biophysical, economic-productive, political-institutional, and socio-cultural establish interrelations that affect the viability of planting and produce a crop in a geographic territory.

We extracted the knowledge about 174 varieties from the dataset, which contained information about weather, soil, yield and regional statistical parameters. Next, we predicted the yield of each variety in each of 6,490 observed subregions of the Midwest. Furthermore, yield was predicted for all the possible weather scenarios approximated by 15 historical weather instances contained in the dataset. Using predicted yields and covariance between varieties through different weather scenarios, we performed portfolio optimisation. In this way, for each subregion, we obtained a selection of varieties, that proved superior to others in terms of the amount and stability of yield. According to the rules of Syngenta Crop Challenge, for which this research was conducted, we aggregated the results across all subregions and selected up to five soybean varieties that should be distributed across the network of seed retailers.

Given the interconnectedness between freshwater availability and many ecosystem services, including food provisioning, it is important to evaluate the drought implications on freshwater provisioning and food provisioning services. Studies about drought implications on streamflow, nutrient loads, and crop yields have been increased and these variables are all process-based model outputs that could represent ecosystem functions that contribute to the ecosystem services. However, few studies evaluate drought effects on ecosystem services such as freshwater and food provisioning and quantify these services using an index-based ecosystem service approach. In this study, the drought implications on freshwater and food provisioning services were evaluated for 14 four-digit HUC (Hydrological Unit Codes) subbasins in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB), using three drought indices: standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized soil water content index (SSWI), and standardized streamflow index (SSI). The results showed that the seasonal freshwater provisioning was highly affected by the precipitation deficits and/or surpluses in summer and autumn. A greater importance of hydrological drought than meteorological drought implications on freshwater provisioning was evident for the majority of the subbasins, as evidenced by higher correlations between freshwater provisioning and SSI12 than SPI12. Food provisioning was substantially affected by the precipitation and soil water deficits during summer and early autumn, with relatively less effect observed in winter. A greater importance of agricultural drought effects on food provisioning was evident for most of the subbasins during crop reproductive stages. Results from this study may provide insights to help make effective land management decisions in responding to extreme climate conditions in order to protect and restore freshwater provisioning and food provisioning services in the UMRB. © 2017 by the authors.

RegCM4 was driven for the period 1970–2100 by the HadGEM2-ES and the MPI-ESM Global Climate Models (GCMs) under the RCP8.5 greenhouse gas concentration pathway. RegCM4 accurately simulates the WAM characteristics in terms of seasonal mean, seasonal cycle, interannual variability and extreme events of rainfall. Overall, both RegCM4 experiments are able to reproduce the large-scale atmospheric circulation for the reference period (i.e. present-day), and in fact show improved performance compared to the driving GCMs in terms of precipitation mean climatology and extreme events, although different shortcomings in the various models are still evident. Precipitation is projected to decrease (increase) over western (eastern) Sahel, although with different spatial detail between RegCM4 and the corresponding driving GCMs. Changes in extreme precipitation events show patterns in line with those of the mean change. The models project different changes in water budget over the Sahel region, where the MPI projects an increased deficit in local moisture supply (E < P) whereas the rest of models project a local surplus (E > P). The E–P change is primarily precipitation driven. The precipitation increases over the eastern and/or central Sahel are attributed to the increase of moisture convergence due to increased water vapor in the boundary layer air column and surface evaporation. On the other hand, the projected dry conditions over the western Sahel are associated with the strengthening of moisture divergence in the upper level (850–300 hPa) combined to both a southward migration of the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) and a weakening of rising motion between the core of the AEJ and the Tropical Easterly Jet. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Climate change; CORDEX; Dynamical downscaling; Hydrological cycle; Precipitation extreme; RegCM4; West African summer monsoon climate","climate change; climate prediction; downscaling; extreme event; hydrological cycle; monsoon; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; summer; West Africa",Article,Scopus

Maximum precipitation occurs over the Himalaya region, which is important for water resources and agriculture sectors over the region and also for the economy of the country. Therefore, in the present global warming era, the realistic prediction of winter precipitation over India is important for planning and implementing agriculture and water management strategies. The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) issued the operational prediction of climatic variables in monthly to seasonal scale since 2004 using their first version of fully coupled global climate model known as Climate Forecast System (CFSv1). In 2011, a new version of CFS (CFSv2) was introduced with the incorporation of significant changes in older version of CFS (CFSv1). The new version of CFS is required to compare in detail with the older version in the context of simulating the winter precipitation over India. Therefore, the current study presents a detailed analysis on the performance of CFSv2 as compared to CFSv1 for the winter precipitation over India. The hindcast runs of both CFS versions from 1982 to 2008 with November initial conditions are used and the model’s precipitation is evaluated with that of India Meteorological Department (IMD). The models simulated wind and geopotential height against the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP–NCAR) reanalysis-2 (NNRP2) and remote response patterns of SST against Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperatures version 3b (ERSSTv3b) are examined for the same period. The analyses of winter precipitation revealed that both the models are able to replicate the patterns of observed climatology; interannual variability and coefficient of variation. However, the magnitude is lesser than IMD observation that can be attributed to the model’s inability to simulate the observed remote response of sea surface temperatures to all India winter precipitation. Of the two, CFSv1 is appreciable in capturing year-to-year variations in observed winter precipitation while CFSv2 failed in simulating the same. CFSv1 has accounted for less mean bias and RMSE errors along with good correlations and index of agreements than CFSv2 for predicting winter precipitation over India. In addition, the CFSv1 is also having a high probability of detection in predicting different categories (normal, excess and deficit) of observed winter precipitation over India. © 2015, Springer International Publishing.","Climate forecast system; extremes; Indian region; remote response; seasonal prediction; winter precipitation","Agriculture; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Climatology; Forecasting; Global warming; Oceanography; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Water management; Water resources; Climate forecasts; extremes; Indian region; Remote response; Seasonal prediction; Winter precipitation; Climate models; climate modeling; climate prediction; extreme event; performance assessment; precipitation (climatology); winter; India",Article,Scopus

Climatic indices and their variation were calculated during seven growth stages of wheat in five locations in the northeast of Iran from 1983 to 2008. Principal component analysis (PCA) technique was applied to explore major modes of variation in the regional climatic indices during different crop growth stages. The principle component obtained for each region was correlated to the regional winter wheat yield. Finally the regional amount of water and precipitation use efficiency (WUE and PUE) were analyzed in order to assess any possible association with wheat yield. The results showed that the highest precipitation occurred during the tillering stage and spatially decreased from north (Bojnord) to south (Birjand) and from east (Mashhad) to west (Sabzevar). The difference between the highest and the lowest precipitation across all locations was 2.5 of standard value. The variation pattern of AET, compared to other indices, showed more similarity to variation of precipitation at different growth stages and the highest AET (more than 2 of standard value in all locations) occurred during the tillering stage. The PCA indicated that effective components varied in different locations. The most positive and effective components were types of evapotranspiration that are associated with crop (ETC and AET) and precipitation. However none of these effective PCs showed a significant correlation with final yield. The PUE and WUE analysis indicated that PUE provides more information to interpret the relationship between total amounts of precipitation and the final yield. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

When applying ecohydrologic models to study climate impacts on crop yield, especially interannual yield responses to climate stresses, the model simulation of plant available soil moisture must be constrained in order to reproduce plant production variation via moisture related bio-climate variables. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to investigate the relationship between climate variability and crop yield at four sites (Boone, Woodbury, Madison, and Mason) in the Midwestern USA. The model was first calibrated for soil moisture at the plot scale. The calibrated model was then used to extend the observational records between 1991 and 2010 to better capture the effect of climate variability on crop yield over a longer period (1941-2010). We also explored the relative yield reduction due to individual stresses. Our results indicated that annual observed yield from 1991 to 2010 is correlated with drought stress intensity in the early and middle reproductive stage at most sites. The early and middle reproductive periods were thought more critical than other stages, because severe drought stress in those periods is substantially correlated with low observed yields. No significant relationship between crop yield and aeration stress was found at any of the four sites, due to their different impacts under different spatial scales, as well as low frequency of events in the historical record. Long term simulation of yield reduction indicates that drought stress was the dominant factor affecting yield in the historical period when compared with aeration stress both at short and long return periods (high/low probability of exceedance). For a 70-year period, the total yield reduction due to drought stress is 8.1%, 17.5%, 15.2% and 9.7% respectively for Boone, Woodbury, Madison and Mason. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Aeration stress; Climate variability; Crop yield; Drought stress; Soil moisture; SWAT","aeration; agrometeorology; climate change; climate effect; crop production; crop yield; drought stress; estimation method; historical record; soil moisture; Madison; Midwest; United States; Wisconsin",Article,Scopus

However, extrapolating site-scale observations to regional scales represents a major challenge confronting the agricultural modeling community. This study introduces a novel geospatial agricultural modeling system (GAMS) exploring the integration of the mechanistic Environmental Policy Integrated Climate model, spatially-resolved data, surveyed management data, and supercomputing functions for cropland C budgets estimates. This modeling system creates spatially-explicit modeling units at a spatial resolution consistent with remotely-sensed crop identification and assigns cropping systems to each of them by geo-referencing surveyed crop management information at the county or state level. A parallel computing algorithm was also developed to facilitate the computationally intensive model runs and output post-processing and visualization. We evaluated GAMS against National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) reported crop yields and inventory estimated county-scale cropland C budgets averaged over 2000-2008. We observed good overall agreement, with spatial correlation of 0.89, 0.90, 0.41, and 0.87, for crop yields, Net Primary Production (NPP), Soil Organic C (SOC) change, and Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), respectively. However, we also detected notable differences in the magnitude of NPP and NEE, as well as in the spatial pattern of SOC change. By performing crop-specific annual comparisons, we discuss possible explanations for the discrepancies between GAMS and the inventory method, such as data requirements, representation of agroecosystem processes, completeness and accuracy of crop management data, and accuracy of crop area representation. Based on these analyses, we further discuss strategies to improve GAMS by updating input data and by designing more efficient parallel computing capability to quantitatively assess errors associated with the simulation of C budget components. The modularized design of the GAMS makes it flexible to be updated and adapted for different agricultural models so long as they require similar input data, and to be linked with socio-economic models to understand the effectiveness and implications of diverse C management practices and policies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Agriculture; Carbon; Climate change; EPIC; Geospatial modeling; Parallel computing","Agriculture; Budget control; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Crops; Economics; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Input output programs; Parallel architectures; Parallel processing systems; Surveys; Accurate quantifications; Environmental policy integrated climate models; EPIC; Geospatial model; National agricultural statistics services; Net primary production; Parallel computing algorithms; Spatially-explicit models; Information management; agricultural land; agricultural land; algorithm; carbon budget; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; climate modeling; concentration (composition); crop yield; crop yield; environmental policy; environmental policy; error analysis; error analysis; estimation method; forest inventory; regional pattern; regional pattern; remote sensing; remote sensing; simulation; statistical analysis",Article,Scopus

In the Midwestern United States, urban area, farmland, and dedicated energy crop (e.g., switchgrass) cultivation are predicted to expand in the coming decades, which will lead to changes in hydrological processes. This study is designed to (1) project the land use and land cover (LULC) by mid-century using the FORecasting SCEnarios of future land-use (FORE-SCE) model under the A1B greenhouse gas emission scenario (future condition) and (2) assess its potential impacts on the water cycle and water quality against the 2001 baseline condition in the Cedar River Basin using the physically based soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). We compared the baseline LULC (National Land Cover data 2001) and 2050 projection, indicating substantial expansions of urban area and pastureland (including the cultivation of bioenergy crops) and a decrease in rangeland. We then used the above two LULC maps as the input data to drive the SWAT model, keeping other input data (e.g., climate) unchanged to isolate the LULC change impacts. The modeling results indicate that quick-response surface runoff would increase significantly (about 10.5%) due to the projected urban expansion (i.e., increase in impervious areas), and the baseflow would decrease substantially (about 7.3%) because of the reduced infiltration. Although the net effect may cause an increase in water yield, the increased variability may impede its use for public supply. Additionally, the cultivation of bioenergy crops such as switchgrass in the newly added pasture lands may further reduce the soil water content and lead to an increase in nitrogen loading (about 2.5% increase) due to intensified fertilizer application. These study results will be informative to decision makers for sustainable water resource management when facing LULC change and an increasing demand for biofuel production in this area. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.","biofuel production; hydrological process; land cover change; SWAT; water quantity and quality","Biofuels; Climate models; Crops; Digital storage; Earth (planet); Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Input output programs; Land use; Plants (botany); Rain; Soil moisture; Water conservation; Water management; Water quality; Watersheds; Biofuel production; Hydrological process; Land-cover change; SWAT; Water quantities; Climate change; atmospheric forcing; biofuel; cultivation; energy crop; environmental impact; fertilizer application; human activity; infiltration; land cover; land use change; numerical model; oil production; pasture; rangeland; runoff; water management; water resource; Cedar Basin; United States; Panicum virgatum",Article,Scopus

By combining an advanced statistical bias correction method with a dynamical downscaling it constitutes a hybrid technique that yields nearly unbiased, high-resolution, physically consistent, three-dimensional fields that can be used for climate impact studies. The method is based on a prior statistical distribution correction of large-scale global climate model (GCM) 3-dimensional output fields to be taken as boundary forcing of a dynamical regional climate model (RCM). GCM fields are corrected using meteorological reanalyses. We evaluate this methodology over a decadal experiment. The improvement in terms of spatial and temporal variability is discussed against observations for a past period. The biases of the downscaled fields are much lower using this hybrid technique, up to a factor 4 for the mean temperature bias compared to the dynamical downscaling alone without prior bias correction. Precipitation biases are subsequently improved hence offering optimistic perspectives for climate impact studies. © 2012. American Geophysical Union.

Average and extreme temperature and precipitation characteristics from 3 stations in the regions were organized into annual, growing season, and phenological growth stage periods and used to assess potential impacts on vineyard and wine quality, and changes in varietal suitability. Results show an overall growing season warming of 1.0 to 2.2°C, with significant increases in heat accumulation indices that are driven mostly by increases in maximum temperature (average Tmax, number of days with Tmax > 90th percentile, and number of days with Tmax > 30°C). Changes in many temperature parameters show moderate to strong relationships with vine and wine parameters in the 3 regions, including earlier phenological events concomitant with warmer growing seasons, higher wine quality with higher ripening diurnal temperature ranges, and reduced production in the warmest vintages. While trends in annual and growing season precipitation were not evident, precipitation during the bloom to véraison period declined significantly for all 3 sites, indicating potential soil moisture stress during this critical growth stage. Shorter-term analysis of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) reveals that the current impact per 1°C of growing season (Apr to Oct) warming is an increase in water demands in the region by 6 to 14 %. These observations, combined with climate projections, indicate potential disruption of climate-variety balance, increasing water stress, and challenges in producing quality wines without the adoption of appropriate adaptive measures. © Inter-Research 2008..","Bioclimatic indices; Climate change; Precipitation; Temperature; Wine; Winegrapes","Forestry; Groundwater; Soil moisture; Water analysis; Water supply; Wine; Bioclimatic indices; Climate parameters; Climate projection; Critical growth; Crop evapotranspiration; Diurnal temperature ranges; Extreme temperatures; Growing season; Growth stages; Heat accumulation; Maximum temperature; Northeast Spain; Potential impacts; Precipitation; Precipitation characteristics; Reduced production; Temperature parameters; Term analysis; Water demand; Water stress; Wine quality; Winegrapes; Climate change; bioclimatology; climate change; climate effect; crop production; evapotranspiration; growing season; phenology; precipitation intensity; soil moisture; temperature effect; vine; warming; water demand; water stress; Eurasia; Europe; Southern Europe; Spain; Vitaceae; Vitis vinifera",Article,Scopus

However, the choice of a particular method and of a particular regional model can strongly influence the final result since crop models are very sensitive to the quality of the input climate forcing. The objective of this study is to address this issue by analysing the dispersion of rainfall provided by eight regional models and how this dispersion spreads in the estimation of millet yields in Senegal. The SARRAH crop model is used to simulate millet yields. The study shows that there is a wide dispersion in the representation of rainfall from one regional model to another (and even sometimes for the same regional model with two sets of parameters) at both the seasonal and intra-seasonal scales. These biases introduce significant errors in estimating the agronomic impacts, which might invalidate conclusions about the impacts of climate change based on the use of a single regional model.

Permanent grassland represents around 70% of all agricultural land. In comparison with other agroecosystems, grasslands are more sensitive to climate change. The aim of this study was to create deterministic models based on artificial neural networks to identify highly significant factors influencing the yield and digestibility of grassland sward in the climatic conditions of central Poland. The models were based on data from a grassland experiment conducted between 2014 and 2016. Phytophenological data (harvest date and botanical composition of sward) and meteorological data (average temperatures, total rainfall, and total effective temperatures) were used as independent variables, whereas qualitative and quantitative parameters of the feed made from the grassland sward (dry matter digestibility, dry matter yield, and protein yield) were used as dependent variables. Nine deterministic models were proposed Y_G, DIG_G, P_G, Y_GB, DIG_GB, P_GB, Y_GC, DIG_GC, and P_GC, which differed in the input variable and the main factor from the grassland experiment. The analysis of the sensitivity of the neural networks in the models enabled the identification of the independent variables with the greatest influence on the yield of dry matter and protein as well as the digestibility of the dry matter of the first regrowth of grassland sward, taking its diverse botanical composition into account. The results showed that the following factors were the most significant (rank 1): the average daily air temperature, total rainfall, and the percentage of legume plants.

The data can support to undertake life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) of food commodities in a “cradle to grave” approach. An integrated F&V supply chain LCA model is constructed, which combined three components of the supply chain: farming system, post-harvest system (processing until the consumption) and bio-waste handling system. We have used numbers of crop models to calculate the crop yields, crop nutrient uptake, and irrigation water requirements, which are largely influenced by the local agro-climatic parameters of the selected crop reporting districts (CRDs) of the United States. For the farming system, LCI information, as shown in the data are averaged from the respective CRDs. LCI data for the post-harvest stages are based on available information from the relevant processing plants and the engineering estimates. The article also briefly presents the assumptions made for evaluating future crop production scenarios. Future scenarios integrate the impact of climate change on the future productivity and evaluate the effect of adaptation measures and technological advancement on the crop yield. The provided data are important to understand the characteristics of the food supply chain, and their relationships with the life cycle environmental impacts. The data can also support to formulate potential environmental mitigation and adaptation measures in the food supply chain mainly to cope with the adverse impact of climate change. © 2020","Fruits and vegetables; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle inventory; Processed products; Sustainability",,Data Paper,Scopus

The Marmara region is an important region located in the northwest of Turkey. The impact of economic, environmental, and social dimensions in the region is high. For this reason, the Marmara region is in a situation that can be affected more by climate change and drought. Precipitation forecasting is the first step for the management of agricultural planning, flood controls, and use of drinking water resources. Time series analysis is an important statistics tool that allows forecasting the amount of future precipitation based on the historical data analysis. Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models are the most common statistical methods used to estimate precipitation based on time series. The ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA models are based on the assumption that past conditions will remain the same in the future. In this study, precipitation for the 9 cities in Turkey’s Marmara region is examined based on the 51-year (1969–2019) historical data and the ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA models are used to predict the precipitation in the next 60 months (up to 2024). While determining the model, the lowest AIC (Akaike information criterion) and AICc (corrected Akaike information criterion) are preferred and, generally, the AICc value is used to select the prediction model. After, the forecast measure errors of the models are checked with mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute scaled error (MASE) indicators. Finally, the ARIMA model is chosen as the most suitable model with the lowest estimation error. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Forecasting; Marmara region; Precipitation; Time series; Turkey",,Article,Scopus

Because the process-based and statistical approaches to simulating crop yields are different in nature, a comparison between them is needed. This study investigates the accuracy of crop yield simulations in the historical period as well as future projections using two modelling approaches: 1) a process-based approach employing the Soil and Water Assessment Tool+ (SWAT+) model, and 2) a statistical approach employing a data-driven model, Feed Forward Back Propagation Neural Network (FFBPNN) over a medium-sized catchment in north-western Poland. The application of two potential evapotranspiration methods (Penman-Monteith and Hargreaves) in SWAT+ permitted calibration (2004–2011) and validation (2012–2019) of runoff and yields of winter wheat and spring barley. Different combinations of climatic parameters with a drought index based on Joint Deficit Index were applied to simulate and project rainfed crop yields (winter wheat, barley, potato, rye, rapeseed, sugar beets, cereals, maize for grain, maize for green forage, pulses) with FFBPNN. The results reveal that adding the new drought index helped increase the FFBPNN performance. This approach showed that future yields of the studied crops would slightly increase under RCP8.5 by 2060. Winter wheat and spring barley projections from SWAT+ showed very small changes using both the Penman-Monteith and Hargreaves method. Policy-wise, the results should be of interest to climate change adaptation practitioners and food security experts.

In addition to their role in mitigating climate change, SCS practices play a role in delivering agroecosystem resilience, climate change adaptability and food security. Environmental heterogeneity and differences in agricultural practices challenge the practical implementation of SCS, and our analysis addresses the associated knowledge gap. Previous assessments have focused on global potentials, but there is a need among policymakers to operationalise SCS. Here, we assess a range of practices already proposed to deliver SCS, and distil these into a subset of specific measures. We provide a multidisciplinary summary of the barriers and potential incentives towards practical implementation of these measures. First, we identify specific practices with potential for both a positive impact on SCS at farm level and an uptake rate compatible with global impact. These focus on: (a) optimising crop primary productivity (e.g. nutrient optimisation, pH management, irrigation); (b) reducing soil disturbance and managing soil physical properties (e.g. improved rotations, minimum till); (c) minimising deliberate removal of C or lateral transport via erosion processes (e.g. support measures, bare fallow reduction); (d) addition of C produced outside the system (e.g. organic manure amendments, biochar addition); (e) provision of additional C inputs within the cropping system (e.g. agroforestry, cover cropping). We then consider economic and non-cost barriers and incentives for land managers implementing these measures, along with the potential externalised impacts of implementation. This offers a framework and reference point for holistic assessment of the impacts of SCS. Finally, we summarise and discuss the ability of extant scientific approaches to quantify the technical potential and externalities of SCS measures, and the barriers and incentives to their implementation in global agricultural systems. © 2019 The Authors.

Together these stresses suppress global crop production by as much as 50% and their impacts are predicted to be exacerbated by climate change. Infrastructure and management practices can mitigate these detrimental impacts, but are costly. Crop breeding for improved tolerance has had some success but is progressing slowly and is not keeping pace with climate change. In contrast, Silicon (Si) is known to improve plant tolerance to a range of stresses and could provide a sustainable, rapid and cost-effective mitigation method. The exact mechanisms are still under debate but it appears Si can relieve salt stress via accumulation in the root apoplast where it reduces “bypass flow of ions to the shoot. Si-dependent drought relief has been linked to lowered root hydraulic conductance and reduction of water loss through transpiration. However, many alternative mechanisms may play a role such as altered gene expression and increased accumulation of compatible solutes. Oxidative damage that occurs under stress conditions can be reduced by Si through increased antioxidative enzymes while Si-improved photosynthesis has also been reported. Si fertilizer can be produced relatively cheaply and to assess its economic viability to improve crop stress tolerance we present a cost-benefit analysis. It suggests that Si fertilization may be beneficial in many agronomic settings but may be beyond the means of smallholder farmers in developing countries. Si application may also have disadvantages, such as increased soil pH, less efficient conversion of crops into biofuel and reduced digestibility of animal fodder. These issues may hamper uptake of Si fertilization as a routine agronomic practice. Here, we critically evaluate recent literature, quantifying the most significant physiological changes associated with Si in plants under drought and salinity stress. Analyses show that metrics associated with photosynthesis, water balance and oxidative stress all improve when Si is present during plant exposure to salinity and drought.

The results show that the yield estimation accuracy of RF is higher than that of the multiple linear regression method. The yield estimation accuracy can be significantly improved by using climate data and geographic information. According to the model results, the estimation accuracy of winter wheat yield increases dramatically and then flattens out over months; it approached the maximum in March, with R2 and RMSE reaching 0.87 and 488.59 kg/ha, respectively; this model can achieve a better yield forecasting at a large scale two months in advance. © 2022 by the authors.

Criteria for the drought occurrence were 1) available soil water content below 50% of available water capacity, 2) soil water content below long-term average soil water content and 3) duration of continuous drought for fifteen or more days. Standardized index of daily available soil water content was used for drought severity classification. According to the index the drought is categorized into four degrees of severity from mild to extreme drought. Cumulative sum of available soil water index was used to drought quantification throughout its duration. Normal climate period 1961- 1990 was chosen as reference period to enable historical comparison of drought severity as well as climate change impacts.

Agroforestry systems promise a number of benefits to enhance nature’s contributions to people. There are a wide range of agroforestry systems implemented representing different levels of establishment across the globe. This range and the long time periods for the establishment of these systems make empirical assessments of impacts on ecosystem functions difficult. In this study we investigate how simulation models can help to assess and predict the role of agroforestry in nature’s contributions. The review of existing models to simulate agroforestry systems reveals that most models predict mainly biomass production and yield. Regulating ecosystem services are mostly considered as a means for the assessment of yield only. Generic agroecosystem models with agroforestry extensions provide a broader scope, but the interaction between trees and crops is often addressed in a simplistic way. The application of existing models for agroforestry systems is particularly hindered by issues related to code structure, licences or availability. Therefore, we call for a community effort to connect existing agroforestry models with ecosystem effect models towards an open‐source, multi-effect agroforestry modelling framework. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aims to quantify the rice yield at various phenological stages from hyper-temporal satellite-derived-vegetation indices computed from time series Sentinel-II images. Different vegetation indices (viz. NDVI, EVI, SAVI, and REP) were used to predict paddy yield. The predicted yield was validated through RMSE and ME statistical techniques. The integration of PLSR and sequential time-stamped vegetation indices accurately predicted rice yield (i.e., maximum R2 = 0.84 and minimum RMSE = 0.12 ton ha−1 equal to 3% of the mean rice yield).

Low tropics lands cattle, face the challenge to adapt the production systems to the climate change consequences, wich has generated longer dry seasons and more food shortage for the animals during these periods. Objective. The objective of this literature review was to collect and analyze research results on shrubs forage species Tithonia diverfisolia, Gliricidia sepium, Cratylia argentea, and Crescentia cujete as a strategy to improve the nutritional offer in livestock in the low tropics. Development. In Colombia, beef cattle production is mainly located in the low tropics, and usually have feeding problems due to poor grasses quality and low availability in drought period. Silvopastoral systems (SSP) contribute to improve the productive and reproductive performance of cattle, since they integrate trees and/or shrubs, and grasses, combining diverse forage strata, with a greater nutritional and forage offer than conventional systems. The shrubs T. diverfisolia, G. sepium, C. argentea, y C. cujete due to their multipurpose characteristics, biomass production, and adaptation to diverse climatic and edaphic conditions, have been used in grazing, fodder banks, live fences and forage conservation, e.g. silage.

Under this scenario, the question that arises is how to address the demand for agricultural products given that the pressures on land use have already increased. In addition, it is obvious that climate change will have a serious negative impact and threaten the productivity and sustainability of food production systems. Therefore, understanding and predicting the outcome of crop production, while considering adaptation and sustainability, is essential. The need for information on decision making at all levels, from crop management to adaptation strategies, is constantly increasing and methods for providing such information are urgently needed in a relatively short period of time. Thus arises the need to use effective data, such as satellite and meteorological data, but also operational tools, to assess crop yields over local, regional, national, and global scales. In this work, three modeling approaches built on a fusion of satellite-derived vegetation indices, agro-meteorological indicators, and crop phenology are tested and evaluated in terms of data intensiveness for the prediction of wheat yields in large scale applications. The obtained results indicated that medium input data intensity methods are effective tools for yield assessments.

The aggravating factor for the successful applications of precision and predictive agriculture is the lack of granulated historical data due to slow, year-round cycles of crops, as a prerequisite for further analysis and modeling. A methodology of plant growth observation with the rapid performance of experiments is presented in this paper. The proposed system enables the collection of data with respect to various climate conditions, which are artificially created and permuted in the encapsulated design, suitable for further correlation with plant development identifiers. The design is equipped with a large number of sensors and connected to the central database in a computer cloud, which enables the interconnection and coordination of multiple geographically distributed devices and related experiments in a remote, autonomous, and real-time manner. Over 40 sensors and up to 24 yearly harvests per device enable the yearly collection of approximately 750,000 correlated database entries, which it is possible to independently stack with higher numbers of devices. Such accumulated data is exploited to develop mathematical models of wheat in different growth stages by applying the concepts of artificial intelligence and utilizing them for the prediction of crop development and harvest. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; encapsulated design plant growth chambers; IoT; predictive agriculture; rapid modeling of plant development",,Article,Scopus

The objective was to describe, through land use/land cover change (LUCC), the natural physical processes under current conditions and to project them to 2029. Moreover, temperature and precipitation forecasts were estimated to detail possible effects of climate change. Using remote sensing techniques, satellite images were processed to prepare a projection to 2029. Water recharge was estimated considering the effects of slope, groundcover, and soil texture. Flash floods were estimated using lumped models, concatenating the information to HEC RAS. Water availability was estimated with a semi-distributed hydrological model (SWAT). Precipitation and temperature data were forecasted using autoregressive and exponential smoothing models. Under the forecast, forest and shrub covers show a growth of 6.6%, water recharge projects an increase of 7.16%. Flood flows suffer a reduction of up to 16.54%, and the flow regime with a 90% of probability of exceedance is 1.85% (7.72 l/s) higher for 2029 than for the 2019 scenario, so an improvement in flow regulation is evident. Forecasts show an increase in average temperature of 0.11◦C and 15.63% in extreme rainfall by 2029. Therefore, intervention strategies in Andean basins should be supported by prospective studies that use these key variables of the system for an integrated management of water resources. © 2021 by the authors.

To estimate potato (Solanum tubersum L.) yield over Mexico at a municipal level, we used meteorological data provided by the ERA5 (ECMWF Re-Analysis) dataset developed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service, satellite imagery from the TERRA platform, and field information. Five different machine learning algorithms were used to build the models: Random forest (rf), support vector machine linear (svmL), support vector machine polynomial (svmP), support vector machine radial (svmR), and general linear model (glm). The optimized models were tested using independent data (2017 and 2018) not used in the training and optimization phase (2004-2016). In terms of percent root mean squared error (%RMSE), the best results were obtained by the rf algorithm in the winter cycle using variables from the first three months of the cycle (R2 = 0.757 and %RMSE = 18.9). For the summer cycle, the best performing model was the svmP which used the first five months of the cycle as variables (R2 = 0.858 and %RMSE = 14.9). Our results indicated that adding predictor variables of the last two months before the harvest did not significantly improved model performances. These results demonstrate that our models can predict potato yield by analyzing the yield of the previous year, the general conditions of NDVI, meteorology, and information related to the irrigation system at a municipal level. © 2020 by the authors.","Machine learning; Meteorological data; Municipal level; Potato yield; Satellite imagery",,Article,Scopus

Our study evaluated the applicability of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in modeling subsurface drainage in a cold environment; we then employed streamflow response analyses to assess the potential impacts of the extensive subsurface drainage development in the Red River Valley (RRV) on streamflows in the Red River. The results showed that extensive subsurface drainage in the RRV would likely increase the magnitude of smaller peak flows while decreasing the magnitude of larger peak flows. Discharge reduction of large peak flows was mainly caused by reducing the flow volumes rather than increasing the time-to-peak of the hydrograph. Our analysis also suggested that extensive subsurface drainage could move more water from the watershed to the rivers in the fall season, creating more storage capacity in the soils. However, such increase in storage capacity in soils would have a negligible effect in reducing the monthly flow volumes in the following spring.

As droughts play a key factor regulating vegetation growth, they inevitably have social and economic effects. Understanding vegetation dynamics and its response to climate change is therefor highly important to reveal the behavior mechanism of terrestrial ecosystems and to guide environmental management. In this investigation, Solar-induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were applied as vegetation indicators to describe vegetation dynamics and meteorological drought was described using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). Bias correction of precipitation and crop yield data of major crop producing areas was also used. By employing correlation coefficient of the maximum absolute value, a drought impact degree and propagation time to vegetation were defined. Dimensions of SIF and NDVI were unified by normalization. Results indicated that: (1) SIF and NDVI generally had a high level of consistency over China, and NDVI had a higher normalized value distribution level than SIF for different vegetation types. (2) Drought generally had a negative impact on vegetation in northern China and a positive impact in southern China. (3) Drought propagation time based on NDVI was larger than that based on SIF. (4) SIF had some advantages when monitoring crop yields among different crop producing areas.

Thus, seasonal forecasts of precipitation and temperature are an essential tool for stakeholders to make timely choices regarding the strategies required to maximize their expected cereal yield outcomes. The availability of state-of-the-art seasonal forecasts such as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) system 5 (SEAS5) may be an asset to help decision making. However, uncertainties and reduced skill may hamper the use of seasonal forecasts in several applications. Hence, in this work, we aim to understand the added value of such dynamical forecasts when compared to persistent anomalies of climate conditions used to predict the production of wheat and barley yields. With that in mind, empirical models relating annual wheat and barley yields in Spain to monthly values of precipitation and temperature are developed by taking advantage of ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis. Then, dynamical and persistence forecasts are issued at different lead times, and the skill of the subsequent forecasted yield is verified through probabilistic metrics. The results presented in this study demonstrate two different outcomes: (1) wheat and barley yield anomaly forecasts (dynamical and persistent) start to gain skill later in the season (typically from April onwards); and (2) the added value of using the SEAS5 forecast as an alternative to persistence ranges from 6 to 16%, with better results in the southern Spanish regions. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"article; cereal; climate; harvest; human; nonhuman; plant yield; precipitation; season; skill; Spain; uncertainty; weather; wheat; food grain; forecasting; temperature; weather; Edible Grain; Forecasting; Seasons; Temperature; Triticum; Weather",Article,Scopus

Indeed, evaporation rate forecasting can help farmers grow crops more sustainably by managing water resources more efficiently in the context of precision agriculture. In this work, we expose an interpretable machine learning approach, based on a multivariate decision tree, to forecast the evaporation rate on a daily basis using data from an Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, which is deployed on a real irrigated plot located in Murcia (southeastern Spain). The climate data collected feed the models that provide a forecast of evaporation and a summary of the parameters involved in this process.

Thus, it is of great importance to carry out spatiotemporal assessments of the dynamic of potential cultivated land in China, especially in dryland sensitive to climate change.

First, among several vegetation indicators during the growing season, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) in August was the most highly correlated with the yield (R2 =0.72). Second, the potential cultivated land that has not been cultivated was mainly distributed in the northwest and the northeast of the dryland of China, while the potential non-cultivated land that has been cultivated was mainly distributed in the Loess Plateau. According to different models, the area of potential non-cultivated land was 2.78 – 15.68 times that of potential cultivated land. Last, benefitting from the wetting trend, the potential cultivated land in the dryland of China expanded from 2001 to 2015. The area of potential cultivated in 2011–2015 was 34.39% more than that in 2001–2005.

Here we explore the performance of the IPSL-CM5A-LR DCP system in predicting air temperature over Europe, by proposing a systematic assessessment of the prediction skill for different time windows (periods of the calendar time, forecast years and months/seasons). In this framework, we also compare raw and de-biased hindcasts, in which the temperature outputs have been corrected using a quantile matching method. The systematic analysis allows to discern certain conditions conferring larger predictability, which we find to be intermittent in time. The predictions appear more skilful around the 1960s and after the 1980s, in coincidence with large shifts of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability, which are well reproduced in the hindcasts. Averages on longer forecast periods also generally imply better prediction skill, while the best predicted months appear to be mainly those between late spring and early autumn. Moreover, we find an overall added value due to initialisation, while de-biased predictions significantly outperform raw predictions only for a few specific time windows.

This study is an attempt to provide an alternative tool for prefecture level users using an aggregate Z-index which uses precipitation as an input. A machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) was introduced to build and train the model. Finally, future precipitation projected from Global Climate Models (GCMs) was used as an input to assess the future rice and maize yield variations. This tool outperformed other conventional statistical tools and was especially suitable for assessing extreme cases. Crop yields are significantly affected by drought in the study area. Z-indexes derived from three GCMs on decadal time scales were used for assessing future yield variations. Under the lower emission Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5, average maize yields and rice yields are likely to be reduced by-0.58% and-1.49%, respectively, over the next three decades in Mianyang prefecture compared to the baseline period. Similarly, under the higher emission (RCP) 8.5, maize yields and rice yields may decrease by-0.75% and-1.30%, respectively.

Efficient use of land and water resources, taking into account the threats that may arise due to climate change, as well as the dynamics of plant growth and development. Vegetation indices play an important role in monitoring vegetation variations. This article provides information on seasonal and long-term changes in the EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) of arable land in the Bryansk region. The purpose of the article is to discern the course of the seasonal dynamics of the index, the ranges of its variability, probable causes of differences between 2000-2018. In this article, physicochemical research methods were used to calculate the humus content, surface topography characteristics, and agricultural use features based on cartographic and stock materials, and the soil composition and density were determined through fieldwork. Summarized material on changes in EVI values for a snowless period as a whole and for individual filming intervals (18 per year) in 2000-2018 is presented. The mechanism of the influence of a variety of edaphic vegetation conditions on smoothing the differences in EVI over a series of years with different meteorological conditions has been described. The results of the analysis of the factors of the long-term dynamics are presented, the role of short-term climatic fluctuations, a progressive decrease in the amount of precipitation, and changes in the species composition of grain crops in the long-term dynamics of EVI are demonstrated. © 2020 Tche Quimica Group.

Two primary causes are identified: 1) more extreme and earlier storms and 2) warming temperatures that shift precipitation from snow to rain dominance over regional terrain. The simulations also show a wide range of uncertainty among different basins stemming from localized storm characteristics. While previous research using statistical downscaling suggests that many areas in the Pacific Northwest are likely to experience substantial increases in flooding in response to global climate change, these initial estimates do not adequately represent the effects of changes in heavy precipitation. Unlike statistical downscaling techniques applied to global climate model scenarios, the regional model provides an explicit, physically based simulation of the seasonality, size, location, and intensity of historical and future extreme storms, including atmospheric rivers. This paper presents climate projections from the ECHAM5/Max Planck Institute Ocean Model (MPI-OM) global climate model dynamically downscaled using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model implemented at 12-km resolution for the period 1970-2069. The resulting daily precipitation and temperature data are bias corrected and used as input to a physically based Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model.

Agricultural big data and artificial intelligence (AI) are key technologies for smart agriculture, bringing cost-effective solutions to the agricultural sector. Deep learning-based crop yield forecast has currently emerged as one of the key methods for guiding agricultural production. In this study, we proposed a Bayesian optimization-based long- and short-term memory model (BO-LSTM) to construct a multi-source data fusion-driven crop growth feature extraction algorithm for winter wheat yield prediction. The yield prediction performance of BO-LSTM, support vector machine (SVM), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) was then compared with multi-source data as input variables. The results showed that effective deep learning hyperparameter optimization is made possible by Bayesian optimization. The BO-LSTM (RMSE = 177.84 kg/ha, R2 = 0.82) model had the highest accuracy of yield prediction with the input combination of “GPP + Climate + LAI + VIs”. BO-LSTM and SVM (RMSE = 185.7 kg/ha, R2 = 0.80) methods outperformed linear regression Lasso (RMSE = 214.5 kg/ha, R2 = 0.76) for winter wheat yield estimation. There were also differences between machine learning and deep learning, BO-LSTM outperformed SVM. indicating that the BO-LSTM model was more effective at capturing data correlations. In order to further verify the robustness of the BO-LSTM method, we explored the performance estimation performance of BO-LSTM in different regions. The results demonstrated that the BO-LSTM model could obtain higher estimation accuracy in regions with concentrated distribution of winter wheat cultivation and less influence of human factors. The approach used in this study can be expected to forecast crop yields, both in regions with a deficit of data and globally; it can also simply and effectively forecast winter wheat yields in a timely way utilizing publicly available multi-source data. © 2022 by the authors.","BO-LSTM; deep learning; meteorological data; remote sensing; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

Assessing the impact of climate warming on suitable planting regions, especially the potential northern planting boundaries of these crops, is therefore critical to help guide agricultural policymaking and further maintain food security. In this study, we analyzed the effect of climate warming on the potential northern planting boundaries of three specific crops (winter wheat, spring maize, double and triple rice cropping systems) during two time periods (1961–1990 and 1991–2020) using meteorological data from 2437 national weather stations. Results show that the potential planting boundaries of these crops present a northward movement and a westward expansion during the time period of 1991–2020 under the background of temperature increase compared with the time period of 1961–1990. Moreover, the boundaries of winter wheat and spring maize also show a trend of expansion to high-altitude areas (e.g., the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau). The average moving distance of these crops ranged from 20 km to 300 km. In general, the potential planting boundaries of winter wheat, spring maize, double and triple rice cropping systems changed significantly due to climate warming, and the suitable planting area was increased. Our study aims to provide a more recent and accurate result than those of previous studies, which is expected to strengthen our understanding of the effect of climate change on the potential northern planting boundaries of the three main grain crops in China. © 2022 by the authors.

To that end machine learning approaches were used to identify the prevailing climatic and soil hydrological drivers of spatial and temporal yield variability of four crops, comprising 40 years yield data each from 351 counties in Germany. Effects of progress in agricultural management and breeding were subtracted from the data prior the machine learning modelling by fitting smooth non-linear trends to the 95th percentiles of observed yield data. An extensive feature selection approach was followed then to identify the most relevant predictors out of a large set of candidate predictors, comprising various soil and meteorological data. Particular emphasis was placed on studying the uniqueness of identified key predictors. Random Forest and Support Vector Machine models yielded similar although not identical results, capturing between 50% and 70% of the spatial and temporal variance of silage maize, winter barley, winter rapeseed and winter wheat yield. Equally good performance could be achieved with different sets of predictors. Thus identification of the most reliable models could not be based on the outcome of the model study only but required expert's judgement. Relationships between drivers and response often exhibited optimum curves, especially for summer air temperature and precipitation. In contrast, soil moisture clearly proved less relevant compared to meteorological drivers.

With few tools available, the current study aimed to develop a yield estimation model based on remote sensing and climate data with a machine-learning approach. Using a satellite-based time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from Sentinel 2 images and climate data acquired by local automatic weather stations, a system for yield prediction based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network was implemented. The study was conducted in the Douro Demarcated Region in Portugal over the period 2016–2021 using yield data from 169 administrative areas that cover 250,000 ha, in which 43,000 ha of the vineyard are in production. The optimal combination of input features, with an Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 672.55 kg/ha and an Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 81.30 kg/ha, included the NDVI, Temperature, Relative Humidity, Precipitation, and Wind Intensity. The model was tested for each year, using it as the test set, while all other years were used as input to train the model. Two different moments in time, corresponding to FLO (flowering) and VER (veraison), were considered to estimate in advance wine grape yield. The best prediction was made for 2020 at VER, with the model overestimating the yield per hectare by 8 %, with the average absolute error for the entire period being 17 %. The results show that with this approach, it is possible to estimate wine grape yield accurately in advance at different scales. © 2022","Climate; Estimation; Machine learning; NDVI; Prediction; Remote sensing; Vineyard; Yield","climate effect; estimation method; growth response; machine learning; NDVI; prediction; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; vineyard; yield response; Douro Valley; Portugal",Article,Scopus

Directorate of Economics and Statistics (DES) based district-wise wheat yield dataset was also used with satellite variables to develop the historical wheat yield model based on the multiple regression analysis. Spatially, higher, lower, and lower to moderate wheat yields are observed in the western and northwest parts, southern and southeast parts, and lower-middle to the lower right parts of the state respectively throughout the study years. Remarkably, the years 2017,2018, and 2019 witnessed higher yields, while 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2015 witnessed lower yield. The developed wheat yield models performed well, as R2 values were observed between 0.3 and 0.76 between the satellite-derived and DES-based district-wise mean yield. The mean absolute error was found to be considerable and ranged between 0.22 and 1.7 t/ha during the study years. The adopted methodology can be used across the different parts of the globe at the local to country scale for a quantitative crop yield depiction and mapping at the satellite pixel level.

It is necessary for obtain baseline datasets such as surface areas and boundaries of water bodies with high accuracy, effectively, economically, and practically by using satellite images in terms of management and planning of lakes. Extracting surface areas of water bodies using image classification algorithms and high-resolution RGB satellite images and evaluating the effectiveness of different image classification algorithms have become an important research domain. In this experimental study, eight different machine learning-based classification approaches, namely, k-nearest neighborhood (kNN), subspaced kNN, support vector machines (SVMs), random forest (RF), bagged tree (BT), Naive Bayes (NB), and linear discriminant (LD), have been utilized to extract the surface areas of lakes. Lastly, autoencoder (AE) classification algorithm was applied, and the effectiveness of all those algorithms was compared. Experimental studies were carried out on three different lakes (Hazar Lake, Salda Lake, Manyas Lake) using high-resolution Turkish RASAT RGB satellite images. The results indicated that AE algorithm obtained the highest accuracy values in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Another important aspect of this study is that Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Universal Image Quality Index (UIQI) metrics that can evaluate close to human perception are used for comparison. With this application, it has been shown that overall accuracy calculated from test data may be inadequate in some cases by using SSIM, UIQI, mean squared error (MSE), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), and Cohen’s KAPPA metrics.

However, high-spatiotemporal-resolution rice yield datasets are limited over this large region. The lack of such products greatly hinders studies that are aimed at accurately assessing the impacts of climate change and simulating agricultural production. Based on annual rice maps in Asia, we incorporated multisource predictors into three machine learning (ML) models to generate a high-spatial-resolution (4 km) seasonal rice yield dataset (AsiaRiceYield4km) for the 1995-2015 period. Predictors were divided into four categories that considered the most comprehensive rice growth conditions, and the optimal ML model was determined based on an inverse probability weighting method. The results showed that AsiaRiceYield4km achieves good accuracy for seasonal rice yield estimation (single rice: R2 0.88, RMSE 920 kg ha-1; double rice: R2 0.91, RMSE 554 kg ha-1; and triple rice: R2 0.93, RMSE 588 kg ha-1). Compared with single rice from the Spatial Production Allocation Model (SPAM), the R2 of AsiaRiceYield4km was improved by 0.20, and the RMSE was reduced by 618 kg ha-1 on average. In particular, constant environmental conditions, including longitude, latitude, elevation and soil properties, contributed the most (∼45 %) to rice yield estimation. For different rice growth periods, we found that the predictors of the reproductive period had greater impacts on rice yield prediction than those of the vegetative period and the whole growing period.

Robusta coffee yield time series were available from 2000 to 2018 for the Central Highlands, where 40% of global robusta coffee is produced. Multiple linear regression has been used to assess the effect of weather on coffee yield, with regularization techniques such as PCA and leave-one-out to avoid over-fitting the regression models. The data suggest that robusta coffee in Vietnam is most sensitive to two key moments: a prolonged rainy season of the previous year favoring vegetative growth, thereby increasing the potential yield (i.e., number of fruiting nodes), while low rainfall during bean formation decreases yield. Depending on location, these moments could be used to forecast the yield anomaly with 3–6 months’ anticipation. The sensitivity of yield anomalies to weather varied substantially between provinces and even districts. In Dak Lak and some Lam Dong districts, weather explained up to 36% of the robusta coffee yield anomalies variation, while low sensitivities were identified in Dak Nong and Gia Lai districts. Our statistical model can be used as a seasonal forecasting tool for the management of coffee production. It can also be applied to climate change studies, i.e., using this statistical model in climate simulations to see the tendency of coffee in the following decades.

In such a context, seasonal forecasts (i.e., climate predictions from a few weeks to several months ahead) are compelling instruments able to anticipate upcoming climate risks and guide tactical decisions. In this study, we assess the performance of seasonal forecasts for the summer period across Central Europe and the Mediterranean region in predicting some key indicators serving agriculture and forestry sectors, i.e., Potential EvapoTranspiration (PET), Potential Soil Moisture Deficit (PSMD), and Fire Weather Index (FWI). We exploit authoritative climate data from Copernicus Climate Data Store, i.e., ERA5 reanalyses and hindcasts from CMCC SPSv3 and ECMWF SEAS5 seasonal prediction systems (SPSs), to evaluate, using both deterministic and probabilistic evaluation scores, differences in performance across the two SPSs, two start dates (March and May) and four correction techniques applied to overcome modelling bias, namely bias correction (BC), calibration (CAL), quantile mapping (QM) and detrending (DET). Results show that seasonal predictions of PET perform better in Western and Eastern Europe and some areas of North Africa. PSMD predictions follow a similar spatial pattern as PET, except that for some areas in Central (Eastern) Europe in which the performance increases (decreases). FWI predictions reveal better results in some areas of the Iberian Peninsula, North-Western Africa, Balkan Peninsula, and Ukraine. Results also suggest that QM might be the most suitable technique for bias correction. Furthermore, the start date of the forecast might imply varying correlation significance, with the start date closest to the forecasted period not always being the best. Overall, our study suggests the potential usefulness of seasonal forecasts for decision making under different geographical and environmental contexts, considering sensitivity inherent to different processing chains. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Bias correction; Climate services; Fire weather index; Potential evapotranspiration; Seasonal forecasts; Soil moisture deficit","decision making; ecosystem management; Mediterranean environment; seasonal variation; Balkans; Europe; Iberian Peninsula; North Africa; Ukraine",Article,Scopus

The purpose of this paper is to propose and compared different methods to isolate the impacts of meteorological change on crop yield based on long time series of maize yield in Yellow River-water irrigated region in Ninxia province of China.【Method】The analysis is based on maize yield measured from1988 to 2019 in 6 counties located in the Yellow River-watered irrigation areas. We compared three methods for the separation: five -year moving average method, quadratic exponential smoothing method, and five-point quadratic smoothing method. The consistent correlation coefficient, trend coincidence conformity analysis method, consistency of climate change characteristics, which lead to the same rise-fall in meteorological yield, were used as the evaluation criteria. Their applicability and rationality were compared and analyzed. All methods were calibrated based on the relationship between meteorological factors and maize yield.【Result】All methods can fit the yield trend well. Compared with the average yield trend, the consistency correlation coefficients of all three methods were >0.5, suggesting that there was no significant difference between these methods for fitting the yield trend. The advantage of the quadratic exponential smoothing method and the five-point quadratic smoothing method is that they accurately describe the change in the yield as affected by national productivity and national policy. The change in the yield due to meteorological factors estimated by the five-point quadratic smoothing method described the effect of inter-annual meteorological factors better, and its associated meteorological yield model is able to describe the relationship between the meteorological factors and the maize yield.【Conclusion】Comprehensive analysis showed that the five-point quadratic smoothing method modeled the yield change due to meteorological factors better than the other two methods. © 2022, Editorial Office of Journal of Irrigation and Drainage.

This combined with increasing protein demands highlight the challenge on providing sustainable protein derived from alternative sources. Microbial protein derived from microorganisms offers potential solutions. Notably, some microbial strains e.g. Fusarium venenatum could efficiently convert carbon sources from food-safe agricultural lignocellulosic ‘waste’ (e.g. food crop residues such as wheat straw) to microbial protein. Our study is underpinned by data-driven approach and presents a modelling framework and analyses to predict spatially-explicit yields of staple crop lignocellulosic residues in response to spatial variation and climate change and highlight their potential for microbial protein production. Five food crops residues have been modelled including barley, wheat, maize, sorghum and rice straws worldwide (around 227 countries) to show future potential for microbial protein production. This study predicts crop residue yields using the data set collection and data pre-processing of crop residues and other environmental factors like temperature. Then, global autocorrelation is used to identify crop residues’ worldwide distribution patterns, and local autocorrelation is used to identify hot and cold spots. Feature selection and four models including ordinary least squares (OLS), multilayer perceptron (MLP), lasso regression and spatial error model are applied in prediction. With the updated independent factor ‘future temperature’ obtained from the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, the selected model is used to predict crop residues in 2030, 2040 and visualizations are created to show the projection outcomes. Our quantitative projection suggests that the future lignocellulosic microbial protein supply in different scenarios would sufficiently satisfy the global protein demands considering the average adult daily protein recommendation (50 g protein per capita 70 kg per day). © 2022 The Author(s)","Crop residues; Microbial protein; Regression; Spatial analysis; Sustainable protein",,Article,Scopus

Precision irrigation allows to achieve these goals through optimizing water use. This approach is particularly advantageous to supply specific irrigation in water limited conditions, but it requires a quick and accurate identification of the grapevine water status and its variability in the vineyard. Traditional sensing methods require specific equipment and long elaboration steps that cannot be easily used by all the wineries. In vineyards, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is currently largely detected to evaluate the variability of plant characteristics. Monitoring the crop water status using NDVI would allow to have a rapid and simple support for the irrigation management. The objective of the study is to set a site-specific model able to estimate the grapevine water stress and its variability at different phenological stages, using NDVI as input. The experiment was carried out in 2018 in a ‘Sangiovese’ vineyard located in the Chianti area, Tuscany (Italy). Data were collected on July 18 and August 23 in 15 analysis stations for the calibration and 12 stations for the validation of the model. In each station, NDVI index was measured using proximal and remote (sentinel 2) multispectral sensors. The water stress was estimated using a portable thermal camera through the crop water stress index (CWSI), analyzing 9 repetitions per station. A square regression model was set for each phenological stage, using NDVI as predictor. Models were calibrated for proximal (July 18, R2=0.578; August 23 R2=0.573) and remote (July 18, R2=0.476) sensing and they were validated for proximal (July 18, R2=0.658; August 23, R2=0.545) and for remote (July 18, R2=0.466). Results show that NDVI was able to predict the water status of the studied vineyard, thus the obtained models can be used for a site-specific water management. © 2021 International Society for Horticultural Science.

Although trees compete with crops for soil resources in agroforestry,they can also improve crops' growing conditions, especially, by providing shade under drought. They can promote higher crop yields and higher harvest quality in the drylands. However, the beneficial effect of tree shade may depend on the seasonal pattern of rainfall, which determines the compensation between yield components. In this study, we evaluated two annual crops (durum wheat and faba bean) in olive agroforestry in northern Morocco. We manipulated water supply in a field experiment to span the high inter-annual rainfall variability at the site and tested whether olive trees reduce or improve crop yields. We assessed the effect of water addition on crop growth, yield components, and final yields and estimated the land equivalent ratio of olive agroforestry. Agroforestry limited crop growth and yield whatever the water regime. The magnitude of grain yield reduction was around 50 % for both crops in 2018, probably due to shade. The number of grains per unit area was the most impacted yield component in both 2018 and 2019. In contrast, water addition only had limited effects on faba bean yield, although it enhanced wheat grain yield by 11 % and the number of wheat spikes by 13 %. Agroforestry improved individual grain weight by 39 % for wheat and 17 % for faba bean, and enhanced the protein content of wheat grains and straw by 4 % and 9 %. However, improvements in grain weight and in protein content were not sufficient to compensate for yield loss due to shade. Despite lower crop yields, we show that agroforestry systems are still more land productive than sole crops and trees, even under arid conditions. We show how changing water supply may impact the performance of olive agroforestry in a drier future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Faba bean; Land equivalent ratio; Morocco; Stress-gradient hypothesis; Tree-Crop interactions; Wheat; Yield components","agroforestry; arid environment; compensation; crop yield; legume; performance assessment; protein; water availability; water supply; wheat; Morocco; Elliptio dilatata; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum; Vicia faba",Article,Scopus

In this study, taking the major winter wheat production regions of China as an example, we compared a traditional machine learning method (random forest, RF) and three deep learning (DL) models, including DNN (deep neural networks), 1D-CNN (1D convolutional neural networks), and LSTM (long short-term memory networks) to predict crop yields by integrating publicly available data within the GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform, including climate, satellite, soil properties, and spatial information data. The results showed that all four models could capture winter wheat yield variations in all the county-years, with R2 of recorded and simulated yields ranging from 0.83 to 0.90 and RMSE ranging from 561.18 to 959.62 kg/ha. They all performed well for winter wheat yield prediction at a county level from 2011 to 2015, with mean R2≥0.85 and RMSE ≤ 768 kg/ha. At a field level, the spatial pattern of estimated winter wheat yield could capture the spatial heterogeneity and yield differences between individual fields across a county fairly well. However, only the DNN and RF models had relatively good performance at the field level, with mean R2 values of 0.71, 0.66 and RMSE values of 1127 kg/ha and 956 kg/ha, respectively. The model comparisons showed that the performance of RF was not always worse than DL at both the county and field levels.

Water scarcity due to climate change, together with the increasing demand of food, is leading experts from around the world find appropriate indicators for water-use efficiency. In this paper we propose and test different indicators for service delivery performance, productive efficiency, and economic efficiency. Since the characteristics of the studied area and the citrus cropping system in the East of Spain are particular, we include in our analysis two other variables which are key to understanding the changes in the indicators: the obtained productivity, and the applied irrigation. The indicators and these two variables are tested with the information provided by farmers of citrus orchards belonging to an irrigation community from the East of Spain. The effect of different factors, such as cultivated varieties, type of farmer (professional or non-professional), or plantations’ size, are evaluated against the productivity and irrigation performance of the evaluated orchards. The effect of excess of irrigation on the indicators is also studied with the previous factors. Finally, an artificial intelligence system is used to predict productive efficiency of an orchard, based on the size and the water supply. Among the proposed indicators, the service delivery performance indicators came out to be the least useful and might provoke overirrigation due to the lack of accuracy of the data used for its calculation. The productive and economic efficiency indicators have been useful to illustrate the remarkable effect that excess of irrigation has on water efficiency, since a reduction of 66% of productive efficiency is found for some of the analysed varieties. On other cases, a reduction of 50% in economic efficiency is detected due to the excess of irrigation. Moreover, the excess of irrigation implied higher economic efficiency in only one of the evaluated varieties. © 2020 by the authors.

One of the major goals of this article is to investigate whether such simulations appropriately simulate the spatial and temporal variability of the current climate, using two simulation chains. These start from the global IPSL-CM4 climate model, using two regional models (LMDz and MM5) at moderate resolution (15-20 km), followed with a statistical downscaling method in order to reach a target resolution of 8 km. The statistical downscaling technique includes a non-parametric method that corrects the distribution by using high-resolution analyses over France. First the uncorrected simulations are evaluated against a set of high-resolution analyses, with a focus on temperature and precipitation. Uncorrected downscaled temperatures suffer from a cold bias that is present in the global model as well. Precipitations biases have a season- and model-dependent behavior. Dynamical models overestimate rainfall but with different patterns and amplitude, but both have underestimations in the South-Eastern area (Cevennes mountains) in winter. A variance decomposition shows that uncorrected simulations fairly well capture observed variances from inter-annual to high-frequency intra-seasonal time scales. After correction, distributions match with analyses by construction, but it is shown that spatial coherence, persistence properties of warm, cold and dry episodes also match to a certain extent. Another aim of the article is to describe the changes for future climate obtained using these simulations under Scenario A1B. Results are presented on the changes between current and mid-term future (2021-2050) averages and variability over France. Interestingly, even though the same global climate model is used at the boundaries, regional climate change responses from the two models significantly differ. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"climate modeling; climate prediction; climate variation; downscaling; metropolitan area; statistical analysis; France",Article,Scopus

In this study, we generated a 1km soil moisture dataset for dryland wheat and maize in China (ChinaCropSM1 km) over 1993-2018 through a random forest (RF) algorithm based on numerous in situ daily observations of soil moisture. We independently used in situ observations (181327 samples) from the agricultural meteorological stations (AMSs) across China for training (164202 samples) and others for testing (17125 samples). An irrigation module was first developed according to crop type (i.e., wheat, maize), soil depth (0-10, 10-20cm) and phenology. We produced four daily datasets separately by crop type and soil depth, and their accuracies were all satisfactory (wheat r 0.93, ubRMSE 0.033m3m-3; maize r 0.93, ubRMSE 0.035m3m-3). The spatiotemporal resolutions and accuracy of ChinaCropSM1 km were significantly better than those of global soil moisture products (e.g., r increased by 116%, ubRMSE decreased by 64%), including the global remote-sensing-based surface soil moisture dataset (RSSSM) and the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) SM.

Environmental data collected at the field level, such as soil and climatic information, can be relevant to improve predictive ability in genomic prediction models by describing more precisely genotype-by-environment interactions, which represent a key component of the phenotypic response for complex crop agronomic traits. Modern predictive modeling approaches can efficiently handle various data types and are able to capture complex nonlinear relationships in large datasets. In particular, machine learning techniques have gained substantial interest in recent years. Here we examined the predictive ability of machine learning-based models for two phenotypic traits in maize using data collected by the Maize Genomes to Fields (G2F) Initiative. The data we analyzed consisted of multi-environment trials (METs) dispersed across the United States and Canada from 2014 to 2017. An assortment of soil- and weather-related variables was derived and used in prediction models alongside genotypic data. Linear random effects models were compared to a linear regularized regression method (elastic net) and to two nonlinear gradient boosting methods based on decision tree algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM). These models were evaluated under four prediction problems: (1) tested and new genotypes in a new year; (2) only unobserved genotypes in a new year; (3) tested and new genotypes in a new site; (4) only unobserved genotypes in a new site. Accuracy in forecasting grain yield performance of new genotypes in a new year was improved by up to 20% over the baseline model by including environmental predictors with gradient boosting methods. For plant height, an enhancement of predictive ability could neither be observed by using machine learning-based methods nor by using detailed environmental information. An investigation of key environmental factors using gradient boosting frameworks also revealed that temperature at flowering stage, frequency and amount of water received during the vegetative and grain filling stage, and soil organic matter content appeared as important predictors for grain yield in our panel of environments.

Plant stress response is one of the major concerns for crop productivity. “Climate change and global warming turned out to be the main contributors to crop loss by imparting both abiotic and biotic stress to the plant. Identifying the reasons and solutions to the problems related to crop loss is one of the major areas of concentration for researchers worldwide. The traditional method of identification, classification and quantification of plant stress by visual phenotyping needs specialized human resources and is often associated with erroneous results. An array of different parameters contributes significantly to the decrease in crop yield. Machine Learning (ML) has revolutionized the way in which we approach and deal with such problems nowadays, i.e., predicting the outcome with a reliable accuracy score, thus preventing the crop loss significantly. Researches concerned with Plant Stress Biology (PSB) have gained significant impetus due to the advent of ML techniques, where prediction studies can be carried out based on the feature space for both image and numeric datasets. This feature space is generally large, owing to the correlation between different features with the final outcome for classification. In this book chapter, we have particularly aimed towards introducing the concept of Dimensionality Reduction and have dealt with the part of “Feature Extraction” in particular. Dimensionality Reduction is a part of data pre- processing and is focused on reducing the original feature space by getting rid of the redundant and less important attributes. Our chapter will focus on the understanding the different feature extraction techniques for both numeric and image data for effective prediction of plant disease as a result of biotic stress. We will also focus on the implementation of some of these techniques on publicly available datasets to understand how the dimensionality reduction methods work to provide us with reliable outcomes for prediction of crop diseases and assist in their management. © 2021 Scrivener Publishing LLC.","Dimensionality reduction; Feature extraction; Image analysis; Machine learning (ML); Numerical data analysis; Plant disease detection; Principal component analysis (PCA); Smart agriculture",,Book Chapter,Scopus

Simulation models provide excellent instruments for researchers to gain more insight into relevant processes and best agricultural practices and provide tools for planners for decision making support. The extent to which models are capable of reliable extrapolation and prediction is important for exploring new farming systems or assessing the impacts of future land and climate changes.A performance assessment was conducted by testing six detailed state-of-the-art models for simulation of nitrate leaching (ARMOSA, COUPMODEL, DAISY, EPIC, SIMWASER/STOTRASIM, SWAP/ANIMO) for lysimeter data of the Wagna experimental field station in Eastern Austria, where the soil is highly vulnerable to nitrate leaching.Three consecutive phases were distinguished to gain insight in the predictive power of the models: 1) a blind test for 2005-2008 in which only soil hydraulic characteristics, meteorological data and information about the agricultural management were accessible; 2) a calibration for the same period in which essential information on field observations was additionally available to the modellers; and 3) a validation for 2009-2011 with the corresponding type of data available as for the blind test. A set of statistical metrics (mean absolute error, root mean squared error, index of agreement, model efficiency, root relative squared error, Pearson's linear correlation coefficient) was applied for testing the results and comparing the models.None of the models performed good for all of the statistical metrics. Models designed for nitrate leaching in high-input farming systems had difficulties in accurately predicting leaching in low-input farming systems that are strongly influenced by the retention of nitrogen in catch crops and nitrogen fixation by legumes. An accurate calibration does not guarantee a good predictive power of the model. Nevertheless all models were able to identify years and crops with high- and low-leaching rates. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Lysimeter; Model comparison; Nitrate leaching; Performance assessment; Predictive power; Simulation model","Agriculture; Calibration; Crops; Decision making; Food supply; Information management; Leaching; Lysimeters; Mean square error; Meteorology; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fixation; Soil surveys; Soil testing; Soils; Model comparison; Nitrate leaching; Performance assessment; Predictive power; Simulation model; Climate models; nitrogen; fertilizer; ground water; nitric acid derivative; nitrogen; soil; soil pollutant; agricultural management; computer simulation; environmental impact assessment; farming system; hydraulic property; leaching; lysimeter; nitrate; nitrogen fixation; numerical model; performance assessment; soil pollution; soil water; sustainability; agricultural management; ARMOSA model; Article; Austria; calibration; correlation coefficient; CoupModel; DAISY model; EPIC model; farming system; legume; lysimetry; nitrate leaching; nitrogen fixation; simulation; SIMWASER STOTRASIM model; soil property; SWAP ANIMO model; validation study; agriculture; analysis; chemical model; chemistry; devices; environmental monitoring; procedures; soil; soil pollutant; statistics and numerical data; Austria; Agriculture; Austria; Environmental Monitoring; Fertilizers; Groundwater; Models, Chemical; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Soil; Soil Pollutants",Article,Scopus

In the case of agriculture, forecasting is an essential element of effective and efficient farm management. Factors affecting crop yields, such as soil, weather, and farm management, are complex and investigations into the relation between these variables are crucial for agricultural studies and decision-making related to crop monitoring, with special emphasis for climate change. Because of this, the aim of this study was to create a spring barley yield prediction model, as a part of the Advisory Support platform in the form of application for Polish agriculture under a moderate input management system. As a representative sample, 20 barley varieties, evaluated under 13 environments representative for Polish conditions, were used. To create yield potential model data for the genotype (G), environment (E), and management (M) were collected over 3 years. The model developed using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) simulated barley yields with high goodness of fit to the measured data across three years of evaluation. On average, the precision of the cultivar yielding forecast (expressed as a percentage), based on the independent traits, was 78.60% (Model F-statistic: 102.55***) and the range, depending of the variety, was 89.10% (Model F-statistic: 19.26***)–74.60% (Model F-statistic: 6.88***). The model developed using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) simulated barley yields with high goodness of fit to the measured data across three years of evaluation. It was possible to observe a large differentiation for the response to agroclimatic or soil factors. Under Polish conditions, ten traits have a similar effect (in the prediction model, they have the same sign: + or -) on the yield of almost all varieties (from 17 to 20). Traits that negatively affected final yield were: lodging tendency for 18 varieties (18-), sum of rainfall in January for 19 varieties (19-), and April for 17 varieties (17-). However, the sum of rainfall in February positively affected the final yield for 20 varieties (20+). Average monthly ground temperature in March positively affected final yield for 17 varieties (17+). The average air temperature in March negatively affected final yield for 18 varieties (18-) and for 17 varieties in June (17-). In total, the level of N + P + K fertilization negatively affected the final yield for 15 varieties (15-), but N sum fertilization significantly positively affected final yield for 15 varieties (15+). Soil complex positively influenced the final yield of this crop. In the group of diseases, resistance to powdery mildew and rhynchosporium significantly decreased the final yield. For Polish conditions, it is a complex model for prediction of variety in the yield, including its genetic potential. © 2022 by the authors.","barley; data analysis; decision-making; moderate input management system; precision farming; predictive analytics; spring barley; yield potential",,Article,Scopus

Predicting yields on a large scale in a timely and accurate manner by considering these factors is essential for preventing climate risk and ensuring food security, particularly in the light of climate change and the escalation of extreme climatic events. In this study, integrating multi-source data (i.e. satellite-derived vegetation indices (VIs), satellite-derived climatic variables (i.e. land surface temperature (LST) and rainfall precipitation, weather station and field-surveys), we built one multiple linear regression (MLR), three machine learning (XGBoost, support vector regression, and random forest) and one deep learning (deep neural network) models to predict oil palm yield at block-level within the oil palm plantation. Moreover, time-series moving average and backward elimination feature selection technique were implemented at the pre-processing stage. The yield prediction models were developed and tested using MLR, XGBoost, support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF) and deep neural network (DNN) algorithms. Their model performances were then compared using evaluation metrics and generated the final spatial prediction map based on the best performance. DNN achieved the best model performances for both selected (R2 = 0.91; RMSE = 2.92 t ha− 1; MAE = 2.56 t ha− 1 and MAPE = 0.09 t ha− 1) and full predictors (R2 = 0.76; RMSE of 3.03 t ha− 1; MAE of 2.88 t ha− 1; MAPE of 0.10 t ha− 1). In addition, advanced ensemble machine learning (ML) techniques such as XGBoost may be utilised as a supplementary for oil palm yield prediction at the block level. Among them, MLR recorded the lowest performance. By using backward elimination to identify the most significant predictors, the performance of all models was improved by 5–26% for R2, and that decreased by 3–31% for RMSE, 7–34% for MAE, and 1–15% for MAPE. After backward elimination, the DNN achieved the highest prediction accuracy among the other models, with a 14% increase in R-squared, a 11% decrease in RMSE, a 32% decrease in MAE and a 1% decrease in MAPE. Our study successfully developed efficient and accurate yield prediction models for timely predicting oil palm yield over a large area by integrating data from multiple sources. These would be useful for plantation management estimating oil palm yields to speed up the decision-making process for sustainable production. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Deep learning; Machine learning; Multi-source data; Oil palm yields","crop yield; extreme event; food security; machine learning; oil industry",Article,Scopus

This paper proposes a systematic methodology to predict the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using time-series data extracted from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The key idea is to obtain accurate NDVI predictions by combining the merits of two effective computational intelligence techniques; namely, fuzzy clustering and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks under the framework of dynamic time warping (DTW) similarity measure. The study area is the Lesvos Island, located in the Aegean Sea, Greece, which is an insular environment in the Mediterranean coastal region. The algorithmic steps and the main contributions of the current work are described as follows. (1) A data reduction mechanism was applied to obtain a set of representative time series. (2) Since DTW is a similarity measure and not a distance, a multidimensional scaling approach was applied to transform the representative time series into points in a low-dimensional space, thus enabling the use of the Euclidean distance. (3) An efficient optimal fuzzy clustering scheme was implemented to obtain the optimal number of clusters that better described the underline distribution of the low-dimensional points. (4) The center of each cluster was mapped into time series, which were the mean of all representative time series that corresponded to the points belonging to that cluster. (5) Finally, the time series obtained in the last step were further processed in terms of LSTM neural networks. In particular, development and evaluation of the LSTM models was carried out considering a one-year period, i.e., 12 monthly time steps. The results indicate that the method identified unique time-series patterns of NDVI among different CORINE land-use/land-cover (LULC) types. The LSTM networks predicted the NDVI with root mean squared error (RMSE) ranging from 0.017 to 0.079. For the validation year of 2020, the difference between forecasted and actual NDVI was less than 0.1 in most of the study area. This study indicates that the synergy of the optimal fuzzy clustering based on DTW similarity of NDVI time-series data and the use of LSTM networks with clustered data can provide useful results for monitoring vegetation dynamics in fragmented Mediterranean ecosystems. © 2022 by the authors.

While substantial progress has been made since the early days of climate modeling, many challenges remain. A problem common to most coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models (GCMs) is the cold sea surface temperature (SST) bias in the tropics. Despite this cold SST bias GCMs tend to produce too much precipitation over the tropical oceans, particularly south of the equator. Due to the close link between convection and surface winds, the precipitation biases in GCMs are also accompanied by surface wind biases. Particularly on the equator this strongly affects the simulated ocean currents and vertical temperature stratification. Precipitation biases over land surfaces likely contribute to biases over the equatorial oceans through their influence on the Walker circulation. This influence is particularly strong for the Atlantic basin, where GCMs typically overpredict precipitation over tropical South America and underpredict it over tropical Africa. Despite cold SST biases over much of the tropical oceans, warm SST biases dominate in the southeastern tropical Pacific and Atlantic. These warm biases appear to be due to a combination of surface wind biases (both on the equator and locally), excessive shortwave solar radiation due to insufficient low-level cloud, and weak oceanic stratification reducing the cooling effect of upwelling. The failure to capture the equatorial thermocline (the sharp temperature gradient separating the deep ocean from the warm surface layer) is also an important error source in coupled GCMs. Moving ahead will require further improvements in the representation of deep convection and its relation to surface winds in atmospheric GCMs. On the oceanic side, one major challenge is to better understand and simulate the processes responsible for the equatorial thermocline. While increased model resolution can solve some of the problems of current GCMs, it certainly cannot solve all of them. Additionally, long-term climate simulations will likely have to rely on convective and other parametrizations for a long time to come. Further improving these parametrizations must therefore remain one of the main targets for model development. Such efforts should increase model performance but, on the other hand, many issues will probably remain. Effort should therefore be spent on understanding how model biases affect seasonal forecasts and climate change projections, in order to maximize their utility as predictive tools. © 2016 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

In order to strengthen the economy and also to meet the food demand for the exponentially growing population, optimizing the agricultural practices has become necessity. In India, weather and geographical conditions are highly variable and were thought to be the major bottleneck of agricultural practices to achieve improved crop yield. Agricultural practices in India are facing many challenges such as change in climatic conditions, different geographical environment, conventional agricultural practices; economic and political scenario. Economic loss due to the lack of information on crop yield productivity is another major concern in the country. These hurdles can be overcome by the implementation of advanced technology in agriculture. Some of the trends observed are smart farming, digital agriculture and Big Data Analytics which provide useful information regarding various crop yields influencing factors and predicting the accurate amounts of crop yield. The exact prediction of crop yield helps formers to develop a suitable cultivation plan, crop health monitoring system, management of crop yield efficiently and also to establish the business strategy in order to decrease economic losses.

Recently, numerous researchers have utilized machine learning (ML) methods to predict crop yield, using observational climate variables and satellite data. Meanwhile, some studies also illustrated the potential of state-of-the-art dynamical atmospheric prediction in crop yield forecasting. However, the potential of coupling both methods has not been fully explored. Herein, we aimed to establish a skilled ML–dynamical hybrid model for crop yield forecasting (MHCF v1.0), which hybridizes ML and a global dynamical atmospheric prediction system, and applied it to northern China at the S2S time scale. In this study, we adopted three mainstream machining learning algorithms (XGBoost, RF, and SVR) and the multiple linear regression (MLR) model, and three major datasets, including satellite data from MOD13C1, observational climate data from CRU, and S2S atmospheric prediction data from IAP CAS, used to predict winter wheat yield from 2005 to 2014, at the grid level. We found that, among the four models examined in this work, XGBoost reached the highest skill with the S2S prediction as inputs, scoring R2 of 0.85 and RMSE of 0.78 t/ha 3–4 months, leading the winter wheat harvest. Moreover, the results demonstrated that crop yield forecasting with S2S dynamical predictions generally outperforms that with observational climate data. Our findings highlighted that the coupling of ML and S2S dynamical atmospheric prediction provided a useful tool for yield forecasting, which could guide agricultural practices, policy-making and agricultural insurance. © 2022 by the authors.

The parameters from the calibrated head watershed were extrapolated to other subwatersheds in the region to complete comprehensive spatial calibration. The simulated crop yields at the head watersheds were in close agreement with observed crop yields. Spatial validation of the aggregated crop yields resulted in reasonable predictions for all crops except dryland corn in a few regions.

The proposed method may improve net yield rate of crops. © 2015 IEEE.","Climate; CSM (Crop Selection Method); GBDT (Gradient Boosted Decision Tree); regression problem; regularization; RGF (Regularized Greedy Forest); Soil composition","Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Economics; Food supply; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Boosted decision trees; Climate; Crop selections; Greedy forest; Regression problem; regularization; Soil composition; Crops",Conference Paper,Scopus

Multi-source data for site-specific soils, climates, and remotely sensed vegetation indices are essential for yield prediction. Algorithms of data-model fusion for crop growth monitoring and yield prediction are complicated and need to be optimized to deal with model uncertainty. This study integrated multi-source environmental variables (e.g., satellite-based vegetation indices, climate data, and soil properties) into random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models for wheat yield prediction in China. The performance of both RF and SVM models was investigated using different types of vegetation indices associated with other predictors. Relative importance and partial dependence analyses were used to identify the main predictors and their relationships with wheat yield. We found that using remotely sensed vegetation indices improved our model precision, and that near-infrared reflectance of terrestrial vegetation (NIRv) was slightly better than normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in predicting yield. NIRv was better in detecting climate stress on crops, and could capture more information regarding crop growth and yield formation. Compared with the SVM model, the RF model with NIRv and other covariates had better performance in wheat yield prediction, with R2 and RMSE being 0.74 and 758 kg/ha respectively. We also found that NIRv from jointing to heading was the most important predictor in determining yield, followed by solar radiation (especially during tillering–heading), relative humidity (during planting–tillering), soil organic carbon, and wind speed (throughout the growing season). In addition, wheat yield exhibited threshold-like responses to most factors based on our RF model. These threshold values can help to better understand how different environmental factors limit wheat yield, which will provide useful information for climate-adaptive crop management. Our findings demonstrated the potential of using NIRv for yield prediction. This approach is broadly applicable to other regions globally using publicly available data. © 2022","NIRv; Random forest; Support vector machine; Vegetation indices; Wheat; Yield prediction","Climate models; Crops; Data fusion; Decision trees; Forecasting; Infrared devices; Organic carbon; Remote sensing; Soil surveys; Soils; Uncertainty analysis; Vegetation; Wind; Environmental factors; Multi-Sources; NIRv; Random forests; Support vector machine models; Support vectors machine; Vegetation index; Wheat; Wheat yield; Yield prediction; Support vector machines; crop yield; data set; machine learning; model; relative humidity; remote sensing; soil-vegetation interaction; solar radiation; wheat; China",Article,Scopus

Each stage of the crop will be affected by various diseases starting from seeding to ripeness. The spread of the crop diseases is very rapi d, and identification of this is challenging as the infrastructure is very less to monitor the same. After a thorough literature survey, we understood there are several ways of predicting the disease and yield prediction. We have developed two new and robust classifiers, one which processes images to predict the crop's diseases, and the second one uses the weather data to predict the same. Both classifiers use deep-learning technique Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) augmented with six neighborhood cellular automata to predict the crop disease and yield. This work will be first of its kind to develop two classifiers for six crop disease prediction. The average time to compute the yield of a particular crop is less than 0.5 nanoseconds. The first classifier is named as CNN-CA-I, which was trained/tested to process 245 different crop species and 132 diseases associated with these crops where image segmentation is done with higher accuracy, thus strengthening the disease recognition system. We gave collected public datasets of 12, 45,678 images diseases and leaves of healthy plants taken in ideal conditions. This model reports an accuracy of 92.6% on a tested standard dataset for disease and yield prediction.

This heterogeneity often arises from landscape elements like forests, hedges, or single trees and shrubs that cast shadows. Shading from forested areas or shrubs has effects on transpiration, temperature, and soil moisture, all of which affect the crop yield in the adjacent arable land. Transitional gradients of solar irradiance can be described as a function of the distance to the zero line (edge), the cardinal direction, and the height of trees. The magnitude of yield reduction in transition zones is highly influenced by solar irradiance—a factor that is not yet implemented in crop growth models on a landscape level. We present a spatially explicit model for shading caused by forested areas, in agricultural landscapes. With increasing distance to forest, solar irradiance and yield increase. Our model predicts that the shading effect from the forested areas occurs up to 15 m from the forest edge, for the simulated wheat yields, and up to 30 m, for simulated maize. Moreover, we estimated the spatial extent of transition zones, to calculate the regional yield reduction caused by shading of the forest edges, which amounted to 5% to 8% in an exemplary region. © 2019 by the authors.

In this study, we demonstrate the use of agronomic knowledge of crop growth drivers in a Long Short-Term Memory-based, domain-guided neural network (DgNN) for in-season crop progress estimation. The DgNN uses a branched structure and attention to separate independent crop growth drivers and captures their varying importance throughout the growing season. The DgNN is implemented for corn, using RS data in Iowa, U.S., for the period 2003–2019, with United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) crop progress reports used as ground truth. State-wide DgNN performance shows significant improvement over sequential and dense-only NN structures, and a widely-used Hidden Markov Model method. The DgNN had a 4.0% higher Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency over all growth stages and 39% more weeks with highest cosine similarity than the next best NN during test years. The DgNN and Sequential NN were more robust during periods of abnormal crop progress, though estimating the Silking–Grainfill transition was difficult for all methods. Finally, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection visualizations of layer activations showed how LSTM-based NNs separate crop growth time-series differently from a dense-only structure. Results from this study exhibit both the viability of NNs in crop growth stage estimation (CGSE) and the benefits of using domain knowledge.

In this paper, we developed a semi-empirical model (Crop-SI) to estimate the yield of the three major crops in the dryland Australian wheatbelt by combining a radiation use efficiency approach with meteorology driven Stress Indices (SI) at critical crop growth stages (e.g., anthesis and grain filling). These crop-specific SI (e.g., drought, heat and cold stress) help explain the impact of high spatial agro-environmental heterogeneity, which lead to substantial improvement in grain yield prediction.

In recent years, an abundance of spatial data providing information on soils, topography, and vegetation condition have become available from both proximal and remote sensing platforms. Given the wide range of data costs (between USD $0−50/ha), it is important to understand where often limited financial resources should be directed to optimize field production. Two key questions arise. First, will these data actually aid in better fine-resolution yield prediction to help optimize crop management and farm economics? Second, what level of priority should stakeholders commit to in order to obtain these data? Before fully addressing these questions a remaining challenge is the complex nature of spatiotemporal yield variation. Here, a methodological framework is presented to separate the spatial and temporal components of crop yield variation at the subfield level. The framework can also be used to quantify the benefits of different data types on the predicted crop yield as well to better understand the connection of that data to underlying mechanisms controlling yield. Here, fine-resolution (10 m) datasets were assembled for eight 64 ha field sites, spanning a range of climatic, topographic, and soil conditions across Nebraska. Using Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis, we found the first axis of variation contained 60–85 % of the explained variance from any particular field, thus greatly reducing the dimensionality of the problem. Using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Random Forest (RF) approaches, we quantified that location within the field had the largest relative importance for modeling crop yield patterns. Secondary factors included a combination of vegetation condition, soil water content, and topography. With respect to predicting spatiotemporal crop yield patterns, we found the RF approach (prediction RMSE of 0.2−0.4 Mg/ha for maize) was superior to MLR (0.3−0.8 Mg/ha). While not directly comparable to MLR and RF the EOF approach had relatively low error (0.5–1.7 Mg/ha) and is intriguing as it requires few calibration parameters (2–6 used here) and utilizes the climate-based aridity index, allowing for pragmatic long-term predictions of subfield crop yield. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Maize and soybean; Remote sensing; Spatiotemporal; Statistics; Yield","aridity; calibration; crop yield; financial provision; optimization; remote sensing; soil water; spatial data; stakeholder; topography; Nebraska; United States; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

A wide range of input data are often needed to forecast crop yield in a region where sophisticated approaches such as machine learning and process-based models are used. This requires considerable effort for data preparation in addition to identifying data sources. Here, we propose a simpler approach called the Analogy Based Crop-yield (ABC) forecast scheme to make timely and accurate prediction of regional crop yield using a minimum set of inputs. In the ABC method, a growing season from a prior long-term period, e.g., 10 years, is first identified as analogous to the current season by the use of a similarity index based on the time series leaf area index (LAI) patterns. Crop yield in the given growing season is then forecasted using the weighted yield average reported in the analogous seasons for the area of interest. The ABC approach was used to predict corn and soybean yields in the Midwestern U.S. at the county level for the period of 2017–2019. The MOD15A2H, which is a satellite data product for LAI, was used to compile inputs. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of crop yield forecasts was <10% for corn and soybean in each growing season when the time series of LAI from the day of year 89 to 209 was used as inputs to the ABC approach. The prediction error for the ABC approach was comparable to results from a deep neural network model that relied on soil and weather data as well as satellite data in a previous study. These results indicate that the ABC approach allowed for crop yield forecast with a lead-time of at least two months before harvest. In particular, the ABC scheme would be useful for regions where crop yield forecasts are limited by availability of reliable environmental data. © 2021 by the authors.

Mapping and monitoring agricultural dynamics and production in real-time at high spatial resolution are essential for ensuring food security and shaping policy interventions. However, an accurate yield estimation might be challenging in some arid and semi-arid regions since input datasets are generally scarce, and access is restricted due to security challenges. This work examines how well Sentinel-2 satellite sensor-derived data, topographic and climatic variables, can be used as covariates to accurately model and predict wheat crop yield at the farm level using statistical models in low data settings of arid and semi-arid regions, using Sulaimani governorate in Iraq as an example. We developed a covariate selection procedure that assessed the correlations between the covariates and their relationships with wheat crop yield. Potential non-linear relationships were investigated in the latter case using regression splines. In the absence of substantial non-linear relationships between the covariates and crop yield, and residual spatial autocorrelation, we fitted a Bayesian multiple linear regression model to model and predict crop yield at 10 m resolution. Out of the covariates tested, our results showed significant relationships between crop yield and mean cumulative NDVI during the growing season, mean elevation, mean end of the season, mean maximum temperature and mean the start of the season at the farm level. For in-sample prediction, we estimated an R2 value of 51 % for the model, whereas for out-of-sample prediction, this was 41 %, both of which indicate reasonable predictive performance. The calculated root-mean-square error for out-of-sample prediction was 69.80, which is less than the standard deviation of 89.23 for crop yield, further showing that the model performed well by reducing prediction variability. Besides crop yield estimates, the model produced uncertainty metrics at 10 m resolution. Overall, this study showed that Sentinel-2 data can be valuable for upscaling field measurement of crop yield in arid and semi-arid regions. In addition, the environmental covariates can strengthen the model predictive power. The method may be applicable in other areas with similar environments, particularly in conflict zones, to increase the availability of agricultural statistics. © 2023 The Authors",,"Arid regions; Crops; Farms; Food supply; Linear regression; Mean square error; Uncertainty analysis; Agricultural productivity; Arid and semi-arid regions; Covariates; Crop yield; Environmental variables; Farming system; Food insecurity; Non-linear relationships; Semi arid; Socio-economics; Forecasting; agricultural production; arid environment; crop yield; data set; food security; semiarid region; Sentinel; smallholder; wheat; Iraq",Article,Scopus

The exploration of key growth phases and features is beneficial to improving the efficiency and accuracy of yield prediction. In this study, a hybrid approach using the WOFOST model and deep learning was developed to forecast corn yield, which analysed yield prediction potential at different growth phases and features. The World Food Studies (WOFOST) model was used to build a comprehensive simulated dataset by inputting meteorological, soil, crop and management data. Different feature combinations at various growth phases were designed to forecast yield using machine learning and deep learning methods. The results show that the key features of corn’s vegetative growth stage and reproductive growth stage were growth state features and water-related features, respectively. With the continuous advancement of the crop growth stage, the ability to predict yield continued to improve. Especially after entering the reproductive growth stage, corn kernels begin to form, and the yield prediction performance is significantly improved. The performance of the optimal yield prediction model in flowering (R2 = 0.53, RMSE = 554.84 kg/ha, MRE = 8.27%), in milk maturity (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 268.76 kg/ha, MRE = 4.01%), and in maturity (R2 = 0.98, RMSE = 102.65 kg/ha, MRE = 1.53%) were given. Thus, our method improves the accuracy of yield prediction, and provides reliable analysis results for predicting yield at various growth phases, which is helpful for farmers and governments in agricultural decision making. This can also be applied to yield prediction for other crops, which is of great value to guide agricultural production. © 2023 by the authors.","corn yield prediction; deep learning; growth phase; WOFOST",,Article,Scopus

This study analyzes the performance of machine learning and deep learning methods for winter wheat yield prediction using an extensive dataset of weather, soil, and crop phenology variables in 271 counties across Germany from 1999 to 2019. We proposed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which uses a 1-dimensional convolution operation to capture the time dependencies of environmental variables. We used eight supervised machine learning models as baselines and evaluated their predictive performance using RMSE, MAE, and correlation coefficient metrics to benchmark the yield prediction results. Our findings suggested that nonlinear models such as the proposed CNN, Deep Neural Network (DNN), and XGBoost were more effective in understanding the relationship between the crop yield and input data compared to the linear models. Our proposed CNN model outperformed all other baseline models used for winter wheat yield prediction (7 to 14% lower RMSE, 3 to 15% lower MAE, and 4 to 50% higher correlation coefficient than the best performing baseline across test data). We aggregated soil moisture and meteorological features at the weekly resolution to address the seasonality of the data. We also moved beyond prediction and interpreted the outputs of our proposed CNN model using SHAP and force plots which provided key insights in explaining the yield prediction results (importance of variables by time). We found DUL, wind speed at week ten, and radiation amount at week seven as the most critical features in winter wheat yield prediction. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"machine learning; season; soil; wheat; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Seasons; Soil; Triticum",Article,Scopus

Moreover, the prediction of crop growth stages is related to the scheduling of planting and tillage, the determination of machine harvest time, and the prediction of crop yield. However, highly complex dynamics cause large volatility in meteorological factors, so it is very challenging to predict the crop growth stage accurately, based on weather data. To solve this problem, we propose a data-driven encoder-decoder model, using long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM), which can be applied to forecast daily sunshine duration, cumulative precipitation, and average temperature for the coming year. To further test the performance of the ConvLSTM-based model, it is compared with the conventional LSTM encoder-decoder model and the convolutional neural network (CNN)-LSTM encoder-decoder model. The results demonstrate that, the ConvLSTM-based model is more accurate than the others for forecasting temperature (MAE = 2.602 °C, RMSE = 3.456 °C), precipitation (MAE = 3.878 mm, RMSE = 10.503 mm), and sunshine hours (MAE = 3.445 h, RMSE = 4.172 h) in 2014–2016. Furthermore, precise forecasting of meteorological factors allows us to develop a hybrid model and a data-driven model for the prediction of each growth stage separately. The hybrid model combines the ConvLSTM encoder-decoder model with empirical models, whereas the data-driven model comprises the ConvLSTM encoder-decoder model and traditional neural network structures. Finally, we compared the two types of models on a real-world dataset from Dandong, and concluded that the data-driven model is more accurate than the hybrid model for prediction of maize growth stages, with R2 in the range of 0.755–0.883, MAE 0.588–2.205 days, and RMSE 0.978–2.729 days.

This paper briefly examines the history of crop modelling by international crop research centres of the CGIAR (formerly Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research but now known simply as CGIAR), whose primary focus is on less developed countries. Basic principles of crop modelling building up to a Genotype × Environment × Management × Socioeconomic (G × E × M × S) paradigm, are explained. Modelling has contributed to better understanding of crop performance and yield gaps, better prediction of pest and insect outbreaks, and improving the efficiency of crop management including irrigation systems and optimization of planting dates. New developments include, for example, use of remote sensed data and mobile phone technology linked to crop management decision support models, data sharing in the new era of big data, and the use of genomic selection and crop simulation models linked to environmental data to help make crop breeding decisions. Socio-economic applications include foresight analysis of agricultural systems under global change scenarios, and the consequences of potential food system shocks are also described. These approaches are discussed in this paper which also calls for closer collaboration among disciplines in order to better serve the crop research and development communities by providing model based recommendations ranging from policy development at the level of governmental agencies to direct crop management support for resource poor farmers. © 2018 by the authors.","Agri-food-systems; Big data; CGIAR; Crop management; Crop modelling; Data sharing; Food security; Foresight; Global phenotyping networks; International agricultural research",,Article,Scopus

Although the crop model has been widely used in yield estimation, its applicability in large-scale yield prediction is limited due to the large amount of data required for parameterization. We took the main winter wheat growing areas in China and developed an ensemble learning framework based on seven machine learning algorithms, such as extreme gradient boosting, random forest, and support vector regression. The model used satellite vegetation index time series, climate, soil properties, and elevation data to provide county-level winter wheat yield forecasts from 2001 to 2015. The results showed that the ensemble explained 86% of the yield variability, which outperformed all base learners. By calculating the correlation between the prediction results of the base learners, we believed that the prediction performance of ensemble learning still has the potential for improvement. Soil properties and elevation data effectively improved the performance of the model because they contained information about yield prediction that could not be fully captured by vegetation index and climate data. As the growing season went on, the unique contribution of increasing climate data to yield forecasts was always more than that of vegetation index, especially in the early growing season. Furthermore, we evaluated the model’s ability to perform within-season prediction, and the model achieved satisfactory prediction accuracy 2 months before harvest (R2 = 0.85, RMSE = 480 kg/ha, MAPE = 7.52%). The framework of yield forecast established in this research can be applied to other crop varieties and regions and provide stakeholders with sufficiently accurate yield predictions. © The Author(s) 2022.","county level; ensemble learning; multi-source data; winter wheat yield","computer aided design; computer simulation; crop yield; ensemble forecasting; numerical model; performance assessment; satellite data; yield response; China",Article,Scopus

Crop growth and development are influenced by the weather. Therefore, models using weather variables can provide reliable predictions of crop yields. It can be tough to select the best crop production forecasting model. Therefore, in this study, five alternative models, viz., stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), an artificial neural network (ANN), the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), an elastic net (ELNET), and ridge regression, were compared in order to discover the best model for rice yield prediction. The outputs from individual models were used to build ensemble models using the generalized linear model (GLM), random forest (RF), cubist and ELNET methods. For the previous 21 years, historical rice yield statistics and meteorological data were collected for three districts under three separate agro-climatic zones of Chhattisgarh, viz., Raipur in the Chhattisgarh plains, Surguja in the northern hills, and Bastar in the southern plateau. The models were calibrated using 80% of these datasets, and the remaining 20% was used for the validation of models. The present study concluded that for rice crop yield forecasting, the performance of the ANN was good for the Raipur ((Formula presented.) = 1, (Formula presented.) = 1 and (Formula presented.) = 0.002, (Formula presented.) = 0.003) and Surguja ((Formula presented.) = 1, (Formula presented.) = 0.99 and (Formula presented.) = 0.004, (Formula presented.) = 0.214) districts as compared to the other models, whereas for Bastar, ELNET ((Formula presented.) = 90, (Formula presented.) = 0.48) and LASSO ((Formula presented.) = 93, (Formula presented.) = 0.568) performed better.

Aggregated results for the Prairie region showed that the GEPS data had a similar predictive skill as the statistically generated values of temperature and precipitation for spring wheat and showed improved prediction skill overall for canola from the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. In the Canadian Prairie environment, where climatic records are short and spatially insufficient, the GEPS data set, which is produced every Thursday and gridded at 45 km resolution, can be used as a substitute for, or supplement to, station-generated climate variables.

It was cultivated in three hydroponics systems (i.e., suspended nutrient film technique system, pyramidal aeroponic system, and tower aeroponic system), which interacted with three different magnetic unit strengths under a controlled greenhouse environment during the growing season in 2018 and 2019. Three scenarios consisting of the combinations of input variables (i.e., leaf number, water consumption, dry weight, stem length, and stem diameter) were assessed. The XGB model with scenario 3 (all input variables) yielded the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 8.88 g followed by SVR with the same scenario that achieved 9.55 g, and the highest result was by RF with scenario 1 (i.e., leaf number and water consumption) that achieved 12.89 g. All model scenarios having Scatter Index (SI) (i.e., RMSE divided by the average values of the observed yield) values less than 0.1 were classified as excellent in predicting fresh lettuce yield. Based on all of the performance statistics, the two best models were SVR with scenario 3 and DNN with scenario 2 (i.e., leaf number, water consumption, and dry weight). However, DNN with scenario 2 requiring less input variables is preferred. The potential of the DNN model to predict fresh lettuce yield is promising, and it can be applied on a large scale as a rapid tool for decision-makers to manage crop yield.

An adaptable and robust method for estimating maize yield for the entire territory of China, however, is currently not available. The inherent trade-off between early estimates of yield and the accuracy of yield prediction also remains a confounding issue. To explore these challenges, we employ indicators such as GPP, ET, surface temperature (Ts), LAI, soil properties and maize phenological information with random forest regression (RFR) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) machine learning approaches to provide maize yield estimates within China. The aims were to: (1) evaluate the accuracy of maize yield prediction obtained from multimodal data analysis using machine-learning; (2) identify the optimal period for estimating yield; and (3) determine the spatial robustness and adaptability of the proposed method. The results can be summarized as: (1) RFR estimated maize yield more accurately than GBDT; (2) Ts was the best single indicator for estimating yield, while the combination of GPP, Ts, ET and LAI proved best when multi-indicators were used (R2 = 0.77 and rRMSE = 16.15% for the RFR); (3) the prediction accuracy was lower with earlier lead time but remained relatively high within at least 24 days before maturity (R2 &gt; 0.77 and rRMSE &lt;16.92%); and (4) combining machine-learning algorithms with multi-indicators demonstrated a capacity to cope with the spatial heterogeneity.

In the present study, UAV‐borne red, green, blue (RGB) and multispectral imagery was utilized for the prediction of whole crop dry biomass yield (DM) and leaf area index (LAI) of barley at three different conventionally managed silvoarable alley cropping agroforestry sites located in Germany. DM and LAI were modelled using random forest regression models with good accuracies (DM: R² 0.62, nRMSEp 14.9%, LAI: R² 0.92, nRMSEp 7.1%). Important variables for prediction included normalized reflectance, vegetation indices, texture and plant height. Maps were produced from model predictions for spatial analysis, showing significant effects of distance to trees on DM and LAI. Spatial patterns differed greatly between the sampled sites and suggested management and soil effects overriding tree effects across large portions of 96 m wide crop alleys, thus questioning alleged impacts of AFS tree rows on yield distribution in in-tensively managed barley populations.

The experiment used the random forest (RF) algorithm to construct a prediction model of yields and yield components. Our results revealed that tillage during the fallow period was more effective than NT in improving yield in dryland wheat. Under drought condition, DP during the fallow period achieved a higher yield than SS, especially in drought years; DP was 16% higher than SS. RF was deemed fit for yield prediction across different precipitation years. An RF model was developed using meteorological factors for fixed variables and soil water storage after tillage during a fallow period for a control variable. Small error values existed in the prediction yield, spike number, and grains number per spike. Additionally, the relative error of crop yield under fallow tillage (5.24%) was smaller than that of NT (6.49%). The prediction error of relative meteorological yield was minimum and optimal, indicating that the model is suitable to explain the influence of meteorological factors on yield. © Copyright 2021 Feng et al.","Precipitation types; Random Forest; Tillage; Winter wheat; Yield prediction","calcium phosphate; nitrogen; nitrogen fertilizer; organic matter; phosphorus; phosphorus derivative; potassium sulfate; soil water; alkaline hydrolysis; Article; decision tree; evapotranspiration; fertilization; growth period; harvest; meteorological phenomena; plant yield; plowing; precipitation; random forest; spike; tillage; Triticum aestivum; wheat; winter wheat",Article,Scopus

While the agronomic factors are responsible for inter-region variations in yield, the year-wise yield variation in a particu-lar region may be attributed to meteorological factors. Various Data Mining Techniques can be applied to analyse the effect of these factors on crop yield. Objective: To develop a model for prediction of Block-wise average wheat yield in the Patiala district of Punjab, India. Methods: Sampling is used for the collection of the yield data, and the data concerning temperature and rainfall is obtained from the Indian Meteorological Department, Pune. The data is then pre-processed and analysed to study the effect of phase-wise average temperature and total rainfall on the wheat yield. The factors that are found to significantly affect yield are used for building a model for yield prediction. Results: It has been found that the average temperature and the total rainfall for the whole wheat growing season are not much of help in explaining the variations in yearly wheat yield. The temperature and rainfall have different effects at different stages of plant growth and the yield is affected ac-cordingly. It is inferred that the average temperature and the total rainfall during the vegetative phase and the grain development and ripening phase are the most important parameters for the prediction of wheat yield. Conclusion: The stepwise selection mechanism is used to choose the variables whose inclusion ex-plains the maximum variance in yield. The model is evaluated based on different parameters and is found to explain 95.6% of the yearly variations in yield. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.","Effect of rainfall on yield; Effect of temperature on yield; Moderation analysis; Prediction models; Wheat; Yield prediction","Agronomy; Crops; Data mining; Forecasting; Rain; Effect of rainfall on yield; Effect of temperature on yield; Effects of rainfalls; Effects of temperature; Moderation analyse; Prediction modelling; Total rainfall; Wheat; Wheat yield; Yield prediction; Temperature",Article,Scopus

The present study was designed to evaluate the potential of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) model to predict wheat grain yield and to determine the urea fertilizer application rate for maximizing wheat grain yield. The urea fertilizer, %sand, %silt, %clay, elevation, soil nitrogen (N), soil electrical conductivity (EC), soil phosphorus (P) and soil pH were used as input parameters and wheat grain yield was used as output. The ANNs model was trained using 124 data sets collected during growing seasons of 2008-09 to 2010-11 and evaluated using randomly selected 20 data sets of 2010-11 and 48 data sets of 2011-12. The results showed that ANNs model has the potential to predict wheat grain yield under semiarid conditions, as the mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.50% was found for training and 9.48% was observed for testing the model. To determine urea fertilizer application rate for maximizing wheat grain yield, the trained model was run for 14 urea fertilizer levels ranging from 0 to 400 kg-urea ha-1. It was examined that 210 kg-urea ha-1 produced maximum grain wheat yield (4200 kg ha-1) and further increase of urea fertilizer rates resulted in decrease of wheat grain yield. These results also showed that ANNs model is a useful tool to estimate the wheat grain yield response to soil and landscape attributes and to determine the optimum urea fertilizer level for maximizing the wheat grain yield in semi-arid conditions of Faisalabad. © 2021 Parlar Scientific Publications.

The current study developed a high-resolution wind speed forecast system for agricultural purposes in South Korea. The system produces a wind speed forecast at 3 m aboveground with 100-m spatial resolution across South Korea. Logarithmic wind profile, power law, random forests, support vector regression, and extreme learning machine were tested as candidate methods for the downscaling wind speed data. The wind speed forecast system developed in this study provides good performance, particularly in inland areas. The machine learning–based methods give the better performance than traditional methods for downscaling wind speed data. Overall, the random forests are considered the best downscaling method in this study.

Accurate and timely estimation of corn yield is therefore essential for commodity trading and global food security. Recently, several deep learning models have been explored for corn yield forecasting. Despite success, most existing models only provide yield estimations without quantifying the uncertainty associated with the predictions. Also, the traditional deep learning approaches typically require a large training set and are easily prone to overfitting when the number of samples in the training set is relatively small. To address these limitations, in this study, we developed a county-level corn yield prediction model based on Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) using multiple data sources that are publicly available, including time-series satellite products, sequential climate observations, soil property maps, and historical corn yield records. Using preceding years since 2001 for model training, the developed BNN model achieved an average coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.77 for late-season prediction across the U.S. Corn Belt in testing years 2010–2019, and outperformed five other state-of-the-art machine learning models. Detailed evaluation in three representative testing years demonstrated that the proposed BNN model could accurately estimate corn yield not only in normal years but also in abnormal years when extreme weather events happened. Moreover, the timeliness of the prediction was evaluated within the growing season with an R2~0.75 achieved by middle August, which is about 2 months before the harvest. We also assessed the predictive uncertainty, and more than 84% of the observed yield records were successfully enveloped in the 95% confidence interval of the predictive yield distribution. Our results also showed that the uncertainty level decreased steadily as time proceeded and stabilized around early August. Uncertainties in yield prediction were mainly induced by the observation noise and also related to the interannual and seasonal variabilities of environmental stress such as heat and water stress. This paper provides a robust framework for the within-season prediction of crop yield and highlights the need to obtain a deeper understanding of the effects of environmental stress on agricultural productivity and crop yield estimation. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Bayesian neural network; Corn yield prediction; Deep learning; Remote sensing; Uncertainty estimation","Bayesian networks; Climate models; Crops; Deep neural networks; Financial markets; Food supply; Forecasting; Productivity; Uncertainty analysis; Yield stress; Bayesian neural networks; Corn yield prediction; Corn yields; Deep learning; Remote-sensing; Training sets; Uncertainty; Uncertainty estimation; Yield estimation; Yield prediction; Remote sensing; artificial neural network; Bayesian analysis; crop yield; estimation method; extreme event; food security; maize; numerical model; remote sensing; uncertainty analysis",Article,Scopus

Process-based simulation models are widely used to predict crop yields, but their application remains limited by the requirements of substantial expertise, intensive data, and extensive calibration. Therefore, greater attention is currently being devoted to machine learning (ML) methods that are more computationally expedient. We evaluated six ML algorithms (linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, random forest, XGboost, and artificial neural network (ANN)) to predict cotton (Gossypium spp.) yield and determine the yield response to critical determinants using long-term (1986–2018) data on management, climate, historical yield, and point measurement of soil organic carbon (SOC) from continuous no-till (NT) cotton cropping system in west Tennessee. Data from 1986 to 2015 were used for model training, hyper-parameterization and testing, while data from 2016 to 2018 were used for independent model validation. Results showed that tree-based models (random forest and XGboost) outperformed other models in predicting lint yield. The variable importance scores, predicted by random forest model, indicated that cotton yield was more responsive to management variables (nitrogen (N) fertilization rate, cover crop, and years since NT establishment) followed by soil (SOC) and climate variables at the study site. The model identified optimal N application at 60 kg ha-1N rate for cotton lint yield, and also highlighted that the benefits of NT in enhancing yield can be achieved after 15 years of practice. The model predicted that the long-term adoption of hairy vetch (Vicia villosa), a legume cover crop, has the potential to increase cotton yield. Among the climate variables, cotton lint yield was most impacted by average maximum temperature and precipitation during flowering to open boll period. While random forest and XGboost proved to be the most effective ML models in this study, multi-site data is needed to build a more robust model with greater generalization and interpretation capabilities under a wider prediction domain. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Cotton yield; Cover crop; Growing season; Hairy vetch; Machine Learning; Nitrogen; No tillage; Random forest","Climate models; Cotton; Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Forecasting; Information management; Machine learning; Neural networks; Organic carbon; Random forests; Regression analysis; Cotton yield; Cover crops; Crop yield; Growing season; Hairy vetch; Lint yield; Machine-learning; No tillage; No-till; Random forests; Nitrogen; artificial neural network; conservation management; cotton; cover crop; crop yield; cropping practice; growing season; legume; long-term change; machine learning; management practice; prediction; yield response; Tennessee; United States",Article,Scopus

How such forcing alters the pattern of yield variation across different geographic scales and across large agricultural landscapes like the Canadian Prairies is less understood. Yet, such questions are of major importance in forecasting future cereal crop production. We explore the potential impact of ENSO on wheat and barley across the Canadian Prairies/Western Canada using a multi-scale, cluster-based principal component analysis (PCA) model that integrates machine-learning (K-means clustering) to predict areas of high climate risk. These risk areas are separable clusters of subregions that show similar ENSO-yield correlation response (spatial coherency). Benchmarking this spatial model to non-spatial models indicates that spatial coherency leads to gains in prediction skill. Incorporating spatial coherency increased the skill in predicting crop yield; reducing RMSE error by up to 26–34% (spring wheat) and 2–4% (barley). We infer that accounting for spatial coherency improves the accuracy and reliability of crop yield forecasts. © 2017, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada as represented by Dr. Kenna MacKenzie.","Crop yield; El-Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO); Forecasting; Regional-scale","barley; climate effect; cluster analysis; crop production; crop yield; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; forecasting method; machine learning; prediction; principal component analysis; wheat; Canada; Prairie Provinces",Article,Scopus

One of these challenges is the growing quantity of food demand, which is highly vital for regional trade, food security, and meeting the nutritious requirements of the population. A timely prediction with accuracy about crop yield could be valuable for greater food production and maintainability of sustainable agricultural growth. This paper presents a predictive model of wheat production using machine learning. The northern areas of Pakistan which grow wheat are selected as a case study due to their importance in the country's agricultural sector. We collected data of five years and selected the best attribute subset related to crop production. We applied twelve (12) algorithms by dividing data samples into three sets. Experimental results helped to shortlist three algorithms for the final analysis i.e. Sequential Minimal Optimization Regression (SMOreg), Multilayer Processing (MLP) and Gaussian Process (GP). The Root Mean Square (RMSE) and Percentage Absolute Difference (PAD) metrics were used to validate the results. The SMOreg obtained the lowest PAD (0.0093) and RMSE (0.5552) values. MLP was a little closer with second-lowest PAD (0.0116) and RMSE (0.737) value. The performance of GP was found lowest due to higher PAD (0.2203) and RMSE (17.7423) values.

In remote sensing information retrieval, the space-ground-network integrated technical system has emerged because of the rapid development of Earth observation satellites, the booming of unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as the extensive and intensive application of wireless sensor networks and the Internet of Things in China. In quantitative remote sensing, various agricultural parameters, including LAI, soil moisture, and crop nutrients have been inverted from remote sensing data via statistical and/or mechanical models. In crop acreage estimation and crop mapping by remote sensing, considerable progress in algorithms and operational system development has been made in the past 20 years in China. In crop growth monitoring and yield estimation/prediction, quantitative remote sensing data products as well as various remote sensing indexes have been used with in-situ data. Various empirical models have also been investigated. Remote sensing data assimilation with crop growth models is a prevailing issue in this research field. For agricultural disaster monitoring and assessment with remote sensing, drought, flood, pests, plant disease, and so on have been studied with different types of remote sensing data and quantitative data products with various models. Some of these research outcomes and systems have been operational. In remote sensing for agricultural land resources, the research foci is shifting from land resources quantity research to spatial patterns and their dynamics, as well as to specific elements of agricultural lands, e.g., facility agriculture land and plastic-mulching cropland. The classification methods are more diverse, and novel methods, including object-oriented methods, machine learning methods, knowledge-based algorithms, and so on, are investigated. In the past 20 years, significant progress has been made in the research and application of agricultural remote sensing in China. In the future, an increasing number of Earth observation satellites will be in orbit with the application of the China High Resolution Earth Observation System and National Spatial Infrastructure. Sensor technology, Internet plus, big data, and artificial intelligence, among other technologies, are expected to develop rapidly. In this new era, the agriculture development pattern will change with the upgrade of the national economy and social development in China. Many new demands and opportunities will occur in agricultural remote sensing research and application. First, the space-ground-network integrated technical system for agricultural information retrieval will be applied more extensively to meet diverse demands in various agricultural sectors. Second, new techniques, including artificial intelligence, big data, and so on, will play important roles in solving critical problems in agricultural remote sensing research and applications. Third, remote sensing is expected to be applied more extensively in new sub-disciplines of agronomy, which will not only improve agricultural research but also enrich the theory and techniques in remote sensing. © 2016, Science Press.

Artificial Intelligence is facilitating farmers to refine their products and alleviate unfavourable impacts due to the environment. The central concern of this paper is predictive analytics to develop a machine learning model to identify and predict crop yield based on multiple environmental factors. In this paper, a hybrid learner ‘RaNN’ is proposed that combines the feature sampling and majority voting technique of Random Forest in-combination with the multilayer Feedforward Neural Network to predict the crop yield. Research has also ascertained the essential features responsible for accurate yield prediction. The proposed model works for rice yield prediction, one of the chief grains of India. The region chosen for the work is Punjab, which is among the largest producer states of India for rice. The dataset consists of 15 attributes comprising the weather and agriculture data collected from the Indian Meteorological Department Pune, and Punjab Environment Information System (ENVIS) Center, Government of India. The study has also made a comparative assessment of ‘RaNN’ with machine learning methods like Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Boosting Regression, Support Vector Machine Regression, Ensemble Learner, and Artificial Neural Network. Our model RaNN has listed a better prediction accuracy with minimal error among the other techniques providing a 98% correlation between the actual and the predicted yield.

Crop Data from six states of India for five crops from 2009–2016 has been used for training and validation of different machine learning regression algorithms to produce a comprehensive study of crop yield estimate. The yields are estimated using Linear models, Support Vector Regressor, K Neighbors Regressor, Tree-based models, Ensemble models and Shallow Neural Networks with R-squared score for evaluation.

Statistical models have been used to estimate or forecast crop yield from weather information. In this paper, a general statistical framework is developed in order to rank and quantify the information content of weather information. The methodology is tested over the US, for corn yield. The weather sensitivity of different corn production areas is first analyzed. More than fifty agro-climatic indices have been compared. The study shows that variability in yield is more likely to be due to weather variability in medium and low production areas. The two best yield predictors are the temperature and then the Standardized Precipitation–Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) in July. While corn in the north Eastern regions is not significantly affected by weather variation, on the East coast, the weather-based mixed model is able to explain about 32% (corr = 0.57) of the yield variability, but in some particularly weather-sensitive states, such as Virginia, this number can reach 64% (corr = 0.80). Two applications are tested: yield estimation at the end of the year for monitoring purpose, and seasonal prediction. It is shown that some agro-climatic indices can significantly improve crop yield modeling when compared to simpler direct weather information (average correlation increase of 0.12 at the US scale). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Agro-climate indices; Corn yield; Statistical model; Weather impact model","agricultural modeling; agrometeorology; assessment method; climate effect; crop yield; forecasting method; index method; maize; statistical analysis; United States; Virginia; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Farmers and their advisors want user-friendly decision support tools for predicting yield. Simulation models can be used to accurately predict yield, but they are complex and difficult to parameterise. The goal of this study is to build a simple and parsimonious model for predicting wheat yields that can be implemented in a decision tool to be used by farmers at a paddock level. A large yield data set accumulated from trials on commonly grown varieties in Western Australia is used to build and validate a generalised additive model (GAM) for predicting wheat yield. Explanatory variables tested included weather data and derivatives, geolocation, soil type, land capability, and wheat varieties. Model selection followed a forward stepwise approach in combination with cross-validation to select the smallest set of explanatory variables. The predictive performance is also evaluated using independent data. The final model uses seasonal water availability, location and year to predict wheat yield. Because the GAM model has minimal inputs, it can be easily employed in a decision tool to predict yield throughout the growing season using rainfall data up to the prediction date and either climatological averages or seasonal forecasts of rainfall for the remainder of the growing season. It also has the potential to be used as an input to agronomic models that predict the effect on yield of various management choices for fertiliser, pest, weed and disease management. © 2019","Crop modelling; Crop water relations; Decision support; Precision farming; Waterlogging; Yield prediction","agricultural management; agricultural modeling; crop production; crop yield; decision support system; farming system; growing season; implementation process; model validation; numerical model; parameterization; plant water relations; precision agriculture; prediction; rainfall; water use efficiency; waterlogging; wheat; yield response; Australia; Western Australia; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

In this paper, a long-term observation was conducted for the yield prediction of maize using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and estimations of chlorophyll contents using SPAD-502. A new vegetation index termed as modified red blue VI (MRBVI) was developed to monitor the growth and to predict the yields of maize by establishing relationships between MRBVIand SPAD-502-based chlorophyll contents. The coefficients of determination (R2s) were 0.462 and 0.570 in chlorophyll contents’ estimations and yield predictions using MRBVI, and the results were relatively better than the results from the seven other commonly used VI approaches. All VIs during the different growth stages of maize were calculated and compared with the measured values of chlorophyll contents directly, and the relative error (RE) of MRBVI is the lowest at 0.355. Further, machine learning (ML) methods such as the backpropagation neural network model (BP), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme learning machine (ELM) were adopted for predicting the yields of maize. All VIs calculated for each image captured during important phenological stages of maize were set as independent variables and the corresponding yields of each plot were defined as dependent variables. The ML models used the leave one out method (LOO), where the root mean square errors (RMSEs) were 2.157, 1.099, 1.146, and 1.698 (g/hundred grain weight) for BP, SVM, RF, and ELM. The mean absolute errors (MAEs) were 1.739, 0.886, 0.925, and 1.356 (g/hundred grain weight) for BP, SVM, RF, and ELM, respectively. Thus, the SVM method performed better in predicting the yields of maize than the other ML methods. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that the MRBVI calculated from images acquired at different growth stages integrated with advanced ML methods should be used for agricultural-and ecological-related chlorophyll estimation and yield predictions. © 2020 by the authors.

We tested six different artificial intelligence (AI) models using satellite images and meteorological data for the dominant growth period. To examine the effects of extreme weather events, we defined the drought and heatwave by considering the characteristics of corn growth and selected the cases for sensitivity tests from a historical database. In particular, we conducted an optimization for the hyperparameters of the deep neural network (DNN) model to ensure the best configuration for accuracy improvement. The result for drought cases showed that our DNN model was approximately 51-98% more accurate than the other five AI models in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). For the heatwave cases, our DNN model showed approximately 30-77% better accuracy in terms of RMSE. The correlation coefficient was 0.954 for drought cases and 0.887-0.914 for heatwave cases. Moreover, the accuracy of our DNN model was very stable, despite the increases in the duration of the heatwave. It indicates that the optimized DNN model can provide robust predictions for corn yield under conditions of extreme weather and can be extended to other prediction models for various crops in future work. © 2020 by the authors.","Artificial intelligence; Corn yield; Extreme weather; Meteorological data; Satellite image",,Article,Scopus

Early prediction of crop performance can reduce this constraint by allowing breeders more time to focus on the highest-performing varieties. Here, we present a multimodal deep learning model for predicting the performance of maize (Zea mays) at an early developmental stage, offering the potential to accelerate crop breeding. We employed multispectral images and eight vegetation indices, collected by an uncrewed aerial vehicle approximately 60 days after sowing, over three consecutive growing cycles (2017, 2018 and 2019). The multimodal deep learning approach was used to integrate field management and genotype information with the multispectral data, providing context to the conditions that the plants experienced during the trial. Model performance was assessed using holdout data, in which the model accurately predicted the yield (RMSE 1.07 t/ha, a relative RMSE of 7.60% of 16 t/ha, and R2 score 0.73) and identified the majority of high-yielding varieties, outperforming previously published models for early yield prediction. The inclusion of vegetation indices was important for model performance, with a normalized difference vegetation index and green with normalized difference vegetation index contributing the most to model performance.

In this study, the linear regression method (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, LASSO) and BP neural network method (back propagation neural network, BPNN) were chosen for field yield prediction. The four variable types considered are climate, soil moisture, crop growth, and flag leaf photosynthesis. Crop-related data were collected in 12 winter wheat varieties that are widely grown in the North China Plain from 2018 to 2021. The same data set was used for both LASSO and BPNN models’ development and validation. The results show that models based on LASSO method had the determination coefficient (R2) from 0.23 to 0.78, and the root mean square error (RMSE) from 548 to 1023 kg ha−1, while they were 0.66–0.94 and 302–684 kg ha−1 in models based on the BPNN method. This showed that the BPNN method performed better in field wheat yield prediction than the LASSO method. For BPNN method, using only a single variable at the early grain-filling stage had the similar prediction accuracy to using single or comprehensive variables in multiple growth periods, indicating that the field wheat yield can be predicted earlier by BPNN method with fewer indicators. Last, an optimal field wheat prediction model was developed by the BPNN method using crop growth variables (dry matter and leaf area index) at the early grain-filling stage, with the R2 and RMSE of 0.93 and 288 kg ha−1 in the model development stage, respectively, and correspondingly 0.86 and 481 kg ha−1 in the model validation stage. The significant point of this model is that the field wheat yield can be predicted with only two growth indicators approximately 35 days before harvest for 12 mostly cultivated wheat varieties. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural management; BP neural network; LASSO; North China Plain; Wheat yield prediction","agricultural management; artificial neural network; crop yield; growth; model validation; parameter estimation; prediction; regression analysis; wheat; winter; China; North China Plain",Article,Scopus

In most cases, both rainfall and irrigation supply the water needs of crops. We postulated that meteorological precipitation could not fully represent the actual amount of water available to crops, whereas the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) can represent actual water, which monitors soil moisture. According to this, meteorological and remote-sensing data based on sunshine hours, temperature, and TVDI formed a light–temperature–water data combination, which are the three most fundamental and critical factors related to crop growth. The new data combination was used as the input variables of the integral regression model, which could predict the crop yield at a fixed date interval of any length. The dynamic results were then compared with that of the meteorology data combination (sunshine hours, temperature, and precipitation). We selected a total of seven county-level areas in semi-humid and arid regions in China. The proposed dynamic prediction approach achieved good results at the county level from March 21 to maturity at 16-day intervals with predicted R2 &gt; 0.94 and root mean squared error range of 15.54–121.01 kg ha−1 between predicted and actual yield with leave-one-year-out cross-validation for each prediction date. The trend of dynamic prediction accuracy had a relatively stable state. In addition, TVDI contained more crop water information, and prediction results using TVDI and meteorology were generally superior to that using only meteorology for semi-humid and arid areas, with the best results for arid regions. Thus, integrating meteorology and TVDI could effectively dynamically predict yield at county level for most agroclimatic regions, and particularly for arid regions. The work has implications for dynamic yield prediction and improving prediction accuracy and can be extended to other areas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","County level; MODIS; Precipitation; TVDI; Winter wheat; Yield prediction","Arid regions; Crops; Forecasting; Mean square error; Meteorology; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Vegetation; County level; Crop yield; Data combination; Dynamic prediction; Regression model; Remote sensing data; Sunshine Hour; Temperature-vegetation dryness indices; Winter wheat; Yield prediction; Precipitation (chemical); agricultural modeling; agrometeorology; crop plant; crop yield; growth; index method; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; remote sensing; soil moisture; temperature effect; Varanidae",Article,Scopus

This paper aims at examining the use of field spectroscopy along with Landsat's satellite imagery in order to test the accuracy of raw satellite data and the impact of atmospheric effects on determining crop yield derived from models using remotely sensed data. The spectroradiometric retrieved Vegetation Indices(VI) of Durum wheat, is directly compared to the corresponding VI of Landsat 7 ETM+ and 8 OLI, sourcing from both atmospherically corrected and not corrected satellite images in order to test the effects of atmosphere upon them. Vegetation Indices are vital in the procedure for estimating Crop Yield since they are used in stochastic or empirical models for describing or predicting crop yield. Leaf Area Index, which is also inferred using VI, is also compared to the real values of LAI that are measured using the SunScan instrument, during the satellite's overpass. Crop Yield is finally determined using the Cyprus Agricultural Research Institute's Crop Yield model for Durum wheat, adapted to satellite data, and is used to examine the impact of atmospheric effects. The results have prevailed that if crop yield models using remote sensing imagery, do not apply atmospheric effects algorithms, then there is statistically significant difference in the prediction from the real yield and hence a significant error regarding the model.

Techniques such as regression and simulation have been used by various studies to model and predict maize yield. This study used a feed-forward, back propagation artificial neural network with levenberg-marquardt algorithm for training. Artificial neural networks framework was chosen because its a data driven method that is relatively less widely used in county level yield prediction. Moreover, neural networks has key merits, such as require less formal statistical training, ability to detect nonlinear relationships by identifying likely interactions between variables and the availability of multiple training algorithms. We modelled historical maize yield between 2005–2016 as function of satellite derived precipitation, temperature, reference crop evapotranspiration, soil moisture and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to predict maize yields at pixel level. The data were obtained with a spatial resolution of ≈ 4 km and subsequently, the predictions was done at ≈ 4 km pixel size. The historical reference maize yield data was divided into two sets for model training and validation. The model predicted maize yield with R2 and root mean square error of 0.76 and 0.038 MT/ha in Trans-Nzoia county and 0.86 and 0.016 MT/ha, respectively, in Nakuru county.

This idea was not alone necessary to predict the crop's yield. Seed firms regularly screen how efficiently plant varieties grow in a particular setup. Thirdly to predict agricultural produce is critical to solving emerging concerns for food security in the phase of global climatical changes. Accurate prediction of forecasts assists farmers so they can take more economical and cost-management decisions. They also enhance the prevention of famine. This results in protecting farmers' efficiency and productivity to reduce the risks associated with environmental gain.

Simulation crop models can assist in scenario planning, but their use is limited because of data requirements and long runtimes. Thus, there is a need for more computationally expedient approaches to scale up predictions. We evaluated the potential of four machine learning (ML) algorithms (LASSO Regression, Ridge Regression, random forests, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and their ensembles) as meta-models for a cropping systems simulator (APSIM) to inform future decision support tool development. We asked: (1) How well do ML meta-models predict maize yield and N losses using pre-season information? (2) How many data are needed to train ML algorithms to achieve acceptable predictions? (3) Which input data variables are most important for accurate prediction? And (4) do ensembles of ML meta-models improve prediction? The simulated dataset included more than three million data including genotype, environment and management scenarios. XGBoost was the most accurate ML model in predicting yields with a relative mean square error (RRMSE) of 13.5%, and Random forests most accurately predicted N loss at planting time, with a RRMSE of 54%. ML meta-models reasonably reproduced simulated maize yields using the information available at planting, but not N loss. They also differed in their sensitivities to the size of the training dataset. Across all ML models, yield prediction error decreased by 10%-40% as the training dataset increased from 0.5 to 1.8 million data points, whereas N loss prediction error showed no consistent pattern. ML models also differed in their sensitivities to input variables (weather, soil properties, management, initial conditions), thus depending on the data availability researchers may use a different ML model. Modest prediction improvements resulted from ML ensembles. These results can help accelerate progress in coupling simulation models and ML toward developing dynamic decision support tools for pre-season management. © 2019 The Author(s).

To solve the issue, we propose to develop a “RANC (Recommendation Analysis by Soil Nutrients of Crops) Crop Recommendation Tool” web application that will help farmers generate their high income with effective crop cultivation along with the suggestion of organic fertilizer by providing up-to - date stock information, Soil Test Report, crop yield time and nutritional value of each crop. The RANC algorithm is used to pick crops and the Deep Neural Network is used for price prediction to improve the farmer’s choice of crops for cultivation with a high benefit. In the case of crop selection, an existing model uses the Soil Test Report to generate the quantity of fertilizers needed to expand. We use SVM for linear data regressions and ANN, RNN, RBM for non-linear data in the case of price estimation in stock analysis.

Oil palm yield prediction is required for import/ export, global food security, and field management. However, complex variations in oil palm yield on account of weather and soil conditions complicate the predictability. Supervised machine learning models can learn nonlinear patterns from complex agrometeorological data. However, environment-based predictive analysis of oil palm yield with machine learning methods is not widely explored. Therefore, this work presents the application of a non-parametric regression algorithm k-nearest neighbor (KNN) for oil palm yield prediction using weather and soil data. This work utilized 35 years of yield, soil, and weather records from Pahang state Malaysia. Data visualization during preprocessing assessment led to an in-depth understanding of environmental impacts on yield patterns. After model selection and training, the statistical evaluation using six different metrics along with an examination of the model's learning process was performed.

In this study, we evaluated the robustness of data-driven models for estimating soybean yields at 120 days after sow (DAS) in the main producing regions in Brazil; and evaluated the reliability of the “best” data-driven model as a tool for early prediction of soybean yields for an independent year. Our methodology explicitly describes a general approach for wrapping up publicly available databases and build data-driven models (multiple linear regression—MLR; random forests—RF; and support vector machines—SVM) to predict yields at large scales using gridded data of weather and soil information. We filtered out counties with missing or suspicious yield records, resulting on a crop yield database containing 3450 records (23 years × 150 “high-quality” counties). RF and SVM had similar results for calibration and validation steps, whereas MLR showed the poorest performance. Our analysis revealed a potential use of data-driven models for predict soybean yields at large scales in Brazil with around one month before harvest (i.e. 90 DAS). Using a well-trained RF model for predicting crop yield during a specific year at 90 DAS, the RMSE ranged from 303.9 to 1055.7 kg ha–1 representing a relative error (rRMSE) between 9.2 and 41.5%. Although we showed up robust data-driven models for yield prediction at large scales in Brazil, there are still a room for improving its accuracy. The inclusion of explanatory variables related to crop (e.g. growing degree-days, flowering dates), environment (e.g. remotely-sensed vegetation indices, number of dry and heat days during the cycle) and outputs from process-based crop simulation models (e.g. biomass, leaf area index and plant phenology), are potential strategies to improve model accuracy. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climatic and soil variables; Geospatial and temporal variability; Large-scale analysis; Machine learning approaches; Public databases",,Article,Scopus

Recent research has shown that machine learning (ML) can provide reasonable predictions faster and with higher flexibility compared to simulation crop modeling. However, a single machine learning model can be outperformed by a “committee” of models (machine learning ensembles) that can reduce prediction bias, variance, or both and is able to better capture the underlying distribution of the data. Yet, there are many aspects to be investigated with regard to prediction accuracy, time of the prediction, and scale. The earlier the prediction during the growing season the better, but this has not been thoroughly investigated as previous studies considered all data available to predict yields. This paper provides a machine leaning based framework to forecast corn yields in three US Corn Belt states (Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa) considering complete and partial in-season weather knowledge. Several ensemble models are designed using blocked sequential procedure to generate out-of-bag predictions. The forecasts are made in county-level scale and aggregated for agricultural district and state level scales. Results show that the proposed optimized weighted ensemble and the average ensemble are the most precise models with RRMSE of 9.5%. Stacked LASSO makes the least biased predictions (MBE of 53 kg/ha), while other ensemble models also outperformed the base learners in terms of bias. On the contrary, although random k-fold cross-validation is replaced by blocked sequential procedure, it is shown that stacked ensembles perform not as good as weighted ensemble models for time series data sets as they require the data to be non-IID to perform favorably. Comparing our proposed model forecasts with the literature demonstrates the acceptable performance of forecasts made by our proposed ensemble model. Results from the scenario of having partial in-season weather knowledge reveals that decent yield forecasts with RRMSE of 9.2% can be made as early as June 1st. Moreover, it was shown that the proposed model performed better than individual models and benchmark ensembles at agricultural district and state-level scales as well as county-level scale. To find the marginal effect of each input feature on the forecasts made by the proposed ensemble model, a methodology is suggested that is the basis for finding feature importance for the ensemble model. The findings suggest that weather features corresponding to weather in weeks 18–24 (May 1st to June 1st) are the most important input features. © Copyright © 2020 Shahhosseini, Hu and Archontoulis.","corn yields; ensemble; forecasting; machine learning; US Corn Belt",,Article,Scopus

Here we present a thorough assessment of county-level maize yield prediction in U.S. Midwest using six statistical/machine learning algorithms (Lasso, Support Vector Regressor, Random Forest, XGBoost, Long-short term memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)) and an extensive set of environmental variables derived from satellite observations, weather data, land surface model results, soil maps, and crop progress reports. Results show that seasonal crop yield forecasting benefits from both more advanced algorithms and a large composite of information associated with crop canopy, environmental stress, phenology, and soil properties (i.e. hundreds of features). The XGBoost algorithm outperforms other algorithms both in accuracy and stability, while deep neural networks such as LSTM and CNN are not advantageous. The compositing interval (8-day, 16-day or monthly) of time series variable does not have significant effects on the prediction. Combining the best algorithm and inputs improves the prediction accuracy by 5% when compared to a baseline statistical model (Lasso) using only basic climatic and satellite observations. Reasonable county-level yield foresting is achievable from early June, almost four months prior to harvest. At the national level, early-season (June and July) prediction from the best model outperforms that of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE).

The introduction of new farming techniques in the past century (e.g., during the Green Revolution) has helped agriculture keep pace with growing demands for food and other agricultural products. However, further increases in food demand, a growing population, and rising income levels are likely to put additional strain on natural resources. With growing recognition of the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment, new techniques and approaches should be able to meet future food demands while maintaining or reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture. Emerging technologies, such as geospatial technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI), could be utilized to make informed management decisions aimed to increase crop production. Precision agriculture (PA) entails the application of a suite of such technologies to optimize agricultural inputs to increase agricultural production and reduce input losses. Use of remote sensing technologies for PA has increased rapidly during the past few decades. The unprecedented availability of high resolution (spatial, spectral and temporal) satellite images has promoted the use of remote sensing in many PA applications, including crop monitoring, irrigation management, nutrient application, disease and pest management, and yield prediction. In this paper, we provide an overview of remote sensing systems, techniques, and vegetation indices along with their recent (2015–2020) applications in PA. Remote-sensing-based PA technologies such as variable fertilizer rate application technology in Green Seeker and Crop Circle have already been incorporated in commercial agriculture. Use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased tremendously during the last decade due to their cost-effectiveness and flexibility in obtaining the high-resolution (cm-scale) images needed for PA applications. At the same time, the availability of a large amount of satellite data has prompted researchers to explore advanced data storage and processing techniques such as cloud computing and machine learning. Given the complexity of image processing and the amount of technical knowledge and expertise needed, it is critical to explore and develop a simple yet reliable workflow for the real-time application of remote sensing in PA. Development of accurate yet easy to use, user-friendly systems is likely to result in broader adoption of remote sensing technologies in commercial and non-commercial PA applications. © 2020 by the authors.

In particular, crop prediction in agriculture is critical and is chiefly contingent upon soil and environment conditions, including rainfall, humidity, and temperature. In the past, farmers were able to decide on the crop to be cultivated, monitor its growth, and determine when it could be harvested. Today, however, rapid changes in environmental conditions have made it difficult for the farming community to continue to do so. Consequently, in recent years, machine learning techniques have taken over the task of prediction, and this work has used several of these to determine crop yield. To ensure that a given machine learning (ML) model works at a high level of precision, it is imperative to employ efficient feature selection methods to preprocess the raw data into an easily computable Machine Learning friendly dataset. To reduce redundancies and make the ML model more accurate, only data features that have a significant degree of relevance in determining the final output of the model must be employed. Thus, optimal feature selection arises to ensure that only the most relevant features are accepted as a part of the model. Conglomerating every single feature from raw data without checking for their role in the process of making the model will unnecessarily complicate our model. Furthermore, additional features which contribute little to the ML model will increase its time and space complexity and affect the accuracy of the model's output. The results depict that an ensemble technique offers better prediction accuracy than the existing classification technique. © 2013 IEEE.","Agriculture; classification; crop prediction; feature selection","Classification (of information); Cultivation; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Machine learning; Agricultural environments; Crop prediction; Environment conditions; Features selection; Humidity and temperatures; Machine learning models; Prediction-based; Security; Selection techniques; Soil conditions; Crops",Article,Scopus

Strategies to advance the production of coffee grains involve better understanding its spatial variability along fields. The objectives of this study were to adjust yield-prediction models based on a time series of satellite images and high-density yield data, and to indicate the best phenological stage of coffee crop to obtain satellite images for this purpose. The study was conducted during three seasons (2019, 2020 and 2021) in a commercial area (10.24 ha), located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Data were obtained using a harvester equipped with a yield monitor that measures the volume of coffee harvested with 3.0 m of spatial resolution. Satellite images from the PlanetScope (PS) platform were used. Random forest (RF) regression and multiple linear regression (MLR) models were fitted to different datasets composed of coffee yield and time series of satellite-image data ((1) Spectral bands—red, green, blue and near-infrared; (2) Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); or (3) Green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI)). Whether using RF or MLR, the spectral bands, NDVI and GNDVI reproduced the spatial variability of yield maps one year before harvest. This information can be of critical importance for management decisions across the season. For yield quantification, the RF model using spectral bands showed the best results, reaching R2 of 0.93 for the validation set, and the lowest errors of prediction. The most appropriate phenological stage for satellite-image data acquisition was the dormancy phase, observed during the dry season months of July and August. These findings can help to monitor the spatial and temporal variability of the fields and guide management practices based on the premises of precision agriculture. © 2022 by the authors.","GNDVI; NDVI; precision agriculture; remote sensing",,Article,Scopus

Remotely sensed evapotranspiration products (RS-ET) have been adopted as an additional constraint on watershed modeling to enhance the accuracy of water cycling predictions while reducing uncertainty. However, plant parameters affecting evapotranspiration (ET) in watershed models are poorly calibrated without the use of appropriate constraints. The goal of this study is to assess the predictive uncertainty of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), depending on the inclusion or exclusion of annual crop yield as an additional constraint for an agricultural watershed. We analyzed the simulated results with acceptable performance measures depending on a varying degree of model constraints: one constraint (streamflow), two constraints (streamflow and RS-ET) and three constraints (streamflow, RS-ET, and crop yield). The three performance measures used were Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Percent bias (P-bias), and Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE). As the number of model's constraints increased, the number of acceptable parameter sets were substantially reduced from 180 (acceptable for streamflow) to 116 (acceptable for streamflow and RS-ET) and 2 (acceptable for streamflow, RS-ET, and crop yield). In addition, overall model performance measures for ET were greatest in the simulation results with three constraints representing 0.02–0.2 and 0.04–0.05 greater NSE and KGE values than those of one constraint and two constraints, respectively. The parameter set with the best ET performance measures was also acceptable for predicting crop yield. Based on these results, we conclude that this crop yield data can be adopted as a model constraint for agricultural watersheds to reduce model uncertainty in ET simulations and to increase model prediction accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additional constraint; Predictive uncertainty; Remotely sensed evapotranspiration; Watershed modeling","Crops; Cultivation; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Remote sensing; Stream flow; Uncertainty analysis; Watersheds; Additional constraint; Agricultural watersheds; Crop yield; Model constraints; Performance measure; Predictive uncertainty; Remotely sensed evapotranspirations; Uncertainty; Water cycling; Watershed modelling; Efficiency; crop yield; cultivation; evapotranspiration; remote sensing; streamflow; watershed",Article,Scopus

The partition of sequestered CO2 into grain, straw, and root portions of plant biomass weight was computed. The present photosynthesis model was evaluated using the mass of carbon included in the harvested grains of provincial crop production.

Wheat is one of the major food crops, covering 21% of global food needs. The food supply issue necessitates reliable mathematical methods for predicting wheat yields. Crop yield information is necessary for agricultural management and strategic planning. Our mathematical model was developed based on a three-year field experiment in a semi-arid climate zone. Wheat yields ranged from 4310 to 6020 kg/ha. The novelty of this model is the inclusion of some stochastic data (weather and technological). The proposed method for wheat yield modeling is based on the theory of random sequence analysis. The model does not impose any restrictions on the number of production parameters and environmental indicators. A significant advantage of the proposed model is the absence of limits on the yield function.

The climate variables included the diffuse flux of photosynthetic active radiation (PDf), the diffuse flux of shortwave radiation (SDf), the direct flux of shortwave radiation (SDr), minimum temperature (Tmn), potential evapotranspiration (Pet), vapor pressure deficit (Vpd), vapor pressure (Vap), and wet day frequency (Wet). Satellite data, including the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), were used. Meteorological indices, including growing degree day (GDD), extreme degree day (EDD), and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), were used. The results showed that integrating all climate, satellite data, and meteorological indices could achieve the highest accuracy.

SIF-based primary productivity metrics have demonstrated higher fidelity to large-scale patterns of crop productivity than reflectance-based vegetation indices when averaged across the growing season. In-season crop yield forecasting typically relies upon reflectance-based vegetation indices, raising the question of whether in-season monitoring could be improved by utilizing SIF. Here, we analyze patterns of US agricultural productivity from USDA surveys and their in-season relationships with coarse-resolution GOME-2 SIF, high-resolution downscaled SIF, SIF-based primary productivity metrics, MODIS NDVI, and MODIS GPP. We find that coarse-resolution SIF-based metrics and NDVI exhibit similar out-of-sample in-season (April–July and April–August) predictive ability, even when spatially filtering higher-resolution NDVI data to cropland areas. The downscaled SIF product performed more poorly than the coarse-resolution SIF, and MODIS GPP performed more poorly than MODIS NDVI. All forecasts are improved by incorporating county fixed effects to control for cross-sectional differences between counties. NDVI-based metrics allow for significantly better yield predictions during drought conditions than SIF-based metrics, suggesting limited added value of SIF for early warning of drought impacts.

Models were calibrated and validated on fertiliser trials over two years in fields in the UK. Correlations of LAI and plant height with yield were stronger than for yield and chlorophyll con-tent. Yield prediction models calibrated in one year and tested on another suggested that LAI and height provided the most robust outcomes. Linear models had equal or smaller validation errors than machine learning. The information content of data for yield prediction degraded strongly with time before harvest, and in application to years not included in the calibration. Thus, impact of soil and weather variation between years on crop phenotypes was critical in changing the interactions between crop variables and yield (i.e., slopes and intercepts of regression models) and was a key contributor to predictive error.

The CNN-GRU model was able to extract features related to yield from the input variables and the accuracy of the proposed model (R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 462.56 kg/ha, MRE = 8.90 %) was higher than that of the GRU model (R2 = 0.62, RMSE = 479.79 kg/ha, MRE = 9.34 %), and the CNN-GRU model's reliability and robustness were confirmed by applying the leave-one-year-out cross-validation. Furthermore, we applied the proposed CNN-GRU model to simulate the wheat yields in the Plain pixel by pixel and examined the spatiotemporal patterns of the estimated yields. The distribution of yields presented the spatial characteristics of low yields in the east and high yields in the west, and the inter-annual variation characteristics of overall stability and steady increase. Additionally, we explored the possibility of timely prediction of winter wheat yield and the contribution of the multi-variables at different growth stages to yield estimation based on the ability of deep learning to reveal cumulative effects and non-linear relationships between influencing factors and yield. It was found that the information reflected by the multi-variables from late March to late April was important for yield estimation and the best prediction could be achieved approximately 20 days before the harvest of winter wheat.

Accurate and rapid forecasting of winter wheat yield at the county level has been a high demand for the decision-making on the grain in precision agriculture. The current forecast of winter wheat yield is commonly used the crop models, meteorological statistics, or remote sensing data. It is very necessary to further improve the accuracy of yield forecasting on the winter wheat, particularly for the refine prediction at the county level. In this research, a forecast model of winter wheat yield was proposed at the county level to combine the Sentinel-2, MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) remote sensing data, and cultivated land distribution using the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the Back Propagation (BP) neural networks. A machine learning technology was also used to evaluate the forecast of winter wheat yield. Specifically, two modules were constructed for the planting area extraction and the yield forecast. Specifically, an improved CNN was selected to extract and identify the spectral features of winter wheat planting areas from the Sentinel-2 remote sensing data. An improved BP neural network was also used to forecast the yield of winter wheat for the subsequent residual block module. The geological features were calculated to compare the cultivated land distribution in the raw MODIS EVI remote sensing data in the yield forecast module after the identification of planting areas. The correlation between the specific information and the winter wheat yield data was verified to forecast the yield using the improved BP neural networks. Some indicators were calculated to evaluate the forecast performance and accuracy of the improved model, including the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2). The experiment results showed that a better performance was achieved for the county-level winter wheat yield forecast using CNN and BP neural networks in the validation set from Shandong Province, China (2014-2016), where the R2 value was above 0.87, while the MAEs and RMSEs were lower than 269.48 and 346.56 kg/hm2, respectively. There were 52.34% of counties in Shandong Province with a relative error between the forecast and the actual yield of less than 3%, whereas, 92.98% of counties with a relative error within 9%, indicating a less than 1.2% deviation between the simulation and experiment. In the validation set from Henan Province (2015-2019), the R2 value was above 0.96, while the MAEs and RMSEs were lower than 304.84 and 418.14 kg/hm2, respectively. There were 45.90% of counties in Henan Province with a relative error between the forecast and the actual yield of less than 3%, while 91.05% of counties with a relative error within 9%, indicating a less than 1.6% deviation between the simulation and experiment. In conclusion, the higher forecast accuracies were achieved in the verification sets of Shandong and Henan Province for the county-level winter wheat yield forecast using CNN and BP neural networks. The better performance of the model can be expected to deal with the random input data, indicating the excellent generalization and high robustness for the accurate and stable forecast of winter wheat yield. © 2022 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The yield prediction model based on random forest algorithm and constructed with the wheat growth stage from October to next May and October to next April as the characteristic variables had higher accuracy, coefficient of determination (R2) were 0.85 and 0.84, and respectively, the root mean square error (RMSE) were 821.55 kg/hm2 and 832.01 kg/hm2. The prediction relative errors in hills and mountains of western and southern Henan was higher than that in plain areas.

In this study, two statistical models, multiple linear regression and random forest, were used to identify rainfall extremes indices affecting wheat yield in three different regions of the New South Wales wheat belt. The results show that the random forest model explained 41–67% of the year-to-year yield variation, whereas the multiple linear regression model explained 34–58%. In the two models, 3-month timescale standardized precipitation index of Jun.–Aug. (SPIJJA), Sep.–Nov. (SPISON), and consecutive dry days (CDDs) were identified as the three most important indices which can explain yield variability for most of the wheat belt. Our results indicated that the inter-annual variability of rainfall in winter and spring was largely responsible for wheat yield variation, and pre-growing season rainfall played a secondary role. Frequent shortages of rainfall posed a greater threat to crop growth than excessive rainfall in eastern Australia. We concluded that the comparison between multiple linear regression and machine learning algorithm proposed in the present study would be useful to provide robust prediction of yields and new insights of the effects of various rainfall extremes, when suitable climate and yield datasets are available. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",,"Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Linear regression; Regression analysis; Climatic conditions; Interannual variability; Multiple linear regression models; Multiple linear regressions; Rainfall extremes; Random forest modeling; Robust predictions; Standardized precipitation index; Rain; algorithm; climate conditions; crop production; crop yield; extreme event; farming system; machine learning; model; multiple regression; rainfall; wheat; yield response; Australia; New South Wales; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

The capability of statistical models to forecast coffee yields at different lead times during the growing season at the farm scale was assessed. Using data collected during a 10-year period (2008-2017) from 558 farmers across the four major coffee-producing provinces in Vietnam (Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Gia Lai, and Lam Dong), the models were built through a robust statistical modelling approach involving Bayesian and machine learning methods. Overall, coffee yields were estimated with reasonable accuracies across the four study provinces based on agroclimate variables, satellite-derived actual evapotranspiration, and crop and farm management information. Median values of prediction mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranged generally from 8% to 13%, and median root mean square errors (RMSE) between 295 kg ha−1 and 429 kg ha−1. For forecasts at four to one month before harvest, errors did not vary markedly when comparing the median MAPE and RMSE values. For farms in Dak Lak, Dak Nong, and Lam Dong, the median forecasting MAPE and RMSE varied between 13% and 16% and between 420 kg ha−1 and 456 kg ha−1, respectively. Using readily and freely available data, the modelling approach explored in this study appears flexible for an application to a larger number of coffee farms across the Vietnamese coffee-producing regions. Moreover, the study can serve as basis for developing a coffee yield predicting forecasting system that will offer substantial benefits to the entire coffee industry through better supply chain management in coffee-producing countries worldwide. © 2021","Climate risk management; Coffea canephora; Crop yield forecasting; Remote sensing","agricultural management; agroindustry; agrometeorology; coffee; crop yield; growing season; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; supply chain management; Dak Lak; Lam Dong; Viet Nam; Coffea canephora",Article,Scopus

In 2019, chronically malnourished people numbered nearly 240 million, or 20% of the population in SSA. Globally, numerous efforts have been made to anticipate potential droughts, crop conditions, and food shortages in order to improve early warning and risk management for food insecurity. To support this goal, we develop an Earth Observation (EO) and machine-learning-based operational, subnational maize yield forecast system and evaluate its out-of-sample forecast skills during the growing seasons for Kenya, Somalia, Malawi, and Burkina Faso. In general, forecast skills improve substantially during the vegetative growth period (VP) and gradually during the reproductive development period (RP). Thus, mid-season assessment can provide effective early warning months before harvest. Skillful forecasts (Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) > 0.6 and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) < 20%) appear approximately two dekads after the VP; for example, skillful forecasts appear in May in Kenya and Somalia, January in Malawi, and July in Burkina Faso. During model development, effective EO features are also identified, such as precipitation and available water during VP, and dry days and extreme temperatures in early VP. Compared to monthly standard EO features, sub-monthly (dekadal), non-standard, and serial EO features significantly improve forecast skills by ＋ 0.3 NSE and -10% of MAPE, demonstrating the ability to precisely and effectively capture favorable or detrimental crop development conditions. Finally, skillful forecasts and practical utility are demonstrated in the recent normal and dry years in each region. Overall, the developed yield forecasting system can provide skillful predictions during the growing season, supporting regional and international agricultural decision-making processes, including informing food-security planning and management, thereby helping to mitigate food shortages caused by unfavorable climate conditions. © 2022 The Author(s)","Earth observation; Food security; Machine learning; Maize yield; Operational forecast; Sub-Saharan Africa",,Article,Scopus

While standard systems use georeferenced agro-climatic data as input to process-based simulation models, new trends entail the application of machine learning for yield prediction. In this paper we present HADES (HAzelnut yielD forEcaSt), a hazelnut yield prediction system, in which process-based modeling and machine learning techniques are hybridized and applied in Turkey. Official yields in the top hazelnut producing municipalities in 2004–2019 are used as reference data, whereas ground observations of phenology and weather data represent the main HADES inputs. A statistical analysis allows inferring the occurrence and magnitude of biennial bearing in official yields and is used to aid the calibration of a process-based hazelnut simulation model. Then, a Random Forest algorithm is deployed in regression mode using the outputs of the process-based model as predictors, together with information on hazelnut varieties, the presence of alternate bearing in the yield series, and agro-meteorological indicators. HADES predictive ability in calibration and validation was balanced, with relative root mean square error below 20%, and R2 and Nash-Sutcliffe modeling efficiency above 0.7 considering all municipalities together.

Limited hydroclimate and yield data, however, hamper drought impact monitoring and assessment at the farm field scale. This study demonstrates the potential of using field-scale soil moisture simulations to support highresolution agricultural yield prediction and drought monitoring at the smallholder farm field scale. We present a multiscale modeling approach that combines HydroBlocks a physically based hyper-resolution land surface model (LSM) with machine learning. We used HydroBlocks to simulate root zone soil moisture and soil temperature in Zambia at 3 h 30 m resolution. These simulations, along with remotely sensed vegetation indices, meteorological data, and descriptors of the physical landscape (related to topography, land cover, and soils) were combined with district-level maize data to train a random forest (RF) model to predict maize yields at district and field scales (250 m). Our model predicted yields with an average testing coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.57 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 310 kgha-1 using year-based cross-validation. Our predicted maize losses due to the 2015 2016 El Niño drought agreed well with losses reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Our results reveal that soil moisture is the strongest and most reliable predictor of maize yield, driving its spatial and temporal variability. Soil moisture was also a more effective indicator of drought impacts on crops than precipitation, soil and air temperatures, and remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based drought indices.

Since there is a tendency towards increased weather extremes in the future, understanding weather-related yield factors becomes increasingly important not only for yield prediction, but also for the design of insurance products. Although insurance products mitigate financial losses for farmers, they suffer from considerable basis risk, i.e., a discrepancy between losses and the indemnity payment. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to explore the potential of machine learning for estimating the relationship between crop yield and weather conditions at the farm level and to use it as a tool for reducing basis risk in index insurance applications. METHODS: An artificial neural network was set up and calibrated to a rich set of farm-level yield data in Germany, covering the period from 2003 to 2018. A nonlinear regression model, which uses rainfall, temperature, and soil moisture as explanatory variables for yield deviations, served as a benchmark. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The empirical application revealed that compared with traditional estimation approaches, the gain in forecasting precision by using machine learning techniques was substantial. Moreover, the use of regionalized models and disaggregated high-resolution weather data improved the performance of artificial neural networks. A considerable part of yield variability at the farm level, however, could not be captured by statistical methods which solely use “big weather data”. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings have important implications for the design of weather-index based insurance because they document that a rather high level of basis risk remains if insurance products are based on an estimation of the weather-yield relationship. © 2021 The Authors","Basis risk; Index insurance; Machine learning; Weather risk; Yield prediction","artificial diet; artificial nest; artificial neural network; crop production; crop yield; exploration; machine learning; soil moisture; spatiotemporal analysis; Germany",Article,Scopus

This study provides a comprehensive step by step modelling approach for a small agricultural watershed using the SWAT model. The watershed is situated in Petzenkirchen in the western part of Lower Austria and has total area of 66 hectares. At present, 87% of the catchment area is arable land, 5% is used as pasture, 6% is forested and 2% is paved. The calibration approach involves a sequential calibration of the model starting from surface runoff, and groundwater flow, followed by crop yields and then soil moisture, and finally total streamflow and sediment yields. Calibration and validation are carried out using the r-package SWATplusR. The impact of each calibration step on sediment yields and total streamflow is evaluated. The results of this approach are compared with those of the conventional model calibration approach, where all the parameters governing various hydrological processes are calibrated simultaneously. Results showed that the model was capable of successfully predicting surface runoff, groundwater flow, soil profile water content, total streamflow and sediment yields with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of greater than 0.75. Crop yields were also well simulated with a percent bias (PBIAS) ranging from −17% to 14%. Surface runoff calibration had the highest impact on streamflow output, improving NSE from 0.39 to 0.77. The step-wise calibration approach performed better for streamflow prediction than the simultaneous calibration approach. The results of this study show that the step-wise calibration approach is more accurate, and provides a better representation of different hydrological components and processes than the simultaneous calibration approach. © 2021 by the authors.

Parameter estimation is challenging, especially for time-dependent parameters such as cultivar parameters with 2–3 years of lifespan. Manual calibration of the parameters is time-consuming, requires expertise, and is prone to error. This research develops a new automated framework to estimate time-dependent parameters for crop models using a parallel Bayesian optimization algorithm. This approach integrates the power of optimization and machine learning with prior agronomic knowledge. To test the proposed time-dependent parameter estimation method, we simulated historical yield increase (from 1985 to 2018) in 25 environments in the US Corn Belt with APSIM. Then we compared yield simulation results and nine parameter estimates from our proposed parallel Bayesian framework, with Bayesian optimization and manual calibration. Results indicated that parameters calibrated using the proposed framework achieved an 11.6% reduction in the prediction error over Bayesian optimization and a 52.1% reduction over manual calibration. We also trained nine machine learning models for yield prediction and found that none of them was able to outperform the proposed method in terms of root mean square error and R2. The most significant contribution of the new automated framework for time-dependent parameter estimation is its capability to find close-to-optimal parameters for the crop model. The proposed approach also produced explainable insight into cultivar traits’ trends over 34 years (1985–2018). © 2021, The Author(s).",,"algorithm; article; calibration; crop; cultivar; machine learning; nonhuman; prediction; simulation",Article,Scopus

Agroforestry may improve food security by increasing soil fertility, crop production, and livelihoods. Agroforestry simulation models can be useful for predicting the effects of tree management on crop growth when designing modifications to these systems. The Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) agroforestry tree-proxy model was used to simulate the response of maize yield to N fertilizer applications and tree pruning practices in the parkland agroforestry system in the Central Rift Valley, Ethiopia. The model was parameterized and tested using data collected from an experiment conducted under trees and in crop-only plots during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons. The treatments contained three levels of tree pruning (100% pruned, 50% pruned, and unpruned) as the main plots, and N fertilizers were applied to maize at two rates (9 or 78 kg N ha−1) as sub-plots. Maize yield predictions across two years in response to tree pruning and N applications under tree canopies were satisfactorily simulated (NSE = 0.72, RSR = 0.51, R2 = 0.8). Virtual experiments for different rates of N, pruning levels, sowing dates, and cultivars suggest that maize yield could be improved by applying fertilizers (particularly on crop-only plots) and by at least 50% pruning of trees. Optimal maize yield can be obtained at a higher rate of fertilization under trees than away from them due to better water relations, and there is scope for improving the sowing date and cultivar. Across a 34-year range of recent climate, small increases in yields due to optimum N-fertilizing and pruning were probably limited by nutrient limitations other than N, but the highest yields were consistently in the 2–4 m zone under trees. These virtual experiments helped to form hypotheses regarding fertilizers, pruning, and the effects of trees on soil that warrant further field evaluation. © 2020 by the authors.

The yield of winter wheat is affected by production technology level and climatic conditions. This study analyzed the feasibility of early prediction of winter wheat yield with long time series meteorological data and random forest method in Henan Province. Winter wheat was planted in a total of 106 counties (cities) in Henan province. Based on the ground observation meteorological data and the winter wheat statistical yield data from the year of 1990 to 2015, we extracted 47 climatic factors such as temperature, humidity and precipitation in different growth stages from wheat jointing to heading stage, and 3 spatial factors of latitude, longitude and elevation. A total of 50 parameters were used as a set of feature variables. The actual yield, meteorological yield and relative meteorological yield were used as the target variables respectively, and a random forest yield prediction model with multiple variables was constructed. The data from the year of 1990 to 2009 were used as training samples to construct the model and the forests constructed were validated with data from the year of 2010 to 2015. The yield impact factors were analyzed by combining the data importance results outside the bag. The results showed that: 1) The prediction results by using meteorological yield and relative meteorological yield as the target variables were better than the yield model. For the meteorological yield and relative meteorological yield models, the values of determination coefficient R2 were both above 0.8, the values of mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of meteorological yield were 415 and 558 kg/hm2, respectively, and the values of MAE and RMSE of relative meteorological yield were 0.07 and 0.09, respectively; 2) The spatial characteristics played an important role in the improving the random forest yield model. However, if the model included only spatial parameters, the predicted values were horizontally distributed along 1:1 line and the different yields in the same region by using random forest algorithm were predicted as the same values. The values far from 1:1 line might be affected by meteorological factors. Therefore, on this basis, adding meteorological features improved the prediction accuracy with smaller deviations, higher R2 (0.88), and smaller MAE and RMSE (0.06 and 0.08). 3) The model prediction was also affected by crop growing stages. The accuracy based on the meteorological features of winter wheat florets differentiation and heading and flowering stage was higher than the other spike differentiation periods, indicating that the environmental changes during this period have a greater impact on the final yield; The predicted results at the late drug interval had the larger deviation from the actual yield. It was because the meteorological factors had strong correlation and it weakened the impacts of spatial characteristics. 4) Based on the importance of outside the bag data, In the meteorological features, the average temperature and minimum temperature of winter wheat floret differentiation period, the spatial characteristics parameters were important. In addition, the negative accumulated temperature from the jointing to heading stage, and the maximum temperature at heading and flowering stage had great influence on yield. During the model establishment, we didn't differentiate disaster from non-disaster year because the sample sizes were small. However, during the model validation, the data were from both normal and disaster years, which could ensure the reliability of the prediction model. Thus, the winter wheat yield prediction based on random forest should consider both spatial and meteorological characteristics parameters. The results of this study provide new ideas and methods for early prediction of winter wheat yield. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Predicting ear emergence of rice plants is known to be crucial for practicing good harvesting quality, and has long been dependent upon old farmers who acquire skills of intuitive prediction based on their long term experiences. Facing with aging farmers, data driven approach for the prediction have been pursued. Nevertheless, they are not necessarily sufficient in terms of practical use. One of the issue is to adopt weather forecast as the feature so that the predictive performance is varied by the accuracy of the forecast. The other issue is that the performance is varied by region and the regional characteristics have not been used as the features for the prediction. With this background, we propose a feature engineering to quantify hidden regional characteristics as the feature for the prediction. Further the feature is engineered based only on observational data without any forecast.

These regulations require that growers apply nitrogen to meet, but not exceed, the annual N demand for crop and tree growth and nut production. To accurately predict seasonal nitrogen demand, therefore, growers need to estimate block-level almond yield early in the growing season so that timely N management decisions can be made. However, methods to predict almond yield are not currently available. To fill this gap, we have developed statistical models using the Stochastic Gradient Boosting, a machine learning approach, for early season yield projection and mid-season yield update over individual orchard blocks. We collected yield records of 185 orchards, dating back to 2005, from the major almond growers in the Central Valley of California. A large set of variables were extracted as predictors, including weather and orchard characteristics from remote sensing imagery. Our results showed that the predicted orchard-level yield agreed well with the independent yield records. For both the early season (March) and mid-season (June) predictions, a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.71, and a ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) of 2.6 were found on average. We also identified several key determinants of yield based on the modeling results. Almond yield increased dramatically with the orchard age until about 7 years old in general, and the higher long-term mean maximum temperature during April–June enhanced the yield in the southern orchards, while a larger amount of precipitation in March reduced the yield, especially in northern orchards. Remote sensing metrics such as annual maximum vegetation indices were also dominant variables for predicting the yield potential. While these results are promising, further refinement is needed; the availability of larger data sets and incorporation of additional variables and methodologies will be required for the model to be used as a fertilization decision support tool for growers. Our study has demonstrated the potential of automatic almond yield prediction to assist growers to manage N adaptively, comply with mandated requirements, and ensure industry sustainability. © 2019 Zhang, Jin, Chen and Brown.","Almond orchard; Central valley; Machine learning; Nitrogen management; Remote sensing; Yield prediction; Yield variation",,Article,Scopus

Under the pressure of feeding a growing population, accurate and timely estimation of corn yield before the harvest is of great importance to supply chain management and regional food security. Recently, machine learning (ML) in conjunction with satellite remote sensing has been used for developing corn yield prediction models. Despite the success, a major bottleneck of training a reliable supervised ML model is the need for representative ground truth labels (e.g., yield records), which may be limited or even not available due to financial and manpower reasons. Also, due to domain shift, an ML model trained with labeled data from a label-rich region (i.e., source domain) could experience a significant performance decrease when directly applied to the region of interest (i.e., target domain). To address this issue, we proposed a Bayesian domain adversarial neural network (BDANN) for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on county-level corn yield prediction. By applying adversarial learning and Bayesian inference, BDANN was trained to reduce domain shift and accurately predict corn yield by extracting domain-invariant and task-informative features from both source and target domains. Moreover, the results also demonstrated that the BDANN model generalized well on small training sets. Experiments in two ecoregions in the U.S. corn belt have shown the effectiveness of the proposed BDANN and its superiority over other state-of-the-art methods. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Adversarial learning; Bayesian inference; corn yield prediction; domain adaptation; remote sensing","Bayesian networks; Crops; Food supply; Forecasting; Image segmentation; Inference engines; Neural networks; Supervised learning; Adversarial learning; Bayes method; Bayesian inference; Biological system modeling; Corn yield prediction; Corn yields; Domain adaptation; Features extraction; Neural-networks; Predictive models; Remote-sensing; Yield prediction; Remote sensing; artificial neural network; Bayesian analysis; crop yield; ecoregion; remote sensing; supply chain management; United States",Article,Scopus

The developed data set is a combination of management, environment, and historical corn yields from 1980 to 2019. Two scenarios for ensemble creation are considered: homogenous and heterogenous ensembles. In homogenous ensembles, the base CNN-DNN models are all the same, but they are generated with a bagging procedure to ensure they exhibit a certain level of diversity. Heterogenous ensembles are created from different base CNN-DNN models which share the same architecture but have different hyperparameters. Three types of ensemble creation methods were used to create several ensembles for either of the scenarios: Basic Ensemble Method (BEM), Generalized Ensemble Method (GEM), and stacked generalized ensembles. Results indicated that both designed ensemble types (heterogenous and homogenous) outperform the ensembles created from five individual ML models (linear regression, LASSO, random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM). Furthermore, by introducing improvements over the heterogenous ensembles, the homogenous ensembles provide the most accurate yield predictions across US Corn Belt states. This model could make 2019 yield predictions with a root mean square error of 866 kg/ha, equivalent to 8.5% relative root mean square and could successfully explain about 77% of the spatio-temporal variation in the corn grain yields. The significant predictive power of this model can be leveraged for designing a reliable tool for corn yield prediction which will in turn assist agronomic decision makers. © Copyright © 2021 Shahhosseini, Hu, Khaki and Archontoulis.","CNN-DNN; heterogenous ensemble; homogenous ensemble; US Corn Belt; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

Rainfall, temperature (minimum and maximum), evaporation, average wind speed (morning and evening), and sunshine hours are the climatic factors considered for modeling. Rice harvest and yield data over the last three decades and monthly climatic data were used to develop the prediction model by applying artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machine regression (SVMR), multiple linear regression (MLR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), power regression (PR), and robust regression (RR). The performance of each model was assessed in terms of the mean squared error (MSE), correlation coefficient (R), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean squared error ratio (RSR), BIAS value, and the Nash number, and it was found that the GPR-based model is the most accurate among them. Climate data collected until early 2019 (Maha season of year 2018) were used to develop the model, and an independent validation was performed by applying data of the Yala season of year 2019.

With advances in remote sensing technology, computational processing power, and machine learning, the ability to forecast yield has improved substantially over the past years. However, most previous work has been done leveraging low-resolution satellite imagery and forecasting yield at the region, county, or occasionally farm-level. In this work, we use high-resolution aerial imagery and output from high-precision harvesters to predict in-field harvest values for corn-raising farms in the US Midwest. By using the harvester information, we are able to cast the problem of yield-forecasting as a density estimation problem and predict a harvest rate, in bushels/acre, at every pixel in the field image. This approach provides the farmer with a detailed view of which areas of the farm may be performing poorly so he can make the appropriate management decisions in addition to providing an improved prediction of total yield. We evaluate both traditional machine learning approaches with hand-crafted features alongside deep learning methods.

Multiple linear regression (MLR) is the benchmark method commonly using to identify suitable factors for crop improvement. It doesn’t work always due to stringent assumption (Multicollinearity, Linearity) behind the MLR model. Here we tried to develop an efficient model for the selection of major traits that contribute to seed yield in soybean by comparing different models. Methods: Field experiment was conducted using 98 soybean core population through augmented design. 18 morphometric traits obtain from soybean core population were considered under the study as regressors. Multiple linear regression (MLR), principle component regression (PCR), regression tree and Random Forest models were compared to select traits based on prediction accuracy. Result: All the models identified the number of pods per plant (NPP) has the most influencing variable to the soybean yield. However random forest has a much higher prediction power (RMSE=4.59, MAPE=0.18) compared to other models under study.

Regular periods of drought limit both the productivity and sustainability of farmers. This paper investigated the influence of drought on one of the major crops in the Maharashtra state of India. Impact of rainfall variations on the Kharif crop Jowar (Sorghum spp) was studied in order to determine the effect of drought on crop production. The study area included 25 districts of Maharashtra and used climate and cropping data from year 1983 to 2012 (30 years). Seasonal Rainfall in millimeters (mm) and crop yield production data in tonnes/hectare (t/h) for Jowar crop were used in the study. Association Rule Mining techniques were carried out on the data set to ascertain the relationship between patterns of rainfall and crop production for the jowar crop. The study examined the temporal and spatial variability in rainfall and crop yield production. Association rules were developed to characterise the crop production for various districts and years related to the drought period. A number of interesting associations were derived with rainfall variability and crop yield production for Maharashtra state of India. It is expected that these techniques could be used for the development of a decision support tool for drought impact for Maharashtra and adapted for other states of India. © 2017 IEEE.","association rule mining; crop production; drought; rainfall variability","Association rules; Cultivation; Decision support systems; Drought; Rain; Regional planning; Agricultural sector; Crop production; Decision support tools; Natural phenomena; Rainfall variability; Rainfall variation; Rule mining techniques; Temporal and spatial variability; Crops",Conference Paper,Scopus

Accurate wheat yield prediction is critical to satisfying local consumption and increasing exports regionally and globally to meet human food security. This paper incorporates remote satellite-based information in a wheat-growing region in South Australia to estimate the yield by integrating the kernel ridge regression (KRR) method coupled with complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and the grey wolf optimisation (GWO). The hybrid model, ‘GWO-CEEMDAN-KRR,’ employing an initial pool of 23 different satellite-based predictors, is seen to outperform all the benchmark models and all the feature selection (ant colony, atom search, and particle swarm optimisation) methods that are implemented using a set of carefully screened satellite variables and a feature decomposition or CEEMDAN approach. A suite of statistical metrics and infographics comparing the pre-dicted and measured yield shows a model prediction error that can be reduced by ~20% by employing the proposed GWO-CEEMDAN-KRR model. With the metrics verifying the accuracy of simulations, we also show that it is possible to optimise the wheat yield to achieve agricultural profits by quantifying and including the effects of satellite variables on potential yield. With further improvements in the proposed methodology, the GWO-CEEMDAN-KRR model can be adopted in agricultural yield simulation that requires remote sensing data to establish the relationships between crop health, yield, and other productivity features to support precision agriculture. © 2022 by the authors.

The agrarian economy was largely consumption-oriented and there were poor irrigation facilities and simple agricultural implements. Agricultural yield was very low and dependency on nature was very high. The food grains were not enough to feed the population. With a view to augment the yield, the Indian government had no option but to introduce Green Revolution. The Green Revolution was a movement towards excessive mechanisation of agriculture. The agriculturists were motivated and assisted to undertake the technology-based farming. Irrigation facilities were developed. However, the results of Green Revolution were not uniform all over the country. Neither has there has been uniform impact on all kinds of crops nor has there been uniform impact on all the regions and all categories of farmers. Even today the farmer falls prey to the risks unleashed by the nature. Success or failure of rain fed vegetation depends upon the sample and amounts of rainfall. But, other factors like temperature, photoperiod and grid additionally notably influence crop boom and yield. The analysis of climate performs a key role in planning better farming structures to enhance and stabilise yields, and to design appropriate crop breeding strategies. With the use of technology, it has also become possible to minimise the risks involved in agriculture to which the early farmers were awfully exposed. There are in particular two procedures to predict rainfall. Empirical technique and dynamical method. In our method we use the empirical technique that is based on evaluation of historical information of the rainfall and its dating to a spread of atmospheric variables over different components of the nation. The most broadly used empirical approaches used for weather prediction are regression, artificial neural network, fuzzy logic and institution approach of statistics dealing with.

It is an end-of-season land cover map which is not available within growing season. Moreover, CDLs in early years have many misclassified pixels (relatively low accuracy) due to cloud cover and lack of satellite images. This paper will present the studies of using machine learning technique to address these issues in CDL data. Specifically, we will present the design and implementation of a machine learning model for agro-geoinformation discovery from CDL.

This paper examines the suitability of multiple meteorological datasets for the rice yield modeling in South Korea, 1996-2019, and a hindcast experiment for rice yield using a machine learning method by considering the nonlinear relationships between meteorological variables and the rice yield. In addition to the ASOS in-situ observations, we used CRU-JRA ver. 2.1 and ERA5 reanalysis. From the multiple meteorological datasets, we extracted the four common variables (air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and precipitation) and analyzed the characteristics of each data and the associations with rice yields. CRU-JRA ver. 2.1 showed an overall agreement with the other datasets. While relative humidity had a rare relationship with rice yields, solar radiation showed a somewhat high correlation with rice yields. Using the air temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation of July, August, and September, we built a random forest model for the hindcast experiments of rice yields. The model with CRU-JRA ver. 2.1 showed the best performance with a correlation coefficient of 0.772. The solar radiation in the prediction model had the most significant importance among the variables, which is in accordance with the generic agricultural knowledge.

It generates a magnetic field which released in solar flares or coronal mass ejections for 11-year solar cycle that causes the occurrence of space weather. Different researchers in different parts of the world indicated that space weather highly affects agriculture production. However, in Ethiopia context especially Chokie mountain basin the influence of space weather on agriculture was not documented. Hence, this paper was aimed at investigating the impact of space weather on agriculture products over Chokie mountain basin. Assessment of space weather impacts on agriculture product is quite useful to balance energy and food security over developing countries like Ethiopia. Space weather (sunspot number), precipitation, temperature, and agriculture data were used for this study. Descriptive quantitative design method was applied on the data of agriculture products and climate variables. Furthermore, regression models with the help of MATLAB software were applied for data analysis. The relation between crop yield (teff, wheat, and maize) with sunspot number, temperature, and precipitation were analyzed in each agro-ecological zones using 31 years (1990–2019) data over Chokie mountain basin. The results showed that correlation coefficients between sunspot number with annual average value of temperature, precipitation, maize, teff, and wheat were found 0.11, − 0.32, − 0.47, − 0.52, and − 0.59, respectively. Sunspot had highly negatively correlated with annual spatial average value of teff and wheat. Generally, the occurrence of space weather (sunspot) leads to reduction of wheat and teff over the study area. Hence, shifting cultivation strategy is needed for local community during the occurrence of 11-year solar cycles frequency.

Understanding and quantifying the temporal cumulative effect of crop growth and spatial variances across different regions remains challenging for large-scale crop yield estimation. In this study, a deep spatial-temporal learning framework, named DeepCropNet (DCN), has been developed to hierarchically capture the features for county-level corn yield estimation. The temporal features are learned by an attention-based long short-term memory network and the spatial features are learned by the multi-task learning (MTL) output layers. The DCN model has been applied to quantify the relationship between meteorological factors and the county-level corn yield in the US Corn Belt from 1981 to 2016. Three meteorological factors, including growing degree days, killing degree days, and precipitation, are used as time-series inputs. The results show that DCN provides an improved estimation accuracy (RMSE = 0.82 Mg ha-1) as compared to that of conventional methods such as LASSO (RMSE = 1.14 Mg ha-1) and Random Forest (RMSE = 1.05 Mg ha-1). Temporally, the attention values computed from the temporal learning module indicate that DCN captures the temporal cumulative effect and this temporal pattern is consistent across all states. Spatially, the spatial learning module improves the estimation accuracy based on the regional specific features captured by the MTL mechanism. The study highlights that the DCN model provides a promising spatial-temporal learning framework for corn yield estimation under changing meteorological conditions across large spatial regions. © 2020 The Author(s).

Food security is important for decision-makers. The agriculture industry can more accurately supply human demand for food if the crop yield is predicted accurately. Tomato is one of the most important crops so that 160 million tonnes of tomatoes are produced annually around the world. In this study, tomato yield based on data of 40 cities of Iran country including annual average temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), effective rainfall (R), wind speed (WS), and Evapotranspiration (EV) for the period of 1968–2018 was predicted using a new Bayesian model averaging (BMA). The paper's main innovation is the use of the new BMA so that it allows the modellers to quantify the uncertainty of model parameters and inputs simultaneously. For this aim, first, the multiple Adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface system (ANFIS) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) were used for predicting crop yield. To train the ANFIS and MLP model, a new algorithm, namely, multi verse optimization algorithm (MOA) was used. Also, the ability of MOA was benchmarked against the particle swarm optimization (PSO), and firefly algorithm (FFA). In the next level, the new BMA used the outputs of the ANFIS-MOA, MLP-MOA, ANFIS, FFA, MLP-FFA, ANFIS-PSO, MLP-PSO, ANFIS, and MLP for predicting tomato yield in an ensemble framework. The five- input combination of RH, T, and R, WS, and EV gave the best result. The mean absolute error (MAE) of the BMA in the testing level was 20.12 (Ton/ha) while it was 24.12, 24.45, 24.67, 25.12, 29.12, 30.12, 31.12, and 33.45 for the ANFIS-MOA, MLP-MOA, ANFIS-FFA, MLP-FFA, ANFIS-PSO, MLP-PSO, ANFIS, and MLP models. Regarding the results of uncertainty analysis, the uncertainty of BMA was lower than those of the ANFIS-MOA, MLP-MOA, ANFIS-FFA, MLP-FFA, ANFIS-PSO, MLP-PSO, ANFIS, and MLP models while the MLP model provided the highest uncertainty.

The traditional rice almanac used astronomical and climate factors to estimate yield response. However, this research integrated meteorological, agro-chemical, and soil physiographic factors for yield response prediction. Besides, the impact of those factors on the production of three major rice ecotypes has also been studied in this research. Moreover, this study found a different set of those factors with respect to the yield response of different rice ecotypes. Machine learning algorithms named Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) have been used for predicting the yield response. The SVR shows better results than XGBoost for predicting the yield of the Aus rice ecotype, whereas XGBoost performs better for forecasting the yield of the Aman and Boro rice ecotypes. The result shows that the root mean squared error (RMSE) of three different ecotypes are in between 9.38% and 24.37% and that of R-squared values are between 89.74% and 99.13% on two different machine learning algorithms. Moreover, the explainability of the models is also shown in this study with the help of the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model called Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). © 2022 Md.

The key meteorological factors and climatic suitable index were calculated by daily meteorological data from 56 meteorological stations, soybean growth stage records of 5 key agrometeorological stations and yield data in Liaoning province from 1992 to 2016. The results showed that the key meteorological factors-based forecast model was suitable to forecast soybean yield on June 16, July 21, July 26, August 1, August 26 and September 16 (P＜0.05), and the climatic suitability-based forecast model could be used for every 5 or 6 days from August 16 to October 1 (P＜0.05) in Liaoning province. The average accuracies of return test of both models were higher than 83.0%. Compared with the key meteorological factors-based model, the climatic suitability-based model was stable, which indicated by smaller variation of average verified accuracy and average forecast test accuracy. From 1997 to 2016, both models could be applied in soybean yield tendency forecast, according to scoring criteria, core above zero reach up to 60% by the two models. In conclusion, the yield forecast models based on key meteorological factors and climatic suitability could meet the basic needs for agrometeorological services in Liaoning province. For soybean yield tendency forecasting, the method based on key meteorological factors should be preferred. In the normal years without severe meteorological disaster, the method on climatic suitability could be given priority to yield quantitative forecasting to reduce forecast times. © 2018 Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Agrometeorology.

Rapeseed and mustard (R&amp;M) is the predominant oilseed crop in Assam and is very much sensitive to climatic factors compared to other crops grown during rabi season. In the context of recent climate variability observed in the Brahmaputra valley, development of efficient yield forecasting models for R&amp;M based on weather parameters would certainly help the policy makers in formulating appropriate policies and decision-making. The present study was undertaken to develop R&amp;M pre-harvest yield forecast models at F1 (flowering), F2 (siliqua formation) and F3 (siliqua development &amp; maturity) stages for 15 districts of Assam using stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques by analysing the yield and weather data for 27 years and to investigate the impact of weather factors in determining the yield of R&amp;M. The results were enumerated based on coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and normalized root mean square error (RMSEn) values. ANN models were found to have greater R2 values over SMLR at all the three stages of forecast except in 2–3 districts. Similarly, profound improvement was observed in RMSE and RMSEn values of the forecast models using ANN technique. Analysing the percent error between observed and forecasted yield, ANN weather-based models were found to give more accurate pre-harvest yield prediction of R&amp;M in the Brahmaputra valley of Assam. Temperature and relative humidity were found to be the most significant parameters in affecting R&amp;M yield in most of the districts during all the three stages of forecast. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","ANN; Brahmaputra valley; Multiple linear regression; Rapeseed and mustard; Yield forecasting","artificial neural network; crop production; crop yield; forecasting method; prediction; regression analysis; Brahmaputra Valley",Article,Scopus

The process of investigation, sharing, visualizing and dealing with the conventional database and programming procedures is difficult because of this data structure. Nowadays, big data analysis has been applied in different areas such as human services, business process, logical research, natural resource administration, share marketing, network organization and climate modelling. Rainfall prediction is the usage of science and innovation to anticipate the condition of the environment. Therefore, in order to create precise results of rainfall and weather forecasting, a few techniques have been produced. This paper presents an effective rainfall prediction technique namely Adaptive Moment Optimization (AMO) based Long Short-term Memory Neural Network (LSTM-NN) in the big data environment. The AMO is used to find the relevant features for rainfall prediction and LSTM is used to predict the rainfall. Here, LSTM-NN based AMO technique is proposed to perform the prediction of rainfall. This technique utilizes large scale rainfall information for the duration of 1901-2002 Years. The AMO has a higher learning rate and selects the relevant features that help to improve the performance of the model.

Several studies have been conducted to forecast agricultural yields using machine learning algorithms (MLA), but few studies have used ensemble machine learning algorithms (EMLA). In the current study, we use a dataset generated by a computer simulation program, and meteorological data obtained over 30 years from Maine, United States (USA). The primary goal of this research is to increase the forecast accuracy of the best characteristics for overcoming hunger challenges. We adopted stacking regression (SR) and cascading regression (CR) with a novel combination of MLA based on the wild blueberry dataset. We used features that indicated the best regulation for wild blueberry agroecosystems. Four feature engineering selection techniques are applied, namely variance inflation factor (VIF), sequential forward feature selection (SFFS), sequential backward elimination feature selection (SBEFS), and extreme gradient boosting based on feature importance (XFI). We applied Bayesian optimization on popular MLA to obtain the best hyperparameters to achieve accurate wild blueberry yield prediction. The SR used a two-layer structure: level-0 containing light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), gradient boost regression (GBR) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and level-1 providing the output prediction using a Ridge. The CR topology is the same MLA used in SR, but in a series form that takes the new prediction as a feeder to each MLA and removes the previous prediction in each stage. We assessed the CR, and SR with outcomes according to the root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2). In the results, the proposed SR showed the best performance with R2 of 0.984 and RMSE of 179.898 compared with another study that reported R2 of 0.938 and RMSE of 343.026 on the seven features selected by XFI. The SR achieved the highest R2 of 0.985 on all features and the features that were selected by the SBEFS.

As such, hybrid crops that are tolerant to drought and heat stress would produce more consistent yields compared to the hybrids that are not tolerant to these stresses. In the 2019 Syngenta Crop Challenge, Syngenta released several large datasets that recorded the yield performances of 2452 corn hybrids planted in 1560 locations between 2008 and 2017 and asked participants to classify the corn hybrids as either tolerant or susceptible to drought stress, heat stress and combined drought and heat stress. However, no data was provided that classified any set of hybrids as tolerant or susceptible to any type of stress. In this paper, we present an unsupervised approach to solving this problem, which was recognized as one of the winners in the 2019 Syngenta Crop Challenge.

An EM38-DD field apparatus was used to measure the apparent electrical conductivity of the soil expressed as ECv in order to shed light on the spatial variability of salinity of the area by monthly observations conducted at 50 points. The salinity measurements were conducted from June 2005 to November 2006, and in July and November 2018, and in March 2019. The ECv values decreased with distance from the lagoon and the wetlands towards the upper and/or central parts of the basin. A comparison of the distributions of salinity showed that salt-affected soils corresponded to the high electrical conductivity of the water-table. The changes in soil salinity indicated that salinization was the result of capillary rise and evaporation from the saline shallow water-table. The electrical conductivity of several soil series and varying land management revealed that the ECv values above 200 mS/m significantly hinder plant growth, however, land use practices (i.e., crop rotation) slightly affected the fluctuation level of salinization. The ECv values of the rainy seasons were generally lower than those of the dry periods. It can be concluded that the topographic position (e.g., distance to the lagoon), soil texture, and the saline shallow water-table along with the inappropriate soil and micro-topographic conditions, are the most effective factors for salinity build up. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Irrigation facilities; Land use; Micro-topography; Semi-arid regions; Soil salinity; Water-table","electrical conductivity; environmental monitoring; long-term change; salinity; salinization; semiarid region; spatial variation; wetland; Adana [Turkey]; Adana [Turkey]; Akyatan Lagoon; Mediterranean Coast [Turkey]; Seyhan Basin; Turkey",Article,Scopus

Usually such assessments apply statistically postprocessed output of climate model projections to force impact models. Increasingly, time series with daily resolution are used, which require high consistency, for instance with respect to transition probabilities (TPs) between wet and dry days and spell durations. However, both climate models and commonly applied statistical tools have considerable uncertainties and drawbacks. This paper compares the ability of 1) raw regional climate model (RCM) output, 2) bias-corrected RCM output, and 3) a conventional weather generator (WG) that has been calibrated to match observed TPs to simulate the sequence of dry, wet, and very wet days at a set of long-term weather stations across Switzerland. The study finds systematic biases in TPs and spell lengths for raw RCM output, but a substantial improvement after bias correction using the deterministic quantile mapping technique. For the region considered, bias-corrected climate model output agrees well with observations in terms of TPs as well as dry and wet spell durations. For the majority of cases (models and stations) bias-corrected climate model output is similar in skill to a simple Markov chain stochastic weather generator. There is strong evidence that bias-corrected climate model simulations capture the atmospheric event sequence more realistically than a simple WG. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","Climate models; Mathematical and statistical techniques; Model comparison; Model errors; Model evaluation/performance; Model output statistics; Models and modeling; Statistical techniques","Mapping; Markov processes; Statistical mechanics; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Model comparison; Model errors; Model evaluation/performance; Model output statistics; Statistical techniques; Climate models; climate modeling; climate prediction; Markov chain; probability; regional climate; stochasticity; uncertainty analysis; weather forecasting",Article,Scopus

In this study, different multispectral and red-green-blue (RGB) vegetation indices were analyzed, as well as the digitally estimated canopy cover and plant density, in order to estimate corn grain yield using a neural network model. The relative importance of the predictor variables was also analyzed. An experiment was established with five levels of nitrogen fertilization (140, 200, 260, 320, and 380 kg/ha) and four replicates, in a completely randomized block design, resulting in 20 experimental polygons. Crop information was captured using two sensors (Parrot Sequoia_4.9, and DJI FC6310_8.8) mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for two flight dates at 47 and 79 days after sowing (DAS). The correlation coefficient between the plant density, obtained through the digital count of corn plants, and the corn grain yield was 0.94; this variable was the one with the highest relative importance in the yield estimation according to Garson’s algorithm. The canopy cover, digitally estimated, showed a correlation coefficient of 0.77 with respect to the corn grain yield, while the relative importance of this variable in the yield estimation was 0.080 and 0.093 for 47 and 79 DAS, respectively. The wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI), plant density, and canopy cover showed the highest correlation coefficient and the smallest errors (R = 0.99, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.028 t ha−1, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.125 t ha−1 ) in the corn grain yield estimation at 47 DAS, with the WDRVI index and the density being the variables with the highest relative importance for this crop development date. For the 79 DAS flight, the combination of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference red edge (NDRE), WDRVI, excess green (EXG), triangular greenness index (TGI), and visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI), as well as plant density and canopy cover, generated the highest correlation coefficient and the smallest errors (R = 0.97, MAE = 0.249 t ha−1, RMSE = 0.425 t ha−1 ) in the corn grain yield estimation, where the density and the NDVI were the variables with the highest relative importance, with values of 0.295 and 0.184, respectively. However, the WDRVI, plant density, and canopy cover estimated the corn grain yield with acceptable precision (R = 0.96, MAE = 0.209 t ha−1, RMSE = 0.449 t ha−1 ). The generated neural network models provided a high correlation coefficient between the estimated and the observed corn grain yield, and also showed acceptable errors in the yield estimation. The spectral information registered through remote sensors mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles and its processing in vegetation indices, canopy cover, and plant density allowed the characterization and estimation of corn grain yield.

This is a significant advancement over typical quantile-matching alternatives available for bias correction, as they implicitly assume that correction of individual variable attributes will lead to correction of dependence biases between multiple variables. Furthermore, existing approaches perform bias correction at a given time scale (e.g., daily), whereas applications often require biases to be addressed at more than one time scale (such as annual in the case of most water resources planning projects). The proposed approach addresses all these issues, and additionally attempts to correct for lag-1 dependence (and cross-dependence) attributes across multiple time scales. The approach is called multivariate recursive quantile nesting bias correction (MRQNBC). The fidelity of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a vector of CSIRO Mk3 GCM atmospheric variables and comparing the results with the commonly used quantile-matching approach. Following this, the implications of the approach in hydrology- and water resources–related applications are demonstrated by feeding the bias-corrected data to a rainfall downscaling model and comparing the downscaled rainfall attributes for current and future climate. The proposed approach is shown to represent the variability and persistence related attributes better and can thus be expected to have important consequences for the simulation of occurrence and intensity of extreme events such as floods and droughts in downscaled simulations, of importance in various climate impact assessment applications. © 2016 American Meteorological Society",,"Climate models; Rain; Time measurement; Atmospheric variables; Climate impact assessment; General circulation model; Hydrology and water resource; Multiple time scale; Rainfall downscaling; Systematic bias; Water resources planning; Water resources; atmospheric general circulation model; correction; downscaling; multivariate analysis; rainfall; vector",Article,Scopus

In this paper the use of MeteoSat-derived meteorological products to replace weather variables interpolated from weather stations (temperature, reference evapotranspiration and radiation) is explored. Simulations for winter-wheat were carried for Spain, Poland and Belgium using both interpolated and MeteoSat-derived weather variables. The results were spatially aggregated to national and regional level and were evaluated by comparing the simulation results of both approaches and by assessing the relationships with crop yield statistics over the periods 1995-2003 from EUROSTAT. The results indicate that potential crop yield can be simulated well using MeteoSat-derived meteorological variables, but that water-stress hardly occurs in the water-limited simulations. This is caused by a difference in reference evapotranspiration which was 20-30% smaller in case of MeteoSat. As a result, the simulations using MeteoSat-derived meteorological variables performed considerably poorer in a regression analyses with crop yield statistics on national and regional level. Our results indicate that a recalibration of the model parameters is necessary before the MeteoSat-derived meteorological variables can be used operationally in the system. © 2007.","Crop growth model; MeteoSat; Regional level; Yield forecasting","crop yield; evapotranspiration; forecasting method; growth modeling; Meteosat; satellite data; wheat; Belgium; Benelux; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Poland; Southern Europe; Spain; Western Europe; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Uncertainties in projections of crop growth may derive from different sources in modelling. The parameter-induced uncertainty is one of the important aspects. Here we calibrated the parameters for rice, wheat and maize combined with observed data of aboveground biomass (AGB) and leaf area index (LAI) at 16 Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN) sites under different rotation systems and subsequently validated the model at these sites using the data independent of calibration. The results showed that the simulated AGB and LAI exhibited good agreement with the observations. The model performance for rice and maize was better than that for wheat. The statistical analysis of model performance showed that the RMSE (root mean square error), RMD (relative mean deviation) and EF (model efficiency) were 32.52%, − 0.95% and 0.87 of the means, respectively. The three components of the modelling uncertainty, bias of mean (UM), bias of slope (UR) and random residue (UE) accounted 0.1%, 0.9% and 99% of the total errors, respectively. The main contributor to the error was the random disturbances, indicating that the parameters calibration in this study had reached relatively reasonable conditions on the whole. Although the model displayed an overall good prediction in crops AGBs and LAI, there were still notable bias at some sites due to non-random errors (UM and UR). This indicated that there were still uncertainties in the modelling procedure, e.g. the model mechanism or parameterization. The uncertainty of the simulated results may greatly restrict the application of a model. To effectively and reasonably apply a model, it is necessary to evaluate and analyse the main sources of uncertainty in the simulated results. The parameter-induced uncertainty analysis in this study showed that, at the site scale, the range of uncertainty brought by the changes in three parameters (SLA, PL and α) to the modelling results (95% CI) of Agro-C covered more than 90% of the observations and brought approximately 21% uncertainty to the simulated AGBs of the three major crops. © 2021, ISB.","Aboveground biomass; Agro-C model; Parameterization; Uncertainty analysis","crop; ecosystem; maize; reproducibility; uncertainty; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Reproducibility of Results; Uncertainty; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

This paper presents an assessment of the random forest (RF)-based prediction model and second-degree polynomial regression models for sugarcane yield prediction. The models are developed utilizing vegetation indices (VIs) computed from the Sentinel-2 satellite and sugarcane yield data. The sugarcane yield data were acquired from sugarcane fields around the Godavari Bio-refineries Limited (GBL) factory in Karnataka, India, during the 2017-2018 sugarcane growing season. A dataset detailing agronomic information and VIs was prepared for yield prediction. The study area comprises seven sugarcane growing talukas. The second-degree polynomial regression was used for predicting the sugarcane yield as it had the best fit for the distribution of variables. The green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) recorded the highest R2, i.e., 0.71 during November month with a coefficient of variance of 0.83, with all other indices characterized by R2 values ranging from 0.42(modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index) to 0.69 (normalized difference red edge), suggesting the GNDVI's potential for sugarcane yield prediction. Comparing the actual yield with the predicted yield, the RF prediction and second-degree polynomial regression model exhibited accuracies of 90.42% and 88%, respectively. This indicates that the models are sufficiently accurate and beneficial in decision-making for sugar mill operational planning. © 2022 by authors, all rights reserved.

It is the basic driving force of surface biological and chemical processes and the fundamental source of human energy. Photosynthesis of plants and surface drought are directly related to the DSR. In this study, based on the in-situ measured DSR in agricultural regions of China, two DSR products, i.e. the high-resolution surface solar radiation datasets over China (HRSSR) and the DSR product from China land surface data assimilation system (CLDAS), were validated. If the in-situ DSR is seriously contaminated by clouds, it will bring great uncertainties to the evaluation. In order to take the effect of cloud into account, a method for cloud screening was proposed and used in the study. Before removing the in-situ DSR which is influenced by cloud contamination, the lowest RMSEs are 143 W/m2 and 145 W/m2 for HRSSR and CLDAS, respectively; the highest RMSEs are 250 W/m2 and 201 W/m2 for HRSSR and CLDAS, respectively. After considering the cloud contamination, the lowest RMSE values decrease to 116 W/m2 and 94 W/m2 for HRSSR and CLDAS, respectively; and the highest RMSEs decrease to 198 W/m2 and 167 W/m2.

To date, their confounding effects, as well as the associated uncertainties, are not well quantified at the global scale. Here, we disentangle the separate and confounding effects of temperature and precipitation on global maize yield under 25 climate scenarios. Instead of relying on a single type of crop model, as pursued in most previous impact assessments, we utilize machine learning, statistical and process-based crop models in a novel approach that allows for reasonable inter-method comparisons and uncertainty quantifications. Through controlling precipitation, an increase in warming of 1 °C could cause a global yield loss of 6.88%, 4.86% or 5.61% according to polynomial regression, long short-term memory (LSTM) and process-based crop models, respectively. With a 10% increase in precipitation, such negative temperature effects could be mitigated by 3.98%, 1.05% or 3.10%, respectively. When temperature is fixed at the baseline level, a 10% increase in precipitation alone could lead to a global yield growth of 0.23%, 1.43% or 3.09% according to polynomial regression, LSTM and process-based crop models, respectively. Further analysis demonstrates substantial uncertainties in impact assessment across crop models, which show a larger discrepancy in predicting temperature impacts than precipitation effects. Overall, global-scale assessment is more uncertain under drier conditions than under wet conditions, while a diverse uncertainty pattern is found for the top ten maize producing countries. This study highlights the important role of climate interactions in regulating yield response to changes in a specific climate factor and emphasizes the value of using both machine learning, statistical and process crop models in a consistent manner for a more realistic estimate of uncertainty than would be provided by a single type of model. © 2022 The Author(s).

Here we describe and demonstrate multiple methods for 'calibrating' climate projections using an ensemble of AOGCM simulations in a 'perfect sibling' framework. Crucially, this type of analysis assesses the ability of each calibration methodology to produce reliable estimates of future climate, which is not possible just using historical observations. This type of approach could be more widely adopted for assessing calibration methodologies for crop modelling. The calibration methods assessed include the commonly used 'delta' (change factor) and 'nudging' (bias correction) approaches. We focus on daily maximum temperature in summer over Europe for this idealised case study, but the methods can be generalised to other variables and other regions. The calibration methods, which are relatively easy to implement given appropriate observations, produce more robust projections of future daily maximum temperatures and heat stress than using raw model output. The choice over which calibration method to use will likely depend on the situation, but change factor approaches tend to perform best in our examples. Finally, we demonstrate that the uncertainty due to the choice of calibration methodology is a significant contributor to the total uncertainty in future climate projections for impact studies. We conclude that utilising a variety of calibration methods on output from a wide range of AOGCMs is essential to produce climate data that will ensure robust and reliable crop yield projections. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Bias correction; Calibration; Climate model; Climate projections; Crop model; Delta method; Weather generator","air-sea interaction; assessment method; calibration; climate modeling; crop yield; environmental stress; numerical model; observational method; temperature effect; Europe",Article,Scopus

The primary drivers behind the shocks in agricultural productivity include strong weather-related events, transitory transportation disruptions, shipping delays, and policy shifts. This paper presents DeepFarm, an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled framework to measure and manage uncertainties while evaluating multiple cause-effect scenarios in agricultural farm production. We deploy Deep Learning (DL) models to predict the impact of crop yield during outlier events such as extreme weather events and cyber-attacks. Additionally, we use a causal inference-based approach to quantity the impact of such events affecting the critical phases of farm production.

The objective of this work was to improve the management of the water resources in a potato crop by applying deep learning algorithms to predict the irrigation prescription. Three deep learning models, such as one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-DCNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and a hybrid convolutional LSTM were reviewed and evaluated. The climatic variables of the potato crop were collected daily for three years, such as temperature, rain, water content in soil, and evapotranspiration, among others. The measured variables were provided by two meteorological stations located in the USoChicamocha Irrigation District. Deep learning models were trained and validated using Python®, calculating performance metrics. The CNN-LSTM model predicted the potato crop irrigation prescription with better precision in the training and validation dataset with MSE values less than 0,067 and RMSE values less than 0,258.

Then, we introduce a graph neural network model to learn crop suitability evaluation and finally achieve a good evaluation effect. The evaluation results of the model can not only provide a reference for expert evaluation but also judge the suitability of the variety to other test trial sites according to the data of the current one, so as to guide future breeding experiments. © 2022 Qiusi Zhang et al.",,"Crops; Graph neural networks; Neural network models; Population statistics; Artificial intelligence technologies; Crop yield; Food production; Global population; Graph neural networks; Intelligence models; Phenotypic data; Poor performance; Suitability evaluation; Urgent problems; Large dataset; agriculture; artificial intelligence; crop; procedures; technology; Agriculture; Artificial Intelligence; Crops, Agricultural; Neural Networks, Computer; Technology",Article,Scopus

While the data-driven deep learning approach has shown great capacity in predicting yield patterns, its capacity to detect and attribute the impacts of climatic extremes on yields remains unknown. In this study, we developed a deep neural network based multi-task learning framework to estimate variations of maize yield at the county level over the US Corn Belt from 2006 to 2018, with a special focus on the extreme yield loss in 2012. We found that our deep learning model hindcasted the yield variations with good accuracy for 2006-2018 (R2 = 0.81) and well reproduced the extreme yield anomalies in 2012 (R2 = 0.79). Further attribution analysis indicated that extreme heat stress was the major cause for yield loss, contributing to 72.5% of the yield loss, followed by anomalies of vapor pressure deficit (17.6%) and precipitation (10.8%). Our deep learning model was also able to estimate the accumulated impact of climatic factors on maize yield and identify that the silking phase was the most critical stage shaping the yield response to extreme climate stress in 2012.

The aim of this research was to characterize the spatial and temporal yield variability of cereals grain and grain legumes grown in 155 administrative districts in Polissya and Forest-steppezone of Ukraine in 1991–2017. The common feature of temporal changes for all administrative districts is the existence of the trend that can be described by the fourth degree polynomial. We provide agroeconomic and agrotechnological origin to the nature of the trend. The yields dynamics of grain and grain legumes is described by the absolute term, which reﬂ ects the starting conditions of soil fertility in the initial period of research and the indicators of maximum rate of yields decline in the 90s and the maximum rate of yields increase in the 2000s. The indicators of the maximum rate of reduction and the maximum rate of increase of yield can be used as markers of agroecosystem stability to external factors. It can be noted that the southern regions of Ukraine are less stable and more exposed to the destructive inﬂ uence, while the central and western regions are more stable and rapidly increase productivity under favorable conditions. This research has found that the agroecological systems of the regions of Ukraine are far from the maximum ecological capacity, and agroeconomic and agrotechnological factors are the limiting now. © 2019, Agricultural Academy, Bulgaria.

However, many of them do not reproduce the small-scale spatial variability of precipitation exhibited by the observed meteorological data, which is an important factor for predicting hydrologic response to climatic forcing. In this study a new downscaling technique (Bias-Correction and Stochastic Analog method; BCSA) was developed to produce stochastic realizations of bias-corrected daily GCM precipitation fields that preserve both the spatial autocorrelation structure of observed daily precipitation sequences and the observed temporal frequency distribution of daily rainfall over space. We used the BCSA method to downscale 4 different daily GCM precipitation predictions from 1961 to 1999 over the state of Florida, and compared the skill of the method to results obtained with the commonly used bias-correction and spatial disaggregation (BCSD) approach, a modified version of BCSD which reverses the order of spatial disaggregation and bias-correction (SDBC), and the bias-correction and constructed analog (BCCA) method. Spatial and temporal statistics, transition probabilities, wet/dry spell lengths, spatial correlation indices, and variograms for wet (June through September) and dry (October through May) seasons were calculated for each method. Results showed that (1) BCCA underestimated mean daily precipitation for both wet and dry seasons while the BCSD, SDBC and BCSA methods accurately reproduced these characteristics, (2) the BCSD and BCCA methods underestimated temporal variability of daily precipitation and thus did not reproduce daily precipitation standard deviations, transition probabilities or wet/dry spell lengths as well as the SDBC and BCSA methods, and (3) the BCSD, BCCA and SDBC methods underestimated spatial variability in daily precipitation resulting in underprediction of spatial variance and overprediction of spatial correlation, whereas the new stochastic technique (BCSA) replicated observed spatial statistics for both the wet and dry seasons. This study underscores the need to carefully select a downscaling method that reproduces all precipitation characteristics important for the hydrologic system under consideration if local hydrologic impacts of climate variability and change are going to be reasonably predicted. For low-relief, rainfall-dominated watersheds, where reproducing small-scale spatiotemporal precipitation variability is important, the BCSA method is recommended for use over the BCSD, BCCA, or SDBC methods. © Author(s) 2013.

First, we corrected the rainfall frequency bias of the climate model by truncating its daily rainfall cumulative distribution into the station's distribution based on a prescribed observed wet-day threshold. Then, we corrected the climate model rainfall intensity bias by mapping its truncated rainfall distribution into the station's truncated distribution. Further improvements were made to the bias corrected GCM rainfall by linking it with a stochastic disaggregation scheme to correct the time structure problem inherent with daily GCM rainfall. Results of the simple and hybridized GCM downscaled precipitation variables (total, probability of occurrence, intensity and dry spell length) were linked with a crop model for a more objective evaluation of their performance using a non-linear measure based on mutual information based on entropy.

This study uses Pucheng County, Fujian Province, a demonstration county of China Good Grains and Oils, as the research area. Using actual rice yield sample data and environment data, a yield simulation model based on random forest regression is constructed to realize a fine-scale simulation of rice yield and its spatial distribution pattern in Pucheng County. On this basis, we construct a method system to identify spatial combination patterns between rice yields and fine-scale multidimensional environmental planting suitability using rice yield data and environmental planting suitability evaluation data. We categorize the areas into four combination model areas to analyze the spatial correlation model of planting suitability, multidimensional environment, and yield: higher-yield and higher-suitability cluster–comprehensive environmental-advantage areas, high-yield and high-suitability cluster–soil condition-limited areas, moderate-yield and moderate-suitability cluster–irrigation and drainage condition-limited areas, and low-yield and low-suitability cluster–site condition-limited areas. The following results are found. (1) The rice yield simulation model, which is based on random forest regression, considers the various complex relationships between yield and natural as well as human factors to realize the refined simulation of rice yields at a county scale. (2) The county rice yield has a strong positive spatial correlation, and the spatial clustering characteristics are obvious; these relationships can provide a basis for effectively imple-menting intensive rice planting in Pucheng County. (3) We construct a spatial combination pattern recognition method based on rice yield and environmental planting suitability. We can use this method to effectively identify the spatial relationship between yield and planting suitability as well as the shortcomings and advantages of different regions in terms of the climate, soil, irrigation, site, mechanical farming, and similar factors. On this basis, we can provide regional rice planting guidance for Pucheng County.

The overarching approach is to develop and adopt a systems-agronomy framework relevant to any wheat production system. It first establishes the scale of current yield gaps, identifies defensible benchmarks, and takes a holistic approach to understand and overcome exploitable yield gaps to complement genetic increases in potential yield. New opportunities to increase productivity will be sought by exploiting future Genotype × Environment × Management synergies in different wheat systems. To identify research gaps and opportunities for collaboration among different wheat producing regions, the EWG compiled a comprehensive database of currently funded wheat agronomy research (n = 782) in countries representing a large proportion of the wheat grown in the world. The yield gap analysis and research database positions the EWG to influence priorities for wheat agronomy research in member countries that would facilitate collaborations, minimize duplication, and maximize the global impact on wheat production systems.

Remote sensing-based platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) show promise to predict different traits including grain yield. Attention is currently being devoted to machine learning methods in order to extract the most meaningful information from the massive amounts of data generated by UAV images. These methods have shown a promising capability to come up with nonlinearity and explore patterns beyond the human ability. This study investigates the application of two different machine learning based regressor methods to predict wheat grain yield using extracted vegetation indices from UAV images. The goal of the study was to investigate the strength of Support Vector Regression (SVR) in combination with Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) for grain yield prediction and compare the results with LASSO regressor with an internal feature selector. Models were tested on grain yield data from 600 plots of spring wheat planted in South-Eastern Norway in 2018. Five spectral bands along with three different vegetation indices; the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) were extracted from multispectral images at three dates between heading and maturity of the plants. These features for each field trial plot at each date were used as input data for the SVR model. The best model hyperparameters were estimated using grid search. Based on feature selection results from both methods, NDVI showed the highest prediction ability for grain yield at all dates and its explanatory power increased toward maturity, while adding MTCI and EVI at earlier stages of grain filling improved model performance. Combined models based on all indices and dates explained up to 90% of the variation in grain yield on the test set. Inclusion of individual bands added collinearity to the models and did not improve the predictions. Although both regression methods showed a good capability for grain yield prediction, LASSO regressor proved to be more affordable and economical in terms of time. © 2021 The Author(s)","LASSO; Machine learning; SFS (Sequential Forward Selection); Support Vector Regression (SVR); Wheat phenotyping; Yield","Antennas; Data mining; Forecasting; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Aerial vehicle; Grain yield; LASSO; Machine-learning; Sequential forward selection; Support vector regression; Wheat phenotyping; Yield; Yield prediction; Grain (agricultural product); crop yield; machine learning; MERIS; NDVI; plant breeding; regression analysis; satellite imagery; spring (hydrology); spring (season); support structure; support vector machine; wheat; Norway",Article,Scopus

The bias-correction is a quantile mapping of empirical cumulative frequency distributions. Corrections are applied at a daily time step to five variables: rainfall, potential evaporation (PE), solar radiation, maximum temperature and minimum temperature. Corrections are calculated independently for each season. We show that quantile mapping of empirical distributions can be highly effective in correcting biases in RCM outputs. Cross-validation shows biases are effectively reduced across the range of cumulative frequency distributions, with few exceptions. The bias-correction is not as effective at correcting biases for values at or near zero (e.g. in rainfall simulations), although even here the bias-correction improves biases evident in the uncorrected simulations. In addition, the bias-correction improves frequency characteristics of variables such as the number of rain days. We use a detrending technique to apply the bias-correction to 140-year time series of RCM variables. We show that the bias-correction effectively preserves long-term changes (e.g. to the mean and variance) to variables projected by the uncorrected RCM simulations. Correlations between key variables are also largely preserved, thus the bias-corrected outputs reflect the dynamics of the underlying RCM. However, the bias-corrected simulations still exhibit some of the deficiencies of the RCM simulations, e.g. the tendency to underestimate the magnitude and duration of large, multi-day rain events, and the tendency to underestimate the duration of dry spells.

The current study was planned for yield estimation of spring maize using remote sensing and crop modeling. In crop modeling, the CERES-Maize model was calibrated and evaluated with the field experiment data and after calibration and evaluation, this model was used to forecast maize yield. A Field survey of 64 farm was also conducted in Faisalabad to collect data on initial field conditions and crop management data. These data were used to forecast maize yield using crop model at farmers’ field. While in remote sensing, peak season Landsat 8 images were classified for landcover classification using machine learning algorithm. After classification, time series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) of the surveyed 64 farms were calculated. Principle component analysis were run to correlate the indicators with maize yield. The selected LSTs and NDVIs were used to develop yield forecasting equations using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Calibrated and evaluated results of CERES-Maize showed the mean absolute % error (MAPE) of 0.35–6.71% for all recorded variables. In remote sensing all machine learning algorithms showed the accuracy greater the 90%, however support vector machine (SVM-radial basis) showed the higher accuracy of 97%, that was used for classification of maize area. The accuracy of area estimated through SVM-radial basis was 91%, when validated with crop reporting service.

In the horticultural industry, the environmental conditions in commercial greenhouses directly impact the quality of productions. Predicting the Net Photosynthesis (Pn) of plants based on the environmental parameters can help growers optimize the climate in greenhouse systems, thereby ensuring the quality of production. Meanwhile, due to the greenhouse climate can be controlled according to the prediction results, excess energy consumption can be avoided, so the production cost can be reduced. However, since the photosynthesis reaction is a highly nonlinear biochemical process, it is difficult for traditional algorithms to describe the hidden effects of individual elements. In previous related works, polynomial fitting was utilized for modeling the relation between Pn and environmental elements. In this paper, a Deep Learning (DL) method is explored to predict the Pn based on three inputs: light level, CO2 concentration and temperature. An exponential decay learning rate is applied in the training process to ensure convergence performance while increasing the convergence speed. Then, the performance of various Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures is experimented and compared within this modeling problem. Finally, through a comprehensive analysis of the accuracy of individual architecture, a particular architecture is determined to solve this problem. According to the test results, the selected DNN can successfully predict the Pn based on the three environmental elements with high accuracy. © 2021 IEEE.","Commercial greenhouse; Deep Learning (DL); Deep Neural Network (DNN); Modeling; Net photosynthesis (Pn)","Biochemistry; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Greenhouses; Network architecture; Photosynthesis; Biochemical process; Commercial greenhouse; Deep learning; Deep neural network; Environmental factors; Horticultural industry; Modeling; Net photosynthesis; Plant growth; Quality of production; Deep neural networks",Conference Paper,Scopus

This study evaluated the use and relative importance of readily available weather data to develop yield estimation models for maize and soybean in the US central Corn Belt. Total rainfall (Rain), average air temperature (Tavg), and the difference between maximum and minimum air temperature (Tdiff) at weekly, biweekly, and monthly timescales from May to August were used to estimate county-level maize and soybean grain yields for Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Minnesota. Step-wise multiple linear regression (MLR), general additive (GAM), and support vector machine (SVM) models were trained with Rain, Tavg, and with/without Tdiff. For the total study area and at individual state level, SVM outperformed other models at all temporal levels for both maize and soybean. For maize, Tavg and Tdiff during July and August, and Rain during June and July, were relatively more important whereas for soybean, Tavg in June and Tdiff and Rain during August were more important. The SVM model with weekly Rain and Tavg estimated the overall maize yield with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 591 kg ha−1 (4.9% nRMSE) and soybean yield with a RMSE of 205 kg ha−1 (5.5% nRMSE). Inclusion of Tdiff in the model considerably improved yield estimation for both crops; however, the magnitude of improvement varied with the model and temporal level of weather data.

Each downscaled climate input dataset was then used in an integrated hydrologic model to examine differences in ability to simulate retrospective streamflow characteristics. Results showed the BCSD_daily method consistently underestimated mean streamflow because the highly spatially correlated small precipitation events produced by this method resulted in overestimation of evapotranspiration. Highly spatially correlated large precipitation events produced by the SDBC method resulted in overestimation of the standard deviation of wet season daily streamflow and the magnitude/frequency of high streamflow events. BCSA showed better performance than the other methods in reproducing spatiotemporal statistics of daily precipitation and streamflow.

Broadly, Winsorization is a versatile technique for accounting for outliers in data. However, different probabilistic machine learning techniques have different levels of efficiency when used on outlier-prone data, with or without Winsorization.

Thus, the objectives of this study were: 1) to evaluate the influence of climatic elements on cotton yield in Brazil, 2) to predict cotton yield using machine learning algorithms based on climatic elements, 3) to calibrate and test machine learning models to forecast cotton yield based on climate data, and 4) to interpolate the estimated cotton yield of the most accurate model. The cotton yield forecast as a function of climatic elements was performed using machine learning algorithms with four parameters adjusted by ordinary least squares. The models show that cotton yield has a sigmoid trend due to the accumulation of P, PET, STO, and EXC during the cycle. It is possible to forecast cotton yield for the main producing regions of Brazil using Machine learning algorithms. Extra-trees regressor models performed better in forecasting cotton yield using climatic data from planting to flowering.

In the first approach, a previously developed multiple linear regression model (VI-MLR) based on vegetation indices (EVI, NMDI) was used. In the second approach, the reflectance data of all Sentinel-2 bands for several dates during the growth periods were used as input parameters in three machine learning model algorithms, i.e., random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and boosting regressions (BR). Modeling results were examined against yield data collected by a combine harvester equipped with a yield mapping system. VI-MLR showed a moderate performance with R2 = 0.532 and RMSE = 847 kg ha−1. All machine learning approaches enhanced model accuracy when all images during the growing periods were used, especially RF and KNN (R2 &gt; 0.91, RMSE &lt; 360 kg ha−1). Additionally, RF and KNN accuracy remained high (R2 &gt; 0.87, RMSE &lt; 455 kg ha−1) when images from the start of the growing period until March, i.e., three months before harvest, were used, indicating the high suitability of machine learning on Sentinel-2 data for early yield prediction of durum wheat, information considered essential for precision agriculture applications. © 2022 by the authors.","durum wheat; machine learning; Sentinel-2; vegetation indices; yield modeling","Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Image enhancement; Linear regression; Nearest neighbor search; Random forests; Vegetation; Durum wheats; Growing period; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Modeling approach; Random forests; Sentinel-2; Vegetation index; Wheat yield; Yield models; Machine learning",Article,Scopus

The variations for the vegetation coverage changes are identified utilizing five meteorological elements (temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, sunshine hour, and ground temperature) in the SVM model. The performance of the SVM model is also evaluated on simulating vegetation coverage anomaly change by comparing with statistical model multiple linear regression (MLR) and partial least squares (PLS)-based models. The symbol agreement rates (SAR) of simulations produced by MLR, PLS, and SVM models are 55%, 57%, and 66%, respectively. The SVM model shows obviously better performance than PLS and MLR models in simulating meteorological elements-related interannual variation of vegetation coverage in North China. Therefore, the introduction of the intelligent analysis method in term of SVM in model development has certain advantages in studying the internal impact of meteorological elements on regional vegetation coverage.

The first stage of this research includes mapping crop patterns using medium-resolution satellite sensor data recorded by LANDSAT and Sentinel-2 over Lower Seyhan Plain (LSP) located at the Eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey between 2010 and 2016. In the second stage, crop productivity of three major crops namely winter wheat, corn, and cotton derived from image classification was modelled spatially and temporally through the CropSyst model. Additionally, the model was also revealed irrigation return flow from the drainage and the related N load. In the last stage, conservation principles and policies were recommended to diminish the detrimental impacts of agricultural fertilizer loads to the biotopes through drainage channels. The model results indicated that crop productivity of wheat, cotton, first crop corn, and second crop corn 21%, 28%, 47%, and 4% of total production in LSP, respectively. The average annual crop production of the wetlands region was 161,548 tons and equal to 16,5% of the total plain area. The largest amount of drainage water comes from cotton and second crop corn cultivation; the smallest amount comes from wheat and first crop corn cultivation. The largest amount of nitrogen remaining within the system was from second-crop corn, whereas, the smallest amount from wheat. It can be concluded that nitrogen fertilizer should be applied according to the soil characteristics, reduced by 5% for wheat, 10% for first crop corn, and 50% for second crop corn. As a result of this reduction fertilizer uptake efficiency will increase and N load to the wetlands will decrease. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Crop yield; CropSyst; Remote sensing; Wetlands","Artificial intelligence; Cotton; Cultivation; Decision support systems; Nitrogen fertilizers; Productivity; Remote sensing; Wetlands; Agricultural landscapes; Agricultural productivity; Conservation Principles; Crop yield; CropSyst; Eastern Mediterranean; Irrigation return flows; Satellite sensor data; Crops; agricultural land; agricultural modeling; crop plant; crop production; crop yield; decision support system; drainage water; fertilizer application; image classification; irrigation; nitrogen; optimization; remote sensing; satellite sensor; wetland; Turkey; Gossypium hirsutum; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The mechanisms of action are complex and interwoven, making it difficult to identify relevant management and adaptation options. The present study uses random forests to investigate such highly non-linear systems for predicting yield anomalies in winter wheat at district levels in Germany. In order to take into account sub-seasonality, monthly features are used that explicitly take soil moisture into account in addition to extreme meteorological events. Clustering is used to show spatially different damage potentials, such as a higher susceptibility to drought damage from May to July in eastern Germany compared to the rest of the country. In addition, relevant heat effects are not detected if the clusters are not sufficiently defined. The variable with the highest importance is soil moisture in March, where higher soil moisture has a detrimental effect on crop yields. In general, soil moisture explains more yield variations than the meteorological variables. The approach has proven to be suitable for explaining historical extreme yield anomalies for years with exceptionally high losses (2003, 2018) and gains (2014) and the spatial distribution of these anomalies. The highest test R-squared (R2) is about 0.68. Furthermore, the sensitivity of yield variations to soil moisture and extreme meteorological conditions, as shown by the visualization of average marginal effects, contributes to the promotion of targeted decision support systems. © 2021 Michael Peichl et al.",,"Crops; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Linear systems; Machine learning; Sensitivity analysis; Agricultural productions; Clusterings; Machine learning methods; Mechanism of action; Non linear system; Non-linear damages; Seasonality; Spectra's; Winter wheat; Winter wheat yields; Soil moisture; assessment method; crop yield; machine learning; soil moisture; soil water; wheat; Germany",Article,Scopus

It is critical to complete this activity with high precision at the regional and national levels to facilitate speedy decision-making. Tea is a big cash crop that contributes significantly to economic development, with a market of USD 200 billion in 2020 that is expected to reach over USD 318 billion by 2025. As a developing country, Bangladesh can be a greater part of this industry and increase its exports through its tea yield and production with favorable climatic features and land quality. Regrettably, the tea yield in Bangladesh has not increased significantly since 2008 like many other countries, despite having suitable climatic and land conditions, which is why quantifying the yield is imperative. This study developed a novel spatiotemporal hybrid DRS-RF model with a dragonfly optimization (DR) algorithm and support vector regression (S) as a feature selection approach. This study used satellite-derived hydro-meteorological variables between 1981 and 2020 from twenty stations across Bangladesh to address the spatiotemporal dependency of the predictor variables for the tea yield (Y). The results illustrated that the proposed DRS-RF hybrid model improved tea yield forecasting over other standalone machine learning approaches, with the least relative error value (11%).

The objective of this study is to predict the regional sugarcane crop yield for the Uttar Pradesh (UP) province using analysis-ready moderate-resolution satellite images. The four machine learning regression algorithms, namely support vector regression (SVR), gradient boosting regression (GBR), eXtreme gradient boosting regression (XGB), and random forest regression (RF), were used to train and predict the district-wise sugarcane yield in UP. Standard MODIS data products such as leaf area index (LAI), fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), evapotranspiration (ET), potential evapotranspiration (PET), latent heat flux (LE), and gross primary product (GPP) were obtained for a period of eighteen years, and their monthly average was extracted and used as features in the model. The models were trained using eighty percent of the observations with the annual district-wise sugarcane yield as the response variable. Iterative feature selection was done based on correlation factor and feature importance to reduce the dimensionality of the data from around a hundred features to twenty-four. The R2 metric was used as the evaluation metric to choose the best predictive model. The study showed results with moderate accuracy and was used to estimate the sugarcane crop yield for the year 2019. The highest R2 of 0.66 and an RMSE value of 7.15 t/ha were obtained using the GBR algorithm by using seven variables and 24 features. The model was very closely followed by the XGB model with an R2 of 0.65 and an RMSE value of 7.20 t/ha. The FPAR-based features contributed the most to the model followed by the LAI and NDVI features. The simple methodology used in the study uses ready-to-use satellite products and has operationalization potential. The model can be improved by incorporating more satellite-derived parameters and an accurate crop mask to avoid spectral interference from other cropland. © 2022, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","FPAR; Gradient boosting; MODIS; Random forest; Regional; Sugarcane; XGBoost; Yield prediction","crop; evapotranspiration; latent heat flux; machine learning; photosynthetically active radiation; vegetation index; India; Uttar Pradesh",Article,Scopus

Despite the clarity of influential factors and deriving forces, estimation of the volumetric irrigation demand using biophysical models is prohibitively difficult. Data-driven models have proven their ability to predict geophysical and hydrological phenomena with only a handful of influential input variables; however, the lack of reliable input data in most agricultural regions of the world hinders the effectiveness of these approaches. Attempting to estimate the irrigation water demand, we first analyze the correlation of potential influencing variables with irrigation water. We develop machine learning models to predict California’s annual, county-level irrigation water demand based on the statistical analysis findings over an 18-year time span. Input variables are different combinations of deriving meteorological forces, geographical characteristics, cropped area, and crop category. After testing various regression machine learning approaches, the result shows that Gaussian process regression produces the best results. Our findings suggest that irrigated cropped area, air temperature, and vapor pressure deficit are the most significant variables in predicting irrigation water demand. This research also shows that Gaussian process regression can predict irrigation water demand with high accuracy (R2 higher than 0.97 and RMSE as low as 0.06 km3) with different input variable combinations. An accurate estimation of irrigation water use of various crop categories and areas can assist decision-making processes and improve water management strategies. The proposed model can help water policy makers evaluate climatological and agricultural scenarios and hence be used as a decision support tool for agricultural water management at a regional scale. © 2022 by the authors.

First, the proposed DL model is trained using station-based data and satellite images as inputs mapped to the strawberry yield as output. The weights obtained from this learning are transferred to the raspberry yield forecasting model since raspberry and strawberry yields are similar and are both planted in California.

Recent studies have used different machine learning techniques to develop such yield forecast systems for single crops at regional scales. However, no study has used multiple sources of environmental predictors (climate, soil, and vegetation) to forecast yields for three major crops in China. In this study, we adopted 7-year observed crop yield data (2013–2019) for three major grain crops (wheat, maize, and rice) across China, and three major data sets including climate, vegetation indices, and soil properties were used to develop a dynamic yield forecasting system based on the random forest (RF) model. The RF model showed good performance for estimating yields of all three crops with correlation coefficient (r) higher than 0.75 and normalized root means square errors (nRMSE) lower than 18.0%. Our results also showed that crop yields can be satisfactorily forecasted at one to three months prior to harvest. The optimum lead time for yield forecasting depended on crop types. In addition, we found the major predictors influencing crop yield varied between crops. In general, solar radiation and vegetation indices (especially during jointing to milk development stages) were identified as the main predictor for winter wheat; vegetation indices (throughout the growing season) and drought (especially during emergence to tasseling stages) were the most important predictors for spring maize; soil moisture (throughout the growing season) was the dominant predictor for summer maize, late rice, and mid rice; precipitation (especially during booting to heading stages) was the main predictor for early rice. Our study provides insights into practical crop yield forecasting and the understanding of yield response to environmental conditions at a large scale across China. The methods undertaken in this research can be easily implemented in other countries with available information on climate, soil, and vegetation conditions. © 2021","Climate extremes; Crop yield forecast; Lead time; Random forest; Remote sensing; Variable importance","agricultural policy; crop yield; environmental conditions; forecasting method; harvesting; investment; machine learning; rice; yield response; China",Article,Scopus

Many studies have examined spatial heterogeneity in the regression model, but only limited research has attempted to account for both spatial autocorrelation and temporal variation. In this article, we develop a novel spatiotemporally varying coefficient (STVC) model to understand non-stationary relationships between crop yields and meteorological variables. We compare the proposed model with variant models specialized for time or spatial, namely spatial varying coefficient (SVC) model and temporal varying coefficient (TVC) model. This study was conducted using the county-level corn yield and meteorological data, including seasonal Growing Degree Days (GDD), Killing Degree Days (KDD), Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD), and precipitation (PCPN), from 1981 to 2018 in three Corn Belt states, including Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa. Allowing model coefficients varying in both temporal and spatial dimensions gives the best performance of STVC in simulating the corn yield responses toward various meteorological conditions. The STVC reduced the root-mean-square error to 10.64 Bu/Ac (0.72 Mg/ha) from 15.68 Bu/Ac (1.06 Mg/ha) for TVC and 16.48 Bu/Ac (1.11 Mg/ha) for SVC. Meanwhile, the STVC resulted in a higher R2 of 0.81 compared to 0.56 for SVC and 0.64 for TVC. The STVC showed better performance in handling spatial dependence of corn production, which tends to cluster estimation residuals when counties are close, with the lowest Moran's I of 0.10. Considering the spatiotemporal non-stationarity, the proposed model significantly improves the power of the meteorological data in explaining the variations of corn yields. © 2021","Bayesian hierarchical model; Crop yields; Meteorology; Spatiotemporal analysis; Spatiotemporally varying coefficient","agricultural modeling; crop yield; maize; meteorology; spatiotemporal analysis; United States",Article,Scopus

We propose here an alternate approach based on deep learning algorithms for forecasting strawberry yields and prices in Santa Barbara county, California. Building the proposed forecasting model comprises three stages: first, the station-based ensemble model (ATT-CNN-LSTM-SeriesNet_Ens) with its compound deep learning components, SeriesNet with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Convolutional Neural Network LSTM with Attention layer (AttCNN-LSTM), are trained and tested using the station-based soil temperature and moisture data of Santa Barbara as input and the corresponding strawberry yields or prices as output. Secondly, the remote sensing ensemble model (SIM_CNN-LSTM_Ens), which is an ensemble model of Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM) models, is trained and tested using satellite images of the same county as input mapped to the same yields and prices as output.

Finally, the forecasts of these two models are ensembled to have a final forecasted value for yields and prices by introducing a voting ensemble.

Accurate and timely estimation of maize yield is of great significance to crop management and food security. Commonly applied vegetation indexes (VIs) are mainly used in crop yield estimation as they can reflect the greenness of vegetation. However, the environmental pressures of crop growth and development are difficult to monitor and evaluate. Indexes for water content, pigment content, nutrient elements and biomass have been developed to indirectly explain the influencing factors of yield, with extant studies mainly assessing VIs, climate and water content factors. Only a few studies have attempted to systematically evaluate the sensitivity of these indexes. The sensitivity of the spectral indexes, combined indexes and climate factors and the effect of temporal aggregation data need to be evaluated. Thus, this study proposes a novel yield evaluation method for integrating multiple spectral indexes and temporal aggregation data. In particular, spectral indexes were calculated by integrating publicly available data (remote sensing images and climate data) from the Google Earth Engine platform, and county-level maize yields in China from 2015 to 2019 were estimated using a random forest model. Results showed that the normalized moisture difference index (NMDI) is the index most sensitive to yield estimation. Furthermore, the potential of adopting the combined indexes, especially NMDI_NDNI, was verified. Compared with the whole-growth period data and the eight-day time series, the vegetative growth period and the reproductive growth period data were more sensitive to yield estimation. The maize yield in China can be estimated by integrating multiple spectral indexes into the indexes for the vegetative and reproductive growth periods. The obtained R2 of maize yield estimation reached 0.8. This study can provide feature knowledge and references for index assessments for yield estimation research. © 2023 by the authors.","combined index; maize yield; multiple spectral indexes; temporal aggregation; yield estimation","Climate models; Crops; Data integration; Earth (planet); Food supply; Forestry; Remote sensing; %moisture; Combined indices; Growth period; Maize yield; Multiple spectral index; Reproductive growth; Spectral indices; Temporal aggregation; Vegetation index; Yield estimation; Vegetation",Article,Scopus

Improving our understanding of their impacts on crop yields is crucial to enhance the resilience of the global food system. This study analyses, to our knowledge for the first time, the impacts of climate extremes on yield anomalies of maize, soybeans, rice and spring wheat at the global scale using sub-national yield data and applying a machine-learning algorithm. We find that growing season climate factors - including mean climate as well as climate extremes - explain 20%-49% of the variance of yield anomalies (the range describes the differences between crop types), with 18%-43% of the explained variance attributable to climate extremes, depending on crop type. Temperature-related extremes show a stronger association with yield anomalies than precipitation-related factors, while irrigation partly mitigates negative effects of high temperature extremes. We developed a composite indicator to identify hotspot regions that are critical for global production and particularly susceptible to the effects of climate extremes. These regions include North America for maize, spring wheat and soy production, Asia in the case of maize and rice production as well as Europe for spring wheat production.

Both estimation and forecasting are based on covariates. However, whereas estimation enables greater agility in current decision making, forecasting can reveal different strategies for the future. The use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has brought improvements in accuracy to the estimation and forecasting of agricultural yield for various crops around the world. These models are part of a set of machine-learning models, becoming an important ally not only to producers, companies, cooperatives, and to government institutions for decisions making and strategic decisions at all levels of the agricultural system. The main constraints of agricultural production are climatic conditions and soil water availability during crop cycles. We propose the use of ANNs for soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] yield estimation and forecasting 2 mo before harvesting in the region of MATOPIBA, the largest and the last agricultural frontier of Brazil. This tropical agricultural area has about 73,173,485 hectares, corresponding to approximately 1.3 times the area of France. The input features for ANN were the monthly climatic conditions of air temperature, precipitation, and global radiation, as well as components of the water balance such as crop evapotranspiration, soil water storage, actual evapotranspiration, water deficiency, and surpluses during the cultivation cycle. The evaluation of ANN for yield estimation had R2 =.88 and RMSE = 167.85 kg ha–1, while the ANN for forecasting obtained R2 =.86 and RMSE = 185.85 kg ha–1. © 2021 The Authors.

The weighted aggregation performed by the convolutional operator also helps to smoothen the noisy data collected at the given locations. However, current convolutional methods are primarily designed to learn the spatial dependencies of the input (predictor) variables only. The recent success in applying multi-task learning to various geospatial prediction problems shows that the model parameters themselves may also be spatially related. This suggests the possibility of employing convolutional methods to learn the spatial dependencies among the model parameters at different locations, especially in situations where there are limited training data available to fit accurate local models. In this paper, we investigate three different ways to incorporate convolutions into geospatial prediction models—convolutions on the predictors, model parameters, or a hybrid of both.

Decision Support Systems (DSS) are useful tools for such planning. Consequently, it is essential that land decision support systems are no longer confined to research centers but also adopted by the production sector and public administration. The MicroLEIS DSS developed by the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) is a user-friendly and suitable user-useful tool for local government officials, consultants and other land use decision makers. The evaluation process entails dynamic interactions between soil, climate and management variables. It includes 12 modules that allow for the assessment of soil capability and vulnerability, and the consequences of future global change scenarios. Here, we illustrate the application of MicroLEIS for land use planning in Asia where this kind of assessment is rather scarce. The decision support system was applied for Ahar, located in East Azarbaijan (Iran). Six agro-ecological land evaluation models, constituents of MicroLEIS DSS software, were selected for land evaluation at the regional level. We identified areas suitable for agricultural production, species suitable for restoring areas marginal for crop production, and suitable crop combinations, and performed a soil capability classification in the soil units. Results obtained from each evaluation model are presented and discussed in this chapter. In summary, MicroLEIS technology proved useful in this semi-arid region of Asia for sustainable agro-ecological planning.

Though existing deep learning-based techniques have been applied in smart agriculture for crop cultivation, crop disease detection, weed removal, and yield production, still it is difficult to find the semantics between extracted information due to unswerving effects of weather, soil, pest, and fertilizer data. This paper consists of two parts. An initial phase, which proposes a data preprocessing technique for removal of ambiguity in input corpora, and the second phase proposes a novel deep learning-based long short-term memory with rectification in Adam optimizer and multilayer perceptron to find agricultural-based named entity recognition, events, and relations between them. The proposed algorithm has been trained and tested on four input corpora i.e., agriculture, weather, soil, and pest & fertilizers.

Along with industries and businesses, farming is also going digital and the data-driven agri-technology and precision farming are the new scientific approaches toward sustainable agriculture to enhance productivity and minimizing environmental bearings. Driven by analytics of historical data, satellite data and real-time sensor inputs, machine learning (ML) plays a pivotal role in developing models for sustainable digital agriculture. This chapter aims at explaining different applications, approaches and algorithms of ML being used in agriculture production system. This chapter covers how ML approaches add sustainability to broad categories of agriculture management that includes managing the soil, water and crop. Effectively and efficiently managing the soil and water in agricultural entails substantial efforts and is very significant for achieving agronomical, hydrological and climatological equilibrium. The evolving artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics driven agriculture systems can apply different algorithms on data from sensors and can help a lot in detecting diseases, identifying weeds, predicting quality of crop and yield along with water management, nutrition management, soil management and so on. It can provide recommendations, remedies and great insights for timely decision and action. The chapter also discusses the most important and popular ML model for different activities of agriculture management and how it helps in sustain-ability.

Instead of pursuing the maximum yield, most turfgrass managers use nitrogen (N) to maintain a sub-maximal growth rate. Few tools or soil tests exist to help managers guide N fertilizer decisions. Turf growth prediction models have the potential to be useful, but the currently existing turf growth prediction model only takes temperature into account, limiting its accuracy. This study developed machine-learning-based turf growth models using the random forest (RF) algorithm to estimate short-term turfgrass clipping yield. To build the RF model, a large set of variables were extracted as predictors including the 7-day weather, traffic intensity, soil moisture content, N fertilization rate, and the normalized difference red edge (NDRE) vegetation index. In this study, the data were collected from two putting greens where the turfgrass received 0 to 1,800 round/week traffic rates, various irrigation rates to maintain the soil moisture content between 9 and 29%, and N fertilization rates of 0 to 17.5 kg ha–1 applied biweekly. The RF model agreed with the actual clipping yield collected from the experimental results. The temperature and relative humidity were the most important weather factors. Including NDRE improved the prediction accuracy of the model. The highest coefficient of determination (R2) of the RF model was 0.64 for the training dataset and was 0.47 for the testing data set upon the evaluation of the model. This represented a large improvement over the existing growth prediction model (R2 = 0.01). However, the machine-learning models created were not able to accurately predict the clipping production at other locations. Individual golf courses can create customized growth prediction models using clipping volume to eliminate the deviation caused by temporal and spatial variability. Overall, this study demonstrated the feasibility of creating machine-learning-based yield prediction models that may be able to guide N fertilization decisions on golf course putting greens and presumably other turfgrass areas. © Copyright © 2021 Zhou and Soldat.","machine learning; nitrogen management; random forest; turfgrass; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

Rain-fed grain production in Australia is highly volatile and producers and industry are progressively confronted with projected uncertainties due to climate variability and change, input costs and market prices. Thus, having advance knowledge of the likely impact of the coming season's climate on crop yield and production is critical for decisions across the supply chain. Here we explore and analyse the lead time and skill of a wheat yield forecasting system using a biophysical crop yield simulation model connected to either a statistical ENSO-analogue climate forecasting system or a dynamic general circulation model (GCM) derived climate forecasting system. The comparative skill was investigated for 16 wheat producing districts (shires) of the broad Australian winter cropping region, each containing 9–35 irregularly-spaced simulation points associated with climate stations. Both the ENSO-analogue and GCM-derived systems produced reliable wheat yield forecasts with the GCM-based approach having general improved skill, and particularly during the early months of the season (March to May) before sowing. The shift in the forecast yield distributions relative to the climatology-based yield distribution were dependent on location and time in the season, with the GCM-derived forecast shifts more widespread and earlier in the season. Overall, the GCM-based climate/crop forecasting system showed a significant improvement in lead time (greater than two months before the normal planting time of wheat), across the Australian wheat belt. This result demonstrates an avenue for improved efficacy in future commodity forecasting frameworks via likely enhanced relevance and utility to industry associated with the use of GCM-derived approaches. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Forecast lead time; Forecast reliability; Forecast skill; Probabilistic forecast; Seasonal climate forecast; Wheat yield forecast","commodity; comparative study; crop yield; cropping practice; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; forecasting method; general circulation model; probability; reliability analysis; seasonal variation; wheat; Australia",Article,Scopus

The watershed has been identified as ""impaired waters"" under Section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act due to high levels of sediment and total phosphorus. This excess is then transported to the Gulf of Mexico via the Yazoo River, further damaging the nation's water resources. The specific objectives of this study were to assess the impact of corn (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr., and rice (Oryza sativa, L.) crop-rotations (corn after soybean, soybean after rice, continuous soybean) and tillage practices (conventional, conservation, no-till) on crop yields and sediment yield using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The SWAT model was calibrated from January 2001 to December 2005 and validated from January 2006 to September 2010 for monthly stream flow with good to very good performance [coefficient of determination (R2) values from 0.68 to 0.83 and Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency index (NSE) values from 0.51 to 0.63] using stream flow data from three spatially distributed USGS gage stations within the BSRW. The SWAT model was further calibrated for corn and soybean yields from research fields at Stoneville and validated using research fields at the Clarksdale experiment stations with fair to excellent statistics (R2 values from 0.43 to 0.59 and NSE values from 0.34 to 0.96). The SWAT model simulation results suggested that corn yields were greater in the corn after soybean rotation under conventional tillage (mean=9.88Mgha-1) than no-tillage (mean=8.81Mgha-1) practices. However, tillage practices had no effects on soybean yield for the corn after soybean rotation. Soybean yields under conventional tillage practice indicated greater yields (mean=3.01Mgha-1) for the soybean after rice rotation than for soybean after corn. Continuous soybean under conventional tillage had the lowest simulated crop yield (mean=2.07Mg ha-1) and the greatest sediment yield (5.2Mg ha-1) in this study. The cumulative (1981-2009) sediment yield at the end of the simulation period (2009) indicated a maximum difference of about 8Mgha-1 between no-till and conventional tillage practices, with no-till contributing the lowest sediment yield. The cumulative difference of the sediment yield between no-till and conservation till was about 2Mgha-1. The results of this study will help to better understand the impact of management practices on watershed crop management and water quality improvement within the BSRW.

However, the productivity of most smallholder farms around the world is still poorly estimated due to absence of technologies and field-scale data, especially for the largest smallholders across China. Here, we integrated 11,857 of field-surveyed yields across maize cultivation areas in China and heterogeneous geospatial data to predict field-level maize yield using three data-driven approaches, i.e., Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We determined the most suitable vegetation index (VI), compared the performances of satellite-derived and ground-observed climate data, and identified the optimal combination of input variables and the best method for maize yield estimation. We found that the green chlorophyll vegetation index (GCVI) outperformed the traditional visible and near-infrared-based VIs. Combining Land Surface Temperature (LST), cumulative precipitation (Pgs) and standardized precipitation index (SPI) explained about 70% of the yield variation, which was comparable to ground-observed indices. Integrating GCVI improved R2 by 0.01–0.20 depending on the methods, suggesting valuable information on biotic or abiotic stress contained by GCVI. Maize yield could be predicted 1–2-month ahead before harvesting in all agro-ecological zones. The data collected during silking period contributed more information. The LSTM model did better than LightGBM and LASSO, because of its neural network characterizing the cumulative effects of environmental factors on yield. Our study demonstrates an effective mean for large-scale crop yield estimation using publicly available data, particularly for smallholder systems where ground observations are currently limited and sparse. © 2021","Deep learning; GEE; Maize; Remote sensing; Smallholder farms; Yield prediction","algorithm; crop yield; cultivation; detection method; integrated approach; maize; smallholder; China",Article,Scopus

Understanding and improving the performance of uncalibrated hydrological models could greatly expand their utility in such regions. In this study, we build and validate an uncalibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for Panama.

New hydrological insights for region: We found a strong seasonal trend and regional differences in the spatial autocorrelation of rainfall, suggesting that this phenomenon should not be modeled statically.

This study aims to develop an early forecasting model of cereal yields (soft wheat, barley and durum wheat) at the scale of the agricultural province considering the 15 most productive over 2000–2017 (i.e., 15 × 18 = 270 yields values). To this objective, we built on previous works that showed a tight linkage between cereal yields and various datasets including weather data (rainfall and air temperature), regional climate indices (North Atlantic Oscillation in particular), and drought indices derived from satellite observations in different wavelengths. The combination of the latter three data sets is assessed to predict cereal yields using linear (Multiple Linear Regression, MLR) and non-linear (Support Vector Machine, SVM; Random Forest, RF, and eXtreme Gradient Boost, XGBoost) machine learning algorithms. The calibration of the algorithmic parameters of the different approaches are carried out using a 5-fold cross validation technique and a leave-one-out method is implemented for model validation. The statistical metrics of the models are first analyzed as a function of the input datasets that are used, and as a function of the lead times, from 4 months to 2 months before harvest. The results show that combining data from multiple sources outperformed models based on one dataset only. In addition, the satellite drought indices are a major source of information for cereal prediction when the forecasting is carried out close to harvest (2 months before), while weather data and, to a lesser extent, climate indices, are key variables for earlier predictions. The best models can accurately predict yield in January (4 months before harvest) with an R2 = 0.88 and RMSE around 0.22 t. ha−1 . The XGBoost method exhibited the best metrics. Finally, training a specific model separately for each group of provinces, instead of one global model, improved the prediction performance by reducing the RMSE by 10% to 35% depending on the provinces. In conclusion, the results of this study pointed out that combining remote sensing drought indices with climate and weather variables using a machine learning technique is a promising approach for cereal yield forecasting. © 2021 by the authors.

Forecast performance needs to be investigated over space and time before practical applications. We assess seasonal forecast performance (skill, probability and accuracy) in predicting flowering and veraison stages of two representative varieties in Portugal over 1993–2017. The state-of-the-art forecast system ECMWF-SEAS5 provides 7-month seasonal forecasts and is coupled with a locally adapted phenology model. Overall, findings illustrate the dependence of forecast performance on initialization timings, regions and predicting subjects (stages and varieties). Forecast performance improves by delaying the initialization timing and only forecasts initialized on April 1st show better skills than climatology on predicting phenology terciles (early/normal/late). The considerable bias of daily values of seasonal climate predictions can represent the main barrier to accurate forecasts. Better prediction performance is consistently found in Central-Southern regions compared to Northern regions, attributing to an earlier phenology occurrence with a shorter forecast length. Comparable predictive skills between flowering and veraison for both varieties imply better predictability in summer. Consequently, promising seasonal phenology predictions are foreseen in Central-Southern wine regions using forecasts initialized on April 1st with approximately 1–2/3–4 months lead time for flowering/veraison: potential prediction errors are ∼2 weeks, along with an overall moderate forecast skill on categorical events. However, considerable inter-annual variability of forecast performance over the same classified phenology years reflects the substantial influence of climate variability. This may represent the main challenge for reliable forecasts in Mediterranean regions. Recommendations are suggested for methodological innovations and practical applications towards reliable regional phenology forecasts. © 2023 The Author(s)","Climate risk; Forecast performance; Mediterranean climate; Phenology forecast; Phenology modelling; Seasonal climate forecast","climatology; flowering; forecasting method; phenology; seasonal variation; viticulture; Portugal",Article,Scopus

For efficient management and adaptation measures, it is important to understand the relative effect of climate variability and anthropogenic influences. The Nagavalli River Basin (NRB), located in India, has experienced significant changes in hydroclimatic variables and land use in the last decade and therefore serves an ideal basin for investigating the attribution of rainfall variability and land-use changes. In this study, the characteristics of precipitation, temperature, and streamflow were analyzed for the period 1970-2012. It was observed that there is a significant increasing trend in precipitation and streamflow. Further, there have been substantial land-use change in terms of scrubland conversion. Investigations on rainfall-runoff coherency using wavelet coherence showed that there were noteworthy changes during the periods of 1991-2001 and 2002-2012. The contributions of land-use and rainfall variability to the changes in the streamflow were quantified using a semidistributed hydrological model (Soil Water Assessment Tool). The results showed that for the whole NRB, the variations of mean annual streamflow in 2002-2012 were primarily affected by rainfall variability with reference to 1990s, whereas human activities played a complementary role. The quantitative assessment revealed that rainfall variability resulted in an increase in runoff by 103 mm in 2002-2012 for the whole catchment, accounting for 41.52% of runoff changes relative to the 1990s. However, land-use changes are responsible for a decrease in runoff by 59 mm during the period of 2002-2012, which accounts for -23.54% of runoff changes. Overall, it was observed that the agricultural intensification in terms of scrubland conversion counteracted the effect of rainfall variability, resulting in the reduction in the margin of increase in streamflow. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Agricultural intensification; Attribution of land-use and rainfall variability; Increased streamflow; Nagavalli River Basin","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Catchments; Rain; Runoff; Soil moisture; Stream flow; Tropics; Watersheds; Agricultural intensification; Anthropogenic influence; Efficient managements; Hydroclimatic variables; Hydrological modeling; Quantitative assessments; Rainfall variability; Soil water assessment tool; Land use; agricultural intensification; anthropogenic effect; climate variation; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; land use change; rainfall; river basin; runoff; streamflow; India",Article,Scopus

However, the influence of extreme weather stress and synchronous crop yield anomalies on trade linkages among countries remains unexplored. Here we use the international wheat trade network, develop two network-based covariates (i.e., difference in extreme weather stress and short-term synchrony of yield fluctuations between countries), and test specialized statistical and machine-learning methods. We find that countries with larger differences in extreme weather stress and synchronous yield variations tend to be trade partners and with higher trade volumes, even after controlling for factors conventionally implemented in international trade models (e.g., production level and trade agreement). These findings highlight the need to improve the current international trade network by considering the patterns of extreme weather stress and yield synchrony among countries. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"agricultural trade; crop yield; food security; international trade; machine learning; severe weather; wheat",Article,Scopus

Identifying plant response to climate is essential to advancing this strategy and planning for precision agriculture. Wheat is the main plant of Saqqez in the Lake Urmia basin of Iran, whose yield is associated with severe fluctuations. This study was conducted to investigate the climate effect on wheat yield. For this purpose, the growing degree days (GDDs) method and the Zadoks scale were used to simulate the wheat growth period and to divide it into seven stages. Forty-seven climatic variables of the first six stages were used to perform factor analysis and develop the climate-yield model. Gene expression programming (GEP), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and multivariate linear regression (MLR) methods were applied to derive models. The results showed that 90.7% of the total variance of 47 variables can be explained by 10 factors. Eighty-two percent of yield variations were modeled by these factors. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for the models developed by GEP and ANN methods was 26%, and its amount for the MLR model was 35%. The algorithm used here, to express the climate effect on yield and the relationship between them, made the interpretation of the results more accurate and simple and produced more detailed and practical information. Also, GEP method, used for the first time in deriving climate-yield model, showed its superiority over MLR and ANN methods. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"accuracy assessment; agrometeorology; algorithm; artificial intelligence; climate effect; climate modeling; crop production; crop yield; efficiency measurement; error analysis; irrigation; lake water; rainfed agriculture; water availability; water resource; wheat; Iran; Lake Urmia",Article,Scopus

Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) provides a promising way to directly measure plant productivity from space. However, satellite SIF observations are only available at a coarse spatial resolution, making it impossible to monitor how individual crop types or farms are doing. This poses a challenging coarsely-supervised regression (or downscaling) task; at training time, we only have SIF labels at a coarse resolution (3km), but we want to predict SIF at much finer spatial resolutions (e.g. 30m, a 100x increase). We also have additional fine-resolution input features, but the relationship between these features and SIF is unknown. To address this, we propose Coarsely-Supervised Smooth U-Net (CS-SUNet), a novel method for this coarse supervision setting. CS-SUNet combines the expressive power of deep convolutional networks with novel regularization methods based on prior knowledge (such as a smoothness loss) that are crucial for preventing overfitting. Experiments show that CS-SUNet resolves fine-grained variations in SIF more accurately than existing methods. © 2022 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

Crop cultivation also depends a lot on environmental factors and the fertility elements of the soil. Due to the changing weather conditions, a seasonal change transpires in the environment and the soil elements. Because of these seasonal changes, farmers face many shortcomings in selecting suitable crop cultivation in their farmland, ensuing massive imbalance in economic growth, causing an enormous threat to the agricultural occupation and the Indian economy. The aforementioned problem can be overcome by implementing seasonal cropping based on the soil elements and environmental factors. As a micromanagement solution to this problem, we propose implementing an economically innovative machine learning Internet of things platform that can closely access and deliver the information pertaining to the attributes of the environment and soil.

This study extracted agricultural fields in the former homelands of Venda and Gazankulu in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Landsat 8 imageries for 2015 were used, applying the maximum likelihood supervised classifier to delineate the agricultural fields. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) applied on Landsat imageries on the mapped fields during the dry season (July to August) was used to identify irrigated areas, because years of satellite data analysis suggest that healthy crop conditions during dry seasons are only possible with irrigation. Ground truth points totaling 137 were collected during fieldwork for pre-processing and accuracy assessment. An accuracy of 96% was achieved on the mapped agricultural fields, yet the irrigated area map produced an initial accuracy of only 71%. This study explains and improves the 29% error margin from the irrigated areas. Accuracy was enhanced through post-classification correction (PCC) using 74 post-classification points randomly selected from the 2015 irrigated area map. High resolution aerial photographs of the 74 sample fields were acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to give a clearer picture of the irrigated fields. The analysis shows that mapped irrigated fields that presented anomalies included abandoned croplands that had green invasive alien species or abandoned fruit plantations that had high NDVI values.

The rice production mainly depends on climatic parameters such as rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed etc. If the farmers can get the timely advice on variation of climatic condition, they can take appropriate action to increase the rice production. This factor motivate us to prepare a computational model for the farmers and ultimately to the society also. The main contribution of this work is to present a classifier ensemble based prediction model by considering the original rice yield and climatic datasets of coastal districts Odisha namely Balasore, Cuttack and Puri for the period of 1983 to 2014 for Rabi and Kharif seasons. This ensemble method uses five diversified classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbour, Naive Bayesian, Decision Tree, and Linear Discriminant Analysis. This is an iterative approach; where at each iteration one classifier acts as main classifier and other four classifiers are used as base classifiers whose output has been considered after taking the majority voting. The performance measure increases 95.38% to 98.10% and 95.38% to 98.10% for specificity, 88.48% to 96.25% and 83.60% to 94.81% for both sensitivity and precision and 91.78% to 97.17% and 74.48% to 88.59% for AUC for Rabi and Kharif seasons dataset of Balasore district and also same improvement in Puri and Cuttack District.

Understanding the spatial and temporal variabilities of water security can play a pivotal role in sustainable management of fresh water resources. In this study, a long-term water security analysis of the Grand River watershed (GRW), Ontario, Canada, was carried out using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). Analyses on blue and green water availability and water security were carried out by dividing the GRW into eight drainage zones. As such, both anthropogenic as well as environmental demand were considered. In particular, while calculating blue water scarcity, three different methods were used in determining the environmental flow requirement, namely, the presumptive standards method, the modified low stream-flow method, and the variable monthly flow method. Model results showed that the SWAT model could simulate streamflow dynamics of the GRW with 'good' to 'very good' accuracy with an average Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.75, R2 value of 0.78, and percentage of bias (PBIAS) of 8.23%. Sen's slope calculated using data from over 60 years confirmed that the blue water flow, green water flow, and storage had increasing trends. The presumptive standards method and the modified low stream-flow method, respectively, were found to be the most and least restrictive method in calculating environmental flow requirements. While both green (0.4-1.1) and blue (0.25-2.0) water scarcity values showed marked temporal and spatial variabilities, blue water scarcity was found to be the highest in urban areas on account of higher water usage and less blue water availability. Similarly, green water scarcity was found to be highest in zones with higher temperatures and intensive agricultural practices. We believe that knowledge of the green and blue water security situation would be helpful in sustainable water resources management of the GRW and help to identify hotspots that need immediate attention. © 2019 by the authors.","Blue water; Grand River watershed; Green water; Soil and water assessment tool (SWAT); Water security","agricultural practice; assessment method; soil and water assessment tool; spatiotemporal analysis; streamflow; water availability; water management; water resource; watershed; Canada; Grand River [Ontario]; Ontario [Canada]",Article,Scopus

Wetlands are constantly affected by anthropogenic factors such as engineering projects and landscaping. Therefore, simulation of hydrologic processes and modeling the factors involved are important. In this study, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to simulate the hydrologic process in the Karkheh River Basin (KRB) in southwest Iran and to evaluate the impacts of engineering projects on its wetland (Al Hawizeh) located in the Iran-Iraq border. Calibration, validation, and uncertainty analysis were performed using Sequential Uncertainty Fitting Ver. 2 (SUFI2), which is one of the program interfaces with SWAT, in the Package SWAT Calibration Uncertainty Programs (SWAT-CUP). To assess the goodness of calibration and validation, four measures were applied: (i) percentage of data bracketed by 95% prediction uncertainty or P-factor (95PPU) calculated at 2.5% and 97.5% intervals of the simulated variables, (ii) R-factor, which is the ratio of average thickness of the PPU, (iii) Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE), and (iv) determination of coefficient (R2). Stream flows from four gauge stations combined with 14 synoptic stations were used for calibration (1987-1990) and validation (1991-1994). The P-factor values for these stations ranged from 0.64 to 0.84 and from 0.65 to 0.79 for calibration and validation, respectively. These results showed reasonable accuracy according to literature. NSE values were also acceptable, ranging from 0.52 to 0.8 and from 0.62 to 0.72 for calibration and validation, respectively. R2 values were also within an acceptable range. The calibration and validation results were then used to simulate two watershed scenarios (with and without a dam). In addition, annual flow volumes (AFVs) for two downstream stations (Hamidiyeh and Pay e Pol) were computed. AFV is defined as the volume of water that discharges from catchment at the desired output during a year. The results showed that the flows during 1987-2000 (before dam construction) and 2001 to 2010 (after dam construction) were significantly reduced after the Karkheh dam construction. The corresponding AFVs for the Hamidiyeh and Pay e Pol stations were 8.92×1011 and 1.04×1012m3 in 1987-2000 and 2.57×1011 to 3.94×1011m3 in 2001-2010. Thus, the AFVs before and after dam construction were reduced to 6.34×1011 and 6.53×1011m3 for the Hamidiyeh and Pay e Pol gauges, respectively. Consequently, flow reduction affected the wetland area, in which the surface area of the wetland was reduced and dust emission was increased. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.","Engineering projects; KRB; Simulation; SUFI-2; SWAT model; Uncertainty analysis","accuracy assessment; anthropogenic effect; calibration; land use; nature-society relations; numerical model; river basin; river engineering; river flow; uncertainty analysis; wetland; Iran; Karkheh Basin; Khuzestan",Article,Scopus

Several researchers have investigated cropping operations’ role in mycotoxin contamination, but these findings were inconclusive, precluding their use in predictive modeling. In this study a machine learning (ML) approach was considered, which included weather-based mechanistic model predictions for AFLA-maize and FER-maize [predicting aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and fumonisins (FBs), respectively], and cropping system factors as the input variables. The occurrence of AFB1 and FBs in maize fields was recorded, and their corresponding cropping system data collected, over the years 2005–2018 in northern Italy. Two deep neural network (DNN) models were trained to predict, at harvest, which maize fields were contaminated beyond the legal limit with AFB1 and FBs. Both models reached an accuracy &gt;75% demonstrating the ML approach added value with respect to classical statistical approaches (i.e., simple or multiple linear regression models). The improved predictive performance compared with that obtained for AFLA-maize and FER-maize was clearly demonstrated.

However, the magnitudes of low- and high-temperature stresses may have been altered by global warming. In this study, the major climatic constraints to the yield and yield components of temperate japonica rice grown in field conditions under the current climates were assessed using the random forests method with 14-yr field trial data (n = 499). Low temperatures had negligible impacts on rice yield under the current climates (2005–2018) in South Korea. Meanwhile, high-temperature stress was most significant during the ripening stage, followed by the reproductive stage. Yield losses by high temperatures were primarily associated with reduced filled-grain percentage, followed by reduced 1,000-grain weight. During the vegetative stage, higher temperature (or higher growing degree days, GDD) decreased the number of panicles per m2 and increased the number of spikelets per panicle, resulting in negligible changes in the number of spikelets per m2 and yield. The effect of solar radiation was most significant during the ripening stage. More solar radiation during the ripening stage enhanced rice yield by increasing filled-grain percentage and 1,000-grain weight. This study highlights that the primary constraints to temperate japonica rice grown under the current climates are high-temperature stresses during the ripening and reproductive stages rather than low-temperature stresses. Thus, there is an urgent need to explore options for improving the adaptation of temperate japonica rice to anticipated global warming. © 2021 The Authors.

Understanding hydrologic responses to crop rotation is critical for developing appropriate crop rotation strategies for sustainable water resources management. These responses are not well understood due to limited availability of multi-year, crop-specific land use-land cover data. The study focuses on the Smoky Hill River watershed in west-central Kansas, a typical agro-ecosystem watershed in the Central Great Plains of the U.S. A multi-year land use dataset developed for the state of Kansas was used to identify 3-year crop rotation patterns in the watershed for three different periods (2006–08, 2008–10, 2010–12). Out of 276 unique rotations, 21 rotations were found to be dominant, with rotation patterns of grain sorghum-fallow-winter wheat (G-F-W), winter wheat-winter wheat-fallow (W-W-F), and continuous winter wheat (W-W-W) occupying more than 81% of the cropland in each rotation period. From 2006 to 2012, the coverage of grain sorghum increased by 26% and corn by 305%, while winter wheat decreased by 20%. Three 11-year simulation scenarios based on three 3-year crop rotation patterns were implemented in the SWAT model and separately calibrated for streamflow at two gauge sites. The SWAT model produced good calibration statistics for the periods corresponding to the applied crop rotations, while the statistics tended to decrease for other periods, with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient becoming unsatisfactory for periods of six to eight years outside of the calibration period. Applying a different number of dominant crop rotations to the SWAT model, it was found that the number can be reduced down to the five most dominant without significant loss in model performance. While the optimum number of crop rotations must be evaluated for each agricultural watershed, this finding provides valuable information for watershed model development and calibration, which can help to avoid issues of over-parameterization and equifinality. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Crop rotations; Land use representability; Model performance; SWAT; Watershed modeling","crop rotation; data set; hydrological modeling; land use change; management practice; parameterization; soil and water assessment tool; sorghum; streamflow; water management; watershed; wheat; Great Plains; Kansas; Smoky Hills; United States; Sorghum bicolor bicolor; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

In this study, we use the physically based model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), to investigate the hydrological processes in the East River Basin in South China, a coastal area dominated by monsoonal climate. The SWAT model was calibrated using 8-year (1973-1980) record of the daily streamflow at the basin outlet (Boluo station), and then validated using data collected during the subsequent 8 years (1981-1988). Statistical evaluation shows that SWAT can consistently simulate the streamflow of the East River with monthly Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies of 0.93 for calibration and 0.90 for validation at the Boluo station. We analyzed the model simulations with calibrated parameters, presented the spatiotemporal distribution of the key hydrological components, and quantified their responses to different land uses.

Therefore, it is essential to provide appropriate solutions to increase water productivity (WP). As an element of research, this study presents a hybrid machine learning approach and investigates its potential for estimating date palm crop yield and WP under different levels of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI). The amount of applied water in the SDI system was compared at three levels of 125% (T1), 100% (T2), and 75% (T3) of water requirement. The proposed ACVO-ANFIS approach is composed of an anti-coronavirus optimization algorithm (ACVO) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Since the effect of irrigation factors, climate, and crop characteristics are not equal in estimating the WP and yield, the importance of these factors should be measured in the estimation phase. To fulfill this aim, ACVO-ANFIS employed eight different feature combination models based on irrigation factors, climate, and crop characteristics. The proposed approach was evaluated on a benchmark dataset that contains information about the groves of Behbahan agricultural research station located in southeast Khuzestan, Iran. The results explained that the treatment T3 advanced data palm crop yield by 3.91 and 1.31%, and WP by 35.50 and 20.40 kg/m3, corresponding to T1 and T2 treatments, respectively. The amount of applied water in treatment T3 was 7528.80 m3/ha, which suggests a decrease of 5019.20 and 2509.6 m3/ha of applied water compared to the T1 and T2 treatments. The modeling results of the ACVO-ANFIS approach using a model with factors of crop variety, irrigation (75% water requirement of SDI system), and effective rainfall achieved RMSE = 0.005, δ = 0.603, and AICC = 183.25.

The study sought to inform future research through identifying and critiquing crop and climate models, and techniques for integrating seasonal forecast information and crop models. Peer-reviewed articles related to crop modelling and seasonal forecasting were sourced from Google Scholar, Web of Science, AGRIS, and JSTOR. Nineteen articles were selected from a search outcome of 530. About 74% of the studies used mechanistic models, which are favored for climate risk management research as they account for crop management practices. European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, Hamburg, are the predominant global climate models (GCMs) used across Africa. A range of approaches have been assessed to improve the effectiveness of the connection between seasonal forecast information and mechanistic crop models, which include GCMs, analogue, stochastic disaggregation, and statistical prediction through converting seasonal weather summaries into the daily weather. GCM outputs are produced in a format compatible with mechanistic crop models. Such outputs are critical for researchers to have information on the merits and demerits of tools and approaches on integrating seasonal forecast and crop models.

The insufficient knowledge of the whole agricultural production system and conventional ways of irrigation have limited agricultural yields in the past. The remote sensing innovations recently implemented in agriculture have dramatically revolutionized production efficiency by offering unparalleled opportunities for convenient, versatile, and quick collection of land images to collect critical details on the crop’s conditions. These innovations have enabled automated data collection, simulation, and interpretation based on crop analytics facilitated by deep learning techniques. This paper aims to reveal the transformative patterns of old Chinese agrarian development and fruit production by focusing on the major crop production (from 1980 to 2050) taking into account various forms of data from fruit production (e.g., apples, bananas, citrus fruits, pears, and grapes). In this study, we used production data for different fruits grown in China to predict the future production of these fruits. The study employs deep neural networks to project future fruit production based on the statistics issued by China’s National Bureau of Statistics on the total fruit growth output for this period. The proposed method exhibits encouraging results with an accuracy of 95.56% calculating by accuracy formula based on fruit production variation. Authors further provide recommendations on the AGR-DL (agricultural deep learning) method being helpful for developing countries. The results suggest that the agricultural development in China is acceptable but demands more improvement and government needs to prioritize expanding the fruit production by establishing new strategies for cultivators to boost their performance. © 2021 by the authors.

Here I show that seasonal glacier meltwater is equivalent to the basic needs of 221 ± 59 million people, or most of the annual municipal and industrial needs of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. During drought summers, meltwater dominates water inputs to the upper Indus, Aral and Chu/Issyk-Kul river basins. This reduces the risk of social instability, conflict and sudden migrations triggered by water scarcity, which is already associated with the large, rapidly growing populations and hydro-economies of these basins. Regional meltwater production is, however, unsustainably high—at 1.6 times the balance rate—and is expected to increase in future decades before ultimately declining.

The selected model was weighted and integrated in order to improve the accuracy of prediction, as it plays a key role in ensuring food security. Daily meteorological observations, winter wheat yield data, and growth period observations were obtained from 69 basic meteorological stations in Jiangsu Province from 1993 to 2018. Then, five methods of meteorological yield and trend yield separation (linear separation, percentage difference, 5- or 3-year sliding average, and quadratic curve) were compared. On this base, by using the fitting test and hind-casting test, we evaluated and analyzed the simulation effects of yield prediction methods based on similar years with bumper or poor harvest, key meteorological factors and climate suitability, and integrated the methods for Jiangsu winter wheat yield prediction. The results revealed the following: 1) For the same yield prediction method, the yield separation methods had a greater effect on prediction accuracy. The quadratic curve method was the best among the linear separation, percentage difference, 5- or 3-year sliding average and quadratic curve methods. The prediction accuracy of the weighting method was higher than the large probability method in the similar years with bumper or poor harvest prediction method. From 1993 to 2013, the average accuracy of the methods of the similar years with bumper or poor harvest prediction, key meteorological factor, and climate suitability were 89.67%, 94.86%, and 94.96%, respectively. 2) The accuracy of the integrated prediction method was more than 96.33% in the past 5 years, and it was higher than that of the similar years with bumper or poor harvest-weighting model, key factor-quadratic curve model and climate suitability-quadratic curve model. This could probably overcome the less stability of prediction accuracy of a single prediction method. 3) The closer the predicted time to the maturity period and the more comprehensive the prediction factor information, the higher the accuracy of the prediction model. These results provide a scientific basis for selecting an optimized prediction model for winter wheat yield in Jiangsu, and the methodology of model screening can also be used in other provinces. © 2020, Science Press.

Due to intensive agricultural activities and a lack of wastewater treatment plants in small settlements, the water quality is deteriorating. As a result, corrective measures need to be taken. Technological Agency of the Czech Republic supported this research which proposes different scenarios for a reduction of water quality degradation in the dam. The Trnávka dam watershed was chosen for study purposes as it occupies one quarter of the Švihov dam watershed. Hydrological balance was established using measured data. Point and non-point sources of nutrients were determined by field research and included in a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. This study aims to propose complex watershed management to improve the state of the environment in the entire area and to reduce eutrophication. Different management practices would reduce nutrient loads of streams and increase water quality which is the critical factor in dam eutrophication.

Here, we analysed the eco-hydrological model SWIM simulating crop yields. Historic simulations for winter wheat and silage maize from 1991 to 2010 were used to examine the model performance at the county level in reproducing the county statistics for crop yields. The focus laid on the replication of mean yield levels and interannual crop yield variability. Simulations of silage maize performed better than simulations of winter wheat with R2-values for interannual yield variability of 0.72 and 0.26 respectively at the national level. In particular, silage maize showed a tendency to perform better in areas of lower soil water availability. The reasons for the clear superiority of silage maize were supposedly the short growing season, the lower susceptibility to pests and diseases and, hence, the direct translation of water stress into yield reductions. This signal was less evident for winter wheat and was additionally superposed of climate induced biotic and abiotic stresses – primarily originating in the cold season - which were not implemented in the model. Overall, the simulation bias seemed to originate rather from unconsidered processes than from uncertainties of input data or in model parameterisation. © 2018","Eco-hydrological modelling; EPIC; Germany; Regional crop modelling; Silage maize; SWIM; Winter wheat","agricultural modeling; annual variation; crop yield; ecohydrology; hydrological modeling; integrated approach; maize; parameterization; silage; simulation; water stress; winter; Germany; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

In this study, we used remote sensing data to calibrate a regional crop model (MCWLA-Rice) for yield simulation in a double-rice crop rotation system in counties of Hunan province dominated by three landforms (plain, hill, and mountain). The calibration scheme with coarse remote sensing data (Global LAnd Surface Satellite, GLASS) greatly improved model accuracy for the double-rice system and is a promising method for yield estimation in large areas. The average improvement in relative root mean square error (RRMSE) was at most 48.00% for early rice and 41.25% for late rice. The average improvement in coefficient of determination (R2) value was at most 0.54 for early rice and 0.19 for late rice. Estimation of yield in counties dominated by different landform types indicated that: (1) MCWLA-Rice tended to be unstable in areas of complex topography and resulted in unbalanced proportions of overestimations and underestimations. (2) Differences in yield simulation between early rice and late rice varied among counties; yield estimates were highest in predominantly hilly counties, followed by counties dominated by plains, and lowest in predominantly mountainous counties.

Three methodologies are compared-the “direct approach” (DA), the “Threshold Adaptation” approach (TA), and the “Positive Approach” (Pos)-as well as a method called “Singularity Stochastic Removal” (SSR) specifically developed for precipitation, all based on the same adjustment technique. Unlike the three other models, SSR allows dealing in the same way with the situations where the precipitation model has too many wet days or not with respect to the reference data. SSR also avoids separating the correction of the occurrence from that of the intensity, which constitutes a flexible tool. First, the four approaches are applied to a historical regional climate model precipitation run. Evaluations are realized through occurrence- and intensity-related criteria. Although SSR, DA, and Pos may be close to each other depending on the criterion, in general, SSR provides the best results when all criteria are accounted for. This is even more true when the classical assumption that “the model precipitation had too many wet days” does not hold. The BC methods are also intercompared over the 2071-2100 period. The different BC methods are in agreement with previous studies, with relatively equivalent evolutions from 1976-2005 to 2071-2100, although nuances are present from one BC method to another. As a global conclusion, the SSR method for precipitation is a good compromise to correct both occurrences and intensities. © 2016. American Geophysical Union.

Machine learning (ML) approaches have emerged as promising artificial intelligence alternative and complimentary tools to the commonly used crop production models. The study was designed to answer the following questions: (a) Can machine learning techniques predict maize grain yields under conservation agriculture (CA)? (b) How close can ML algorithms predict maize grain yields under CA-based cropping systems in the highlands and lowlands of Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA)? Machine learning algorithms could predict maize grain yields from conventional and CA-based cropping systems under low and high potential conditions of the ESA region. Linear algorithms (LDA and LR) predicted maize yield more closely to the observed yields compared with nonlinear tools (NB, KNN, CART and SVM) under the conditions of the reported study. However, the KNN algorithm was comparable in its yield prediction to the linear tools tested in this study. Overall, the LDA algorithm was the best tool, and SVM was the worst algorithm in maize yield prediction. Evaluating the performance of different ML algorithms using different criteria is critical in order to get a more robust assessment of the tools before their application in the agriculture sector. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agro-ecology; Big data; Cropping systems; Data-driven value creation; Smallholder agriculture","Agricultural robots; Crops; Cultivation; Forecasting; Grain (agricultural product); Machine learning; Agriculture sectors; Conservation agricultures; Crop simulation model; Cropping systems; Field experimentation; Linear algorithms; Machine learning techniques; Various technologies; Learning algorithms",Article,Scopus

The three major fruit production areas on the Central Coast complement each other in producing fruits almost throughout the year. Forecasting strawberry yield with some lead time can help growers plan for required and often limited human resources and aid in making strategic business decisions. The objectives of this paper were to investigate the correlation among various weather parameters related with strawberry yield at the field level and to evaluate yield forecasts using the predictive principal component regression (PPCR) and two machine-learning techniques: (a) a single layer neural network (NN) and (b) generic random forest (RF). The meteorological parameters were a combination of the sensor data measured in the strawberry field, meteorological data obtained from the nearest weather station, and calculated agroclimatic indices such as chill hours. The correlation analysis showed that all of the parameters were significantly correlated with strawberry yield and provided the potential to develop weekly yield forecast models. In general, the machine learning technique showed better skills in predicting strawberry yields when compared to the principal component regression. More specifically, the NN provided the most skills in forecasting strawberry yield. While observations of one growing season are capable of forecasting crop yield with reasonable skills, more efforts are needed to validate this approach in various fields in the region. © 2019 by the authors.","Machine learning; Prediction; Regression; Strawberry; Weekly yield","Crops; Decision trees; Forecasting; Fruits; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Meteorology; Multilayer neural networks; Network layers; Regression analysis; Correlation analysis; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Meteorological parameters; Principal component regression; Regression; Strawberry; Weekly yield; Weather forecasting; crop production; crop yield; fruit; machine learning; numerical model; prediction; regression analysis; statistical analysis; weather forecasting; California; United States; Fragaria x ananassa",Article,Scopus

However, the traditional linear rice growth forecasting model is ineffective under rapidly changing climate conditions. Here we show that growth rate (Gr) can be well-predicted by artificial intelligence (AI)-based artificial neural networks (ANN) and gene-expression programming (GEP), with accumulated air temperatures based on growth degree day (GDD). In total, 10,246 Gr from 95 cultivations were obtained with three cultivars, TK9, TNG71, and KH147, in Central and Southern Taiwan. The model performance was evaluated by the Pearson correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative RMSE (r-RMSE) in the whole growth period (lifecycle), as well as the average and specific key stages (transplanting, 50% initial tillering, panicle initiation, 50% heading, and physiological maturity). The results in lifecycle Gr modeling showed that ANN and GEP models had comparable r (0.9893), but the GEP model had the lowest RMSE (3.83 days) and r-RMSE (7.24%). In stage average and specific key stages, each model has its own best-fit growth period. Overall, GEP model is recommended for rice growth prediction considering the model performance, applicability, and routine farming work.

Three land use maps representing a 17-year period when the region underwent significant transitions served as inputs for hydrologic modeling using the Automated Geospatial Watershed Assessment (AGWA) tool, a GIS-based hydrologic modeling system.

The SWAT model was calibrated using observation data taken during the 1990s with high annual concordance. Simulation results showed that land use changes have resulted in corresponding increases in surface runoff and decreases in groundwater recharge.

For a specific region, the comprehensive effects of multiple meteorological factors are important indicators for the climatic suitability of the crops. To evaluate the synthetic effects, an integrated climatic assessment indicator (ICAI) are developed in Jiangsu Province, China. A newly produced meteorological assimilation driving datasets (CMADS V1.0) combined with observation data are used in establishing the indicator. The procedure to construct the indicator involves building statistical crop models by meteorological factors and determining the indicator values by classification. In modeling, two machine learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are compared and the classification model of RF is chosen to build ICAI due to its better performance in the independent test set. To determine a reasonable division in classification, distribution detection of climatic yield is carried out and Monte Carlo simulations are applied for the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test. The generated indicator includes three values: yield loss, normal and yield increment, with the spatial and temporal prediction accuracy from 67.86% to 100% in the test set for the Northern, Central and Southern Jiangsu. The ICAI are used to estimate the past climatic suitability of winter wheat and the future suitability under global warming conditions in Jiangsu Province. The results show that the climate in 1990s has more adverse effects on wheat production than the other two sub-periods in Northern and Southern Jiangsu. The adaptability of wheat production in Southern Jiangsu has improved greatly to the local environments during the past three decades. In addition, when annual temperature accelerates upwards, both possibilities of yield loss in Northern Jiangsu and yield increment in Southern Jiangsu will increase. Therefore, more concerns should be given to the North in future warming climate, while yield potential in the South may be further improved in this circumstance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agro-meteorological indicator; Random Forest; Support Vector Machine; Winter wheat; Yield prediction","Computational complexity; Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Global warming; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Monte Carlo methods; Support vector machines; Assessment indicator; Classification models; Comprehensive effect; Meteorological condition; Meteorological factors; Random forests; Winter wheat; Yield prediction; Classification (of information); agrometeorology; algorithm; crop plant; crop production; crop yield; design method; environmental indicator; global warming; machine learning; support vector machine; wheat; yield response; China; Jiangsu; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Whereas traditional agricultural systems mainly rely on scarce ground-survey data, freely available multi-temporal and multi-spectral remote sensing images are excellent tools to support these vulnerable systems by accurately monitoring and estimating crop yields before harvest. In this context, we introduce the use of Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery, with a medium spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions, to estimate rice crop yields in Nepal as a case study. Firstly, we build a new large-scale rice crop database (RicePAL) composed by multi-temporal S2 and climate/soil data from the Terai districts of Nepal. Secondly, we propose a novel 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) adapted to these intrinsic data constraints for the accurate rice crop yield estimation. Thirdly, we study the effect of considering different temporal, climate and soil data configurations in terms of the performance achieved by the proposed approach and several state-of-the-art regression and CNN-based yield estimation methods.

Structural transformation captures a country’s level of dependence on agriculture, while rural transformation captures the productivity in the agricultural sector. Specifically, the agri-food system and employment transitions accompany country transformations and shape the spatial distribution of populations by influencing where people live, work and eat, all of which closely relate to food system transitions. We create a food systems index (FSI) capturing a rich set of drivers established in the literature. Using country level data from 85 low and middle-income countries (LMIC’s), we analyse the linkages between food system, structural and rural transformations as well as spatial population distributions. We also analyse a large number of policy relevant variables using machine-learning methodology to shed light on patterns related to institutions, female empowerment, infrastructure and health. Our analysis indicates that rural-dominant countries in the lowest FSI group will see their youth populations more than double in the next 30 years, indicating that their food system investments today will affect one third of global youth in the future. Medium FSI countries need to invest more in the semi-rural and peri-urban areas. We find that structural transformation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for desirable food system outcomes. Rural transformation by itself without structural transformation is not enough either. For LMIC’s, broad development interventions such as financial and digital connectivity as well as women’s empowerment loom more important than narrowly focused interventions regarding progress in the food system. © 2021, International Society for Plant Pathology and Springer Nature B.V.","Food policy; Food systems index; Machine learning; Spatial population data; Women’s empowerment","aquaculture industry; empowerment; food industry; food market; food policy; food supply; machine learning; quantitative analysis",Article,Scopus

Prevailing weather conditions during the crop growth period determine the yield of sorghum. Hence, the crop yield forecasting models based on weather parameters will be an appropriate option for policymakers and researchers to develop sustainable cropping strategies. In the present study, six multivariate weather‐based models viz., least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), elastic net (ENET), principal component analysis (PCA) in combination with stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), artificial neural network (ANN) alone and in combination with PCA and ridge regression model are examined by fixing 90% of the data for calibration and remaining dataset for validation to forecast rabi sorghum yield for different districts of Karnataka. The R2 and root mean square error (RMSE) during calibration ranged between 0.42 to 0.98 and 30.48 to 304.17 kg ha−1, respectively, without actual evapotranspiration (AET) whereas, these evaluation parameters varied from 0.38 to 0.99 and 19.84 to 308.79 kg ha−1, respectively with AET inclusion. During validation, the RMSE and nRMSE (normalized root mean square error) varied between 88.99 to 1265.03 kg ha−1 and 4.49 to 96.84%, respectively without AET and including AET as one of the weather variable RMSE and nRMSE were 63.48 to 1172.01 kg ha−1 and 4.16 to 92.56%, respectively. The performance of six multivariate models revealed that LASSO was the best model followed by ENET compared to PCA_SMLR, ANN, PCA_ANN and ridge regression models because of reduced overfitting through penalisation of regression coefficient. Thus, it can be concluded that LASSO and ENET weather‐based models can be effectively utilized for the district level forecast of sorghum yield. © 2020 by the authors.

In a case study for 50 representative agricultural stations in Australia, we test our method to postprocess daily rainfall forecasts with up to 186-day lead time. We demonstrate that the ECPP improves the overall forecast skill from raw rainfall forecasts and outperforms quantile mapping (QM) by checking various verification measures. Though the forecasts for daily amounts are hardly skilful except for the first few days, the forecasts for accumulated totals can be skilful from error averaging and propagating positive skill from short lead times. We also demonstrate that the ECPP can simulate rainfall forecasts with more realistic dry day distribution and daily rainfall intensity than QM.

Simulation was carried out for each algorithm using ambient temperature and growing season as input variables for the entire life cycle of rice (Trall) either as one continuous growth period or as the sum of four distinctive growth stages (Tr1~4). The results showed that the model output from Tr1~4 are more accurate than Trall.

The object of this study is to understand if surface karstification is the same as the interior karst development of an aquifer. Surface karstification was analyzed using Geographic Information System and remote sensing techniques, while interior karstification was studied with spring hydrograph analysis. The study area includes seven carbonate aquifers in the Zagros Region of Iran. The surface karstification of these aquifers is controlled by different factors including the thickness of carbonate formations, distance from faults, fracture density, precipitation, temperature, vegetation index, slope, and relief. The most important factors are precipitation and presence and density of faults and fractures; while the least significant factor is the vegetation cover. The spring hydrograph analysis shows that there are different ways of estimating the relative karst development, but each parameter that impacts the specific character of the karst aquifer might be independent of others. Furthermore, comparing the relative surface and interior karst development demonstrates that the possible relationship between them is unpredictable.

The spatial heterogeneity of crop condition (e.g., phenology and yields) at that scale could be substantial. Because the atmosphere-cropland exchanges of energy, water, and materials are sensitive to crop condition, this issue poses a question: How can we simulate the condition of a crop of interest on a GCM grid scale while taking into account the spatial heterogeneity of crop condition at a sub-grid scale? We therefore proposed an ensemble approach that uses stochastic parameter values to represent the spatial variation in the phenological and biophysical characteristics of a crop within a given GCM grid box, and tested its feasibility with simulation experiments. The combination of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) applied to maize in the Central Great Plains, United States, and coarse-resolution (2.5° × 2.5°) reanalysis data was taken as the example. The ensemble simulations successfully captured the spatial variation in the phenology and yield. Our conclusion is that the ensemble approach is feasible and expected to benefit large-area crop modeling when extending those models to include more information on the spatial heterogeneity of crop condition than ever. © 2013, The Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan.

Among the different approaches, machine learning (ML) techniques are being increasingly adopted, since they allow exploiting all the information on crop progress and environmental conditions and their relations with crop yield, achieving reliable and accurate estimations. However, interpreting the relationships learned by the ML models, and hence getting insights about the problem, remains a complex and usually unexplored task. Without accountability, confidence and trust in the ML models can be compromised. Here, we develop interpretable ML approaches for crop yield estimation that allow us investigating the most informative agro-ecological drivers and influencial regions learned by the models. We conduct a set of experiments to learn the selection of agro-ecological drivers leading to best estimations of main crops grown in Europe: corn, barley and wheat. As input data, we consider a variety of multi-scale Earth observation products sensitive to canopy greenness (e.g. EVI and LAI), its water-uptake dynamics (e.g. VOD) and available water (soil moisture), as well as climatic variables from the ERA5-Land reanalysis (e.g. temperature and radiation). Our results show that the best performances (R2&gt;0.55 for corn and R2&gt;0.8 for both barley and wheat) are obtained when descriptors of soil, vegetation, and atmosphere status are used as input in the ML models. This combination of variables outperforms the results obtained using single variables as inputs or all variables altogether. We then further analyze the relations of input features with crop yield in the developed models by means of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). We show how the information learned by the GPR model allows us to identify atypical or anomalous crop seasons across the study region, and investigate the underlying factors behind crop progress and failure in Europe. © 2021","Crop Yield Estimation; ERA5-Land; Gaussian Process; Interpretability; Machine Learning; MODIS; Optical and Passive Microwave sensors","crop yield; environmental conditions; Gaussian method; machine learning; MODIS; remote sensing; sensor; Europe",Article,Scopus

Mammography captures multiple features like masses, microcalcifications etc. Microcalcifications may indicate breast cancer in its early stages and are considered to play a crucial role in early breast cancer diagnosis. In this paper, we have undertaken an investigative study for breast cancer classification by automated learning from mammography images with microcalcifications. Three types of convolutional neural architectures - shallow (ResNet101), deep (VGG101) and dense (DenseNet101) learning models are employed in this investigative study towards contributing to the objective of rapid and early breast cancer diagnosis. To improve the accuracies of the learning models, the features extracted from microcalcifications have been fed to the learning models. We have experimented with varying hyperparameter setup and have recorded the optimal performances of the three models. It has been observed that among the three models, ResNet101 model demonstrated best performance of 94.2% in benign and malicious cancer classification and also demonstrated best performance in terms of time complexity. The dense model DenseNet101 was more sensitive and specific towards the classification of breast cancer using the microcalcifications.

Even in those that are available, either there is room for improvement in sugar content estimation, or they were not properly assessed as to how they would perform given weather variability. In this work, we show that when developed with a dataset comprised of typical weather patterns, the outputs of empirical models that have been recently developed are qualitatively analogous to those of a process-based model and have smaller errors. However, when the training data is not representative, the same doesn't happen and they are not consistent with known responses from sugarcane and with the output of mechanistic models. We used data from three years of harvests of a sugarcane mill to develop and evaluate the performance of machine learning models, as well as to evaluate an empirical model recently developed and DSSAT/Canegro. All models’ performances were evaluated in each of the three years separately, as well as through sensitivity analysis, to observe the effects of unknown weather in the estimates obtained by the model.

At 5.4 t/ha, the wheat yield was the lowest recorded since 1986 and 30% below the 5-year average. Crop yield forecasting can be considered as near-real-time impact modeling, but unfortunately, none of the forecasting systems in place anticipated the extent of the impact. We summarize key insights and assess the reasons for our failure to forecast French wheat accurately in 2016, with wider implications for quantifying the impacts of extremes on agriculture. The 2015/2016 growing season was characterized by compounding warm autumn temperatures and abnormally wet conditions the following spring. High rainfall and high temperatures leading to fungal diseases, soil water lodging and anoxia, low radiation affecting grain filling, and leaching of nitrogen have all been suggested as important factors ultimately leading to the yield loss. The use of binomial logistic regressions accounting for warm autumn and wet spring conditions together with autumn precipitation and June temperatures, suggests that the odds of an extreme yield loss (i.e., < 10th percentile) in 2016 was 35 times higher than expected. The challenge now is further untangling the variety of biotic and abiotic processes interacting at different timescales that can explain observed patterns. Collecting relevant insights from field trial experiments and confronting these with statistical and biophysical crop modeling will be key to achieve this. Besides improving forecasting methodologies, improving the collection, combination, and aggregation of novel real-time data streams will be necessary. Interestingly, a map of yield estimates based on Tweets of farmers harvesting their wheat was the first indication that something was amiss. Such novel data streams can help to anticipate impacts. Improved impact relevant predictors will need to be integrated into operational crop yield forecasting systems in preparation for future compound events. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

We develop a copula-based postprocessing (CPP) method to overcome this mismatch problem. The CPP forecasts are ensemble based and are generated from the predictive distribution conditioned on raw climate forecasts. CPP performs univariate postprocessing procedures at each station, lead time, and variable separately and then applies the Schaake shuffle to reorder ensemble sequence for a more realistic spatial, temporal, and cross-variable dependence structure. The use of copulas makes CPP free of strong distributional assumptions and flexible enough to describe complex dependence structures. In a case study, we apply CPP to postprocess rainfall, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and radiation forecasts at a monthly level from the Australian Community Climate and Earth-System Simulator Seasonal model (ACCESS-S) to three representative stations in Australia. We evaluate forecast skill at lead times of 0–5 months on a cross-validation theme in the context of both univariate and multivariate forecast verification. When compared with forecasts that use climatological values as the predictor, the CPP forecast has positive skills, although the skills diminish with increasing lead times and finally become comparable at long lead times. When compared with the bias-corrected forecasts and the quantile-mapped forecasts, the CPP forecast is the overall best, with the smallest bias and greatest univariate forecast skill. As a result of the skill gain from univariate forecasts and the effect of the Schaake shuffle, CPP leads to the most skillful multivariate forecast as well. Further results investigate whether using ensemble mean or additional predictors can enhance forecast skill for CPP. © 2020, American Meteorological Society.

Remote sensing (RS) and crop models are effective means to predict cotton yield in the field. The satellite vegetation indices (VIs) can describe crop yield variations over large areas but can’t take the exact environmental impact into consideration. Climate variables (CVs), the result of the influence of spatial heterogeneity in large regions, can provide environmental information for better estimation of cotton yield. In this study, the most important VIs and CVs for estimating county-level cotton yield across Xinjiang Province were screened out. We found that the VIs of canopy structure and chlorophyll contents, and the CVs of moisture, were the most significant factors for cotton growth. For yield estimation, we utilized four approaches: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO), support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR) and long short-term memory (LSTM). Due to its ability to capture temporal features over the long term, LSTM performed best, with an R2 of 0.76, root mean square error (RMSE) of 150 kg/ha and relative RMSE (rRMSE) of 8.67%; moreover, an additional 10% of the variance could be explained by adding CVs to the VIs. For the within-season yield estimation using LSTM, predictions made 2 months before harvest were the most accurate (R2 = 0.65, RMSE = 220 kg/ha, rRMSE = 15.97%). Our study demonstrated the feasibility of yield estimation and early prediction at the county level over large cotton cultivation areas by integrating satellite and environmental data.

Unfortunately, this type of application is characterized by datasets with a very limited number of samples (typically one sample per year). In general, statistical inference uses three datasets: the training dataset to optimize the model parameters, the validation dataset to select the best model, and the testing dataset to evaluate the model generalization ability. Splitting the overall database into three datasets is often impossible in crop yield modelling due to the limited number of samples. The leave-one-out cross-validation method, or simply leave one out (LOO), is often used to assess model performance or to select among competing models when the sample size is small. However, the model choice is typically made using only the testing dataset, which can be misleading by favouring unnecessarily complex models. The nested cross-validation approach was introduced in machine learning to avoid this problem by truly utilizing three datasets even with limited databases. In this study, we propose one particular implementation of the nested cross-validation, called the nested leave-two-out cross-validation method or simply the leave two out (LTO), to choose the best model with an optimal model selection (using the validation dataset) and estimate the true model quality (using the testing dataset). Two applications are considered: robusta coffee in Cu M'gar (Dak Lak, Vietnam) and grain maize over 96 French departments. In both cases, LOO is misleading by choosing models that are too complex; LTO indicates that simpler models actually perform better when a reliable generalization test is considered. The simple models obtained using the LTO approach have improved yield anomaly forecasting skills in both study crops. This LTO approach can also be used in seasonal forecasting applications. We suggest that the LTO method should become a standard procedure for statistical crop modelling.

Research on ecosystem services has increased recently, though relatively fewer studies apply a data driven approach to quantify freshwater provisioning for different ecosystem services. In this study, freshwater provisioning was quantified annually from 1995 to 2013 for 13 watersheds in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). Results showed that the annual freshwater provision indices for all watersheds were less than one indicating that freshwater provisioning is diminished in the UMRB. The concentrations of sediment and nutrients (total nitrogen, and total phosphorus) are the most sensitive factors that impact freshwater provisioning in the UMRB. A significant linear relationship was observed between precipitation and freshwater provisioning index. During wet periods freshwater provisioning generally decreased in the study watersheds, primarily because of relatively high concentrations and loads of sediment and nutrients delivered from nonpoint sources. Results from this study may provide an insight, as well as an example of a data-driven approach to enhance freshwater provisioning for different ecosystem services and to develop a sustainable and integrated watershed management approach for the UMRB.","Freshwater provisioning; Precipitation; Sensitivity analysis; Upper Mississippi River Basin; Water quality","Ecology; Nutrients; Potable water; Precipitation (chemical); Quality control; Rivers; Sensitivity analysis; Soil conservation; Water; Water conservation; Water management; Water quality; Water resources; Watersheds; Data-driven approach; Ecosystem services; Freshwater provisioning; Integrated watershed management; Linear relationships; Non-point source; Total phosphorus; Upper Mississippi; Ecosystems; concentration (composition); ecosystem service; freshwater; hydrogeochemistry; nonpoint source pollution; nutrient enrichment; precipitation intensity; river basin; sensitivity analysis; service provision; water quality; watershed; Mississippi River; United States",Article,Scopus

In this work, we developed an unprecedented optimized framework for the MODIS-based mid-season corn yield forecasting over five producing states of the United States: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, and Ohio. We evaluated Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)-based forecasts under different schemes accounting for: different machine learning techniques with a mid-season composite or multi-temporal composites as inputs, four (county-, district-, state-, and global-based) training domains, and 16-day composites versus daily interpolated composites involving the day of pixels as predictors. Under the best identified scheme, we compared the EVI-based forecasts with those based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Leaf area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetic Active Radiation (FPAR). EVI and NDVI were transformed to LAI (named as LAIEVI and LAINDVI) as predictors for producing EVI- and NDVI-based forecasts. We evaluated both county- and state-level forecasts using the percent error (PE), mean absolute PE (MAPE) and determination coefficient (R2). The linear regression models driven by the single latest composite in mid-season often outperformed elastic net and random forest models driven by multi-temporal composites. The forecast performance decreased with longer subsets of EVI composites being used. The performance under the different training domains varied by states and forecast level (county or state), although the changes within states were mostly non-significant except in Nebraska. The forecasts based on 16-day and daily composites performed similarly, indicating that the use of information about the day of pixel composite provides no additional benefit to the yield forecast. For the best EVI-based schemes, the medium annual MAPE (PE) at the county (state) level varied between 6.1% (2.4%) and 7.7% (5.3%) across states while the medium annual R2 (interannual R2) varied between 0.54 (0.59) and 0.82 (0.86). Results suggested that, while EVI was, in general, the best predictor for the Corn Belt as a whole, the adequacy of the EVI- and NDVI-based forecasts varied by states and largely exceeded that of the LAI- and FPAR-based forecasts. Compared with the EVI-based forecasts, the NDVI-based forecasts performed better in Iowa (MAPE's 0.9% and 1.43% lower at the county and state level), similar in Nebraska and worse in the other states. Overall, the best state-level forecasts consistently outperformed concurrent National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) forecasts. © 2020 The Authors","Crop yield forecast; Enhanced vegetation index; Leaf area index; Machine learning; MODIS; The Corn Belt","crop yield; decision making; leaf area index; machine learning; MODIS; optimization; vegetation index; Illinois; Indiana; Iowa; Nebraska; Ohio; United States",Article,Scopus

For a commercial organization that manages large amounts of crops, collecting accurate and consistent data is a bottleneck. Due to limited time and labor, accurately phenotyping crops to record color, head count, height, weight, etc. is severely limited. However, this information, combined with other genetic and environmental factors, is vital for developing new superior crop species that help feed the world's growing population. Recent advances in machine learning, in particular deep learning, have shown promise in mitigating this bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method for counting on-ear corn kernels in-field to aid in the gathering of real-time data and, ultimately, to improve decision making to maximize yield. We name this approach DeepCorn, and show that this framework is robust under various conditions. DeepCorn estimates the density of corn kernels in an image of corn ears and predicts the number of kernels based on the estimated density map. DeepCorn uses a truncated VGG-16 as a backbone for feature extraction and merges feature maps from multiple scales of the network to make it robust against image scale variations. We also adopt a semi-supervised learning approach to further improve the performance of our proposed method. Our proposed method achieves the MAE and RMSE of 41.36 and 60.27 in the corn kernel counting task, respectively.

In the proposed method, back propagation neural network was first utilised to build a behavioural model to forecast precipitation during the grass-growing season (June-July-August) from 1961 to 2015. Second, the relationship between precipitation and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index during the grass-growing season from 2000 to 2015 was modelled with the help of back propagation neural network. The prediction results demonstrate that the proposed back propagation neural network-based model is effective in the forecast of precipitation and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index. Thus, an accurate prediction of livestock carrying capacity is achieved based on the proposed back propagation neural network-based model.

Despite their importance, limited attention has been given to these uncertainty sources. We compare 27 projected temperature and precipitation indices over 22 regions of the world (including the global land area) in the near (2021-2060) and distant future (2061-2100), calculated using four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), five GCMs, two bias-correction methods, and three reference forcing data sets. To widen the variety of forcing data sets, we developed a new forcing data set, S14FD, and incorporated it into this study. The results show that S14FD is more accurate than other forcing data sets in representing the observed temperature and precipitation extremes in recent decades (1961-2000 and 1979-2008). The use of different bias-correction methods and forcing data sets contributes more to the total uncertainty in the projected precipitation index values in both the near and distant future than the use of different GCMs and RCPs. However, GCM appears to be the most dominant uncertainty source for projected temperature index values in the near future, and RCP is the most dominant source in the distant future. Our findings encourage climate risk assessments, especially those related to precipitation extremes, to employ multiple bias-correction methods and forcing data sets in addition to using different GCMs and RCPs. © 2017.

However, compared to drought impact, the impact of excessive rainfall on crop yield remains unresolved. Here, we present observational evidence from crop yield and insurance data that excessive rainfall can reduce maize yield up to −34% (−17 ± 3% on average) in the United States relative to the expected yield from the long-term trend, comparable to the up to −37% loss by extreme drought (−32 ± 2% on average) from 1981 to 2016. Drought consistently decreases maize yield due to water deficiency and concurrent heat, with greater yield loss for rainfed maize in wetter areas. Excessive rainfall can have either negative or positive impact on crop yield, and its sign varies regionally. Excessive rainfall decreases maize yield significantly in cooler areas in conjunction with poorly drained soils, and such yield loss gets exacerbated under the condition of high preseason soil water storage. Current process-based crop models cannot capture the yield loss from excessive rainfall and overestimate yield under wet conditions.

Wheat, as one of the most important agricultural products, which is widely consumed all over the world, has a very important role in people's nutrition, particularly among Iranians, the diet of whom is highly dependent on bread. Product forecasting is critical for any country so that decisions about storage, import or export, etc. can be planned. In this paper, several univariate time series models and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model are used to forecast wheat production in Iran. Annual wheat production, total annual precipitation, total applied fertilizer, population, and wheat cultivated area data were used in the period between 1961-1962 to 2018-2019. With the minimum values of 1.45894, 1.00329, 1.0448, and 1.09742 obtained for RMSE, AIC, HQC, and SIBC criteria, respectively, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) (1,1,1) was selected as the best univariate model. In testing the ANN models, total annual precipitation, total applied fertilizer, population, and wheat cultivated, area as input variables, and wheat production, as output variable, were used. Among several NN models, the Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN) model with five hidden layers had the lowest MSE= 0.153 and was chosen in this study. Comparison between the ANN model and the ARIMA (1,1,1) model showed that RMSE= 0.391, MSE= 0.153, and MAPE= 0.4231 in the ANN model were much lower than that of the ARIMA (1,1,1) model.

However, this study found that applying commonly used thresholds in defining HRUs may lead to considerable loss of information about the watershed landscape, emphasizing larger soil types on smaller land covers once the land covers meet a threshold for land cover, and potentially changing average slopes. These changes often have a minor effect on water yield and streamflow simulations by SWAT but a larger effect on sediment and nutrient load simulations, which are more sensitive to slope and soil type and are more influential on outputs at the subwatershed than at the watershed outlet.

Artificial intelligence provides a robust tool for integrating environmental, physiological, and management data and predicting crop yield. In this study, we used a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model in its default and hybrid learning modes to predict wheat yield. In its default mode, MLP was trained with the backpropagation algorithm, and in the hybrid mode, MLP was trained with the Water Striders Algorithm (WSA), Sine-Cosine Algorithm (SCA), and Genetic Algorithm (GA). We further considered two ensemble modeling approaches, including the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and Copula-based Bayesian Model Averaging (CBMA). The study area was classified into four homogenous wheat cultivation regions using the Fuzzy clustering approach, and for each region, the models were trained based on 30 years of fertilizer information, harvested yield, and climatic data. Our results showed that hybridizing MLP with an optimization algorithm provides more accurate yield predictions than its default mode. WSA required the lowest computational time, and its combination with MLP resulted in a more accurate yield prediction compared to other optimization algorithms. The accuracy of yield predictions was further improved when ensemble modeling was implemented. Accordingly, the CBMA approach generated the most accurate result with the lowest uncertainty range.

However, some studies have raised concerns as to whether the function is able to adequately simulate representative irrigation practices. In this study, observations of climate, irrigation, evapotranspiration (ET), leaf area index (LAI), and crop yield derived from an irrigated lysimeter field at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory at Bushland, Texas were used to evaluate the efficacy of the SWAT auto-irrigation functions. Results indicated good agreement between simulated and observed daily ET during both model calibration (2001-2005) and validation (2006-2010) periods for the baseline scenario (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency; NSE ≥ 0.80). The auto-irrigation scenarios resulted in reasonable ET simulations under all the thresholds of soil water deficit (SWD) triggers as indicated by NSE values > 0.5. However, the auto-irrigation function did not adequately represent field practices, due to the continuation of irrigation after crop maturity and excessive irrigation when SWD triggers were less than the static irrigation amount. © 2017 by the authors.","Crop yield; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation frequency; Irrigation magnitude; Leaf area index (LAI); Lysimeters; Single-HRU method; Soil water deficit threshold; SWAT","Agriculture; Aquifers; Crops; Evapotranspiration; Function evaluation; Lysimeters; Plants (botany); Rain; Research laboratories; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Soils; Crop yield; Irrigation frequency; Leaf Area Index; Single-HRU method; Soil water deficit; SWAT; Irrigation; agricultural management; calibration; crop production; crop yield; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; leaf area index; lysimeter; management practice; model validation; recharge; semiarid region; soil and water assessment tool; upland region; water budget; Great Plains; Ogallala Aquifer; United States",Article,Scopus

The approach requires two independent steps: 1. Cloud properties are determined from narrow-band satellite radiances. 2. These cloud properties are used together with data on water vapor column and surface albedo to calculate the atmospheric flux transmittance. The retrieved irradiance is biased low by about 3-4 W/m2 throughout the year, corresponding to an underestimate in atmospheric flux transmittance of about 0.015 in summer and 0.04 in winter. From a least-squares linear regression, residual standard deviations of 56 W/m2 (0.072, 17.0%), 11 W/m2 (0.052, 10.8%), and 4 W/m2 (0.021, 4.2%) are found for hourly, daily and monthly mean irradiance (transmittance, relative error), respectively. These findings indicate that the accuracy of the retrieval is comparable to first-class pyranometers in the summer half year (5% of daily-mean values), but significantly lower in winter.

From the temporal perspective, water resource is related to precipitation, which varies with hydrometeorological events, while spatially, it is largely related to the land use or vegetation cover. The changes in surface runoff of the Duero river basin, Mexico, using the SWAT model was investigated. The input data for the model include climatic variables, soil properties, topography, and four periods of land use map. The runoff estimates of the SWAT were compared with the streamflow data from the National Data Bank of Surface Water. An elevated record of runoff of up to 30 Dam3 (cubic decameter) was observed in 1983 in the municipalities of Tangamandapio and Tangancicuaro, which was likely associated with forest clearing since the 1970s. A decrease of runoff to 10 Dam3 was also observed in 2000, likely reflecting the conservation practice of forest management.

This study applied the Soil and Water Assessment Tool and the threshold drainage area (TDA) technique to evaluate the impacts of watershed subdivision on hydrological simulations at a 5,913-km2 Arctic watershed, Målselv. The watershed was discretized according to four TDA scheme scales including 200, 2,000, 5,000, and 10,000 ha. The impacts of different TDA schemes on hydrological simulations in water balance components, snowmelt runoff, and stream-flow were investigated. The study revealed that the complexity of terrain and topographic attributes altered significantly in the coarse discretizations: (1) total stream length (47.2 to 74.6%); (2) average stream slope (68 to 83%); and (3) drainage density (24.2 to 51.5%). The spatial density of weather grid integration reduced from 5 to 33.33% in the coarse schemes. The annual mean potential evapo-transpiration, evapotranspiration, and lateral flow slightly decreased, while areal rainfall, surface runoff, and water yield slightly increased with the increases of TDAs. It was concluded that the fine TDAs produced finer and higher ranges of snowmelt runoff volume across the watershed. All TDAs had similar capacities to replicate the observed tendency of monthly mean streamflow hydrograph, except overestimated/underestimated peak flows. Spatial variation of streamflow was well analyzed in the fine schemes with high density of stream networks, while the coarse schemes simplified this. Watershed subdivisions affected model performances, in the way of decreasing the accuracy of monthly streamflow simulation, at 60% of investigated hydro-gauging stations (3/5 stations) and in the upstream. Furthermore, watershed subdivisions strongly affected the calibration process regarding the changes in sensitivity ranking of 18 calibrated model parameters and time it took to calibrate. © 2021 The Authors.","Arctic watershed Målselv; Hydrological simulations; Snowmelt runoff; SWAT; Threshold drainage area (TDA); Watershed subdivisions","Evapotranspiration; Rivers; Runoff; Snow melting systems; Stream flow; Arctic watershed malselv; Drainage area; Hydrological simulations; Norwegian Arctic; Snowmelt runoff; Spatial densities; SWAT; Threshold drainage area; Watershed subdivision; Weather inputs; Watersheds; drainage basin; hydrological modeling; quantitative analysis; runoff; snowmelt; soil and water assessment tool; spatial variation; watershed; weather; Arctic; Norway",Article,Scopus

In response, the agroforestry technology intercropping of Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.)) and Maize (Zea mays L.) was developed to complement conventional soil fertility management technologies. However, diversified information on the profitability of Gliricidia‐Maize intercropping system in dryland areas is scanty. Using data from the Gliricidia and maize models of the Next Generation version of the Agriculture Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM), this study estimates the profitability of the Gliricidia‐Maize system relative to an unfertilized sole maize system. Results show significant heterogeneity in profitability indicators both in absolute and relative economic terms. Aggregated over a 20‐year cycle, Gliricidia‐Maize intercropping exhibited a higher Net Present Value (NPV = Tsh 19,238,798.43) and Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR = 4.27) than the unfertilized sole maize system. The NPV and BCR of the latter were Tsh 10,934,669.90 and 3.59, respectively. Moreover, the returns to labour per person day in the Gliricidia‐Maize system was 1.5 times those of the unfertilized sole maize system. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the profitability of the Gliricidia‐Maize system is more negatively affected by the decrease in output prices than the increase in input prices. A 30% decrease in the former leads to a decrease in NPV and BCR by 38% and 30%, respectively. Despite the higher initial costs of the agroforestry establishment, the 30% increase in input prices affects more disproportionally unfertilized sole maize than the Gliricidia‐Maize system in absolute economic terms, i.e., 11.1% versus 8.8% decrease in NPV. In relative economic terms, an equal magnitude of change in input prices exerts the same effect on the unfertilized sole maize and the Gliricidia‐maize systems. This result implies that the monetary benefits accrued after the first year of agroforestry establishment offset the initial investment costs. The Gliricidia‐Maize intercropping technology therefore is profitable with time, and it can contribute to increased household income and food security. Helping farmers to overcome initial investment costs and manage agroforestry technologies well to generate additional benefits is critical for the successful scaling of the Gliricidia‐ Maize intercropping technology in dryland areas of Dodoma, Tanzania. : © 2021 by the authors.

In the present study, a water balance of reservoir for computation of runoff coupled with the application of spatially distributed Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, the SWAT model and SWAT–CUP application have been proposed for hydrological modeling can be used asses the inflows for efficient reservoir operation and planning of releases. The proposed methodology has been applied on Tandula reservoir catchment in Chhattisgarh state of India, which is well-known for its paddy cultivation and any short supply affect the economic status of marginal farmers in the command. The water balance of Tandula reservoir has been carried out for the period of 1991 to 2015 using daily reservoir levels, releases, evaporation, seepage, supplies from other sources, and spillway information. The percentage error in water balance analysis of Tandula reservoir varied between − 6.87 and 3.39% and seem reasonably well matched. The runoff obtained from water balance was checked with the SCS–CN technique and found close resemblance on the monthly and yearly basis. The digital image processing of remote sensing data has been used for determination of land uses and found that forest and agriculture land with rice cultivation are the principal land uses covering nearly 86% area of the catchment. The sensitivity analysis suggested that SCS curve number (r_CN2), saturated hydraulic conductivity (sol_k), soil antecedent water content (sol_AWC), and Manning’s N for the main channel (Ch_N2) are the most sensitive parameters.

The model performance was adjudged using P-factor, r-factor, and Nash–Sutcliff efficiency, and best-fit model parameters were determined. The Nash–Sutcliff efficiency for calibration and validation were found as 0.75 and 0.65 respectively suggested that the developed model can be used for assessment of runoff from the catchment.

The classification methodology is adapted in order to be trained with a limited number of extreme cases. Using four weather predictors—the average temperature in July and August, and the SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index) in June and July—71% of the extreme cases are well classified by this statistical model.

The intervariable, spatial, and temporal dependencies of the corrected data are usually poor compared to observations.Here, the authors propose a novel method for multivariate BC. The empirical copula-bias correction (EC-BC) combines a one-dimensional BC with a shuffling technique that restores an empirical multidimensional copula. Several BC methods are investigated and compared to high-resolution reference data over the FrenchMediterranean basin: notably, (i) a 1D BC method applied independently to precipitation and temperature fields, (ii) a recent conditional correction approach developed for producing correct two-dimensional intervariable structures, and (iii) the EC-BC method. Assessments are realized in terms of intervariable, spatial, and temporal dependencies, and an objective evaluation using the integrated quadratic distance (IQD) is presented. As expected, the 1D methods cannot produce correct multidimensional properties. The conditional technique appears efficient for intervariable properties but not for spatial and temporal dependencies. EC-BC provides realistic dependencies in all respects: intervariable, spatial, and temporal. The IQD results are clearly in favor of EC-BC. As many BC methods, EC-BC relies on a stationarity assumption and is only able to reproduce patterns inherited from historical data. However, because of its ease of coding, its speed of application, and the quality of its results, the EC-BC method is a very good candidate for all needs in multivariate bias correction. © 2015 American Meteorological Society.","Bias; Precipitation; Statistical techniques; Temperature","Climatology; Precipitation (chemical); Temperature; Bias; Correction approaches; High resolution; Historical data; Objective evaluation; Shuffling technique; Statistical techniques; Temporal structures; Climate models; air temperature; atmospheric correction; atmospheric modeling; climate modeling; data quality; multivariate analysis; precipitation (climatology); spatiotemporal analysis",Article,Scopus

Our results indicate that NPS pollution was the dominant contribution (>94%) to nutrient loads except for mineral phosphorus (50%). A comprehensive Water Quality Index (WQI) computed using eight key water quality variables demonstrates that water quality is better upstream than downstream despite the higher level of ammonium nitrogen found in upstream waters. Also, the temporal (seasonal) and spatial distributions of nutrient loads clearly indicate the critical time period (from late dry season to early wet season) and pollution source areas within the basin (middle and downstream agricultural lands), which resource managers can use to accomplish substantial reduction of NPS pollutant loadings. Overall, this study helps our understanding of the relationship between human activities and pollutant loads and further contributes to decision support for local watershed managers to protect water quality in this region.

In this study, we improved the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to explicitly consider the thermal processes influencing the temperature of various terrestrial water components (i.e., surface runoff, lateral flow, and base flow) and the heat balance of water in streams. The improved SWAT model with an explicit heat balance description on both terrestrial and aquatic thermal processes (SWAT-HB) was compared with previous versions of the SWAT model that employ only empirical relationships between air temperature and stream temperature (SWAT-ER) or combine empirical terrestrial water temperature estimates with the heat balance of stream water (SWAT-EH) for the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) and Greensboro Watershed (GW) in the United States. The results show that, even though the SWAT-HB better simulates terrestrial thermal processes, all three models produce comparable simulations of long-term stream temperatures, indicating that stream temperature is mainly influenced by air temperature as water travels along large rivers. Nevertheless, the SWAT-HB and SWAT-EH models achieved better performance than the SWAT-ER model in the winter and spring but exhibited mixed performance in the summer and fall. The better model performance of the SWAT-HB model than the SWAT-EH model can be attributed to the improved estimation of terrestrial water temperature components. Although, empirical methods (e.g., SWAT-ER) are suitable for providing estimation of stream temperature, the coupled terrestrial and aquatic heat balance-based methods (e.g., SWAT-HB) allow for the consideration of land and water management practices (e.g. crop irrigation, land use change, and water use for thermoelectric cooling) effects on stream temperature. © 2021","Heat balance; Stream temperature; Upper Mississippi River; Watershed modeling","Aquatic ecosystems; Atmospheric temperature; Indicators (chemical); Rivers; Runoff; Specific heat; Water management; Water quality; Watersheds; Heat balance; Mississippi river; Soil and Water assessment tools; Stream temperatures; Thermal process; Tool models; Upper Mississippi; Upper mississippi river; Water temperatures; Watershed modelling; Land use; aquatic ecosystem; mountain stream; soil and water assessment tool; stream; streamwater; terrestrial ecosystem; water quality; watershed; Indicator indicator",Article,Scopus

Rice farmers, policymakers and other stakeholders thus need to understand and manage the risks associated with climate variability, including those related to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) – the most important source of variability affecting Colombian climates. The objectives of this study were to (1) assess the ENSO influence on the spatio-temporal variability of agro-climatic conditions (crop water requirements, dry and wet spells, and heatwaves) and rice yield across the central producing region of Colombia; and (2) identify the main agro-climatic factors driving crop yield variability. Results showed that rice irrigation water requirements under positive ENSO phases (El Niño) increased by up to 14% compared to the long-term average. These increases were associated with less total precipitation, more dry days and longer dry spells, together with a greater number of day-and-night heatwave episodes. During negative phases (La Niña), on the other hand, irrigation requirements decreased by 16% with respect to the long-term average due to longer and more frequent wet spells, and more total precipitation. Analyses of simulated yields indicated that El Niño years reduce crop yield in about 86% of the study region, while La Niña affects 62% of the region positively. The number of heat nights (i.e. nights with minimum temperature > 23°C) during the growing season was the most important agro-climatic factor causing yield losses during ENSO events. Our results represent an important step towards understanding the interaction between climate variability and rice production in Colombia, which is useful for improving climate risk management at local levels. © 2021","Agro-climatic indices; Climate risk; Colombia; El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO); La Niña; Simulated rice yield","crop production; crop yield; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; environmental factor; heat wave; policy making; rice; spatiotemporal analysis; stakeholder; Colombia",Article,Scopus

Commonly, more fertilizers have been applied to improve grain yield. There is a need to optimize fertilizers, to reduce environmental pollution, and to increase agricultural production. Maize is the main crop in China, and its ample production is of vital importance to guarantee regional food security. In this study, the RGB and multispectral images, and maize grain yields were collected from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform. To confirm the optimal indices, RGB-based vegetation indices and textural indices, multispectral-based vegetation indices, and crop height were independently applied to build linear regression relationships with maize grain yields. A stepwise regression model (SRM) was applied to select optimal indices. Three machine learning methods including: backpropagation network (BP), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) and the SRM were separately applied for predicting maize grain yields based on optimal indices. RF achieved the highest accuracy with a coefficient of determination of 0.963 and root mean square error of 0.489 (g/hundred-grain weight). Through the grey relation analysis, the N was the most correlated indicator, and the optimal ratio of fertilizers N/P/K was 2:1:1.

We reviewed 215 papers found in the literature that contained field observed data where the CERES models were tested. Over 30 simulated variables of the CERES models have been tested in 43 different countries under various experimental treatments. Across all testing conditions, the CERES models simulated grain yield with a root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 1400 kg/ha (~10% relative error, RE), 1200 kg/ha (~20% RE) and 800 kg/ha (~10% RE) for maize, wheat, and rice, respectively. Phenological development was simulated with less than 7 days difference from the observations in most studies. The CERES models simulated aboveground biomass, harvest index, evapotranspiration, and soil water reasonably well too. The simulations of grain number (up to 4340 root mean square error, RMSE), grain weight (up to 22% error), intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR, up to 0.41 MJ/plant), leaf area index (LAI, 31.9% error), soil temperature (over 10°C difference), and nitrogen (N) dynamics (up to 80% error) were less accurate.

Satellite imagery is an interesting big data source that has potential applications in agriculture. When applying satellite imagery for crop yield estimation, practitioners choose which resolution (i.e., grid size) of images to use. Processing higher resolution images requires greater computing resources compared to lower resolution images. Practitioners may choose to use lower resolution images, but there may be a loss in crop yield model estimation accuracy. The cost of computation has decreased significantly with the advent of cloud computing and open access computing portals such as Google Earth Engine. These technologies have made satellite image processing more economical. The objective of this research is to quantify the crop yield estimation accuracy improvement that could be achieved by using higher resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with a cropland mask. NDVI (a measure of crop greenness) data was collected for 48 U.S. states for four crops over 11 years. The crops investigated were corn, soybeans, spring wheat, and winter wheat. Each crop yield regression model estimation showed improved accuracy (R2) as the satellite NDVI resolution increased. Results suggest that using higher resolution satellite NDVI provides more accurate crop yield estimation compared to lower resolution satellite NDVI. This study is believed to be the most comprehensive study to date using NDVI to estimate crop yield, analyzing 48 states in the U.S. and four crops over 11 years using three resolution levels. © 2022","Big data; Crop insurance; Crop yield estimation; NDVI; Remote sensing",,Article,Scopus

Researchers used statistical inference for discovering the relationships of data to build predictive model. However, crop production and its price trend do not only depend on ecosystems, molecular biology, precision agriculture, veterinary science, animal genes, and technology, but also depend on the environmental change and economic factors. Most importantly, the crop price trend is in non-stationary pattern and is influenced by multiple dimensional factors that the traditional techniques of time series forecasting, such as ARIMA, cannot perform well in prediction. Since CNN model can cope with non-stationary data and learn non-linearity by adjusting the model parameters, it can overcome the limitations of the traditional statistical methods in prediction. Therefore, the aims of this research are to conduct a review to identify a more complete factors that may influence crop production and price changes, and to propose a novel Clustered 3D-CNN model for predicting crop future price.

It can be achieved with empirical models developed with the information provided by vegetation indices (VI). This work evaluated the performance of different time series of VI for the predictive modelling of wheat production and yield in Spain comparing two sources of cropland masks: wheat mask using Common Agricultural Policy declarations (CAP), and arable land from Corine Land Cover (CLC). Both sources were used to analyse the improvement derived from considering specific wheat masks. The wheat production and yield were modelled using time series of MODIS NDVI and EVI2 (2006 to 2016) from weekly surface reflectance products (MOD09Q1 v6) at 250 meters. The sum of VI values of one month after the maximum was used as this period is related with yield and production. VI indicators were filtered and aggregated to NUTS-3 level. The cropland masks were obtained either by combining the parcel boundaries with the CAP wheat reports, or from the CLC arable land category of 2006 and 2012 maps. Production (t) and yield (t ha-1) estimates were obtained from official statistics. Subsequently, different regression analyses were carried to build an overall model and single models for some NUTS2. Models using CAP wheat masks outperformed those of CLC, predicting more accurately production than yield. The best performance for production models using CAP was that of EVI2 in Castille and Leon (R2=96% and Normalized Relative Error (NRE)=14.72%) and the best for CLC that of EVI2 in Spain (R2=55% and NRE=58.01%). Regarding yield modelling, CAP with EVI2 in Aragon was the best (R2=81% and NRE=10.57%) as well as CLC with EVI2 in Spain overall model (R2=50% and NRE=22.34%). The findings of this work suggest that the use of specific crop masks is of paramount importance for the predictive modeling of crop production. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

However, transferring this technology to farms is not easy. This study aimed to make a variable fertilization map in a commercial plot where there is no data from a yield monitor, combining machine learning techniques and farmer’s knowledge. In addition to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from Sentinel-2 and a digital elevation model (DEM), information captured by a yield monitor in 2019 was used to train and validate models. Among the 15 algorithms trained, the best result was obtained by the random forest (RF), with an RMSE of 496 and R2 of 0.90. Using the “leave one out” technique, the capacity to predict an entire plot was tested. Finally, the RF algorithm was tested on a 12-hectare wheat plot where no yield data were available. The novelty of this work lies in the collaborative work developed between farmers and researchers to implement the VRF technique in plots where precise yield data do not exist and in the “leave one out” validation. The collaboration between scientists and farmers resulted in a very positive exchange of information that allowed the farmer to change the fertilization strategy of the whole farm and the scientists to better understand how soil properties and plot history affect yield. © 2022 by the authors.","NDVI; nitrogen fertilization; on-farm experimentation; precision agriculture; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

Furthermore, earlier treatment reduces the amount of yield loss and therefore boosts crop production during a given season. With this in mind, we collect sequences of high-resolution aerial imagery and construct semantic segmentation models to detect and predict NDS across the field; our work sits at the intersection of agriculture, remote sensing, and deep learning. First, we establish a baseline for full-field detection of NDS and quantify the impact of pretraining, backbone architecture, input representation, and sampling strategy. We then quantify the amount of information available at different points in the season by building a single-timestamp model based on a U-Net. Next, we construct our proposed spatiotemporal architecture, which combines a U-Net with a convolutional LSTM to accurately detect regions of the field showing NDS; this approach has an impressive IOU score of 0.53. Finally, we show that this architecture can be trained to predict regions of the field which are expected to show NDS in a later flight- potentially more than three weeks in the future- maintaining an IOU score of 0.47- 0.51 depending on how far in advance the prediction is made. We will also release a dataset which we believe will benefit the computer vision, remote sensing, and agriculture fields.

As such, it is crucial to accurately estimate within-season yield in order to provide critical information for farm management and decision making. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to assess the most appropriate method, indices, and growth stage for predicting the groundnut yield in smallholder agricultural systems in northern Malawi. We have estimated the yield of groundnut in two smallholder farms using the observed yield and vegetation indices (VIs), which were derived from multitemporal PlanetScope satellite data. Simple linear, multiple linear (MLR), and random forest (RF) regressions were applied for the prediction. The leave-one-out cross-validation method was used to validate the models. The results showed that (i) of the modelling approaches, the RF model using the five most important variables (RF5) was the best approach for predicting the groundnut yield, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.96 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.29 kg/ha, followed by the MLR model (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 0.84 kg/ha); in addition, (ii) the best within-season stage to accurately predict groundnut yield is during the R5/beginning seed stage. The RF5 model was used to estimate the yield for four different farms. The estimated yields were compared with the total reported yields from the farms. The results revealed that the RF5 model generally accurately estimated the groundnut yields, with the margins of error ranging between 0.85% and 11%. The errors are within the post-harvest loss margins in Malawi. The results indicate that the observed yield and VIs, which were derived from open-source remote sensing data, can be applied to estimate yield in order to facilitate farming and food security planning. © 2022 by the authors.","food security; Malawi; PlanetScope; random forest regression; vegetation indices; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

It is then tested for timely estimation of maize grain yields and their year-on-year variability in Burkina Faso. Outputs from the SARRA-O crop model were used as a proxy for observed data for calibration. The final remote sensing-based yield model was constructed on the interaction between aboveground biomass at flowering (AGB-F) and crop water stress (Cstr) over the reproductive and maturation phases. Various vegetation and drought-related indices were derived from different spectral domains and tested. Model performance was evaluated by cross-validation against (a) simulated yields and (b) independent yields from ground surveys aggregated at village level. The results showed that the RF (Random Forest) model outperformed the MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) model for year-on-year yield estimation at the end of the season when compared to simulated yields. Surface soil moisture (SSM) information, as a proxy for soil water available for plant growth, together with information on the temperature of the canopy cover, helped to improve the RF maize yield model, impacting more particularly the estimation of crop water stress. Lastly, two months before harvest the RF model predicted 46% of the observed end-of-season maize grain yield variability. The combined remote sensing, crop model and machine learning method is thus an effective approach for estimating and forecasting inter-annual maize crop yields in environments where field data are scarce, such as in most parts of the African continent.

Landsat satellite images based on seven land use classes which were defined for this basin are forest deciduous (FRSD), forest mixed (FRST), mixed crop (RWSW), barren land (BARN), hay (HAY), residential (URBN) and water body (WATR). The LULC (1985–2035) result showed an increase in URBN from 0.29 to 2.81% while the rate of change (RoC) for URBN was calculated to be 8.71%. A continuous reduction was seen in FRSD from 15.57 to 9.77% giving the RoC as − 0.37%. The FRST increased at the RoC of 1.95% from 0.6 to 1.77% while the mixed crop (RWSW) increased from 72.68 to 78.27% at the RoC of 0.77%. The other LULC classes showed similar results. The hydrologic impacts were analyzed by running SWAT for the LULC changes in order to predict the corresponding changes in the hydrologic process. In this consequence SWAT was run for five decades from 1985 to 1995, 1995–2005, 2005–2015 (before baseline scenario) and 2015–2025, 2025–2035 (after baseline scenario) assuming 2015 as a baseline scenario. Evaluation of the impact of LULC changes revealed that there was decrease in surface runoff, from 62.29 to 62.14% and lateral flow from 2.39 to 0.261% for the period of 2015 to 2035. The groundwater flow showed a slight increment from 37.42 to 37.62% while the total water yield increased from 774.74 to 776.74 mm. The simulated results for TRB showed that the hydrological processes in the watershed were minimally influenced by LULC changes. It was concluded that the basin’s LULC change was not pronounced and was minimally affected by natural and artificial changes. The hydrological changes were not correlated with LULC changes.

This study performed a comparative analysis of multitemporal Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference index (NDVI) data for estimating rice crop yields in the Mekong River Delta (MRD), Vietnam. We processed the data for a 10-year period (2002-2011) following three main steps: (1) create a smooth time series of EVI and NDVI data, (2) formulate crop yield models, and (3) validate the model. The comparison results between EVI/NDVI-based estimated yields and the government's yield statistics indicated a significant relationship between the two datasets (p-value&lt;0.001). The estimated results produced from EVI-based models were slightly more accurate than those from NDVI-based models, with the correlation coefficients (R2) ranging from 0.62 to 0.71 for spring-winter and 0.4 to 0.56 for summer-autumn rice crops, respectively. The root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) used to measure the model accuracy revealed the consistency between EVI-based estimated yields and the government's yield statistics.

The method devises a multivariate statistical model to compute bias and uncertainty in forecasted yield at the Census of Agricultural Region (CAR) scale across the Canadian Prairies. The method uses robust variable-selection to select the best predictors within spatial subregions. Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and random forest-tree machine learning techniques are then integrated to generate sequential forecasts through the growing season. Cross-validation of the model was performed by hindcasting/backcasting and comparing forecasts against available historical data (1987-2011) for spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The model was also validated for the 2012 growing season by comparing forecast skill at the CAR, provincial and Canadian Prairie region scales against available statistical survey data. Mean percent departures between wheat yield forecasted were under-estimated by 1-4% in mid-season and over-estimated by 1% at the end of the growing season. This integrated methodology offers a consistent, generalizable approach for sequentially forecasting crop yield at the regional-scale. It provides a statistically robust, yet flexible way to concurrently adjust to data-rich and data-sparse situations, adaptively select different predictors of yield to changing levels of environmental uncertainty, and to update forecasts sequentially so as to incorporate new data as it becomes available. This integrated method also provides additional statistical support for assessing the accuracy and reliability of model-based crop yield forecasts in time and space. © 2014 Newlands, Zamar, Kouadio, Zhang, Chipanshi, Potgieter, Toure and Hill.","Agriculture; Bayesian; Climate; Crop yield; Forecasting; Regional; Uncertainty",,Article,Scopus

However, the challenges to biofuel development are its effects on the environment, especially water quality. This study evaluates the long-term impacts of biofuel production alternatives (e.g., elevated corn stover removal rates and the potential land cover change) on an ecosystem with a focus on biomass production, soil erosion, water quantity and quality, and soil nitrate nitrogen concentration at the watershed scale. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was modified for setting land cover change scenarios and applied to the Iowa River Basin (a tributary of the Upper Mississippi River Basin). Results show that biomass production can be sustained with an increased stover removal rate as long as the crop demand for nutrients is met with appropriate fertilization. Although a drastic increase (4.7-70.6%) in sediment yield due to erosion and a slight decrease (1.2-3.2%) in water yield were estimated with the stover removal rate ranging between 40% and 100%, the nitrate nitrogen load declined about 6-10.1%. In comparison to growing corn, growing either switchgrass or miscanthus can reduce sediment erosion greatly. However, land cover changes from native grass to switchgrass or miscanthus would lead to a decrease in water yield and an increase in nitrate nitrogen load. In contrast to growing switchgrass, growing miscanthus is more productive in generating biomass, but its higher water demand may reduce water availability in the study area. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Biofuel; Corn stover; Miscanthus; SWAT; Switchgrass; Water quantity and quality","Biofuel production; Biofuels production; Biomass productions; Corn stover; Land-cover change; Miscanthus; Native grass; Nitrate nitrogen; Perennial grass; Removal rate; River basins; Second generation; Sediment erosion; Sediment yields; Soil and water assessment tool; Soil erosion; Study areas; SWAT; Switchgrass; Upper Mississippi; Water availability; Water demand; Water quantities; Water yield; Watershed scale; Anoxic sediments; Biofuels; Biomass; Dewatering; Erosion; Forestry; Landforms; Nitrogen; Rivers; Runoff; Sedimentology; Soils; Water quality; Watersheds; Nitrogen removal; biofuel; biomass power; environmental impact assessment; erosion control; fertilizer application; grass; land cover; maize; native species; nitrate; renewable resource; river basin; soil erosion; sustainability; water availability; water demand; water quality; water yield; watershed; Iowa; Iowa Basin; Mississinewa Basin; United States; Miscanthus; Panicum virgatum; Poaceae; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

In this study, the ArcSWAT model was applied to determine the sediment yield and sediment load of the Ungauged Huluka River watershed through the parameters transfer method. This particular study calibrated and validated the ArcSWAT model on the Guder River gauging station of watershed area 659 km2. The calibrated and validated best values were extended to all the sub-basin to estimate the sediment yield and sediment load of the ungauged Huluka River watershed. The ArcSWAT model was found certain with statistical performance procedures like regression coefficient, Nash–Sutcliffe and percentage of bias. The model was calibrated and validated with accepted statistical performance values on the monthly time scale. The statistical performance like regression coefficient, Nash and percentage of biased were dramatically increased upon the validation period to very good range according to Arnold et al. The estimated average sediment yield of the whole Guder sub-basin was found to be 4.3 (ton/ha). The annual average sediment load contributed from the Huluka River watershed was found to be 37.5 Kiloton/year. The estimated average annual sediment quantities at Guder gauging station and the whole Guder sub-basin were 344.8 Kiloton/year and 1.1 Megaton/year, with data ranging from 1998 to 2014 (17 years). Three different best management practices (BMPs) such as contouring, strip cropping and terracing were evaluated to see their effectiveness on the whole sub-basin. The sediment yield reduction with these BMPs was ranged from 58 to 62% at Guder hydro-gauging station with simulation period of 1998–2014.

There are growing interests to study the impacts of drought on crop. However, studies on the impacts of heat stress on crop photosynthesis and yield are still lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we used both statistical models and satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data to assess the impacts of heat stress on wheat yield in a major wheat growing region, the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), India. The statistical model showed that the relationships between different accumulated degree days (ADD) and reported wheat yield were significantly negative. The results confirmed that heat stress affected wheat yield across this region. Building on such information, satellite SIF observations were used to further explore the physiological basis of heat stress impacts on wheat yield. Our results showed that SIF had strong negative correlations with ADDs and was capable of monitoring heat stress. The SIF results also indicated that heat stress caused yield loss by directly impacting the photosynthetic capacity in wheat. Overall, our findings demonstrated that SIF as an effective proxy for photosynthetic activity would improve our understanding of the impacts of heat stress on wheat yield. © 2020 by the authors.

Our results show that soil N2O emissions can be modelled in a better way using microbial kinetics. © 2019 Elsevier LtdA conversion of the global terrestrial carbon sink to a source is critically dependent on the microbially mediated decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM). We have developed a detailed, process-based, mechanistic model for simulating SOM decomposition and its associated processes, based on Microbial Kinetics and Thermodynamics, called the MKT model. We formulated the sequential oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and chemical reactions undergoing at the soil-water zone using dual Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Soil environmental variables, as required in the MKT model, are simulated using one of the most widely used watershed-scale models - the soil water assessment tool (SWAT). The MKT model was calibrated and validated using field-scale data of soil temperature, soil moisture, and N2O emissions from three locations in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. The model evaluation statistics show good performance of the MKT model for daily soil N2O simulations. The results show that the proposed MKT model can perform better than the more widely used process-based and SWAT-based models for soil N2O simulations. This is because the multiple processes of microbial activities and environmental constraints, which govern the availability of substrates to enzymes were explicitly represented.

Several techniques are being used throughout the world for boosting agricultural productivity which has a major influence on global economic development. Even though such techniques expand agricultural crop production, still there are different challenges faced by the farmers in the production process. The crop damage, poor productivity, soil management, water management, weather forecasting, and insect-pest attacks are illustrations of such kinds of problems. The modern agriculture practices have been observed to be capable to address the aforementioned issues. The farmers can be trained to incorporate Information and Communication Technology (ICT) with modern farming practices. The low agricultural yields are also a result of uncertain climatic changes, insufficient irrigation facilities, decreasing soil fertility, and outdated farming methods. Recently, machine learning is the latest evolving technology that can be used for resolving agricultural issues, thereby fostering agricultural development.

Occurrences and numbers of insects can be monitored through insect traps, which include their permanent touring and checking of their condition. Another more efficient way is to set up sensor devices with a camera at the traps that will photograph the traps and forward the images to the Internet, where the pest insect’s appearance will be predicted by image analysis. Weather conditions, temperature and relative humidity are the parameters that affect the appearance of some pests, such as Helicoverpa armigera. This paper presents a model of machine learning that can predict the appearance of insects during a season on a daily basis, taking into account the air temperature and relative humidity. Several machine learning algorithms for classification were applied and their accuracy for the prediction of insect occurrence was presented (up to 76.5%). Since the data used for testing were given in chronological order according to the days when the measurement was performed, the existing model was expanded to take into account the periods of three and five days. The extended method showed better accuracy of prediction and a lower percentage of false detections. In the case of a period of five days, the accuracy of the affected detections was 86.3%, while the percentage of false detections was 11%. The proposed model of machine learning can help farmers to detect the occurrence of pests and save the time and resources needed to check the fields. © 2021 by the authors.

To simplify the procedure of generating weather realizations and make them available over the Internet, we implemented novel mechanisms for providing weather generators as web services, as well as a mechanism for sharing identical weather realizations given a climatological information. A web service for preparing long-term climate data was implemented based on an international standard, Sensor Observation Service (SOS). The weather generator services, which are the core components of the framework, analyze climatological data, and can take seasonal climate forecasts as inputs for generating weather realizations. The generated weather realizations are encoded in a standard format, which are ready for use to crop modeling. All outputs are generated in SOS standard, which broadens the extent of data sharing and interoperability with other sectoral applications, e.g., water resources management. These services facilitate the development of other applications requiring input weather realizations, as these can be obtained easily by just calling the service. The workload of analysts related to data preparation and handling of legacy weather generator programs can be reduced. The architectural design and implementation presented here can be used as a prototype for constructing further services on top of an interoperable sensor network system. © 2016 by the authors.","Climatological data; Crop model; Sensor observation service; Weather model; Weather realizations","Crops; Data handling; Information management; Interoperability; Sensor networks; Systems engineering; Water resources; Websites; Climatological data; Climatological information; Crop model; Design and implementations; Seasonal climate forecast; Sensor observation services; Water resources management; Weather modeling; Web services",Article,Scopus

Land surface patches within one HRU have identical hydrological properties (e.g., land use, soil, slope and management) and thus have similar hydrological responses. The non-spatial aspects of HRUs, however, are considered a key weakness of the SWAT model because it is difficult to determine the spatial locations and describe the interactions between different HRUs. Here, a new method to produce continuous HRUs with a clear spatial position for SWAT using Geographic Information System tools is proposed and then tested in a small catchment of the Taihu Basin, China. The SWAT model was then modified based on spatial continuous discretized HRUs accounting for the surface runoff lag difference of HRUs in one sub-basin. The results showed that the modified model was more sensitive to the lag in runoff processes and thus had better simulation accuracy. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Hydological response unit; Hydrological model; Runoff lag; Spatial discretization; Taihu basin","Catchments; Geographic information systems; Land use; Hydological response unit; Hydrological modeling; Runoff lags; Spatial discretizations; Taihu basins; Runoff; ecohydrology; GIS; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; land surface; runoff; spatial analysis; China; Taihu Basin",Article,Scopus

Sedimentation due to forest harvesting has been identified as one of the major threat to Upper Pearl River Watershed (UPRW) located in east central Mississippi. The overall objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of forest harvesting, particularly clear cutting and thinning, on hydrological and water quality characteristics at UPRW. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to assess hydrologic impacts such as flow, surface runoff and water yields, and water quality effect such as sediment yield. The statistical analysis such as coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (NSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and percentage bias (PBIAS) were used for evaluating SWAT efficiency for predicting average monthly flow. The calibrated SWAT model showed fair to good performance with R2 ranging from 0.70 to 0.74, NSE from 0.42 to 0.7, RMSE from 1.13 to 4.8 m3/s and PBIAS from 0.1% to .3%. SWAT also adequately predicted flow over the validation period with R2 ranging from 0.48 to 0.57, NSE from 0.40 to 0.59, RMSE from 0.38 to 3.53 m3/s and PBIAS from -0.08% to 0.32%. The preliminary findings on forest harvesting impacts showed that hydrological and water quality characteristics were consistently higher for clear cut scenarios compared to thinning, particularly when 20% forested area is considered clear cut. In addition, model results also indicated that harvesting impact was more apparent at the harvested site than over the entire watershed.","Clear cut harvest; Forest harvesting; Hydrology; Thinning; Water quality; Watershed","Anoxic sediments; Engineers; Forestry; Geologic models; Hydrology; Landforms; Mean square error; Quality control; Water quality; Watersheds; Clear cut harvest; Coefficient of determination; Forest harvesting; Forested area; Harvesting impacts; Hydrologic effects; Hydrologic impacts; Hydrological process; Mississippi; Model results; Monthly flow; Pearl River; Root mean square errors; Sediment yields; Significant impacts; Soil and water assessment tool; Surface runoffs; SWAT model; Thinning; Validation periods; Water quality characteristics; Water yield; Harvesting; Clear Cutting; Errors; Forestry; Harvesting; Hydrology; Mathematical Models; Mississippi; Quality Control; Rivers; Sediments; Thinning; Water Quality; Water Sheds",Conference Paper,Scopus

Drainage water management showed potential for reducing annual average (1915-2006) drain flow from all drain spacings (10-35 m) regardless of the growing season operational strategy, with reductions varying between 52 and 55% for the drain spacings considered. Approximately 81 to 99% of the annual drain flow reduction occurred during the non-growing season, depending on the operational strategy. Fixed DWM operational strategies led to an increase in mean predicted yield for narrower spacings compared with conventional drainage systems. Maximum yield was achieved with no control for drain spacings wider than 20 m in 50% of the years. Overall, the height of control had more influence on relative yield than the date of initiation of control. The greatest positive impacts of DWM on relative yield (1.2%) occurred in cool, dry years, while the greatest average negative impacts (-0.2%) occurred in cool, wet years. On average, with the best-case operation selected for annual weather conditions, DWM increased relative yield by approximately 0.8, 0.4, and 0.2% for the 10-, 20-, and 30-m drain spacing, respectively.

However, estimating daily SST with both high precision and high spatial completeness remains a challenge. This article attempts to solve this problem by merging two complementary daily SST products, that is, the 25 km-resolution Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) SST and 4 km-resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) SST, using a genetic algorithm–assisted deep neural network model (GA-DNNM). The merged SST with a spatial resolution of 4 km and a temporal resolution of 1 day is achieved. Experiments in the Asia and Indo-Pacific Ocean (AIPO) region in 2005 were conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of the proposed method. Results showed that the spatial coverages of the original MODIS SST and AMSR-E SST are ranging from 25.0 to 48.1%, and 31.5 to 47.6%, respectively, while the merged SST achieves a spatial coverage ranging from 56.1 to 73.1%, with improvements ranging from 50.2 to 131.7% relative to the original MODIS SST. Comparisons with drifting buoy observations indicate that the merged SST is accurate, with an average bias of 0.006°C and an average RMSE of 0.502°C, in places where the MODIS SST data are missing before being merged in the AIPO area, and with an average bias of −0.082 °C, and an average RMSE of 0.603°C for the merged SST in the whole study area.

Mechanical transplanting is gaining popularity as a cost-saving and on-time operation with less labor orientation in rice cultivation. This experiment was performed to investigate the relation of rice yield (g m−2) with four mechanical rice transplanting parameters (i.e., seedling density in the tray (nos.cm−2), missing hill percentage, floating hill percentage, and seedling number per hill), and to develop an Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) model to predict the yield from the transplanting parameters. A regression analysis was also conducted to validate the accuracy of the trained ANN model. This study reveals that the dependency of yield on these four parameters is not ignorable and significant. The ANN model performed an accurate match in predicting yield from transplanting parameters with an R2 value of 0.994 and adjusted R2 of 0.993. The ANN model possessed an RMSE of 4.577 in predicting yield which lied in the allowable range of 10 %. The ANN model showed better accuracy in predicting yield than the regression model and pretended to be an alternative to numerical models in predicting yield.

The productivity of tree crops such as almond orchards, is particularly complex. To understand and mitigate these threats requires a collection of multi-layer large data sets, and advanced analytics is also critical to integrate these highly heterogeneous datasets to generate insights about the key constraints on the yields at tree and field scales. Here we used a machine learning approach to investigate the determinants of almond yield variation in California’s almond orchards, based on a unique 10-year dataset of field measurements of light interception and almond yield along with meteorological data. We found that overall the maximum almond yield was highly dependent on light interception, e.g., with each one percent increase in light interception resulting in an increase of 57.9 lbs/acre in the potential yield. Light interception was highest for mature sites with higher long term mean spring incoming solar radiation (SRAD), and lowest for younger orchards when March maximum temperature was lower than 19°C. However, at any given level of light interception, actual yield often falls significantly below full yield potential, driven mostly by tree age, temperature profiles in June and winter, summer mean daily maximum vapor pressure deficit (VPDmax), and SRAD. Utilizing a full random forest model, 82% (±1%) of yield variation could be explained when using a sixfold cross validation, with a RMSE of 480 ± 9 lbs/acre. When excluding light interception from the predictors, overall orchard characteristics (such as age, location, and tree density) and inclusive meteorological variables could still explain 78% of yield variation. The model analysis also showed that warmer winter conditions often limited mature orchards from reaching maximum yield potential and summer VPDmax beyond 40 hPa significantly limited the yield. Our findings through the machine learning approach improved our understanding of the complex interaction between climate, canopy light interception, and almond nut production, and demonstrated a relatively robust predictability of almond yield. This will ultimately benefit data-driven climate adaptation and orchard nutrient management approaches. © Copyright © 2020 Jin, Chen, Lampinen and Brown.","artificial intelligence; big data; light interceptioon; nutrient management; Prunus dulcis; yield gap",,Article,Scopus

This study compares the utility of ant colony optimization (ACO), genetic algorithm (GA), and K-means methods to cluster climatic variables affecting the yield of rainfed wheat in northeast Iran from 1984 to 2010 (27 years). These variables included sunshine hours, wind speed, relative humidity, precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and the number of wet days. Seven climatic factors with higher correlations with detrended rainfed wheat yield were selected based on Pearson correlation coefficient significance (P value < 0.1). Three variables (i.e., sunshine hours, wind, and average relative humidity) were excluded for clustering. In the next step based on Pearson correlation (P value < 0.05) between the yield, and the seven climate attributes, fitness function, and silhouette index, only four attributes with higher correlation in its cluster were selected for reclustering. Four climate attributes had an extensive association with yield, so we used four-dimensional clustering to describe the common characteristics of low-, medium-, and high-yielding years, and this is the significance of this research that we have done four-dimensional clustering. The silhouette index showed that the best number of clusters for each station was equal to three clusters. At the last step, reclustering was done through the best-selected method. The results yielded that GA was the best method. © 2019, ISB.","Ant colony; Attribute; Fitness function; Genetic algorithm; Rainfed wheat; Silhouette index","artificial intelligence; cluster analysis; Iran; temperature; wheat; Artificial Intelligence; Cluster Analysis; Iran; Temperature; Triticum",Article,Scopus

Traditional approaches separately evaluate variable performance, which may lead to an inappropriate selection of physics parameterization combinations. Besides traditional approaches, we suggest an additional selection approach by considering the joint dependence structure (covariance structure) between key meteorological variables, i.e., precipitation P and temperature T. This is accomplished by empirical P and T copula functions and the X2-test, and is demonstrated in two locations in Kenya with different major precipitation processes. It is shown that the selection based on traditional approaches alone may lead to nonoptimal decisions in terms of joint dependence structure between P and T. It was found that the copula-based approach may reduce the need for complex multivariate bias correction, as demonstrated using local intensity scaling for P and linear scaling for T.

Streamflow contribution from the sub-watersheds varies throughout the year; the larger of the two contributes greater flow in wetter seasons, while the smaller one has more regulation capacity and contributes more in summer. The data obtained from EC were used to calibrate the model, simulating this variability satisfactorily and even more-so when the model was forced during calibration. Additionally, EC measured at the outlet of the watershed was used to make a decomposition of the hydrograph (surface runoff - base flow), comparing the data obtained with those simulated by SWAT.

Both models have been calibrated against the observed daily runoff at the watershed outlet (Yingluoxia Hydrological Station) for the period of 1995-2004 and validated for the period of 2005-2009. Results show that both SWAT and DLBRM produced reasonable results in this study, and DLBRM performed better than SWAT. The difference in performance is mainly due to data constraints, different interpolation schemes, and spatial representations of landscape variations in the models. The tank storage-output principle used in DLBRM seems more suitable than the Soil Conservation Service curve number (SCS-CN) method used in SWAT to simulate daily flow in an arid area. Both models performed worse in simulating low flows mostly occurring in spring and winter, because of a lack of detailed representation of the impacts of snow-melting processes and frozen soils. The authors' analysis indicates that consideration of the impacts of snow melting and frozen soils on the hydrological process is key to improving performance of hydrological models in mountainous areas. Because of their simpler operations, lower data requirements, fewer input parameters, and better performances, distributed conceptual models such as DLBRM seem more suitable for hydrological modeling in data-deficient, high elevation, and topographically complex mountainous watersheds in arid regions. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Distributed large basin runoff model (DLBRM); Heihe River watershed; Model performance; Mountainous area; Soil and water assessment tool (SWAT)","Arid regions; Digital storage; Hydrology; Infiltration; Melting; Rivers; Runoff; Sea level; Snow; Soil conservation; Soils; Water resources; Watersheds; Heihe river; Large basin runoff models; Model performance; Mountainous area; Soil and water assessment tool; Frozen soils; arid region; comparative study; hydrological modeling; mountain stream; numerical model; peak flow; runoff; topographic effect; watershed; China; Gansu; Hei River",Article,Scopus

Our study area is the Tocantins-Araguaia River Basin (TAW), focusing on the Tucuruí Hydropower Plant (THP), downstream of the TAW. In this study, we evaluated four scenarios of change in land use and cover for the TAW in which forest areas were replaced by pasture, then by agriculture, then by reforestation vegetation and, finally, by regenerated forest to investigate the impacts on the hydrological components of the basin and the hydropower potential of the THP according to these scenarios. For this evaluation, the SWAT model was used to simulate the streamflow of each scenario, so it was possible to predict the hydropower potential in the TAW under different environmental perspectives. Nonparametric statistics were used to identify the efficiency of turbines in converting the streamflow into energy at the 5% significance level. A reduction was observed in the annual evapotranspiration rate and increments were observed in the surface runoff and streamflow, but despite the increase in flow, there was no increase in the energy produced at the THP due to the inability of the turbines to convert excess water into energy, with losses in the energy production of up to 30% per month and 65% in the annual balance.

This need for high-resolution data leads to apply projection techniques called downscaling. Downscaling can be performed according to two approaches: dynamical and statistical models. The latter approach is constituted by various statistical families conceptually different. If several studies have made some intercomparisons of existing downscaling models, none of them included all those families and approaches in a manner that all the models are equally considered. To this end, the present study conducts an intercomparison exercise under the EURO- and MED-CORDEX initiative hindcast framework. Six Statistical Downscaling Models (SDMs) and five Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are compared in terms of precipitation outputs. The downscaled simulations are driven by the ERAinterim reanalyses over the 1989–2008 period over a common area at 0.44° of resolution. The 11 models are evaluated according to four aspects of the precipitation: occurrence, intensity, as well as spatial and temporal properties. For each aspect, one or several indicators are computed to discriminate the models. The results indicate that marginal properties of rain occurrence and intensity are better modelled by stochastic and resampling-based SDMs, while spatial and temporal variability are better modelled by RCMs and resampling-based SDM. These general conclusions have to be considered with caution because they rely on the chosen indicators and could change when considering other specific criteria. The indicators suit specific purpose and therefore the model evaluation results depend on the end-users point of view and how they intend to use with model outputs. Nevertheless, building on previous intercomparison exercises, this study provides a consistent intercomparison framework, including both SDMs and RCMs, which is designed to be flexible, i.e., other models and indicators can easily be added. More generally, this framework provides a tool to select the downscaling model to be used according to the statistical properties of the local-scale climate data to drive properly specific impact models. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","CORDEX; Dynamical downscaling; Intercomparison; Precipitation; Statistical downscaling","climate modeling; downscaling; hindcasting; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; spatial variation; statistical analysis; temporal variation",Article,Scopus

Owing to the extreme arid climate conditions and scarce precipitation in the arid oasis regions, groundwater plays a key role in restricting the development of the vegetation. The Qira Oasis is located on the southern margin of the Taklimakan Desert (Tarim Basin, China) that is one of the most vulnerable regions regarding vegetation growth and water scarcity in the world. Based on remote sensing images of the Qira Oasis and daily meteorological data measured by the ground stations during the period 2006–2019, this study analyzed the temporal and spatial patterns of NPP in the oasis as well as its relation with the variation of groundwater depth using a modified Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model. At the spatial scale, NPP of the vegetation decreased from the interior of the Qira Oasis to the margin; at the temporal scale, NPP of the vegetation in the oasis fluctuated significantly (ranging from 29.80 to 50.07 g C/(m2·month)) but generally showed an increasing trend, with the average increase rate of 0.07 g C/(m2·month). The regions with decreasing NPP occupied 64% of the total area of the oasis. During the study period, NPP of both farmland and grassland showed an increasing trend, while that of forest showed a decreasing trend. The depth of groundwater was deep in the south of the oasis and shallow in the north, showing a gradual increasing trend from south to north. Groundwater, as one of the key factors in the surface change and evolution of the arid oasis, determines the succession direction of the vegetation in the Qira Oasis. With the increase of groundwater depth, grassland coverage and vegetation NPP decreased. During the period 2008–2015, with the recovery of groundwater level, NPP values of all types of vegetation with different coverages increased. This study will provide a scientific basis for the rational utilization and sustainable management of groundwater resources in the oasis. © 2021, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach; groundwater depth; land use; NDVI; net primary productivity; Qira Oasis","groundwater resource; image analysis; land use change; NDVI; net primary production; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; China; Qira Basin; Tarim Basin; Xinjiang Uygur",Article,Scopus

However, eco-hydrological modelling usually neglects crop rotations. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we present a Crop Generator to reproduce the stochastic characteristics of crop rotations at regional scale. METHODS: The Crop Generator emulates farmers’ decision making on crop rotation planning. We combined the Crop Generator with the eco-hydrological Soil and Water Integrated Model to show the hydrological relevance of considering crop rotations in a study region in central Europe including the Elbe River basin. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A spatial validation showed that the Crop Generator reproduced the given cropping patterns well. Higher daily discharge, runoff and groundwater seepage and lower evapotranspiration were simulated based on crop rotations compared with a simplified representation of cropping patterns. The Crop Generator is a solution to simulate more realistic cropping patterns in large-scale eco-hydrological modelling. It closes the gap between aggregated agricultural statistics and the requirement of representing crop rotations in a realistic way in eco-hydrological modelling.

Therefore, it is significant to understand the processes of soil erosion and sediment transport along rivers, and this can help identify the erosion prone areas and find potential measures to alleviate the environmental effects. In this study, we investigated soil erosion and identified the most seriously eroded areas in the East River Basin in southern China using a physically-based model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). We also introduced a classical sediment transport method (Zhang) into SWAT and compared it with the built-in Bagnold method in simulating sediment transport process along the river. The derived spatial soil erosion map and land use based erosion levels can explicitly illustrate the identification and prioritization of the critical soil erosion areas in this basin. Our results also indicate that erosion is quite sensitive to soil properties and slope. Comparison of Bagnold and Zhang methods shows that the latter can give an overall better performance especially in tracking the peak and low sediment concentrations along the river. We also found that the East River is mainly characterized by sediment deposition in most of the segments and at most times of a year. Overall, the results presented in this paper can provide decision support for watershed managers about where the best management practices (conservation measures) can be implemented effectively and at low cost. The methods we used in this study can also be of interest in sediment modeling for other basins worldwide. © 2012.","Bagnold equation; Sediment transport; Soil erosion; SWAT; Zhang equation","Decision support systems; Land use; River pollution; Rivers; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Soils; Watersheds; Bagnold equation; Global environmental problems; Non-point source pollution; Sediment transport process; Soil and water assessment tool; Soil erosion; SWAT; Zhang equation; Erosion; land degradation; modeling; nonpoint source pollution; sediment transport; sedimentation; soil erosion; soil property; article; China; concentration (parameters); decision support system; environmental management; intermethod comparison; land use; mathematical model; named inventories, questionnaires and rating scales; performance; priority journal; river; sediment transport; simulation; Soil and Water Assessment Tool; soil erosion; watershed management; China; Dong River",Article,Scopus

However, during droughts, the water resources are limited and determining the exact irrigation amount and its response to crop yields are crucial. Existing crop yield simulation models are data-intensive and a majority of these are point-based. Therefore, this study presents a novel integrated modeling framework by using two parsimonious models (CROPWAT, an irrigation water requirement simulation model; and AquaCrop-GIS, a spatial crop yield simulation model) to simulate corn and soybean yields under different irrigation application rates during drought years at a spatial scale in the Mobile River Basin (MRB), Southeast U.S. To simulate crop yields for drought years, first agricultural drought years are identified using an integrated drought index called the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Soil Moisture Index (SPESMI). The results indicate that a majority of the basin was affected by mild to extreme droughts during the years 2008, 2011, 2012, 2016. The results of the integrated modeling framework illustrate the potential corn and soybean yields can be increased from 10% to 259% and 20% to 229% respectively under different irrigation water application rates (50%, 75%, and 100% of irrigation water requirement) relative to rainfed crop yields at the counties in the MRB during drought years. These findings demonstrate the importance of overall irrigation and the integrated modeling framework in devising robust irrigation water management plans in drought-affected areas at a spatial scale. Failure in integrating irrigation water requirement models in crop yield simulations will result in erroneous yield simulations, especially during droughts – this is salient given projections for frequent and intense droughts globally. Although the study is focused on MRB, the framework developed is applicable for irrigation planners and water managers in any region that experiences mild to extreme droughts, as long as the farmers have the ability to adapt the irrigation in their practice given socio-economic constraints. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","AquaCrop-GIS; Corn; CROPWAT; Droughts; Mobile River Basin; Soybean","Crops; Drought; Irrigation; Soil moisture; Water management; Aquacrop-GIS; Corn; Crop yield; Crop yield simulations; CROPWAT; Integrated modeling framework; Mobile river basin; River basins; Simulation model; Soybean; Watersheds; agricultural modeling; assessment method; crop yield; drought; irrigation system; spatiotemporal analysis; water management; Alabama; Mobile Basin; United States",Article,Scopus

Understanding local vegetation changes is crucial for projecting ecosystem dynamics. In this paper, we make a case for Himalayan mountain areas to explore vegetation dynamics and their influencing factors. Firstly, the interannual trends of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were extracted by the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) algorithm and linear regression method. Moreover, the influence of environmental factors on interannual NDVI trends was assessed using the Random Forests algorithm and partial dependence plots. Subsequently, the time-lag effects of seasonal NDVI on different climatic factors were discussed and the effects of these factors on seasonal NDVI changes were determined by partial correlation analysis. The results show that (1) an overall weak upward trend was observed in NDVI variations from 1982 to 2015, and 1989 is considered to be the breakpoint of the NDVI time series; (2) interannual temperature trends and the shortest distance to large lakes were the most important factors in explaining interannual NDVI trends. Temperature trends were positively correlated with NDVI trends. The relationship between the shortest distance to large lakes and the NDVI trend is an inverted U-shaped; (3) the time-lags of NDVI responses to four climatic factors were shorter in Autumn than that in Summer. The NDVI responds quickly to precipitation and downward long-wave radiation; (4) downward long-wave radiation was the main climate factor that influenced NDVI changes in Autumn and the growing season because of the warming effect at night.

Reliable and robust hydrological drought predictions are critical for water and food security and ecosystem health under anthropogenic warming.

We therefore developed a new drought prediction model utilizing the Bayesian Model Averaging coupled with Vine Copula, called Bayesian Model Averaging Ensemble Vine Copula (BMAViC) model, in which previous meteorological drought, antecedent evaporative drought, and preceding hydrological drought were selected as three predictors. The BMAViC model was applied to the Upper Yellow River basin and showed robust skills during calibration and validation periods for 1- to 3-month lead hydrological drought predictions. In comparison with the MG model (reference model), the skills of the proposed model were relatively stable and superior under diverse lead times. Good performances under the 1- to 3-month lead times strongly implied that the BMAViC model yielded robust and accurate hydrological drought predictions.

Ensuring these models can represent cropping field heterogeneity and environmental impact is important, especially given the growing interest in using agroecosystem models to quantify ecosystem services from best management practices and land use change. We posited that augmenting process-based agroecosystem models with additional field-specific information such as topography, hydrologic processes, or independent indicators of yield could help limit simulation artifacts that obscure mechanisms driving observed variations. To test this, we augmented the agroecosystem model Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) with field-specific topography and satellite imagery in a simulation framework we call Foresite. We used Foresite to optimize APSIM yield predictions to match those created from a machine learning model built on remotely sensed indicators of hydrology and plant productivity. Using these improved subfield yield predictions to guide APSIM optimization, total N O 3 − N loss estimates increased by 39% in maize and 20% in soybeans when summed across all years. In addition, we found a disproportionate total amount of leaching in the lowest yielding field areas vs the highest yielding areas in maize (42% vs 15%) and a similar effect in soybeans (31% vs 20%). Overall, we found that augmenting process-based models with now-common subfield remotely sensed data significantly increased values of predicted nutrient loss from fields, indicating opportunities to improve field-scale agroecosystem simulations, particularly if used to calculate nutrient credits in ecosystem service markets. © 2022 The Author(s).

The studies were performed in-field monitoring by using a hybrid approach based on an extreme machine learning method (ELM) and tree growth optimization algorithm (TGO) to estimate corn yield, WP, and AE criteria.

The DTI method was compared with the standard furrow irrigation (FI). The field monitoring results showed that the DTI increased corn yield, WP, and AE by 22.2%, 0.58 kg/m3, and 70%, respectively, compared to the FI method. The modeling results showed that model M9 gave a more optimistic estimate of the corn crop, WP and AE by applying the parameters of irrigation levels, rainfall, and soil moisture as model inputs.

With the heightened concern of its water-quality implications, we need a method to design drainage systems for both crop production and environmental protection. The objective of this research was to develop an empirical equation that estimates the design drainage rate (DDR) for local soil and weather conditions. This DDR can then be used in the Hooghoudt equation to estimate the optimum drain spacing that maximizes profit. We conducted DRAINMOD simulations for each combination of four factors: three drain depths, three effective radii, seven locations, and five soils. For each combination of factors, simulations were repeated for a range of drain spacing from 5 to 100 m using 30 years (1990–2019) of weather data planted with continuous corn (Zea mays L.). Simulations provided a 30-year average relative corn yield and drainage discharge for each combination of factors. The drain spacings that maximized annual economic return on investment were identified as optimum spacings and used to calculate the DDR for each combination of factors. Results were then used in a multiple linear regression to develop two empirical equations for northeast and southeast USA with DDR as the dependent variable. The independent variables were the long-term average growing-season precipitation, drain depth, equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity, and depth to restrictive layer. The environmental value of the empirical equations is that they help avoid too narrow of a drain spacing, thereby preventing more drainage than is needed. In conclusion, application of these empirical equations is a means for estimating the site-specific optimum drain spacing that maximizes economic return on investment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Drain depth; Drain spacing; DRAINMOD; Effective radius; Subsurface drainage; Tile drainage","Crops; Design; Drainage; Groundwater flow; Hydraulic conductivity; Linear regression; Profitability; Water quality; Crop production; Drain depth; Drain spacings; Drainage rate; DRAINMOD; Economic returns; Effective radius; Empirical equations; Subsurface drainages; Tile drainage; Cultivation; agricultural land; crop production; growing season; maize; United States; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Enterprise-scale geographic information system (GIS) software and high-resolution aerial or satellite imagery are tools which are typically not available to or affordable for resource-limited communities. In this paper, we present a concept of aerial data collection, 3D cadastre modeling, and disaster risk assessment using low-cost drones and adapted open-source software. Computer vision/machine learning methods are used to create a classified 3D cadastre that contextualizes and quantifies potential natural disaster risk to existing or planned infrastructure. Building type and integrity are determined from aerial imagery. Potential flood damage risk to a building is evaluated as a function of three mechanisms: undermining (erosion) of the foundation, hydraulic pressure damage, and building collapse due to water load. Use of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) provides water runoff estimates that are improved using classified land features (urban ecology, erosion marks) to improve flow direction estimates. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to find these flood-induced erosion marks from high-resolution drone imagery.

Distributed stream temperature models are crucial for providing insights into variations of stream temperature for regions and time periods for which observed data do not exist.

The Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is used to calibrate flow at a single outlet and stream temperatures at five sites. Few studies have calibrated this stream temperature model for different basins, and this is the first demonstration of an automatic, subbasin-level calibration for stream temperature at multiple sites. The subbasin calibration is shown to better match the observed data than the original SWAT temperature model as well as the modified temperature model calibrated basinwide.

We focus on corn production as a significant contributor to the economy of the US Midwest. Nitrogen is one of the key nutrients needed to increase production efficiency, but its leaching and loss as nitrate through subsurface flow and agricultural drainage systems poses a threat to water quality. We build a novel two-stage stochastic mixed-integer program to find the annual farm management decisions that maximize the expected farm profit. A decomposition-based solution strategy is suggested to reduce the computational complexity resulting from the predominance of binary variables and complicated constraints. Case study results indicate that farmers may compensate for the additional risks associated with nutrient reduction strategies by increasing the planned nitrogen application rate. Significant financial incentives would be required for farmers to achieve substantial reductions in nitrate loss by fertilizer management alone.

Tea yield, however, has stagnated in recent years, due to changes in temperature, precipitation, the age of the tea bushes, and diseases. Developing an approach for monitoring tea bushes by remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) might be a way to alleviate this problem. Using multi-temporal remote sensing data, the paper details an investigation of the changes in tea health and yield forecasting through the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In this study, we used NDVI as a support tool to demonstrate the temporal and spatial changes in NDVI through the extract tea NDVI value and calculate the mean NDVI value. The results of the study showed that the minimum NDVI value was 0.42 during January 2013 and February 2015 and 2016. The maximum NDVI value was in August 2015 and June 2017. We indicate that the linear relationship between NDVI value and mean temperature was strong with R2 = 0.79 Our results confirm that the combination of meteorological data and NDVI data can achieve a high performance of yield prediction. Three models to predict tea yield were conducted: support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and the traditional linear regression model (TLRM). For period 2009 to 2018, the prediction tea yield by the RF model was the best with a R2 = 0.73, by SVM it was 0.66, and 0.57 with the TLRM. Three evaluation indicators were used to consider accuracy: the coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and percentage error of tea yield (PETY). The highest accuracy for the three models was in 2015 with a R2 ≥ 0.87, RMSE &lt; 50 kg/ha, and PETY less 3% error. In the other years, the prediction accuracy was higher in the SVM and RF models. Meanwhile, the RF algorithm was better than PETY (≤10%) and the root mean square error for this algorithm was significantly less (≤80 kg/ha). RMSE and PETY showed relatively good values in the TLRM model with a RMSE from 80 to 100 kg/ha and a PETY from 8 to 15%. © 2020 by the authors.","NDVI; Random forest (RF); Remote sensing; Support vector machine (SVM); Tea monitoring; Yield forecasting","Crops; Decision trees; Errors; Forecasting; Logistic regression; Mean square error; Meteorology; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Coefficient of determination; Evaluation indicators; Linear regression models; Linear relationships; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Normalized difference vegetation index; Root mean square errors; Temporal and spatial changes; Tea",Article,Scopus

Therefore, the accurate prediction of winter temperature in extended range is of utmost importance. The National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) has been providing climatic variables from the fully coupled global climate model, known as Climate Forecast System version 1 (CFSv1) on monthly to seasonal scale since 2004, and it has been upgraded to CFSv2 subsequently in 2011. In the present study, the performance of CFSv1 and CFSv2 in simulating the winter 2 m maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures (Tmax, Tmin, and Tmean, respectively) over India is evaluated with respect to India Meteorological Department (IMD) 1° × 1° observations. The hindcast data obtained from both versions of CFS from 1982 to 2009 (27 years) with November initial conditions (lead-1) are used. The analyses of winter (Tmax, Tmin, and Tmean) temperatures revealed that CFSv1 and CFSv2 are able to replicate the patterns of observed climatology, interannual variability, and coefficient of variation with a slight negative bias. Of the two, CFSv2 is appreciable in capturing increasing trends of winter temperatures like observed. The Tmax, Tmin, and Tmean correlations from CFSv2 is significantly high (0.35, 0.53, and 0.51, respectively), while CFSv1 correlations are less (0.29, 0.15, and 0.12) and insignificant. This performance of CFSv2 may be due to the better estimation of surface heat budget terms and realistic CO2 concentration, which were absent in CFSv1. CFSv2 proved to have a high probability of detection in predicting different categories (below, near, and above normal) for winter Tmin, which are required for crop yield and public utility services, over north India. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.",,"air temperature; climate modeling; climate prediction; climate variation; climatology; heat budget; weather forecasting; winter; India",Article,Scopus

SWAT-CUP (SWAT-Calibration and Uncertainty Programs) was used for model calibration, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, following the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) technique. The model calibration was performed for the period (1987-1999), with initial 3 years of warm up (1987-89); then, the model was validated for the subsequent 6 years of data (2000-2005). To assess the competence of model calibration and uncertainty, two indices, the p-factor (observations bracketed by the prediction uncertainty) and the r-factor (achievement of small uncertainty band), were taken into account. The results of SWAT simulations indicated that during the calibration the p-factor and the r-factor were reported as 0.82 and 0.76, respectively, while during the validation the p-factor and the r-factor were obtained as 0.71 and 0.72, respectively. After a rigorous calibration and validation, the goodness of fit was further assessed through the use of the coefficient of determination (R2) and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NS) between the observed and the final simulated values. The results indicated that R2 and NS were 0.77 and 0.74, respectively, during the calibration. The validation also indicated a satisfactory performance with R2 of 0.71 and NS of 0.69.

In this study, the hydrology of the Lower Porsuk Stream Watershed in Turkey has been modelled with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool to determine optimal water management strategies. The calibration and the validation process have been accomplished using data from two monitoring stations. The model has been run for the 1978-2009 period, and while the 1998-2004 period has been used for calibration, the validation has spanned the whole period. The SWATCup calibration and uncertainty program has been used for this purpose. No significant differences have been detected among different iteration numbers in the calibration period. The monthly Nash-Sutcliffe and R2 performance indicators for the upstream Esenkara station have been 0.74 and 0.88, respectively, for the calibration period, and 0.87 and 0.87, respectively, for the validation period. The Kiranharmani station, which is located close to the watershed outlet, has shown values of 0.59 and 0.72, respectively, for the calibration period, and 0.44 and 0.56, respectively, for the validation period. There are uncertainties in the abstracted irrigation and groundwater quantities that have reflected in the results in the Kiranharmani station, which is more affected as it lies downstream of the irrigation areas. The effects of different irrigation practices on the flow regime have been also investigated. A scenario has been implemented in which drip irrigation wholly replaces conventional furrow and sprinkler irrigation. The scenario has shown increases in stream flows by 87% for the whole year. The adoption of more efficient irrigation practices thus results in reducing the water stress induced by irrigation demands.

In this study, pond-induced impacts on soil erosion and sediment transport were investigated at the scale of the French Claise basin. In order to determine erosion and sediment transport patterns of the Claise, the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) erosion and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models were used. The impact of ponds on the studied processes was revealed by means of land cover change scenarios, using ponded versus pondless inputs. Results show that under current conditions (pond presence), 12.48% of the basin corresponds to no-erosion risk zones (attributed to the dense pond network), while 65.66% corresponds to low-erosion risk, 21.68% to moderate-erosion risk, and only 0.18% to high-erosion risk zones. The SWAT model revealed that ponded sub-basins correspond to low sediment yields areas, in contrast to the pondless sub-basins, which yield appreciably higher erosion rates. Under the alternative pondless scenario, erosion risks shifted to 1.12%, 0.52%, 76.8%, and 21.56% for no, low, moderate, and high-erosion risks, respectively, while the sediment transport pattern completely shifted to higher sediment yield zones.

Karst comprises exposed carbonate bedrock over approximately 1.30×106 km2 of this area, which suffers from soil degradation and poor crop yield. This paper aims to gain a better understanding of the environmental controls on crop yield in order to enable more sustainable use of natural resources for food production and development. More precisely, four kinds of artificial neural network were used to analyse and simulate the spatial patterns of crop yield for seven crop species grown in Guizhou Province, exploring the relationships with meteorological, soil, irrigation and fertilization factors. The results of spatial classification showed that most regions of high-level crop yield per area and total crop yield are located in the central-north area of Guizhou. Moreover, the three artificial neural networks used to simulate the spatial patterns of crop yield all demonstrated a good correlation coefficient between simulated and true yield. However, the Back Propagation network had the best performance based on both accuracy and runtime. Among the 13 influencing factors investigated, temperature (16.4%), radiation (15.3%), soil moisture (13.5%), fertilization of N (13.5%) and P (12.4%) had the largest contribution to crop yield spatial distribution. These results suggest that neural networks have potential application in identifying environmental controls on crop yield and in modelling spatial patterns of crop yield, which could enable local stakeholders to realize sustainable development and crop production goals. © The Author(s) 2020.","artificial neural network; critical zone; crop model; crop yield; Guizhou; Karst","artificial neural network; back propagation; crop yield; environmental factor; fertilizer application; karst; radiation exposure; soil moisture; spatial distribution; temperature effect; China; Guizhou",Article,Scopus

Each one focuses on a different story about which model is more appropriate. Therefore, finding a suitable model remains a difficult task due to the remotely sensed data issues and the complexity of the vegetation cover change process. Despite the unicity of vegetation indices time series, the forecasting assessment relies basically on the commonly used forecast error measurements (e.g. Mean Square Error (MSE), Root MSE (RMSE), and the symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE), etc.) which may not reflect the real potential of the fitted forecasting model. Herein, the experimentation of forecasting vegetation indices employing two univariate time series models and new accuracy metrics is discussed. Box Jenkins models (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model) and neural network model (nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) model) are applied individually and coupled (NAR-NAR and NAR-ARIMA) based on a multi-resolution analysis-wavelet transform. These models’ forecasting ability is evaluated using 16-days Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data of two different vegetation cover types of northwestern area in Tunisia. The major finding highlights firstly the importance of integration of the decomposition step to show off the hidden components of vegetation indices. The commonly used accuracy measures show that the coupled neural networks model outperforms other models. Then, interesting conclusions were drawn when phenological metrics are used as performance measures. Herein, Box Jenkins forecasting model generates a better NDVI curve shape than hybrid models despite their low RMSE measures. This is mainly due to good estimation of some phenological events, namely, the amplitude, the peak and the season’s length. Generally, Box Jenkin model excels at handling quick variations. By contrast, combined models show better phenological metrics’ estimation when the observations are complex or describe long time periods. Based on these findings, we suggest that the choice of the evaluation metric must be related to the future forecaster interest. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Autoregressive moving average model; Complex networks; Errors; Forestry; Mean square error; Neural networks; Radiometers; Time series; Vegetation; Wavelet transforms; Coupled neural networks; Mean absolute percentage error; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Neural network model; Normalized difference vegetation index time series; Remotely sensed data; Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving averages (ARIMA); Univariate time series models; Forecasting; accuracy assessment; cereal; forecasting method; forest cover; MODIS; NDVI; phenology; vegetation index; Tunisia",Article,Scopus

The aim of this work is the detection of medium-low damages (i.e., between 10 and 30% of the gross saleable production) using the much-used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in comparison with alternative vegetation indices (i.e., ARVI, MCARI, SAVI, MSAVI, MSAVI2) and their change from pre-event to post-event in five hailstorms in Lombardy in 2018. Seventy-four overlapping scenes (10% cloud cover) were collected from the Sentinel-2 in the spring-summer period of 2018 in the Brescia district (Lombardy). An unsupervised classification was carried out to automatically identify the maize fields (grain and silage), testing the change detection approach by searching for damage by hail and strong wind in the Lombardy plain of Brescia. A database of 125 field surveys (average size 4 Ha) after the hailstorm collected from the insurance service allowed for the selection of the dates on which the event occurred and provided a proxy of the extent of the damage (in % of the decrease of the yield). Hail and strong wind damages ranged from 5 to 70%, and they were used for comparison with the satellite image change detection. The differences in the vegetation indices obtained by Sentinel 2 before and after the hailstorm and the insurance assessments of damage after the events were compared to assess the degree of concordance. The modified soil-adjusted vegetation index outperformed other vegetation indices in detecting hail-related damages with the highest accuracy (73.3%). On the other hand, the NDVI resulted in scarce performance ranking last of the six indices, with an accuracy of 65.3%. Future research will evaluate how much uncertainty can be found in the method’s limitations with vegetation indices derived from satellites, how much is due to errors in estimating damage to the ground, and how much is due to other causes. © the Author(s), 2022.","change detection; damage estimation; Hailstorms; modified soil-adjusted vegetation index; vegetation indices","assessment method; comparative study; damage mechanics; detection method; estimation method; field method; hail; insurance system; maize; remote sensing; Sentinel; unsupervised classification; vegetation index; Brescia; Italy; Lombardy",Article,Scopus

Recent advances in remote sensing make producing climate data easier and provided alternatives to the conventional climate data sources, particularly for hydro-climatological studies in the data-scarce regions. However, rigorous evaluations are warranted to evaluate the reliability and effectiveness of gridded climate products. This study evaluated the CFSR and CHIRPS products against the observed climate for hydrologic prediction at two streamflow gauging stations. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to simulate hydrological processes in the watersheds. Model sensitivity analysis and calibration were conducted using the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting-2 (SUFI-2) algorithm in the SWAT-Calibration Uncertainty and Prediction (SWAT-CUP). Streamflow simulation performance was evaluated using several statistical, hydrological performances and prediction uncertainty of p-factor and r-factor within the SUFI-2 framework. Simulation of the model using the observed and gridded climate products provided satisfactory model performance in terms of the goodness of fit criteria and uncertainty prediction. Results show that CHIRPS rainfall combined with CFSR and observed temperatures demonstrates slightly better statistics and hydrological performance than observed, but shows substantial difference than CFSR. The simulations with CHIRPS and observed yielded minor differences in the water balance component estimates where the CFSR simulation gave lower average annual rainfall, resulting in lower water balance components. Quantifying the various water balance component in the watershed helps to tackle the water management issues. Overall, the CHIRPS rainfall combined with CFSR temperature can serve as a better alternative climate input for hydrological applications in the study region © 2021 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences","Baro-Akobo basin; CFSR; CHIRPS; Hydrological modeling; Observed; SWAT","computer simulation; hydrological modeling; rainfall; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; water budget; watershed; Akobo Basin; Baro Basin",Article,Scopus

Numerous experiments have been conducted to assess the performance of CA under various local conditions, and meta-analysis has become a standard approach in agricultural sector for analysing and summarizing the experimental data. Meta-analysis provides valuable synthetic information based on mean effect size estimation. However, summarizing large amounts of information by way of a single mean effect value is not always satisfactory, especially when considering agricultural practices. Indeed, their impacts on crop yields are often non-linear, and vary widely depending on a number of factors, including soil properties and local climate conditions. To address this issue, here we present a machine learning approach to produce data-driven global maps describing the spatial distribution of the productivity of CA versus conventional tillage (CT). Our objective is to evaluate and compare several machine-learning models for their ability in estimating the productivity of CA systems, and to analyse uncertainty in the model outputs. We consider different usages, including classification, point regression and quantile regression. Our approach covers the comparison of 12 different machine learning algorithms, model training, tuning with cross-validation, testing, and global projection of results. The performances of these algorithms are compared based on a recent global dataset including more than 4,000 pairs of crop yield data for CA vs. CT. We show that random forest has the best performance in classification and regression, while quantile regression forest performs better than quantile neural networks in quantile regression. The best algorithms are used to map crop productivity of CA vs. CT at the global scale, and results reveal that the performance of CA vs. CT is characterized by a strong spatial variability, and that the probability of yield gain with CA is highly dependent on geographical locations. This result demonstrates that our approach is much more informative than simply presenting average effect sizes produced by standard meta-analyses, and paves the way for such probabilistic, spatially-explicit approaches in many other fields of research.

The National Agriculture and Food Research Organization– Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Climate Center (NARO-APCC) Crop Forecasting Service provides yield forecasts for global cropland on a monthly basis using seasonal temperature and precipitation forecasts as the main inputs, and 1 year of testing the operation of the service was recently completed. Here we evaluate the forecasts for the 2019 yields of major commodity crops by comparing with the reported yields and forecasts from the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Forecasts for maize, wheat, soybean, and rice were evaluated for 20 countries located in the Northern Hemisphere, including 39 crop-producing states in the United States, for which 2019 reported yields were already publicly available. The NARO-APCC forecasts are available several months earlier than the JRC and USDA forecasts. The skill of the NARO-APCC forecasts was good in absolute terms, but the forecast errors in the NARO-APCC forecasts were almost always larger than those of the JRC and USDA forecasts. The forecast errors in the JRC and USDA forecasts decreased as the harvest approached, whereas those in the NARO-APCC forecasts were rather stable over the season, with some exceptions. Although this feature seems to be a disadvantage, it may turn into an advantage if skillful forecasts are achievable in the earlier stages of a season.

Commonly-used methods for seasonal yield forecasting are based on process-based crop models or statistical regression-based models. Both have limitations, particularly in regard to accounting for growth stage-specific climate extremes (such as drought, heat, and frost). In this study, we firstly developed a hybrid yield forecasting approach by blending of multiple growth stage-specific indicators, i.e. APSIM (a process-based crop model)-simulated biomass, and climate extremes, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index) before forecasting dates, using a regression model (random forest or multiple linear regression). Plot-scale wheat yield (2008–2017) in the southeastern Australian wheat belt was dynamically forecasted at the end of several targeted growth stages as the growing season progressed to harvest. Results showed that the forecasting accuracy increased significantly for both systems as forecast time approached harvest time. The forecasting system based on random forest outperformed the forecasting system based on multiple linear regression at each forecasting event. Satisfactory yield forecasts occurred at one month (~35 days) prior to harvest (r = 0.85, LCCC = 0.81, MAPE = 17.6%, RMSE = 0.70 t ha−1, and ROC score = 0.90), and at two months before harvest (r = 0.62, LCCC = 0.53, MAPE = 27.1%, RMSE = 1.01 t ha−1, and ROC score = 0.88). In addition, drought events throughout the growing season were identified as the main factor causing yield losses in the wheat belt during the past decade. With the increasing availability of farming-related data, we expect that the yield forecasting system proposed in our study may be widely extended to other comparable cropping regions to produce sufficiently accurate wheat yield forecasts for stakeholders to develop strategic decisions in their respective roles. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","APSIM; Extreme climate events; Random forest; Remote sensing; Wheat yield forecast","agrometeorology; biophysics; crop yield; cropping practice; drought; extreme event; forecasting method; machine learning; NDVI; remote sensing; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Although the main effects of G and E are typically larger and easier to model, the GEI interaction effects are important and a critical factor when considering such issues as to why some genotypes perform consistently well across a range of environments. In plant breeding, a major challenge is limited information, including a single genotype is tested in only a small subset of all possible test environments. The two-way table of phenotype responses will therefore commonly contain missing data. In this paper, we propose a new model of GEI effects that only requires an input of a two-way table of phenotype observations, with genotypes as rows and environments as columns that do not assume the completeness of data. Our analysis can deal with this scenario as it utilizes a novel biclustering algorithm that can handle missing values, resulting in an output of homogeneous cells with no interactions between G and E. In other words, we identify subsets of genotypes and environments where phenotype can be modeled simply. Based on this, we fit no-interaction models to predict phenotypes of a given crop and draw insights into how a particular cultivar will perform in the unused test environments. Our new methodology is validated on data from different plant species and phenotypes and shows superior performance compared to well-studied statistical approaches.

R. Br.) yields recorded in Niger. Field experiments were conducted at the National Agricultural Research Institute of Niger (N’Dounga) during the 2016 and 2017 rainy seasons to evaluate the performance of the CERES-Millet model in simulating the growth and yield of pearl millet varieties. Treatments consisted of two sowing windows (late June and mid-July) and four varieties (HKP, ZATIB, CIVT, and H80-10 GR) arranged in a split-plot design with three replications. Sowing dates were allocated to the main plots, whereas varieties were assigned to the subplots. The data collected on days to 50% flowering, days to physiological maturity, grain yield, and above-ground biomass during 2016 and 2017 were used to calibrate and evaluate the CERES-Millet model for simulating sowing windows. The model was used to simulate the long-term effects of different sowing windows using long-term historical weather data from 1983 to 2017 in Kollo. The results for model calibration showed that simulated growth and yield of millet were in good agreement with their corresponding observed values. The d-index was 0.99 for days to anthesis, 0.97 for days to physiological maturity, 0.93 for grain yield, and 0.79 for above-ground biomass. The results for both calibration and evaluation showed that normalized root mean square errors were less than 10%. The values of the d-index were also within the acceptable range for all the parameters. Therefore, the CERES-Millet model was robust enough to successfully simulate millet growth and yield in Niger. Seasonal analysis revealed that sowing should be done from early June to mid-June for ZATIB and H80-10 GR varieties. However, it should be done from early June to late June for CIVT and from mid-June to early July for HKP. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","CERES-millet model; DSSAT; optimum sowing window; pearl millet; varieties",,Article,Scopus

Adequate agricultural inputs, particularly nutrient amendments and best management practices, are essential to reverse this trend. There is a need to understand the cause of variations in maize yield, provide reliable early estimates of yields, and make necessary recommendations for fertilizer applications. Maize yield prediction and estimates of yield gaps using objective and spatial analytical tools could provide accurate and objective information that underpin decision support. A study was conducted in Rwanda at Nyakiliba sector and Gashora sector located in Birunga and Central Bugesera agro-ecological zones, with the objectives of (1) determining factors influencing maize yield, (2) predicting maize yield (using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) approach), and (3) assessing the maize yield gaps and the impact on food security. Maize grain yield was significantly higher at Nyakiliba (1.74 t ha−1) than at Gashora (0.6 t ha−1). NDVI values correlated positively with maize grain yield at both sites (R2 = 0.50 to 0.65) and soil fertility indicators (R2 = 0.55 to 0.70).

We propose a non-parametric probabilistic method for detecting interaction effects of unknown form. First, the relationship between the features and the output is modelled using a Bayesian neural network, capable of representing complex interactions and principled uncertainty. Second, interaction effects and their uncertainty are estimated from the trained model. For the second step, we propose an intuitive global interaction measure: Bayesian Group Expected Hessian (GEH), which aggregates information of local interactions as captured by the Hessian. GEH provides a natural trade-off between type I and type II error and, moreover, comes with theoretical guarantees ensuring that the estimated interaction effects and their uncertainty can be improved by training a more accurate BNN. The method empirically outperforms available non-probabilistic alternatives on simulated and real-world data.

This study determined the spatial–temporal changes and water constraints on vegetation photosynthesis based on the Self-Calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI), Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and global Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 SIF (GOSIF) data in the Yangtze River and Yellow River basin between 2000 and 2018. The results showed that annual maximum GOSIF steadily increased across the whole basin (slope = 0.0031 W m-2μm-1sr-1a-1, P &lt; 0.001). The maximum increasing trend was found in the semi-arid region (0.0034 W m-2μm-1sr-1a-1, P &lt; 0.001). The highest value of annual maximum GOSIF was found in the Qinling-Daba Mountains along with Hengduan Mountain. The lowest GOSIF was found in the western portions of the Loess Plateau and the source region of Yangtze River and Yellow River. Positive correlations between satellite GOSIF and water availability were particularly strong in the Loess Plateaus; in contrast, negative correlations were found in the Hengduan Mountains. The area of water deficit displayed a significant trend towards expansion (slope = 1.539 % a-1 and 0.898 % a-1, P &lt; 0.05), while water surplus areas significantly shrank (slope = 0.847 % a-1 and 0.584 % a-1, P &lt; 0.05) in the Yangtze River and Yellow River basin. Atmospheric CO2 concentration and precipitation were the dominant drivers for the water deficit regions, while atmospheric CO2 concentration and temperature were the dominant drivers for the water surplus regions.

A constant monitoring of salinity affected areas is imperative to prevent land degradation, agricultural and livelihood losses. With this aim, we developed three soil salinity models with direct, indirect and a combination of both of these soil salinity measurement techniques, for south-western Bangladesh. The five salinity indexes (direct) and eleven environmental variables (indirect) were integrated using Principal Component Analysis, and the predictability of the models was evaluated against ground-based soil salinity measurements from soil survey and land cover maps generated during the model development. Delineation based solely on salinity indexes yielded results that contradicted with models developed from indirect variables and combining all the variables. Results suggest that the salinity model developed by combining direct and indirect techniques has the highest prediction capacity and can also be explained in terms of land cover changes. Therefore, an integrated approach yielded better delineation of salt-affected areas, characterized by active hydrological processes and vegetation cover.

In order to enhance the reach of agronomic research, use of emerging tools of big data analytics, geo-referenced satellite information Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based imaging and artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques which can process large data sets are described which could be validated by agronomic field experiments. Some areas of data science for use in agronomy include: Satellite and UAV based data acquisition, Internet of Things (IoT), AI (machine and deep learning) and big data analytics.

In this study, we first sought to determine the influencing factors of crop yields and the process of drought impacts on crop yields. We then systematically reviewed the effects of droughts on major global crop yields from four aspects: field control experiments, statistical models, crop growth models, and remote sensing inversion models. Recent progress in crop yield impact assessment reveals that the current research has changed from single-hazard to multi-hazard, from single target to multiple targets, and from statistical models to a comprehensive model. A bibliometric analysis shows that the volume of research on drought impacts on crop yields has increased exponentially, and the related research theme has undergone a transformation from traditional research on crop water stress to comprehensive research on crop drought impacts and adaptation, reflecting the continuous deepening and integration of research perspectives. Agriculture, plant sciences, and environmental sciences are the three main disciplines in research on drought impacts on crop yields. We need to strengthen the application of geographical thinking, that is, systematic thinking concerning multiple factors and multiple scales to study the coupling of crop yields and water resources in the future. Finally, we suggest the following four priority areas for future research in consideration of the problems and challenges of the existing research: establishing a multi-source database of drought impact on crop yield, revealing the key process and mechanism of drought impacts on crop yields, developing a coupled macro and micro process crop growth model, and establishing a comprehensive monitoring platform system for crop yields and food security.

There are several mathematical models used for the estimation of the wheat crop but these models are implemented without considering the wheat species which is an important independent variable. The task of wheat species identification is challenging both for human experts as well as for computer vision-based solutions. With the use of satellite remote sensing, it is possible to identify and monitor wheat species on a large scale at any stage of the crop life cycle. In this work, nine popular wheat species are identified by using Landsat8 operational land imager (OLI) and thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) data. Two thousand samples of eachwheat crop species are acquired every fifteen days with a temporal resolution of ten multispectral bands (band two to band eleven). This study employs random forest (RF), artificial neural network, support vector machine, Naive Bayes, and logistic regression for nine types of wheat classification. In addition, deep neural networks are also developed. Experimental results indicate that RF shows the best performance of 91% accuracy while DNN obtains a 90.2% accuracy.

However, in recent years, the planting area in China has decreased by approximately 12.2% due to the low yield and economic benefits. Thus, to ensure oil security, it is necessary to develop high-efficiency cultivation for rapeseed production. Crop growth models are powerful tools to analyze and optimize the yield composition of crops under certain environmental and management conditions. In this study, the CROPGRO-Canola model was first calibrated and evaluated using the rapeseed planting data of four growing seasons in Wuhan with nine nitrogen fertilizer levels (from 120 to 360 kg ha−1 ) and five planting densities (from 15 to 75 plants m−2 ). The results indicated that the CROPGRO-Canola model simulated rapeseed growth well under different nitrogen rates and planting densities in China, with a simulation error of 0–3 days for the anthesis and maturity dates and a normalized root mean square error lower than 7.48% for the yield. Furthermore, we optimized the management of rapeseed by calculating the marginal net return under 10 nitrogen rates (from 0 to 360 kg ha−1 at an increasing rate of 40 kg ha−1 ) and 6 planting densities (from 15 to 90 plant m−2 at an increasing rate of 15 plant m−2 ) from 1989 to 2019. The results indicated that the long-term optimal nitrogen rate was 120–160 kg N ha−1, and the optimal planting density was 45–75 plants m−2 under normal fertilizer prices. The optimal nitrogen rate decreased with increasing fertilizer price within a reasonable range. In conclusion, long-term rapeseed management can be optimized based on rapeseed and nitrogen cost using long-term weather records and local soil information. © 2022 by the authors.

The water losses increased, when water application records low efficiency. The water losses maybe amplified, when the irrigation system ignores soil variability and water applied uniformly. Which means more water application, more energy demand, and more money expenses. The current investigation aims at using remotely sensed data and GIS Techniques for monitoring irrigation water consumption and its correlation with crop yield under the pivot irrigation system. El-Salhia region contains a big agricultural farm located at the South Eastern of Nile delta. The investigated field was irrigated under the pivot central sprinkler irrigation system which cultivated with the wheat crop. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) were calculated based on landsat data. The crop water stress index (CWSI) depends on the variance between the LST of the targets and their air temperature (Tair) to detect the relative moisture condition. The soil texture, organic matter, time-domain reflectometer (TDR), thermal infrared, leaf area index (LAI), and actual yield measurements were taken for 47 systematic samples during the wheat growing season of the year 2012/2013. Accordingly, the available water (AW) displayed relatively lower accuracy than the rest of the other parameters. The canopy temperature (Tc), CWSI, field capacity (Fc), and LAI showed high accuracy to predict the wheat yield as shown from the statistical analysis. The WUE recorded 1.07 (kg/m3) in the southeast boundary and gradient toward the northwest boundary with a rate of 2.2 (kg/m3). The WUE distribution is comparable to soil parameters and measured yield circulation, which indicates high applicability with significant improvement in yield response. © 2020, King Abdulaziz University and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","And field capacity; Available water; The canopy temperature; Water holding capacity; Water-use efficiency",,Article,Scopus

In areas where such data are not readily available, an independent seasonal monitoring method is needed. Remote sensing is a widely used tool to map land use types, although there are some limitations that can partly be circumvented by using, among others, multiple observations, careful feature selection and appropriate analysis methods. Here, we used Sentinel-2 satellite image time series (SITS) over the land area of Norway to map three agricultural land use classes: cereal crops, fodder crops (grass) and unused areas. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and two variants of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are implemented on SITS data of four different temporal resolutions. These enabled us to compare twelve model-dataset combinations to identify the model-dataset combination that results in the most accurate predictions. The CNN is implemented in the spectral and temporal dimensions instead of the conventional spatial dimension. Rather than using existing deep learning architectures, an autotuning procedure is implemented so that the model hyperparameters are empirically optimized during the training. The results obtained on held-out test data show that up to 94% overall accuracy and 90% Cohen’s Kappa can be obtained when the 2D CNN is applied on the SITS data with a temporal resolution of 7 days. This is closely followed by the 1D CNN on the same dataset. However, the latter performs better than the former in predicting data outside the training set. It is further observed that cereal is predicted with the highest accuracy, followed by grass. Predicting the unused areas has been found to be difficult as there is no distinct surface condition that is common for all unused areas. © 2021 by the authors.

This study showed that using observations of pasture growth along with environmental and pasture management variables enabled both models, GAM and RF to predict the pre-grazing pasture biomass production at field scale with an average error below 20%. If predictive variables (i.e. post-grazing pasture biomass) were excluded, model performance was reduced, generating errors up to 40%. The post-grazing biomass information at high spatial resolution (<1 m) acquired with the UAV-multispectral camera system was used as predictive variable for future pasture biomass. With the inclusion of the spatially explicit post-grazing biomass variable both models accurately predicted the pre-grazing pasture biomass with an error of 27.7% and 22.9% for RF and GAM, respectively. However, the GAM model performed better than RF in reproducing the spatial variability of pre-grazing pasture biomass.

Nowadays, satellite remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) can enable the estimation of these crop production parameters over large geographic areas. The present work aims to estimate the wheat (Triticum aestivum) acreage and yield of Maharajganj, Uttar Pradesh, India, using satellite-based data products and the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model. Uttar Pradesh is the largest wheat-producing state in India, and this district is well known for its quality organic wheat. India is the leader in wheat grain export, and, hence, its monitoring of growth and yield is one of the top economic priorities of the country. For the calculation of wheat acreage, we performed supervised classification using the Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine classifiers and compared their classification accuracy based on ground-truthing. We found that RF performed a significantly accurate acreage assessment (kappa coefficient 0.84) compared to SVM (0.68). The CASA model was then used to calculate the winter crop (Rabi, winter-sown, and summer harvested) wheat net primary productivity (NPP) in the study area for the 2020–2021 growth season using the RF-based acreage product. The model used for wheat NPP-yield conversion (CASA) showed 3100.27 to 5000.44 kg/ha over 148,866 ha of the total wheat area. The results showed that in the 2020–2021 growing season, all the districts of Uttar Pradesh had similar wheat growth trends. A total of 30 observational data points were used to verify the CASA model-based estimates of wheat yield. Field-based verification shows that the estimated yield correlates well with the observed yield (R2 = 0.554, RMSE = 3.36 Q/ha, MAE −0.56 t ha−1, and MRE = −4.61%). Such an accuracy for assessing regional wheat yield can prove to be one of the promising methods for calculating the whole region’s agricultural yield. The study concludes that RF classifier-based yield estimation has shown more accurate results and can meet the requirements of a regional-scale wheat grain yield estimation and, thus, can prove highly beneficial in policy and decision making. © 2022 by the authors.

Auto-Irr generally performed better than Well-Irr in simulating groundwater irrigation volume (reducing the mean bias from 86 to −30%) and groundwater level (reducing the normalized root-mean-square-error from 13.55 to 12.47%) across the NHP, as well as streamflow interannual variations at two stations (increasing NSE from 0.51, 0.51 to 0.55, 0.53). We also examined the effects of groundwater irrigation on the water cycle. Based on simulation results from Auto-Irr, historical irrigation led to significant recharge along the Elkhorn and Platte rivers. On average over the entire NHP, irrigation increased surface runoff, evapotranspiration, soil moisture and groundwater recharge by 21.3%, 4.0%, 2.5% and 1.5%, respectively.

Many factors including weather variability can limit returns on production expenditure and lead growers to moderate inputs that also limit yield. The purpose of this study was to identify management practices that growers could use most profitably under differing seasonal conditions. Canola crop yields were simulated with APSIM at seven diverse Australian locations in a factorial array of management practices including sowing date, sowing density, cultivar, rate of cultivar development and nitrogen fertiliser rate. The implication for growers of input costs for the different management combinations was evaluated in terms of the extent that costs were recovered (ratio of gross margins to variable costs) and magnitude of variable input costs for gross margins. A regression-tree data-mining approach was used to identify the most profitable and highest yielding combinations of management practices. Environmental conditions (defined here by combinations of date of sowing and ‘perfect knowledge’ of growing season rainfall) had greatest impact on gross margins and few profitable management practices could be identified unless environmental conditions were first accounted for. When crop management practices were tailored to rainfall and sowing date to maximize gross margins, yields were up to 2 Mg ha−1 greater than the average yield achieved by industry. Yield generally increased in response to increasing variable costs but gross margins tended to plateau; after this point higher variable input costs were matched but not exceeded by revenue from increased yield. Gross margins changed in response to individual management factors: for sowing date, gross margins decreased with progressively later sowings from mid-March. For N fertiliser rate in all sowing dates, it was more profitable to use higher N fertiliser rates for higher rainfall deciles, and to use lower N rates as sowing was delayed. Cultivars with slow to medium rates of development were most profitable for early sowings up to the end of April, except where rainfall was low (in low rainfall deciles or for locations in low rainfall zones). Hybrid and conventional open-pollinated cultivars had similar gross margins, which were greater than for the Triazine-tolerant open pollinated cultivar due to its lower yield potential. Selection of most profitable practices was enhanced with knowledge of seasonal rainfall, but time of sowing matched with rate of development and a non-TT-OP cultivar could be selected to maximise gross margins without knowledge of rainfall. Nevertheless, high costs of production may hinder the most profitable selection of management practices. © 2020","APSIM; Gross margins; Rain decile; Regression tree; Sowing date","canola; crop plant; crop production; crop yield; cultivar; environmental conditions; fertilizer; fertilizer application; growing season; management practice; rainfall; sowing date; Brassica napus; Brassica napus var. napus",Article,Scopus

The current study developed models to predict the level of P. truncatus infestation and associated damage of maize grain in smallholder farmer stores. Data were gathered from grain storage trials conducted in Hwedza and Mbire districts of Zimbabwe and correlated with weather data for each site. Insect counts of P. truncatus and other common stored grain insect pests had a strong correlation with time of year with highest recorded numbers from January to May. Correlation analysis showed insect-generated grain dust from boring and feeding activity to be the best indicator of P. truncatus presence in stores (r = 0.70), while a moderate correlation (r = 0.48) was found between P. truncatus numbers and storage insect parasitic wasps, and grain damage levels significantly correlated with the presence of Tribolium castaneum (r = 0.60). Models were developed for predicting P. truncatus infestation and grain damage using parameter selection algorithms and decision-tree machine learning algorithms with 10-fold cross-validation. The P. truncatus population size prediction model performance was weak (r = 0.43) due to the complicated sampling and detection of the pest and eight-week long period between sampling events. The grain damage prediction model had a stronger correlation coefficient (r = 0.93) and is a good estimator for in situ stored grain insect damage.

In this study, a new BMP cost tool was developed. Then the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the new BMP cost tool were integrated to explore efficiencies and cost-effectiveness of BMPs in an agricultural catchment of the Maumee River watershed with various scenarios. The scenarios included individual BMPs applied in 100% of suitable areas, individual BMPs targeting Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus (DRP) and Total Phosphorus (TP) critical areas, and BMPs implemented in series. In addition, a cost-effective approach for the selections and placements of BMPs in agricultural watersheds was developed as an alternative to running complex optimization tools that are not applicable to large watersheds. The cost-effective approach applied BMPs based on cost-effectiveness rankings starting from the most cost-effective one. Results showed that: (1) BMPs implemented in series, which reduced pollutant loads more than individual BMPs, were not as cost-effective as some individual BMPs; (2) among all scenarios, filter strips targeting DRP/TP critical areas were the most cost-effective in reducing yearly/spring DRP/TP losses; (3) to obtain the watershed management plan goal of reducing March-July DRP/TP losses by 40%, implementing BMPs one by one in critical areas based on the cost-effectiveness rankings of individual BMPs in DRP/TP critical areas was the most cost-effective; and (4) the simulation results, modeling tools, and cost-effective approach can help create agricultural BMP strategies to cost-efficiently improve water quality. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation practices; Cost-efficiency; Nutrients; Performance; Phosphorus; Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)","Agriculture; Catchments; Efficiency; Lakes; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Soil conservation; Water conservation; Water management; Water pollution; Water quality; Watersheds; Agricultural best management practices; Best management practices; Conservation practices; Cost efficiency; Dissolved reactive phosphorus; Performance; Soil and water assessment tool; Watershed management plans; Cost effectiveness; agricultural catchment; algal bloom; best management practice; conservation; cost analysis; nutrient; performance assessment; phosphorus; soil and water assessment tool; water quality; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Erie; Maumee Basin; United States; algae",Article,Scopus

Traditional methods typically use linear regression models with clear assumptions; such methods are unable to capture the complex relationships between genotypes and phenotypes. Non-linear models (e.g., deep neural networks) have been proposed as a superior alternative to linear models because they can capture complex non-additive effects. Here we introduce a deep learning (DL) method, deep neural network genomic prediction (DNNGP), for integration of multi-omics data in plants. We trained DNNGP on four datasets and compared its performance with methods built with five classic models: genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP); two methods based on a machine learning (ML) framework, light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and support vector regression (SVR); and two methods based on a DL framework, deep learning genomic selection (DeepGS) and deep learning genome-wide association study (DLGWAS). DNNGP is novel in five ways. First, it can be applied to a variety of omics data to predict phenotypes. Second, the multilayered hierarchical structure of DNNGP dynamically learns features from raw data, avoiding overfitting and improving the convergence rate using a batch normalization layer and early stopping and rectified linear activation (rectified linear unit) functions. Third, when small datasets were used, DNNGP produced results that are competitive with results from the other five methods, showing greater prediction accuracy than the other methods when large-scale breeding data were used. Fourth, the computation time required by DNNGP was comparable with that of commonly used methods, up to 10 times faster than DeepGS. Fifth, hyperparameters can easily be batch tuned on a local machine. Compared with GBLUP, LightGBM, SVR, DeepGS and DLGWAS, DNNGP is superior to these existing widely used genomic selection (GS) methods. Moreover, DNNGP can generate robust assessments from diverse datasets, including omics data, and quickly incorporate complex and large datasets into usable models, making it a promising and practical approach for straightforward integration into existing GS platforms. © 2022 The Author","deep learning; genomic selection; multi-omics data; prediction method","genome-wide association study; genomics; plant breeding; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Multiomics; Neural Networks, Computer; Plant Breeding",Article,Scopus

First, we fitted nine machine learning algorithms with various pre-processing scenarios using variables from July, August and September based on the red, red-edge and infra-red bands of the spectrum. Second, we selected the best performing models and evaluated them against independent test data. Finally, we repeated the previous two steps using only variables corresponding to July and August.

Despite this, plant diseases and unfavorable weather patterns continue to threaten the delicate balance between vegetable production and consumption. It is critical to utilize machine learning (ML) in this setting because it provides context for decision-making related to breeding goals. Cutting-edge technologies for crop genome sequencing and phenotyping, combined with advances in computer science, are currently fueling a revolution in vegetable science and technology. Additionally, various ML techniques such as prediction, classification, and clustering are frequently used to forecast vegetable crop production in the field. In the vegetable seed industry, machine learning algorithms are used to assess seed quality before germination and have the potential to improve vegetable production with desired features significantly; whereas, in plant disease detection and management, the ML approaches can improve decision-support systems that assist in converting massive amounts of data into valuable recommendations. On similar lines, in vegetable breeding, ML approaches are helpful in predicting treatment results, such as what will happen if a gene is silenced. Furthermore, ML approaches can be a saviour to insufficient coverage and noisy data generated using various omics platforms.

To better quantify the responses of crop yield to hydrological variability in the rainfed Corn Belt of the United States (U.S.), we analyzed the relationships between corn/soybean yield and hydrological cycle metrics, as well as their spatio-temporal dynamic at the agricultural district and interannual scale between 2003 and 2014. We used Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) to optimally integrate different hydrological metrics and drought indices to define a crop-specific new drought index that uses crop yield as the target, and investigated the contributions of those hydrological cycle components to the new drought index. We used both observed and modeled hydrological cycle metrics, as well as several drought indices in this study, including evapotranspiration (ET) and potential ET (PET), terrestrial water storage change (ΔS), surface soil moisture (SSM), river discharge (Q), Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), fET (the ratio of ET to PET), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Our results revealed that: (1) VPD, SSM, and fET showed the strongest correlations with crop yield, among the observation-based hydrological cycle metrics and drought indices considered here. Most of the hydrological cycle metrics and drought indices showed similar seasonal correlation patterns with crop yield, and this pattern revealed that the sensitivity of crop growth to water stress peaked in July for corn and in August for soybean in the rainfed U.S. Corn Belt. (2) The drought in 2012 started with higher water demand (reflected in abnormally high ET, PET, and VPD) and lower water supply (reflected in abnormally low P), followed by soil water depletion (as revealed in SSM and ΔS), leading to massive crop yield losses due to increased constraints on both water supply and demand. (3) The R2 of the PLSR-based crop yield model reached 0.76 and 0.70 for corn and soybean, respectively. For both corn and soybean, the first PLSR component was mainly composed of information from VPD, fET, ΔS and SSM, indicating atmospheric water deficit and soil water storage both play critical roles in quantifying corn and soybean yield loss due to water stress. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Crop yield; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Groundwater; Soil moisture; U.S. Corn Belt; VPD","Agricultural robots; Drought; Economics; Evapotranspiration; Plants (botany); Soil moisture; Water supply; Hydrological variability; Palmer drought severity indices; Partial least square regression; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Surface soil moisture; Terrestrial water storage; Vapor pressure deficit; Water supply and demands; Crops; agrometeorology; connectivity; crop yield; drought stress; evapotranspiration; hydrological cycle; least squares method; precipitation assessment; rainfed agriculture; seasonality; soil water; soybean; water storage; Corn Belt; United States; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

In the present study, two variables of livestock production and agricultural production were considered as the source of food production. Three variables were used to evaluate livestock production, namely livestock yield, live animals, and animal slaughtered, and two variables were used to assess agricultural production, namely agricultural production yields and losses. Iran was selected as the case study of the current study. Therefore, time-series data related to livestock and agricultural productions in Iran from 1961 to 2017 have been collected from the FAOSTAT database. First, 70% of this data was used to train ANFIS and MLP, and the remaining 30% of the data was used to test the models. The results disclosed that the ANFIS model with generalized bell-shaped (Gbell) built-in membership functions has the lowest error level in predicting food production.

When modeling yield, the difference between potential and actual yield consistently changes because of advances in technology. Considering historical yield potential would help determine spatiotemporal trends in agricultural development. Comparing current and historical yields in Denmark is possible because yield potential has been documented throughout history. However, the current national winter wheat yield map solely uses soil properties within the model. The aim of this study was to generate a new Danish winter wheat yield map and compare the results to historical yield potential. Utilizing random forest with soil, climate, and topography variables, a winter wheat yield map was generated from 876 field trials carried out from 1992 to 2018. The random forest model performed better than the model based only on soil. The updated national yield map was then compared to yield potential maps from 1688 and 1844. While historical time periods are characterized by numerous low yield potential areas and few highly productive areas, current yield is evenly distributed between low and high yields. Advances in technology and farm practices have exceeded historical yield predictions, mainly due to the use of fertilizer, irrigation, and drainage. Thus, modeling yield projections could be unreliable in the future as technology progresses. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

An accurate estimation of PET requires many input climate variables which are, in most cases, not available prior to the 1960s for the UK, nor indeed most parts of the world. Therefore, when applying hydrological models to earlier periods, modellers have to rely on PET estimations derived from simplified methods. Given that only monthly observed temperature data is readily available for the late 19th and early 20th century at a national scale for the UK, the objective of this work was to derive the best possible UK-wide gridded PET dataset from the limited data available.To that end, firstly, a combination of (i) seven temperature-based PET equations, (ii) four different calibration approaches and (iii) seven input temperature data were evaluated. For this evaluation, a gridded daily PET product based on the physically based Penman-Monteith equation (the CHESS PET dataset) was used, the rationale being that this provides a reliable ""ground truth"" PET dataset for evaluation purposes, given that no directly observed, distributed PET datasets exist. The performance of the models was also compared to a ""naïve method"", which is defined as the simplest possible estimation of PET in the absence of any available climate data. The ""naïve method"" used in this study is the CHESS PET daily long-term average (the period from 1961 to 1990 was chosen), or CHESS-PET daily climatology.The analysis revealed that the type of calibration and the input temperature dataset had only a minor effect on the accuracy of the PET estimations at catchment scale. From the seven equations tested, only the calibrated version of the McGuinness-Bordne equation was able to outperform the ""naïve method"" and was therefore used to derive the gridded, reconstructed dataset. The equation was calibrated using 43 catchments across Great Britain.The dataset produced is a 5km gridded PET dataset for the period 1891 to 2015, using the Met Office 5km monthly gridded temperature data available for that time period as input data for the PET equation. The dataset includes daily and monthly PET grids and is complemented with a suite of mapped performance metrics to help users assess the quality of the data spatially.This dataset is expected to be particularly valuable as input to hydrological models for any catchment in the UK. © Author(s) 2018.",,,Article,Scopus

To address the water quality implications of increased biofuel production, biofuel scenarios were tested with a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model revision featuring improved biofuel crop representation. Scenarios included corn stover removal and the inclusion of two perennial bioenergy crops, switchgrass and Miscanthus, grown on marginal lands (slopes >2% and erosion rates >2 t/ha) and nonmarginal lands. The SWAT model estimates show water quality is not very sensitive to stover removal. The perennial bioenergy crops reduce simulated sediment, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) yields by up to 60%. Simulated sediment and P reductions in marginal lands were generally twice that occurring in the nonmarginal lands. The highest unit area reductions of N occurred in the less sloping tile-drained lands. Productivity showed corn grain yield was independent from stover removal, while yields of the two perennial bioenergy crops were similar in the marginal and nonmarginal lands. The results suggest planning for biofuel production in the Corn Belt could include the removal of stover in productive corn areas, and the planting of perennial bioenergy crops in marginal land and in low-sloped tile-drained areas characterized by high N pollution.

The MOD09A1 data, which are eight-day interval surface reflectance data, were obtained from day of the year (DOY) 89 to 337 to calculate the leaf area index (LAI). The sum of the LAI from early in the season to a given date in the season (end of DOY (EOD)) was well fitted to a logistic function and represented seasonal changes in leaf area duration (LAD). A simple phenology model was derived to estimate the dates of emergence and maturity using the LAD-logistic function parameters b1 and b2, which represented the rate of increase in LAI and the date of maximum LAI, respectively. The phenology model predicted emergence and maturity dates fairly well, with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 6.3 and 4.9 days for the validation dataset, respectively. Two simple linear regression models (YP and YF) were established using LAD as the variable to predict corn yield. The yield model YP used LAD from predicted emergence to maturity, and the yield model Yf used LAD for a predetermined period from DOY 89 to a particular EOD. When state/province corn yields for the validation dataset were predicted at DOY 321, near completion of the corn harvest, the YP model, including the predicted phenology, performed much better than the Yf model, with RMSE values of 0.68 t/ha and 0.66 t/ha for Illinois and Heilongjiang, respectively. The Yp model showed similar or better performance, even for the much earlier pre-harvest yield prediction at DOY 257. In addition, the model performance showed no difference between the two study regions with very different climates and cultivation methods, including cultivar and irrigation management. These results suggested that the approach described in this paper has potential for application to relatively wide agroclimatic regions with different cultivation methods and for extension to the other crops. However, it needs to be examined further in tropical and sub-tropical regions, which are very different from the two study regions with respect to agroclimatic constraints and agrotechnologies. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","LAD; Logistic function; MODIS; Phenology; Yield","Biology; Crops; Cultivation; Forecasting; Image reconstruction; Mean square error; Radiometers; Regression analysis; Satellite imagery; Irrigation management; Logistic functions; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer datum; MODIS; Phenology; Root mean square errors; Simple linear regression; Yield; Climate models",Article,Scopus

Two runs were performed using the standard version of RegCM4 and the modified one of the same model taking into account the incorporated forest. The reforestation significantly modifies rainfall signal over West Africa by increasing it over the reforested zone and the Fouta Jallon highlands (FJH). This rainfall increase is associated with a strengthening of the atmospheric moisture over the reforested area. This atmospheric moisture content increase associated with the wind dynamic may explain the spatiotemporal change of the rainfall and extreme precipitation events. The analysis of the impacts of the reforestation on some rainfall indices shows an increase of the 90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles over the reforested zone and off the FJH.

The aim of this study was to identify the key meteorological factors affecting the harvest date (model M_HARV) and yield of the soybean variety Augusta (model M_YIELD) using a neural network sensitivity analysis. The dates of the start of flowering and maturity, the yield data, the average daily temperatures and precipitation were collected, and the Selyaninov hydrothermal coefficients were calculated during a fifteen-year study (2005–2020 growing seasons). During the experiment, highly variable weather conditions occurred, strongly modifying the course of phenological phases in soybean and the achieved seed yield of Augusta cultivar. The harvesting of mature soybean seeds took place between 131 and 156 days after sowing, while the harvested yield ranged from 0.6 t·ha−1 to 2.6 t·ha−1 . The sensitivity analysis of the MLP neural network made it possible to identify the factors which had the greatest impact on the tested dependent variables among all the analyzed factors. It was revealed that the variables assigned ranks 1 and 2 in the sensitivity analysis of the neural network forming the M_HARV model were total rainfall in the first decade of June and the first decade of August. The variables with the highest impact on the Augusta soybean seed yield (model M_YIELD) were the mean daily air temperature in the second decade of May and the Seljaninov coefficient values calculated for the sowing–flowering date period. © 2022 by the authors.

We also integrated several datasets including satellite remote sensing and in-situ measurements for a twenty-year time period (2000–2019). Our results show that despite no significant trend being observed in temperature and precipitation, vegetation indices expressed an increasing trend at both the control and treated watersheds. The vegetation cover was not significantly affected by the natural factors whereas the watershed management practice (as a human activity) had significant impacts on vegetation change in the long-term. Further, the vegetation cover long-term response to watershed management practice was mainly linear. We also found that the vegetation indices values in the 2011–2019 period (as the treated period in treated watershed) were significantly higher than those in the 2000–2010 period. In the short-term, however, the drought condition and decreased precipitation (as natural factors) explained the majority of the change in vegetation cover.

Recent developments in interpretable machine learning techniques offer opportunities to use these methods in agronomic studies. Our objectives were two-fold: (1) to assess the performance of different machine learning methods to explain on-farm wheat yield variability in the Northwestern Indo-Gangetic Plains of India, and (2) to identify the most important drivers and interactions explaining wheat yield variability. A suite of fine-tuned machine learning models (ridge and lasso regression, classification and regression trees, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, gradient boosting, extreme gradient boosting, and random forest) were statistically compared using the R2, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The best performing model was again fine-tuned using a grid search approach for the bias-variance trade-off. Three post-hoc model agnostic techniques were used to interpret the best performing model: variable importance (a variable was considered “important” if shuffling its values increased or decreased the model error considerably), interaction strength (based on Friedman's H-statistic), and two-way interaction (i.e., how much of the total variability in wheat yield was explained by a particular two-way interaction). Model outputs were compared against empirical data to contextualize results and provide a blueprint for future analysis in other production systems. Tree-based and decision boundary-based methods outperformed regression-based methods in explaining wheat yield variability. Random forest was the best performing method in terms of goodness-of-fit and model precision and accuracy with RMSE, MAE, and R2 ranging between 367 and 470 kg ha−1, 276–345 kg ha−1, and 0.44–0.63, respectively. Random forest was then used for selection of important variables and interactions. The most important management variables explaining wheat yield variability were nitrogen application rate and crop residue management, whereas the average of monthly cumulative solar radiation during February and March (coinciding with reproductive phase of wheat) was the most important biophysical variable. The effect size of these variables on wheat yield ranged between 227 kg ha−1 for nitrogen application rate to 372 kg ha−1 for cumulative solar radiation during February and March. The effect of important interactions on wheat yield was detected in the data namely the interaction between crop residue management and disease management and, nitrogen application rate and seeding rate. For instance, farmers’ fields with moderate disease incidence yielded 750 kg ha−1 less when crop residues were removed than when crop residues were retained. Similarly, wheat yield response to residue retention was higher under low seed and N application rates. As an inductive research approach, the appropriate application of interpretable machine learning methods can be used to extract agronomically actionable information from large-scale farmer field data. © 2022 The Authors","Accumulated local effect plot; Big data; Interaction strength; Partial dependency plot; Quantile regression; Random forest; Variable importance","crop yield; disease incidence; machine learning; productivity; regression; India",Article,Scopus

We evaluated the efficacy of creating high-resolution, broad-scale indicators of yield from simple models that combine yield mapping data, a precision agriculture tool, with the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Landsat 5 and 7 ETM+ imagery. These models were then generalised to test its potential operationalisation across a large agricultural region (>1/2 million hectares) and the state of South Australia (>8 million hectares). Annual models were the best predictors of yield across both areas. Moderate discrimination accuracy in the regional analysis meant that models could be extrapolated with reasonable spatial precision, whereas the accuracy across the state-wide analysis was poor. Generalisation of these models to further operationalise the methodology by removing the need for crop type discrimination and the continual access to annual yield data showed some benefit.

As affected by complex background such as soil, ground, plastic film and lots of overlapping green leaves in greenhouse, it is difficult to recognize disease from image of tomato leaf. In order to provide a solution for such problem, an innovate tomato early blight disease spot detection method of sliding window SVM (SW-SVM) was proposed. To enhance recognition accuracy and stability, color and texture features included color moment (CM), color coherence vector (CCV) and rotation invariant co-occurrence among adjacent LBPs (RIC-LBP) features were introduced, and CCR-SVM (CM+CCV+RIC-LBP+SVM) classification model were trained by using RBF-SVM with the extracted color texture feature (CCR) from the training samples. Meanwhile, for supporting small region data set and to fulfill recognize performance under complex environment, original images were divided to small region images by applying sliding window. And small region images belonged to early blight disease spot, healthy leaves and ground background were selected and divided into three catalogs as training samples. To verify feasibility of the proposed method, offline and online experiments were conducted. For offline classification performance, cross validation average recognition rate was 99.55% and recognition rate for testing data set was 96.97%, and average testing time for a single sliding window image was 0.004 s. For online detection performance, the results showed that the proposed method can realize average accuracy rate for the original images with 86.39%, average detection time of single sliding windows image with 0.073 s. For rotated images and pixel value adjusted image data, average accuracy rate was 88.98% and 92.59%, respectively; average error recognition rate was 12.71% and 16.44%, respectively; average missing recognition rate was 10.93% and 7.41%, respectively; and average disease detection time of single sliding window image was 0.075 s and 0.074 s, respectively.

So, decision support tools, on-farm nutrient cycling models, and life cycle assessment tools to assess the sustainability of agricultural production systems that include manure typically use ambient air temperature as a surrogate for manure temperature. This study explores the application of machine learning algorithms' unique abilities to predict manure temperature based on measured data. The data was collected from two on-farm manure storages (clay pit and concrete tank) instrumented with sensors to acquire manure temperature at various depths during the storage period. The local weather data (ambient air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, solar radiation, relative humidity, and rainfall) were recorded by stations installed at each farm. The data were subjected to four machine learning algorithms gradient boosted trees, bagged tree ensembles, random forest ensembles, and neural networks using the supervised learning approach. The weather data and two additional parameters, time (month) and the manure depth above a sensor, were derived and used as inputs for the machine learning algorithms. Further, the developed machine learning algorithms were challenged with parameters from historical weather data (1990 to 2020) to assess their suitability to predict manure temperature where local weather is not available. The results showed that, in general, the stored manure temperature lagged but followed a similar trend as the ambient air temperature and solar radiation. The average manure temperature was higher than the ambient air temperature for most of the year. Depth influenced the manure temperature; manure in the top layers had a higher temperature during warm periods than the bottom layers, and vice versa during cold seasons. The ensemble models performed better than the neural networks by predicting manure temperatures closer to the measured values and predictions during the scenario analysis. The random forests and bagged tree ensembles were the best performers. Models tended to make better predictions as the depth of manure above a sensor increased. This work will provide added value for developing better decision support tools and models for assessing nutrient cycling on farms. It also informs our knowledge to develop emission mitigation strategies during manure storage, leading to more sustainable manure management practices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Dairy manure; Machine learning; Manure emissions; Manure storages; Modeling manure temperature","Atmospheric temperature; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Digital storage; Fertilizers; Forecasting; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Life cycle; Meteorology; Nutrients; Solar radiation; Wind; Ambient air temperature; Dairy manures; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Manure emission; Manure storages; Modeling manure temperature; Nutrients cycling; Support tool; Weather data; Machine learning; agricultural production; air temperature; algorithm; assessment method; detection method; gas storage; machine learning; sensor; solar radiation; storage; temperature effect",Article,Scopus

To achieve sustainability, we formulate a multiobjective (MO) optimization problem, in which the decision maker determines the cultivation areas and the supplemental irrigation water levels at different locations, with social, economic, and environmental goals in mind. For the social goal, we minimize the root mean squared difference of incomes among locations. For the economic goal, we minimize the production risk. We show that minimizing production risk is equivalent to maximizing the service level, when demand is normally distributed. For the environmental goal, we minimize the resource utilization. Assume that the yield vector at different locations follows a multivariate normal distribution. We formulate the MO optimization problem using a weight global criterion method, and we provide a sufficient condition for convex quadratic programming. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed framework in the case study of sugarcane production in Thailand. To capture yield response to water, we propose several models including linear and nonlinear regressions, and we obtain the closed-form expression for the linear and probit yield response models. The numerical experiment reveals that our solution significantly improves the social and economic goals, compared to the current policy.

This study was conducted in 2015 to evaluate the interspecific competition in tree-based intercropping systems in a semiarid region of Saman County, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province, Iran. Wheat and barley intercropping with almond trees in comparison with the conventional sole-cropping was investigated in terms of the photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), leaf area index, crop growth rate (CGR), net assimilation rate (NAR), amount of the residual elements in the soil, soil organic carbon, and crop yields at three distances from the trees (0.5 m, 1.5 m, and 2.5 m). According to the results, the PAR intercepted by the crops increased with distances from the tree. The highest intercepted PAR in almond–barley and almond–wheat systems was 1017 and 796 µmol m−2 s−1, respectively, at a distance of 2.5 m from the trees. The shading of the almond tree at 0.5 m from the trunk caused a reduction in the intercepted PAR by about 80%. This trend was repeated for the NAR and CGR, which had the highest values at distance of 2.5 m from the tree. The highest grain yields for wheat and barley (2985 and 2180 kg ha−1, respectively) were obtained by intercropping systems at the distance of 2.5 m from the trees, which were 35% and 39% higher than their respective monocultures. The remaining nutrients in the soil were also affected by the planting systems and their distance from the tree. For example, in barley–almond system, the highest amounts of soil organic carbon (0.89 g kg−1), total nitrogen (0.8 g kg−1), phosphorus (15.5 mg kg−1), and potassium (289 mg kg−1) in soil were observed at a distance of 0.5 m from the almond trees, which were higher than the monoculture by about 55, 63, 48, and 53%, respectively. In general, the amounts of residual nutrients of the soil were greater for the agroforestry system. The reduction of PAR in agroforestry systems was the most important crop limitation, which can be managed by increasing the distance from the trees. According to the data regarding carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium residues in the soil of agroforestry system, it could be concluded that soil fertility was not limiting crop performance. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Agroforestry; Competition; Monoculture; Nutrient; PAR","agroforestry; cereal; crop plant; crop yield; deciduous tree; growth rate; intercropping; monoculture; organic carbon; photosynthetically active radiation; semiarid region; soil fertility; soil nutrient; Iran; Hordeum; Prunus dulcis; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

At this time, data related to rice avaibility is still spread across several agencies and difficult to access easily and quickly to support strategic and rapid decision making. This data is the level of fertility of rice plants, fertilizers and water content at certain locations and times. Fertilizers, new superior varieties and water content are production factors that are vital in supporting the efforts to increase national rice production. New superior varieties including hybrid rice are generally responsive to macro fertilizers NPC (Nitrogen-Phosporus-Calcium), where fertilization efficiency and effectiveness is very dependent on local location. The use of fertilizers with excessive doses must be prevented by socializing the right dosage specifically for location and time. The use of fertilizers with high doses of nitrogen also results in plants being more susceptible to plant pests. Based on the consideration of efficiency and sustainability, the use of uniform recommended doses for large areas and not considering the specific conditions of the plant is no longer relevant to be applied. Therefore the distribution of the characteristics of rice and soil at specific locations and times is very important information. Research objectives to develop technology that integrates operational information systems at farmer levels (SMS, GSM or IoT) and information systems in management levels with GIS, Spatial data mining, Kriging Interpolation and Artificial Intelligence systems that have prediction ability and optimization of food security problems, especially rice.

Understanding the parameters affecting crop productivity is essential for an efficient agriculture. We compared two statistical methods: random forest (RF), and multiple linear regression (MLR), to evaluate the effects of various parameters, including subsoiling, on corn (Zea mays L.) plant height and on seasonal mean water table depth. We performed subsoiling treatments in a clay field of low permeability, provided with subsurface drains and remodeled with rounded beds. These experiments allowed comparing a control without subsoiling to four subsoiling treatments: a tractor and a bulldozer operated parallel and perpendicular to the subsurface drains. Each treatment was randomized and repeated three times. In the spring of 2016, we drilled 198 60-cm deep water table depth observation wells. The corn height was estimated by photogrammetry. The results showed that both RF and MLR allowed determining the main factors affecting plant height and seasonal mean water table depth, for which subsoiling treatments played a negligible role. Coefficients of determination were much higher and prediction intervals much smaller for RF (R2 ≥ 0.94) than for MLR (R2: 0.28-0.69). RF allowed visualizing nonlinear relationships between mean water table depth, plant height and the predictor variables, such as XY coordinates, horizontal distance to the field open drain and depth to subsurface drains which are all related to the position on the beds. To maximize corn plant height in this type of soil, RF also showed that the horizontal distance to drain must be less than 3–4 m, and therefore optimal drain spacing is 7 m, horizontal distance to field open drains is more than 8 m, and optimal mean seasonal water table depth is greater than 0.25 m. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Corn plant height; Multiple linear regression; Random forest; Soil bedding; Subsoiling; Subsurface drainage; Tile drainage; Water table depth","Cultivation; Decision trees; Drainage; Groundwater flow; Linear regression; Plants (botany); Soil mechanics; Soils; Corn plant; Multiple linear regressions; Random forests; Subsoiling; Subsurface drainages; Tile drainage; Water table depths; Groundwater; clay soil; compaction; deep water; growth response; maize; numerical method; permeability; prediction; seasonality; spacing; subsoil; tile drain; water table; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Previous regional studies have suggested that the predictable seasonal pattern of a climatic time series, or seasonality, might aid in the prediction of average fire activity, but it is not known whether these findings are applicable globally. Here, we investigate how seasonality can be used to explain variations in fire activity on a global scale. Location: Global, 60° S–60° N. Time period: Data averaged over the period 1999–2015. Methods: We describe a method to partition a periodic seasonal cycle into two seasons and define conceptually simple temporal metrics that describe spatial variability in seasonality. We explore the usefulness of these metrics in explaining global fire activity using the average monthly time series of precipitation and temperature and a flexible machine learning procedure (random forests). Results: A simple model that uses only precipitation and temperature amplitude and synchrony between wet and warm seasons correctly predicts 66% of the variability in global fire activity, substantially more than a model with mean annual temperature and precipitation. A more complex model that includes all nine metrics predicts 87% of variability in global fire activity. Main conclusions: This study shows that seasonality of temperature and precipitation can be used to predict multi-year average fire activity in a globally relevant way. The mechanisms highlighted in our work could be used to improve global fire models and enhance their ability to represent the spatial patterns of fire activity. Our method might also be useful in hindcasting historical fire using reanalysis or predicting future fire regimes using coarse output from climate models. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","burned area; fire prediction; pyrogeography; seasonality","climate modeling; fire; machine learning; precipitation (climatology); prediction; seasonality; spatial variation; temperature profile",Article,Scopus

To geospatially link potential locations to individual land owners, a land-use layer that incorporated specific crops and crop rotations needed to be developed. Model results obtained using the new land-use layer are compared to those obtained using a more conventional land-use layer. Results indicate that water flow and nutrient loadings are similar at the basin outlet, confirming the overall consistency of the approach. Water flow results at upland subbasin outlets appear similar; however, nutrient loadings are different since the crop distributions in the alternative approach are more representative of actual practice in the basin.

This DSS is based on the multifunctional evaluation of soil quality, using input data collected in standard soil surveys, and with particular reference to the peculiarities of the Mediterranean region. Specific agro-ecological strategies to prevent soil degradation in the benchmark sites were designed within two major topics: (i) strategies related to land use planning at a regional level: segregation of agricultural lands, restoration of marginal areas, diversification of crop rotation, and identification of vulnerability areas; and (ii) those related to land management planning at a farm level: organic matter restoration, formulation of tillage practices and workability timing, optimum machinery use, and input rationalization. The predicted results of applying the 12 agro-ecological land evaluation model constituents of MicroLEIS DSS are presented and discussed for each application site. The main conclusion of this paper is that using soil type information in decision-making is at the heart for sustainable use and management of agricultural land.

Although the crop growth models provide accurate yield forecasting, these models are difficult to implement in developing countries like India due to inhomogeneous or/and lack of required information about crop, soil, weather, etc. On the contrary, remotely sensed imagery available homogeneously provides valuable inputs for this purpose. Particularly, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data proved to have great potential for paddy growth monitoring and biophysical parameters retrieval over optical data. Moreover, the effective use of artificial neural network (ANN) may enable us to understand the complex relation between parameters as well as improve the forecasting performance than using empirical-/semiempirical-based approaches. Thus, the study aims to analyze multi-temporal dual-polarization C-band Sentinel-1 SAR data for paddy yield forecasting using ANN model. In this study, smart sampling based on the normalized difference vegetation (NDVI) and normalized difference water index has been considered to obtain in situ yield measurements in the study area. The peak stage signature of backscattering coefficients is considered to estimate yield due to the maximum possibility of signal to interact with crop cover characteristics. It is observed that the VH-polarization-based ANN model provides better accuracy with coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.72 and 600.11 kg/ha, respectively, in comparison with VV polarization which has shown 0.26 and 948.46 kg/ha, respectively. Overall, the study demonstrates that the effective use of ANN model may provide reliable yield estimation accuracy from remotely sensed imagery alone. © 2022, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","ANN; Crop yield; Paddy; Remote sensing; SAR","artificial neural network; crop yield; forecasting method; paddy field; remote sensing; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar",Article,Scopus

The present study simulated reductions in light intensity caused by walnut trees (Juglans regia L.) before budburst, between budburst to tree foliage expansion, and after foliage expansion, to examine the effects on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield and quality in an agroforestry system. We designed artificial shading systems using black polyethylene screen of varying density (21 %, 44 and 74%reductions in light intensity) at the jointing (approximately 70 d of shading), booting (approximately 55 d of shading), and anthesis (approximately 40 d of shading) stages, with full solar radiation (S0) as a control. Reduced light intensity significantly decreased the number of fertile florets per spike, resulting in a marked decline in grains per spike. Decreased light intensity also significantly decreased photosynthetic rates, grain yield and associated components (spike number, grains per spike, and thousand-grain weight), Furthermore, when applied at the anthesis stage, shading had the strongest negative impact on wheat productivity via decreases in thousand-grain weight. Decreased light intensity substantially enhanced grain and stalk nitrogen concentrations, as well as protein and wet gluten contents. However, the increase in grain quality did not compensate for the decreased final grain yield.

In previous research, different crop phenology models were compared, and different parameterization methods for crop model calibration were evaluated, which revealed that both model structures and parameterization methods were important for crop modeling. However, few studies have considered the combination of both factors and compared these influences simultaneously. Therefore, information regarding the extent of variation in model accuracy and uncertainty depending on model structure and parameterization method is lacking. In this study, we developed three winter wheat phenology models with different structures, i.e., the Agricultural Production System Simulator model for wheat (APSIM-wheat), Wang and Engel model, and sigmoid and exponential function based model, to predict the heading date as a case study. We calibrated these models using three different parameterization methods (augmented Lagrange multiplier method, Nelder-Mead method, and Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process) to investigate their effects on model accuracy and uncertainty. Six-fold cross validation of nine combinations of model calibration (3 models × 3 parameterizations) and their validation revealed that accuracies ranged mostly from 2 to 7 days in the root mean square error (RMSE). The coefficient of variation of RMSE varied widely in among model structures and parameterization methods (∼0.01–0.6). Furthermore, the coefficient of variation of model parameters also varied substantially depending both on model structure and parameterization method. Especially for the model with more parameters, we found that the prediction and parameter stability varied depending on parameterization methods. These findings suggest that both prediction and parameter uncertainty varied with model structure and parameterization method and emphasize the importance of which models and parameterization methods modelers use for robust crop phenology model. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Model structure; Optimization; Parameter uncertainty; Parameterization; Prediction uncertainty; Wheat phenology model","agricultural modeling; Bayesian analysis; calibration; error analysis; Gaussian method; optimization; parameterization; uncertainty analysis; wheat; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

This study aims to derive reservoir operating rules through establishing a multi-objective optimization model for the Xinfengjiang (XFJ) reservoir in the East River Basin in southern China to minimize water supply deficit and maximize hydropower generation. Additionally, to enhance the estimation of irrigation water demand from the downstream agricultural area of the XFJ reservoir, a conventional method for calculating crop water demand is improved using hydrological model simulation results. Although the optimal reservoir operating rules are derived for the XFJ reservoir with three priority scenarios (water supply only, hydropower generation only, and equal priority), the river environmental health is set as the basic demand no matter which scenario is adopted. The results show that the new rules derived under the three scenarios can improve the reservoir operation for both water supply and hydropower generation when comparing to the historical performance. Moreover, these alternative reservoir operating policies provide the flexibility for the reservoir authority to choose the most appropriate one. Although changing the current operating rules may influence its hydropower-oriented functions, the new rules can be significant to cope with the increasingly prominent water shortage and degradation in the aquatic environment.

Best management practices (BMPs) were run through the model to simulate the effects of watershed intervention scenarios on sediment yield and runoff. Simulation results of BMP intervention were compared with the reference and worst-case scenarios. The simulation of sediment production indicates a clear growing trend. Temporally, the maximum amount of sediment transported out of the watershed is experiential from June to September, and the minimum is in February. A plainly defined similar orientation is observed between precipitation, surface runoff, and sediment load in the landscape. Spatially, the maximum sediment transported out of the watershed is from agricultural landscape units with a slope of over 50%, annual precipitation above 1592 mm, and surface runoff over 151 mm. This signifies that the watershed is under serious threat from erosion due to vegetation loss, steep slope farming, and high surface runoff. Gibe III is a 243-m high roller compacted gravity dam built on the Omo-Gibe River basin in Ethiopia for hydroelectric power and downstream flood control. It is one of Africa’s tallest dams, with an annual electric output of 1870 MW that began operation in 2016. Thus, Gibe III could see a loss of storage capacity due to higher-than-expected sedimentation resulting from worsening environmental degradation, which implies that the beneficial uses that depend on this dam — electricity production, regulated irrigation water supply, and flood control — will decline with significant economic losses. Despite that, selected sustainable land management interventions and the application of BMPs to critical erosion-prone hotspot areas can support the overall reduction in total sediment yield and surface runoff. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","BMP intervention; Gojeb; Hydrosediment; Management scenario; Runoff discharge; Watershed","water; agriculture; Ethiopia; procedures; soil; water supply; Agriculture; Ethiopia; Soil; Water; Water Supply",Article,Scopus

The conventional practice of using a single variable to calibrate a hydrological model can lead to equifinality, which can result in substantial uncertainty in capturing the internal processes. Since multi-objective calibration process can be a way to solve this problem, a novel stepwise series of calibration experiments are employed by integrating (i) spatiotemporal remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration (AET) data in multi objective calibration process, (ii) Leaf area index (LAI) data, and (iii) AET and LAI data together in multi-objective calibration with Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). This calibration process aims for reducing the equifinality by improving the connected hydrologic internal processes rather than improvement in the assessment metrics at the catchment outlet. The results suggest that the integration of remotely sensed AET and LAI data in multi-objective calibration tend to increase model accuracy and reduce the prediction uncertainty, including significant improvement in simulated evapotranspiration and streamflow. In comparison with the traditional SWAT model, which is based on user input and semiempirical equations to simulate hydrologic processes, AET and LAI integration in multi-objective calibration notably captured the improved evapotranspiration and actual vegetation dynamics estimations, which resulted improvement in streamflow calibration. The findings showed the necessity of integrating remotely sensed AET and LAI data to improve the calibration and reduce the equifinality of hydrologic model simulations.

This can lead to structural changes in entire ecosystems, and serious, persistent environmental consequences. However, many of these changes occur in vast and poorly accessible biomes and involve myriad species. As a consequence, conventional methods of measurement and data analysis are resource-intensive, restricted in scope, and in some cases, intractable for measuring species changes in remote areas. In this article, we introduce a method for detecting flowers of tundra plant species in large data sets obtained by aerial drones, making it possible to understand ecological change at scale, in remote areas. We focus on the sedge species E. vaginatum that is dominant at the investigated tundra field site in the Canadian Arctic. Our system is a modified version of the Faster R-CNN architecture capable of real-world plant phenology analysis. Our model outperforms experienced human annotators in both detection and counting, recording much higher recall and comparable level of precision, regardless of the image quality caused by varying weather conditions during the data collection.

We conducted a retrospective study using the wheat blast outbreaks in Bangladesh, which occurred for the first time in Asia in 2016, to study a what-if scenario that if there was seasonal disease risk prediction at that time, the epidemics could be prevented or reduced through prediction-based interventions. Two factors govern the answer: the seasonal disease risk prediction is accurate enough to use, and there are effective and realistic control measures to be used upon the prediction. In this study, we focused on the former. To simulate the wheat blast risk and wheat yield in the target region, a high-resolution climate reanalysis product and spatiotemporally downscaled seasonal climate forecasts from eight global climate models were used as inputs for both models. The calibrated wheat blast model successfully simulated the spatial pattern of disease epidemics during the 2014–2018 seasons and was subsequently used to generate seasonal wheat blast risk prediction before each winter season starts. The predictability of the resulting predictions was evaluated against observation-based model simulations. The potential value of utilizing the seasonal wheat blast risk prediction was examined by comparing actual yields resulting from the risk-averse (proactive) and risk-disregarding (conservative) decisions. Overall, our results from this retrospective study showed the feasibility of seasonal forecast-based early warning system for the pre-season strategic interventions of forecasted wheat blast in Bangladesh. © Copyright © 2020 Kim and Choi.","climate reanalysis; disease epidemiological model; early warning system; global crop calendar; seasonal disease risk; winter wheat",,Article,Scopus

An analysis of variance (ANOVA), linear mixed-effects model (LMM), and MP5 regression tree model were used to evaluate the grain yield response. All the methods identified fertilizer application and environmental factors as the main variables that explained 80% of the variance in grain yields. Mineral nitrogen fertilizer (NF) application was the major factor that influenced the grain yield in all methods. Farmyard manure slightly influenced the grain yield with no NF application in the ANOVA and M5P regression tree. While sources of environmental factors were unmeasured in the ANOVA test, they were quantified in detail in the LMM and M5P model. The LMM and M5P model identified the cumulative number of freezing days in December as the main climate-based determinant of the grain yield variation. Additionally, the temperature in October, the cumulative number of freezing days in February, the yield of the preceding crop, and the total nitrogen in the soil were determinants of the grain yield in both models. Apart from the common determinants that appeared in both models, the LMM additionally showed precipitation in June and the cumulative number of days in July with temperatures above 30◦C, while the M5P model showed soil organic carbon as an influencing factor of the grain yield. The ANOVA results provide only the main factors affecting the WW yield. The LMM had a better predictive performance compared to the M5P, with smaller root mean square and mean absolute errors. However, they were richer regressors than the ANOVA. The M5P model presented an intuitive visualization of important variables and their critical thresholds, and revealed other variables that were not captured by the LMM model. Hence, the use of different methods can strengthen the statement of the analysis, and thus, the co-use of the LMM and M5P model should be considered, especially in large databases involving multiple variables. © 2020 by the authors.

To reduce the potential risk and provide support for agricultural flood management, prevention, and mitigation, it is important to account for flood damage to crop production and to understand the relationship between flood characteristics and crop losses. A quantitative and effective evaluation tool is therefore essential to explore what and how flood characteristics will affect the associated crop loss, based on accurately understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of flood evolution and crop growth. Current evaluation methods are generally integrally or qualitatively based on statistic data or ex-post survey with less diagnosis into the process and dynamics of historical flood events. Therefore, a quantitative and spatial evaluation framework is presented in this study that integrates remote sensing imagery and hydraulic model simulation to facilitate the identification of historical flood characteristics that influence crop losses. Remote sensing imagery can capture the spatial variation of crop yields and yield losses from floods on a grid scale over large areas; however, it is incapable of providing spatial information regarding flood progress. Two-dimensional hydraulic model can simulate the dynamics of surface runoff and accomplish spatial and temporal quantification of flood characteristics on a grid scale over watersheds, i.e., flow velocity and flood duration. The methodological framework developed herein includes the following: (a) Vegetation indices for the critical period of crop growth from mid-high temporal and spatial remote sensing imagery in association with agricultural statistics data were used to develop empirical models to monitor the crop yield and evaluate yield losses from flood; (b) The two-dimensional hydraulic model coupled with the SCS-CN hydrologic model was employed to simulate the flood evolution process, with the SCS-CN model as a rainfall-runoff generator and the two-dimensional hydraulic model implementing the routing scheme for surface runoff; and (c) The spatial combination between crop yield losses and flood dynamics on a grid scale can be used to investigate the relationship between the intensity of flood characteristics and associated loss extent. The modeling framework was applied for a 50-year return period flood that occurred in Jilin province, Northeast China, which caused large agricultural losses in August 2013. The modeling results indicated that (a) the flow velocity was the most influential factor that caused spring corn, rice and soybean yield losses from extreme storm event in the mountainous regions; (b) the power function archived the best results that fit the velocity-loss relationship for mountainous areas; and (c) integrated remote sensing imagery and two-dimensional hydraulic modeling approach are helpful for evaluating the influence of historical flood event on crop production and investigating the relationship between flood characteristics and crop yield losses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Flood characteristics; HJ-1A/B imagery; Remote sensing; Two-dimensional hydraulic model; Yield loss","Agricultural robots; Agricultural runoff; Crops; Cultivation; Dynamics; Flood control; Floods; Flow velocity; Food supply; Hydraulic models; Infiltration; Storms; Extreme storm events; Flood characteristics; HJ-1A/B imagery; Methodological frameworks; Remote sensing imagery; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Two-dimensional hydraulic model; Yield loss; Remote sensing; crop production; crop yield; flood; flood control; flood damage; flow velocity; food security; growth rate; maize; mountain region; rainfall-runoff modeling; remote sensing; rice; runoff; satellite imagery; soybean; two-dimensional modeling; yield response; China; Jilin; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

All these different tipping elements share common characteristics related to their nonlinear nature. They can also interact with each other leading to synergies that can lead to cascading tipping points. Even if the probability of each tipping event is low, they can happen relatively rapidly, involve multiple variables, and have large societal impacts. Therefore, adaptation measures and management in general should extend their focus beyond slow and continuous changes, into abrupt, nonlinear, possibly cascading, high impact phenomena. Remote sensing observations are found to be decisive in the understanding and determination of early warning signals of many tipping elements. Nevertheless, considerable research still remains to properly incorporate these data in the current generation of coupled Earth system models. This is a key prerequisite to correctly develop robust decadal prediction systems that may help to assess the risk of crossing thresholds potentially crucial for society. The prediction of tipping points remains difficult, notably due to stochastic resonance, i.e. the interaction between natural variability and anthropogenic forcing, asking for large ensembles of predictions to correctly assess the risks. Furthermore, evaluating the proximity to crucial thresholds using process-based understanding of each system remains a key aspect to be developed for an improved assessment of such risks. This paper finally proposes a few research avenues concerning the use of remote sensing data and the need for combining different sources of data, and having long and precise-enough time series of the key variables needed to monitor Earth system tipping elements. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","AMOC; Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets; Atlantic; Bifurcation; Climate dynamics; Early warning; Earth observation; Land use; Marine biology; Permafrost; Remote sensing; SPG; Terrestrial resource use; Tipping element; Tipping point","Ecosystems; Forecasting; Magnetic resonance; Remote sensing; Space optics; Stochastic systems; Antarctic ice sheets; Anthropogenic forcing; Decadal predictions; Overturning circulation; Remote sensing data; Social-ecological systems; Stochastic resonances; Terrestrial resources; Risk assessment; bifurcation; climate; early warning system; EOS; gyre; land use; marine environment; meridional circulation; permafrost; remote sensing; resource use; Antarctic Ice Sheet; Antarctica; Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet",Review,Scopus

Big data is a key concept for the future development of agriculture as it offers unprecedented capabilities and it enables various tools and services capable to change its current status. This survey paper covers the state-of-the-art agriculture systems and big data architectures both in research and commercial status in an effort to bridge the knowledge gap between agriculture systems and exploitation of big data. The first part of the paper is devoted to the exploration of the existing agriculture systems, providing the necessary background information for their evolution until they have reached the current status, able to support different platforms and handle multiple sources of information.

We also tested the influence of adjusting the quantity of local fertilization and irrigation on crop production in Guizhou Province. Results showed that the total yield of the selected crops had, on average, reached over 72.5% of the theoretical maximum yield. Increasing irrigation tended to be more consistently effective at increasing crop yield than additional fertilization. Conversely, appropriate reduction of fertilization may even benefit crop yield in some regions, simultaneously resulting in significantly higher fertilization efficiency with lower residuals in the environment.

Herein, we combined multi- ML algorithms with multi-crop models (CMs) of the DSSAT platform to develop a hybrid approach for wheat yield simulation over 40 years in different locations. The simulation analysis included temperatures (minimum and maximum), solar radiation, and precipitation as important key ecological factors in wheat production that varied across sites and years. Detailed observed datasets of wheat yield from 1981 to 2020 were used for training and testing Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest Regressor (RFR), and Support Vector Regressor (SVR) using Google Colaboratory (Colab). Such models were built to create four main approaches, including two approaches as hybrid (CMs-ML) and benchmark (pure ML), as well as two testing methods for each approach such as default (75 % training and 25 % testing) and warmest years (2001, 2006, 2009, 2010, and 2018). In addition to wheat yield simulations, ML approaches were used to identify the important features, improve accuracy, and reduce overfitting. We developed ML approaches by novel cells on the built models (i.e., pure ML and hybrid) to eliminate less important features from permutation. Our results revealed that ANN and RFR outperformed other ML algorithms (SVR and KNN) in wheat yield simulation accuracy. Application of ML algorithms reduced yield change from 31.7 % under DSSAT simulations to 8.1 % and uncertainty from 12.8 % to 7.2 % relative to observed wheat yield over the last four decades (1981–2020). Our novel approach, which includes a hybrid CMs-ML model, cloud computing, and a new permutation tool, could be effectively used for robust crop yield simulation on a regional and global scale, contributing to better aid decision-making strategies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial Neural Network; DSSAT; Google Colaboratory; K-Nearest Neighbors; Random Forest; Support Vector Regressor; Uncertainty; Wheat yield simulation","Cloud computing; Crops; Machine learning; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Random forests; Simulation platform; Textures; Well testing; DSSAT; Google colaboratory; Google+; K-near neighbor; Nearest-neighbour; Random forests; Support vector regressor; Uncertainty; Wheat yield; Wheat yield simulation; Decision trees; arid region; artificial neural network; cloud phenomena; crop yield; machine learning; simulation; uncertainty analysis",Article,Scopus

Skilful yield forecasts at the beginning of, or before, a cropping season can provide farmers and other stakeholders in agribusiness with the necessary information for early planning and actions. Only a few yield forecast studies have a forecast lead time of four months or longer due to the problem complexity. To enable SCFs from Global Climate Models (GCMs) to be used for early-season yield forecasts, this paper uses a statistical downscaling technique, Extended Copula Post-Processing (ECPP) and the Schaake shuffle, to downscale four climate variables to generate weather-like daily data that are suitable for agricultural applications. Climate forecasts drive a process-based crop model APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) to simulate crop forecasts on 50 stations, well-distributed across the Australian grain zone. To focus on yield forecast skills attributable to SCF, we propose best practice management rules to predict water-limited winter wheat yield. Yield forecasts from ECPP have a significant improvement over quantile mapping downscaling and raw SCF from the Australian recent seasonal forecast model ACCESS-S1 in terms of bias, accuracy, reliability, and overall forecast skill. In addition, even at the beginning of a cropping season with a forecast lead time of four or more months, yield forecasts driven by ECPP illustrate higher skill than climatology, a benchmark for yield forecast. Early-season yield forecasts driven by SCFs provides a promising alternative to regression/machine-learning-based forecasts. Performance sensitivity and issues, and gaps on using skilful SCFs to help growers with their farming decision-making are discussed. © 2022","Crop model; Post-processing; Probabilistic yield forecasts; Seasonal climate forecasts; Wheat yield forecast","agroindustry; climate modeling; crop yield; cropping practice; downscaling; weather forecasting; wheat",Article,Scopus

This study provides land productivity estimates in the contiguous United States (CONUS) through a machine learning approach. Land productivity is defined as the potential in producing agricultural outputs given biophysical properties including climate, soil, and land slope. The land productivity is approximated by the potential yields of six major crops in the CONUS, i.e. corn, soybean, winter wheat, spring wheat, cotton, and alfalfa. This quantitative relationship is then applied to estimating the availability of marginal land for bioenergy crop production in the CONUS. Furthermore, the levels of uncertainties associated with land productivity and marginal land estimates are quantified and discussed. Based on the modeling results, the total marginal land of the CONUS ranges 55.0-172.8 mha, but the 95% inter-percentile distance of the estimated productivity index reaches up to 60% of its expected value in data-scarce regions.

They constitute primary staple crops in drylands, where their production is known to date back over 5000 years ago. Compared to other crops, millets and sorghum have received less attention until very recently, and their production has been progressively reduced in the last 50 years. Here, we present new models that focus on the ecological factors driving finger millet, pearl millet and sorghum traditional cultivation, with a global perspective. The interaction between environment and traditional agrosystems was investigated by Redundancy Analysis of published literature and tested against novel ethnographic data. Contrary to earlier beliefs, our models show that the total annual precipitation is not the most determinant factor in shaping millet and sorghum agriculture. Instead, our results point to the importance of other variables such as the duration of the plant growing cycle, soil water-holding capacity or soil nutrient availability. This highlights the potential of finger millet, pearl millet and sorghum traditional cultivation practices as a response to recent increase of aridity levels worldwide. Ultimately, these practices can play a pivotal role for resilience and sustainability of dryland agriculture. Copyright: © 2023 Ruiz-Giralt et al.

However, such water accounting tools and models have dependencies to the choice of precipitation data used to drive the model, as the input bias propagate into simulated streamflow through interaction with different hydrological processes. This study performs a holistic investigation of sensitivity of water accounting fractions like blue water flow (BWF), green water flow (GWF), green water storage (GWS), and their dependencies on secondary precipitation datasets (SPDs) choices using a lumped conceptual rainfall-runoff model [Hydrological Simulation model (HYSIM)] and a physically based semi-distributed hydrological model [Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)] in the Damodar River basin, India. These models were driven by seven gridded precipitation datasets, including India Meteorological Department (IMD) data, Indian Monsoon Data Assimilation and Analysis (IMDAA) data, Asian Precipitation-Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation (APHRODITE) data, Watch forcing ERA-Interim data, Climate Hazard Group Infrared Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), PRINCETON precipitation data and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Network-Climate Data Records (PERSIANN-CDR) data. The reference IMD based multimodel results revealed that the annual average blue and green water components of the Damoder River were in the range of 558–656 mm/year, 574–728 mm/year and 34–112 mm/year for BWF, GWF, and GWS respectively during 1994–2010 period. The results obtained after applying parameter transferability approach across the input space have revealed exact quantification of choice dependent annual variations in spatial and temporal characteristics of BWF, GWF, and GWS. A further evaluation based on error propagation ratios (γCC, γrRMSE, γB) has revealed a quantification of input choice induced dampening/magnification effects on flow estimations of both the HYSIM and SWAT and these quantifications were free from the compensation effects of recalibration. The findings in this study demonstrate that the change in annual average BWF varies between −46.97% to +41.38% in comparison to benchmark IMD simulations, and the corresponding changes for GWF is between −19.63% and +17.06% and for GWS is between −29.97% to +35.5% with different choices of SPD scenarios.

However, agricultural applications, such as yield prediction and sowing timing, require seasonal forecast data at high temporal (daily) and spatial (field-scale) resolutions. In this study, a hybrid model was proposed that coupled a global climate model (GloSea5GC2) with a regularized extreme learning machine (RELM) to perform seasonal forecasting (up to 90 days) of daily mean air temperatures at the field scale. Twenty candidate frameworks for the hybrid model were developed by employing different combinations of the transformation scheme, numbers of climate model ensemble members, and learning algorithms. The output blending method was also evaluated. Results showed that the hybrid models demonstrated a good capacity for long-range prediction at the field scale. In particular, the hybrid model (root mean square error, RMSE, 1.02–3.35) demonstrated better predictive skill compared to the climatology model (RMSE 1.61–3.37) at all lead times. When the hybrid model frameworks were compared, the framework which combined centered data with hindcast data, ensemble learning, and the member mean method was the most appropriate. Adopting the centering scheme with hindcast data as RELM input data had the largest influence on hybrid model predictive skill, improving model performance by 3–20% based on RMSE. The output blending method was found to be a suitable alternative when hindcast data were unavailable. The results of this study provide insight into the development of seasonal forecast hybrid models for agro-climatic variables such as minimum and maximum air temperature, relative humidity, and specific humidity at the field scale. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Daily mean air temperature prediction; Downscaling; GloSea5GC2; Long-term prediction; Machine learning","agricultural management; air temperature; climate modeling; decision making; downscaling; global climate; machine learning; prediction; seasonal variation",Article,Scopus

The uncertainty is quantified using the Cramer-von Mises score (CvM) to measure the ""distance"" between the simulated and observed CDFs. The ability of the three RCMs and CDF-t to simulate the ""climate"" variability is quantified with the explained variance, variance ratio and extreme occurrence. The study shows that despite their differences, the three RCMs display very similar performance. In terms of global distributions (i.e. CvM), all models perform better than ERA-40 for both seasons and variables. However, looking at variance criteria, RCMs are not always much better than ERA-40 reanalyses, whereas CDF-t produces accurate results when applied to ERA-40. In a second step, a combined statistical/dynamical downscaling approach has been used, consisting in applying CDF-t to the RCM outputs. It shows that CDF-t applied to the RCM outputs does not necessarily produce better results than those from CDF-t directly applied to ERA-40. It also shows that CDF-t applied to RCMs generally improves the downscaled CDFs and that the ""additional"" added value of CDF-t applied to the RCMs is independent of the performance of the RCMs in terms of CvM, explained variance, variance ratio and extreme occurrence. © 2012 Author(s).",,"assessment method; climate modeling; downscaling; rainfall; regional climate; statistical analysis; temperature effect; wind forcing; Mediterranean Sea",Article,Scopus

Machine learning (ML) is now being applied to environmental problems, and it is, therefore, opportune to investigate ML models in CO2 predictions from agricultural soils. In this study, six ML models were compared for their predictive performance by comparing field measurements of CO2 emissions from two fertiliser treatments: inorganic fertiliser (IF) and solid cattle manure supplemented with inorganic fertiliser (SCM) applied to a maize-soy rotation. The study also included a generalised scenario where all the data from IF and SCM were included in one dataset. The ML models include support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), feed-forward neural network (FNN), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), and extreme learning machine (ELM). The input parameters were soil moisture, soil temperature, soil organic matter, soil total carbon, soil total nitrogen, air temperature, solar radiation and pan evaporation, while the output parameter was field measured CO2 emissions. The results of this study demonstrated that RF was the best at predicting CO2 emissions from IF [coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.92 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 2.27], SCM (R2 = 0.94 and RMSE = 2.86) and generalised scenarios (R2 = 0.86 and RMSE = 3.05).

In the recent two decades, the number of models has grown rapidly, but the increase in their quality does not match the growth in number. Often, an ensemble of multiple models is required to make a useful prediction. This ensemble approach does not facilitate the improvement of models as a tool to understand crop physiological mechanisms. On the other hand, following a bottom-up approach that tries to assemble all elements along different scales of biological organisation may result in numerically clumsy models that are not necessarily more robust than existing models in simulating phenotypes at the crop scale. We argue that to model complex crop phenotypes in a simple yet accurate manner, crop modellers should be inspired by experiences in some fundamental sciences. For example, physicists used sound theories and solid mathematics in thought experiments, and came up with seemingly simple equations to explain the behaviour of very diverse systems, from sub-atomic particles to the largest clusters of galaxies. We review examples, where biological insights and mathematics are combined to derive simple equations that apply to different processes of crop growth. The essence of this modelling approach is a combination of simplicity, elegance and robustness. Models integrating those equations can predict crop phenotypes as well as generate hypotheses or emerging properties to assist in knowing the unknowns. Thus, crop models should not only provide practical predictions, but should especially be considered as a research tool for data interpretation, system design, and heuristic understanding. © 2021 The Author(s)","Algorithm simplicity; Crop model improvement; Model heuristics; Systems behaviour","crop performance; mathematics; numerical model; phenotype; physiology",Review,Scopus

The advantage of remote sensing data-crop model assimilation for yield estimates has been well recognized, however its potential for early-season crop yield forecasting has not yet been investigated. In this study, combining a crop model, remote sensing leaf area index (LAI) assimilation and weather forecasts, we conducted yield forecasting for winter wheat in the central North China Plain during 2008–2015. Sequential forecasting was conducted to assess the yield forecasting potential and the effects of LAI assimilation and multiple weather forecasts with different lead times. Results showed that forecasting skill increased with shortening of lead time. Assimilating remote sensing LAI into crop model was valuable and critical to improve yield forecasting skills. The uncertainties from weather forecasts could weaken the forecasting skills; and using historical weather observations performed better than using weather forecasts outputted by climate models. In general, winter wheat yield in the central North China Plain could be reliably forecasted with a lead time from five weeks (mean MAPE < 10%, ROC score > 0.8, ACC> 0.65) to two months (mean MAPE <12%, ROC score> 0.75, ACC > 0.55) before harvest. The study highlights that current available data can provide fair yield forecasting; nevertheless the remote sensing LAI data and weather forecasts need further improvements to improve yield forecasting skills and provide valuable suggestions for stakeholders to respond to the forecasts timely. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Crop model; Data assimilation; Food security; Remote sensing; Yield forecasting","crop yield; leaf area index; satellite data; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; weather forecasting; China; North China Plain",Article,Scopus

Previous studies have focused on investigating the hydrology of shallow drains at discrete locations. However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated the profitability of shallow drains across a wide range of soil and climatic conditions. The main objective of this study was to comparatively evaluate the effects of 75-cm shallow drains versus 125-cm deep drains on profitability and hydrology of subsurface drainage systems across the eastern USA. We conducted DRAINMOD simulations under continuous corn production (Zea mays L.) using 30 years of weather data (1990–2019) for combinations of three factors: two drain depths, four soils, and seven locations. Simulations were optimized for crop production that maximized annual economic return on investment. The results showed that corn yield for shallow drains went from 1.6% increase to –1.3% decrease with increasing growing-season rainfall from northeast to southeast USA. Shallow drains provided the benefit of reduced year-to-year corn yield variability across the region. Corn yield for coarse-textured soil benefited more from shallow drains than fine-textured soil across the region. Even though shallow drains increased annual benefit from higher corn yield under certain soil and weather conditions, they were less profitable than deep drains (lower benefit-cost ratio and higher payback period). The benefit of drainage discharge reduction under shallow drains generally intensified with increasing annual precipitation from northeast to southeast USA. Results were used to develop an empirical equation for estimating the benefit of drainage discharge reduction with shallow drains in the eastern USA. In conclusion, even though shallow drains were less profitable than deep drains, they provide benefits that may be of interest to farmers and policymakers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Corn yield; Drainage discharge; DRAINMOD; Shallow drains; Time for drawdown; Water-table depth","Cost benefit analysis; Crops; Cultivation; Drainage; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Hydrology; Investments; Soils; Textures; Water levels; Corn yields; Discharge reductions; Drain depth; Drainage discharge; DRAINMOD; Shallow drain; Subsurface drainage design; Subsurface drainage system; Time for drawdown; Water table depths; Profitability; crop production; drainage; equation; hydrology; profitability; simulation; subsurface flow; United States; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The proposed framework addresses the gaps in policymaking, the role of all stakeholders, and uses historical data of crop production in different sectors of land in optimizing the profits that shall meet the defined constraints including national requirement, and export demand of different crops. There are many agro-economy-based countries where agriculture is the main contributor to their GDP, while there are others who always struggle to meet their national need while optimizing the agro-economy component of their earnings. Crops are not always produced with keeping the demand and production balance. Rather, the crops are mostly produced according to the farmer's ease and last year's prices for profit maximization leading to excessive production of one type of crop, lowering of profit margins, and shortage of some key crops for national need. This paper presents a decision aiding tool that can be used for farmer's awareness for crop production planning that meets the national and export needs while maximizing farmer's earnings. The model is tested on historical data of different segments of cultivated lands in Pakistan for validation, with the first experiment performed on single farmland with multi-fields while the second performed for multi-locations and multi-fields. The results are promising and provide estimates of net profit, expected production against the demand for each crop, and analysis that aids in crop planning, before and after the application of our model while meeting all necessary constraints. © 2013 IEEE.","Agriculture; Decision making; Decision support systems; Intelligent systems; Linear programming; Optimization; Planning; Prediction methods; Yield estimation","Cultivation; Decision making; Decision support systems; Intelligent systems; Linear programming; Planning; Production control; Profitability; Crop production; Decision support framework; Decisions makings; Historical data; Linear-programming; Multi-field; Optimisations; Prediction methods; Production Planning; Yield estimation; Crops",Article,Scopus

In this paper we used an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to assimilate coarse resolution satellite microwave sensor derived soil moisture estimates (SWI) for correcting errors in the water balance of the world food studies (WOFOST) crop model. Crop model simulations with the EnKF for winter wheat and grain maize were carried out for Spain, France, Italy and Germany for the period 1992-2000. The results were evaluated on the basis of regression with known crop yield statistics at national and regional level. Moreover, the EnKF filter innovations were analysed to see if any systematic trends could be found that could indicate deficiencies in the WOFOST water balance. Our results demonstrate that the assimilation of SWI has clearly improved the relationship with crop yield statistics for winter wheat for the majority of regions (66%) where a relationship could be established. For grain maize the improvement is less evident because improved relationships could only be found for 56% of the regions. We suspect that partial crop irrigation could explain the relatively poor results for grain maize, because irrigation is not included in the model. Analyses of the filter innovations revealed spatial and temporal patterns, while the distribution of normalised innovations is not Gaussian and has a non-zero mean indicating that the EnKF performs suboptimal. The non-zero mean is caused by differences in the mean value of the forecasted and observed soil moisture climatology, while the excessive spread in the distribution of normalised innovations indicates that the error covariances of forecasts and observations have been underestimated. These results clearly indicate that additional sources of error need to be included in the simulations and observations. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, due to irregular climatic events, ASA regions are affected commonly by frequent droughts that can impact food production. In addition, ASA regions in the Middle East and Africa are often characterised by political instability, which can increase population vulnerability to hunger and ill health. Remote sensing (RS) provides a platform to improve the spatial prediction of crop production and food availability, with the potential to positively impact populations. This paper, firstly, describes some of the important characteristics of agriculture in ASA regions that require monitoring to improve their management. Secondly, it demonstrates how freely available RS data can support decision-making through a cost-effective monitoring system that complements traditional approaches for collecting agricultural data. Thirdly, it illustrates the challenges of employing freely available RS data for mapping and monitoring crop area, crop status and forecasting crop yield in these regions. Finally, existing approaches used in these applications are evaluated, and the challenges associated with their use and possible future improvements are discussed. We demonstrate that agricultural activities can be monitored effectively and both crop area and crop yield can be predicted in advance using RS data. We also discuss the future challenges associated with maintaining food security in ASA regions and explore some recent advances in RS that can be used to monitor cropland and forecast crop production and yield. © 2021 by the authors.

Agroforestry systems such as alley cropping are gaining more and more attention as a practice to maintain and/or increase SOC in agroecosystems. The aim of this study was to add to the knowledge on SOC in alley cropping systems and to evaluate the contribution of introducing trees into agricultural landscapes by conducting a meta-analysis of the available data. The soil carbon (C) input will increase with time. Our findings suggest that a beneficial effect on SOC occurs after approximately a decade of alley cropping practice adoption. Furthermore, the effect of alley cropping is more beneficial in regions with lower initial SOC concentration compared to that in regions rich in SOC. Higher relative SOC is observed in the tropical region compared to that in the temperate climate zone. The establishment of alley cropping systems on agricultural land needs to consider several parameters such as alley width and tree species when designing such systems to achieve the highest possible tree and crop productivity while increasing SOC. © 2022 by the authors.

Thus, accurate and timely information on wheat production can help mitigate food price fluctuations. Within the existing operational regional and global scale agricultural monitoring systems that provide information on global crop yield and area forecasts, there are still fundamental gaps: #1. Lack of quantitative Earth Observation (EO) derived crop information, #2. Lack of global but detailed (national or subnational level) and timely crop production forecasts and #3. Lack of information on forecast uncertainties. In this study we present the Agriculture Remotely-sensed Yield Algorithm (ARYA) an EO-based method, advancing the state of EO-data application and usage (addressing gap #1) to forecast wheat yield. The algorithm is based on the evolution of the Difference Vegetation Index (DVI) using MODIS data at 1 km resolution and the Growing Degree Days (GDD) from reanalysis data. Additionally, we explore how Land Surface Temperature (LST) can be included into the model and whether this parameter adds any value to the model performance when combined with the optical information. ARYA is implemented at the national and subnational level to forecast winter wheat yield in the main wheat exporting countries of US, Russia, Ukraine, France, Germany, Australia and Argentina from 2001 to 2019 (covering over 70% of wheat exports globally) in a timely manner by providing daily forecasts (addressing gap #2). The results show that ARYA provides yield estimations with RMSE's within 0.3 ± 0.1 t/ha at national level and 0.6 ± 0,1 t/ha at subnational level after Day Of the Year (DOY) 140 (mid May) in the Northern Hemisphere and DOY 280 (beginning of October) in the Southern Hemisphere. This means that ARYA can provide crop yield estimates of wheat yield with 5–15% error at national and 7–20% error at subnational level starting from 2 to 2.5 months prior to harvest. © 2021 The Author(s)","Agriculture; DVI; LST; MODIS; Wheat; Yield forecast","algorithm; crop production; crop yield; export; food market; forecasting method; MODIS; remote sensing; wheat",Article,Scopus

Based on the assumption that environmental information would have close connections with Acer mono sap exudation to reinforce the competitive edge of production in forest products, the study analyzed correlations between Acer mono sap exudation and environmental information and predicted Acer mono exudation. A smart collection of electric devices would gather data about Acer mono sap exudation per hour on outdoor temperature, humidity, conductivity, and wind direction and velocity, and was installed in four areas in the Republic of Korea, including Sancheong, Gwangyang, Geoje, and Inje. Collected data were used to analyze correlations between environmental information and Acer mono sap exudation using four different algorithms, including linear regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and random forest, to predict Acer mono sap exudation. Remarkable outcomes were obtained across all the algorithms except for linear regression, demonstrating close connections between environmental information and Acer mono sap exudation.

This study aimed to estimate, forecast, and model the green and blue water footprints (WFg and WFb, respectively) of maize by using an artificial neural network (ANN). Three Egyptian Nile Delta governorates were selected as major maize-producing sites: Ad Daqahliyah, Al Gharbiyah, and Ash Sharqiyah. The monthly data of minimum temperature (Tmin), maximum temperature (Tmax), precipitation (P), solar radiation (SR), soil moisture (SM), wind speed (WS), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) data were obtained from open access data over the period from 2006 to 2016. The analyzed data were divided into two parts from 2006 to 2012 and from 2013 to 2016 for model training and testing, respectively. To predict WFb in the three governorates, the results show that the models with SR, humidity (H) and VPD; Tmean, crop coefficient (Kc), and H; and SM, WS, VPD, and Kc were the best ANNs with different hidden layers (5, 3), (2, 6) and (7, 3), respectively. Furthermore, the findings showed that the optimal ANN for forecasting WFg included Tmean, WS, and P; P, WS, VPD, and SR; WS, Tmax, and VPD with hidden neuron layers (7, 3), (7, 5) and (8, 5), respectively, for the three locations. The calculated WF values achieved a high statistical significant versus those simulated in the three sites with the lowest distributional variations, and the accuracy and coefficients of determination were close to 1. Moreover, for model testing, the findings indicated that the deviations between the actual and predicted WFs ranged from - 2.6 to 6.63 % and from - 2.4 to 3.16 % for the blue and green WFs, respectively. Thus, the developed models generated relatively better results and can help promote the decision-making process for both water managers and development planners. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","ANN models; Blue water footprint; Green water footprint; Hidden layers; Limited meteorological data","Agricultural robots; Crops; Forecasting; Governors; Meteorology; Neural networks; Soil moisture; Wind; Ann models; Blue water; Green water; Hidden layers; Meteorological data; Decision making; agricultural policy; artificial neural network; decision making; moisture content; relative humidity; soil moisture; soil temperature; solar radiation; vapor pressure; water footprint; water use efficiency; wind velocity; Daqahliya; Egypt; Gharbiya; Nile Delta; Sharqiya; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

One of the goals of the present work is to develop a baseline scenario relative to which the impacts of land use changes on hydrological and environmental processes can be evaluated. In addition, this study can help in quantifying the potential impacts of future projected changes in land use in order to mitigate the negative impacts of these changes, especially in regard to a shift toward urbanization and second-generation bioenergy crop production derived from lignocellulosic crops. The present study explores the relationship between land use changes and hydrologic indicators within the agricultural regions of Michigan and Wisconsin. Two sets of land use data, the circa 1800 county base and the 2001 National Land Cover Dataset, were used to set up the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. First, sensitivity analyses were performed based on both pre-settlement and current land use scenarios. Results showed that parameter sensitivity analysis may not always explain how the variation in model output can be attributed to different sources of variation in the model input. Therefore, effort should be made to determine the true importance of sensitive parameters by considering their placement in model algorithms. The model was then calibrated against measured daily streamflow data obtained from eight U.S. Geological Survey gauging stations. The impacts of land use changes were studied at three scales: subwatershed, watershed, and basin. At the subwatershed scale, most of the hydrologic behavior can be described by percent change in land cover. However, the trend was more apparent for land use conversion from mixed forest to urban and agriculture lands than for other land use conversions. At the watershed scale, significant differences were observed based on the long-term average hydrologic variables under the current and presettlement scenarios. In addition, an increase in evapotranspiration (up to 16.5%) and surface runoff (up to 93.9%) contribution to streamflow, a decrease in recharge to aquifers (up to -51.5%) and baseflow (up to -50.1%), and mixed impacts on water yield (-21.5% to 24.6%) were detected. However, at the basin scale, more than 70% of the study area experienced decreased lateral subsurface flow and recharge to aquifers, while 65% of the area experienced increased overland flow and minor changes in evapotranspiration and water yield. © 2012 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Great lakes region; Hydrologic variables; Land use change; SWAT","Baseflows; Basin scale; Bio-energy; Crop production; Data sets; Environmental process; Gauging stations; Great lakes; Hydrologic modeling; Hydrologic variables; Land cover; Land-use change; Land-use scenario; Lateral subsurface flow; Michigan; Mixed forests; Model algorithms; Model inputs; Model outputs; Overland flow; Parameter sensitivities; Potential impacts; Presettlement; Sensitive parameter; Soil and water assessment tool; Sources of variation; Study areas; Surface runoffs; SWAT; U.s. geological surveys; Water yield; Watershed scale; WISCONSIN; Aquifers; Biofuels; Cultivation; Evapotranspiration; Hydrogeology; Lakes; Landforms; Rain; Recharging (underground waters); Stream flow; Water supply; Watersheds; Land use; agricultural land; algorithm; baseflow; bioenergy; cellulose; crop production; data set; energy crop; evapotranspiration; hydrological modeling; land cover; land use change; lignin; overland flow; recharge; sensitivity analysis; streamflow; subsurface flow; urbanization; watershed; Great Lakes [North America]; Michigan; United States; Wisconsin",Article,Scopus

In recent years, geostatistical methods have proven valuable for estimating hydrological variables in ungauged catchments. However, four major problems restrict the development of geostatistical methods. We established a new information diffusion model based on genetic algorithm (GIDM) for spatial interpolating of runoff in the ungauged basins. Genetic algorithms (GA) are used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems. So, using GA, the parameter of optimal window width can be obtained. To test our new method, seven experiments for the annual runoff interpolation based on GIDM at 17 stations on the mainstream and tributaries of the Yellow River are carried out and compared with the inverse distance weighting (IDW) method, Cokriging (COK) method, and conventional IDMs using the same sparse observed data. The seven experiments all show that the GIDM method can solve four problems of the previous geostatistical methods to some extent and obtains best accuracy among four different models. The key problems of the PUB research are the lack of observation data and the difficulties in information extraction. So the GIDM is a new and useful tool to solve the Prediction in Ungauged Basins (PUB) problem and to improve the water management. Copyright © 2017 Mei Hong et al.",,,Article,Scopus

The aim of this study was to determine the variation of the productive potential of J. curcas in response to different soil and climatic conditions of the state of Veracruz. The model used to simulate the seed yield of J. curcas was the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The units of calculation were the Hydrologic Response Units (HRU); the weather was extracted from 95 weather stations; Crop physiological parameters were taken from the literature. The simulated seed yield of J. curcas ranged from 0.16 to 5.74 t ha-1 and was mapped by grouping in 5 intervals. Superficies was quantified for each interval and related to the current land use. There were Identified 872 thousand hectares with seed yield higher than 3.63 t ha-1 in grasslands.

A sensitivity analysis was conducted using an extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test, followed by an automatic calibration procedure to calibrate the curve number for moisture condition 2 (CN2), curve number index coefficient (CNIC), conservation practice factor (PEC), and peak runoff rate - rainfall energy adjustment factor (APM). The percent errors of mean (PE) were within 20%, with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (EF) and R 2 values all above 0.45 and 0.55 for both daily runoff and sediment yield for the three plots during the calibration period. For the validation period, the PE values were within 25%, and the EF and R 2 values ranged from 0.41 to 0.84 and from 0.55 to 0.85, respectively. Scenario analyses were conducted for a 24-year period for (1) fallow (baseline), (2) mixed wood-grass with horizontal terraces (scenario 1), and (3) woodland with horizontal-level ditches (scenario 2). The long-term benefits of scenario 1 over the baseline were quantified as minimum surface runoff and sediment yield reductions of 37 mm year-1 (35%) and 22 Mg ha-1 year-1 (84%), respectively. The benefits of scenario 2 over the baseline were reductions of 37% surface runoff and 89% sediment yield. The results suggest that APEX is a useful tool for evaluating soil and water loss for different management practices in the middle Huaihe River watershed, China, and that construction of horizontal-level ditches and horizontal terraces, and enhancing vegetation, are efficient strategies for controlling runoff and sediment in the region.

However, thorough evaluation of these models is needed to assess their predictive ability for this resource issue. The EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate) model version 3060 was evaluated using data collected from six cultivated small watersheds (4.0 to 8.4 ha) near Riesel, Texas. The study watersheds were fallow in 2001, cropped with corn (Zea mays L.) in 2002 and 2003, and planted to winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in 2004. A target poultry litter application rate from 0 to 13.4 Mg ha -1 was randomly assigned to each of the watersheds. Monthly data of runoff, sediment, and soluble P for 2001-2002 from one watershed (Y13) were used to calibrate the initial CN2, erosion control practice factor, RUSLE C factor coefficient, and phosphorus sorption ratio. The modeling efficiency (EF) for the calibrated period was 0.90 for runoff, 0.65 for sediment, and 0.94 for soluble P. EPIC was validated using the 2001-2004 measured data for the other five watersheds and the remaining data for Y13. It successfully predicted surface runoff on an annual, monthly, and daily basis for all watersheds, with EF values larger than 0.5 and R 2 larger than 0.7. The sediment, organic N and P, soluble P, and NO 3-N losses simulated by EPIC were satisfactory, with EF values ranging from 0.59 to 0.87 based on annual comparisons and larger than 0.4 (in 25 out of 30 tests) based on monthly comparisons. EF was 0.96 for crop yields. Paired t-tests based on monthly comparisons of runoff, sediment and nutrient losses, and annual crop yields indicated that the differences between predicted and observed values were not significantly different from zero at the significance level α = 0.05, except for soluble P losses for the control watershed. Both parametric and nonparametric statistical tests for EF values of monthly comparisons of runoff, sediment and nutrient losses, and percent errors of crop yields indicated that the reliability of the model was not significantly different among the poultry litter application watersheds and the control watershed, with the exception of soluble P losses for the control watershed. These statistical tests indicate that EPIC was able to replicate the runoff, water quality, and crop yield impacts of poultry litter application.","Animal manure; Crop yield; EPIC model; Nutrient loss; Runoff; Sediment loss; Water quality","Animal manure; EPIC model; Nutrient loss; Sediment loss; Environmental impact; Fertilizers; Runoff; Sediments; Watersheds; Crops; crop yield; environmental policy; leaching; manure; nutrient; runoff; sediment; water quality; Farm Crops; Fertilization; Runoff; Sediments; Water Sheds; Animalia; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

In Ethiopia, fertilizer application during the last four decades has led to significant yield gains, yet yield remains below its potential across much of the country. One of the main challenges responsible for low yield response to fertilizer application has been the use of 'blanket' recommendations, whereby no tailoring of fertilizer amount and frequency is done based on soil requirements. As a result, the amount of fertilizer applied ranges widely, and can be either sub- or supra-optimal. There is thus an increasing need for site-specific fertilizer recommendations which take into account site characteristics such as climate variables (temperature, rainfall, and solar radiation); soil factors (soil organic carbon, moisture, pH, texture, cation exchange capacity, and level of macro- and micronutrients); and topographic position indices. This article reports on a data-mining approach we developed on a large dataset of 6585 wheat (Triticum aestivum) field trials. The dataset includes detailed, site-specific biophysical variables to create nutrient response functions that can guide optimal site-specific fertilizer application. The approach used a machine-learning model (random forest) to capture the relationship between nutrients - nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K), and sulfur (S) - and wheat yield. The model explained about 83, 82, 47, and 69% of variances of yield for N, P, K, and S omission, respectively, with consistent performance across training and testing datasets. Expectedly, for N and P omission data, the most important explanatory variables are nutrient rate, followed by soil organic carbon and soil pH. For K and S, however, climatic variables played an important role alongside nutrient rates. The site-specific yield-fertilizer response curves derived from our model are highly variable from location to location, as they are affected by the climatic, soil, or topographic conditions of the site. Importantly, using principal component analysis, we showed that the shape of the fertilizer response curves is a result of the multiple environmental factors (including soil, topography, and climate) that are at play at a given site, rather than of a specific dominant one. The research output is expected to respond to the national policy demands for a sound method to identify the optimal fertilizer rate to increase economic returns of fertilizer investments and take fertilizer utilization research one step further. © The Author(s), 2022.

Such crop areas come from land cover maps or reported statistics, both of which can have errors and uncertainties. Sub-national or regional crop yield forecasting minimizes the propagation of these errors to some extent. In addition, regional forecasts provide added value and insights to stakeholders on regional differences within a country, which would otherwise compensate each other at national level. We propose a crop yield forecasting approach for multiple spatial levels based on regional crop yield forecasts from machine learning. Machine learning, with its data-driven approach, can leverage larger data sizes and capture nonlinear relationships between predictors and yield at regional level. We designed a generic machine learning workflow to demonstrate the benefits of regional crop yield forecasting in Europe. To evaluate the quality and usefulness of regional forecasts, we predicted crop yields for 35 case studies, including nine countries that are major producers of six crops (soft wheat, spring barley, sunflower, grain maize, sugar beets and potatoes). Machine learning models at regional level had lower normalized root mean squared errors (NRMSE) and uncertainty than a linear trend model, with Wilcoxon p-values of 3e-7 and 2e-7 for 60 days before harvest and end of season respectively. Similarly, regional machine learning forecasts aggregated to national level had lower NRMSEs than forecasts from an operational system in 18 out of 35 cases 60 days before harvest, with a Wilcoxon p-value of 0.95 indicating similar performance. Our models have room for improvement, especially during extreme years. Nevertheless, regional crop yield forecasts from machine learning and aggregated national forecasts provide a consistent forecasting method across spatial levels and insights from regional differences to support important policy decisions. © 2021 The Authors","Crop yield; Large-scale crop yield forecasting; Machine learning; Regional differences; Scalability","agricultural policy; crop production; crop yield; forecasting method; harvesting; land cover; machine learning; stakeholder; Europe; Helianthus; Hordeum; Solanum tuberosum",Article,Scopus

Current approaches based on crop cutting experiments are expensive and usually too late for timely income stabilization measures like crop insurances. We, therefore, utilized a Gradient Boosted Regression (GBR), a machine learning technique, to estimate rice yields at ~500 m spatial resolution for rice-producing areas in India with potential application for near real-time estimates. We used resampled intermediate resolution (~5 km) images of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Leaf Area Index (LAI) and observed yields at the district level in India for calibrating GBR models. These GBRs were then used to downscale district yields to 500 m resolution. Downscaled yields were re-aggregated for validation against out-of-sample district yields not used for model training and an additional independent data set of block-level (below district-level) yields. Our downscaled and re-aggregated yields agree well with reported district-level observations from 2003 to 2015 (r = 0.85 & MAE = 0.15 t/ha). The model performance improved further when estimating separate models for different rice cropping densities (up to r = 0.93). An additional out-of-sample validation for the years 2016 and 2017, proved successful with r = 0.84 and r = 0.77, respectively. Simulated yield accuracy was higher in water-limited, rainfed agricultural systems. We conclude that this downscaling approach of rice yield estimation using GBR is feasible across India and may complement current approaches for timely rice yield estimation required by insurance companies and government agencies. © 2021 by the authors.

Due to the importance of wheat production scale, it is advisable to predict its yield before harvesting. However, the current models are built solely on the basis of quantitative data. Therefore, the aim of the work was to create three multicriteria models for the prediction and simulation of winter wheat yield, which were made on the basis of extended quantitative and qualitative variables from field research in the year period 2008-2015. Neural networks with MLP (multi-layer perceptron) topology were used to build the following models, which can predict and simulate the yield on three dates: 15 April, 31 May, and 30 June. For this reason, they were designated as follows: QQWW15_4, QQWW31_5, and QQWW30_6. Each model is based on a different number of independent features, which ranges from 19 to 25. As a result of the conducted analyses, a MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) forecast error from 6.63% to 6.92% was achieved. This is equivalent of an error ranging from 0.521 to 0.547 t·ha-1, with an average yield of 6.57 ton per hectare of cultivated area. In addition, the most important quantitative and qualitative factors influencing the yield were also indicated. In the first predictive range (15 April), it is the average air temperature from 1 September to 31 December of the previous year (T9-12_PY). In the second predictive range (31 May) it is the sum of precipitation from 1 May to 31 May, and in the third (30 June) is the average air temperature from 1 January to 15 April of the year (T1-4_CY). In addition, one of the qualitative factors had a significant impact on the yield in the first phase-the type of forecrop in the previous year (TF_PY). The presented neural modeling method is a specific extension of the previously used predicting methods. An element of innovation of the presented concept of yield modeling is the possibility of performing a simulation before harvest, in the current agrotechnical season. The presented models can be used in large-area agriculture, especially in precision agriculture as an important element of decision-making support systems. © 2019 by the authors.","Artificial neural networks; Machine learning; MLP network; Precision agriculture; Sensitivity analysis; Winter wheat yield; Yield prediction; Yield simulation",,Article,Scopus

First, the growing neural gas (GNG) method is utilized to cluster the TWSA data to find similar patterns. The Silhouette Chou Davies (SCD) validity measure, a combination of three robust cluster validity measures, is used to evaluate the performance of the GNG method. Then, the feasibility of deep learning Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), shallow learning Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN), and Random Forest (RF) are examined in downscaling GRACE-derived TWSA using only remote sensing images. The results indicate that the deep learning method outperforms the RF and FFNN models by 7 % and 18 %, respectively. Then, the Ground Water Storage (GWS) data are isolated from TWSA, showing an agreement between the GRACE-derived GWS and ground-based measurements with R2 = 0.76. Additionally, the downscaled TWSA is used to generate annual drought frequency and change detection maps for the GWS from 2002 to 2016. Annual standardized precipitation index (SPI) drought frequency maps are also produced to gain deeper insight into the water resource scarcity of Iran. The results indicate that Iran has experienced water resource overexploitation since 2011 for agricultural activities, while meteorological drought is a trigger and intensifier for the water crisis in Iran. According to the results, Iran experienced exceptional drought in some regions, and the GWS has decreased all over the country. In addition, further analysis of Iran's water resources is provided until 2022.

Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, we recently developed a Scalable satellite-based Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM) that integrates crop simulations with satellite imagery and gridded weather data to generate 30 m resolution yield estimates for multiple crops in different regions. Existing versions of SCYM typically capture one-third to half of the variation in reported county-scale yields. Using rainfed maize in the US Midwest as an example, this study tested multiple approaches for improving SCYM's accuracy, including (i) calibrating the phenology parameters of the crop model (APSIM) used to generate training samples for SCYM; (ii) using an ensemble of three crop models (APSIM-Maize, CERES-Maize, and Hybrid-Maize) instead of a single model; (iii) using simulated biomass from the crop models instead of simulated yields to train SCYM, with the former assuming a constant harvest index (HI). Results show substantial improvement in performance, as assessed using reported county yields by USDA-NASS, both from calibrating APSIM phenology parameters and from training SCYM on simulated biomass rather than yields. Using a multi-model ensemble further improves SCYM, although the benefit is limited. The proposed preferred version of SCYM on average captures 75% of the yield variation for 2001–2015 in the 3I states (i.e. Illinois, Indiana and Iowa) where SCYM is trained, with RMSE typically less than 1 t/ha, and explains 41% to 83% of multi-year yield variations when tested across nine Midwestern US states for 2008–2015. This level of accuracy is particularly notable given that only data from 2014 were used to calibrate phenology parameters. The yield estimates for multiple years in multiple states utilized 1184 Landsat tiles, but could be completed in about 2 h per year by using the GEE platform. All approaches tested in this study do not require any site-specific measurements, and thus can be readily extended to other regions and crops. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Google earth engine; Landsat; Maize; Yield estimation","accuracy assessment; agricultural modeling; calibration; computer simulation; crop yield; data processing; data set; information technology; Landsat; maize; phenology; phytomass; rainfed agriculture; resolution; satellite data; satellite imagery; weather; Illinois; Indiana; Iowa; Midwest; United States; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Five erosion and SSL algorithms were applied within a common LSM framework to quantify uncertainties and evaluate predictability in two steep, forested catchments (&gt;1,000 km2). The algorithms were chosen from among widely used sediment models, including empirically based: monovariate rating curve (MRC) and the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE); stochastically based: the Load Estimator (LOADEST); conceptually based: the Hydrologic Simulation Program—Fortran (HSPF); and physically based: the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM). The algorithms were driven by the hydrologic fluxes and meteorological inputs generated from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) LSM. A multiobjective calibration was applied to each algorithm and optimized parameter sets were validated over an excluded period, as well as in a transfer experiment to a nearby catchment to explore parameter robustness. Algorithm performance showed consistent decreases when parameter sets were applied to periods with greatly differing SSL variability relative to the calibration period. Of interest was a joint calibration of all sediment algorithm and streamflow parameters simultaneously, from which trade-offs between streamflow performance and partitioning of runoff and base flow to optimize SSL timing were noted, decreasing the flexibility and robustness of the streamflow to adapt to different time periods.

However, the existing models usually focus on the cycles of one or more elements (e.g., water, carbon, or nitrogen). For example, hydrological models such as Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) focus on the water cycle and nutrient loadings at watershed scale, whereas biogeochemical models such as DayCent (i.e., daily CENTURY) emphasize carbon/nitrogen storage and fluxes of ecosystems at landscape scale. Therefore, using either one of the two categories of models is not enough for understanding/solving the current complex environmental issues that involve multiple aspects. Although use of both models (SWAT and DayCent) could be an expedient way toward treating the problem, creating separate model projects for a single area could be challenging and time consuming, and integration/analyses of model results have some limitations due to the non-uniformity of input spatial data between models. To overcome this issue, we developed an integrated model implementation coupler that aims to drive SWAT and DayCent—the two representative models in hydrology and biogeochemistry, respectively—just using a user's SWAT project without the need of any extra efforts such as developing a framework or preparing input data for DayCent modeling. This software is easy to use and would be promising for conducting comprehensive environmental impact assessment involving hydrological and biogeochemical cycles at watershed scale. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon cycle; DayCent; Model integration; SWAT; Water cycle","Biogeochemistry; Digital storage; Ecology; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Hydrology; Watersheds; Carbon cycles; DAYCENT; Model integration; SWAT; Water cycle; Integration; biogeochemical cycle; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; environmental impact assessment; hydrological modeling; nitrogen cycle; numerical model; software; soil and water assessment tool; watershed",Article,Scopus

The UMRB is an important ecosystem located in the north central U.S. that is experiencing a range of ecological stresses. Specifically, testing of SWAT was performed for: (1) Hargreaves (HG) and Penman-Monteith (PM) PET methods, and (2) Livneh, National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) and Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) climate datasets. The Livneh-PM combination resulted in the highest average annual water yield of 380.6 mm versus the lowest estimated water yield of 193.9 mm for the Livneh-HG combination, in response to 23-year uncalibrated simulations. Higher annual ET and PET values were predicted with HG method versus the PM method for all three weather datasets in response to the uncalibrated simulations, due primarily to higher HG-based estimates during the growing season. Based on these results, it was found that the HG method is the preferred PET option for the UMRB. Initial calibration of SWAT was performed using the Livneh data and HG method for three Mississippi River main stem gauge sites, which was followed by spatial validation at 10 other gauge sites located within the UMRB stream network. Overall satisfactory results were found for the calibration and validation gauge sites, with the majority of R2 values ranging between 0.61 and 0.82, Nash-Sutcliffe modeling efficiency (NSE) values ranging between 0.50 and 0.79, and Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) values ranging between 0.61 and 0.84. The results of an additional experimental suite of six scenarios, which represented different combinations of climate data sets and calibrated parameters, revealed that suggested statistical criteria were again satisfied by the different scenario combinations.

They consider spatial and temporal variability in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum to modulate N applications to the actual crop nutrient status and requirements. However, deriving fertilizer N recommendations exclusively from remote proximal and remote sensing data can lead to substantial inaccuracies and new, more complex approaches are needed. Therefore, this study presents an improved approach that integrates crop modelling, proximal sensing and forecasts weather data to manage site-specific N fertilization in winter wheat. This improved approach is based on four successive steps: (1) optimal N supply is estimated through the DSSAT crop model informed with a combination of observed and forecast weather data; (2) actual crop N uptake is estimated using proximal sensing; (3) N prescription maps are created merging crop model and proximal sensing information, considering also the contribution of the soil N mineralisation; (4) N-Variable Rate Application (N-VRA) is implemented in the field. A VRA method based on DSSAT fed with historical weather data and a business-as- usual uniform fertilization were also compared. The methods were implemented in a 23.4 ha field in Northern Italy, cropped to wheat and characterized by large soil variability in texture and organic matter content. Results indicated that the model-based approaches consistently led to higher yields, agronomic efficiencies and gross margins than the uniform N application rate. Furthermore, the proximal sensing-based approach allowed capturing of the spatial variability in crop N uptake and led to a substantial reduction of the spatial variability in yield and protein content. This study grounds the development of web-based software as a friendly tool to optimize the N variable rate application in winter cereals. © 2022, The Author(s).","DSSAT; Nitrogen Fertilization; Proximal sensing; Variable rate; Winter wheat","crop yield; fertilizer; nitrogen; numerical model; remote sensing; wheat; winter",Article,Scopus

Up to now, this technology has been limited to the control of weeds and pests, whereas the second generation of GM crops is expected to assist farmers in abiotic stress tolerance or improved nutritional features. Aiming to analyze this subject holistically, in this presentation we address an advanced technology for drought-tolerant GM crops, upscaling from molecular details obtained in the laboratory to an extensive network of field trials as well as the impact of the introduction of this innovation into the market. Sunflower has divergent transcription factors, which could be key actors in the drought response orchestrating several signal transduction pathways, generating an improved performance to deal with water deficit. One of such factors, HaHB4, belongs to the homeodomain-leucine zipper family and was first introduced in Arabidopsis. Transformed plants had improved tolerance to water deficits, through the inhibition of ethylene sensitivity and not by stomata closure. Wheat and soybean plants expressing the HaHB4 gene were obtained and cropped across a wide range of growing conditions exhibiting enhanced adaptation to drought-prone environments, the most important constraint affecting crop yield worldwide. The performance of wheat and soybean, however, differed slightly across mentioned environments; whereas the improved behavior of GM wheat respect to controls was less dependent on the temperature regime (cool or warm), differences between GM and wild-type soybeans were remarkably larger in warmer compared to cooler conditions. In both species, these GM crops are good candidates to become market products in the near future. In anticipation of consumers’ and other stakeholders’ interest, spectral analyses of field crops have been conducted to differentiate these GM crops from wild type and commercial cultivars. In this paper, the potential impact of the release of such market products is discussed, considering the perspectives of different stakeholders. © Copyright © 2020 González, Rigalli, Miranda, Romagnoli, Ribichich, Trucco, Portapila, Otegui and Chan.","drought tolerance; grain yield determination; HaHB4; sunflower transcription factor; transgenic soybean; transgenic wheat",,Article,Scopus

It has been a great challenge to non-destructively estimate plant N status across different agro-ecological zones (AZs). The objective of this study was to use random forest regression (RFR) models together with multi-source data to improve the estimation of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) N status across two AZs. Fifteen site-year plot and farmers' field experiments involving different N rates and 19 cultivars were conducted in two AZs from 2015 to 2020. The results indicated that RFR models integrating climatic and management factors with vegetation index (R2 = 0.72–0.86) outperformed the models by only using the vegetation index (R2 = 0.36–0.68) and performed well across AZs. The Pearson correlation coefficient-based variables selection strategy worked well to select 6–7 key variables for developing RFR models that could achieve similar performance as models using full variables. The contributions of climatic and management factors to N status estimation varied with AZs and N status indicators. In higher-latitude areas, climatic factors were more important to N status estimation, especially water-related factors. The addition of climatic factors significantly improved the performance of the RFR models for N nutrition index estimation. Climatic factors were important for the estimation of the aboveground biomass, while management variables were more important to N status estimation in lower-latitude areas. It is concluded that integrating multi-source data using RFR models can significantly improve the estimation of winter wheat N status indicators across AZs compared to models only using one vegetation index. However, more studies are needed to develop unmanned aerial vehicles and satellite remote sensing-based machine learning models incorporating multi-source data for more efficient monitoring of crop N status under more diverse soil, climatic, and management conditions across large regions.

Today, New Zealand and other nations need integrated modelling tools at the national scale to help industries and stakeholders plan for future disruptive changes. In this paper, following a scoping review process, we analyse modelling approaches and available agricultural systems’ model examples per thematic applications at the regional to national scale to define the best options for the national policy development. Each modelling approach has specificities, such as stakeholder engagement capacity, complex systems reproduction, predictive or prospective scenario testing, and users should consider coupling approaches for greater added value. The efficiency of spatial decision support tools working with a system dynamics approach can help holistically in stakeholders’ participation and understanding, and for improving land planning and policy.

Timely and accurate estimation of cotton yield in Xinjiang is important for sustainable agricultural development and food security. However, most current studies have been devoted to the linkage of crop yield with remotely sensed reflectance and climate parameters. This has caused numerous uncertainties due to that these explanatory variables are unable to quickly reflect the actual photosynthetic dynamics of crops. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), as a direct proxy of plant photosynthesis (gross primary productivity, GPP), has recently been suggested to be a promising method for crop yield estimation, but the spatial resolution of current SIF products derived from satellites is usually very low (such as Global OCO-2 SIF (GOSIF): 0.05°). This greatly limited the ability of SIF to accurately estimate field-scale cotton yield in Xinjiang. Here, we first proposed a two-step convolutional neural network (CNN) strategy to downscale the monthly GOSIF products sequentially from 0.05°, 0.005° to 0.0005° to match the size of cotton field parcels, and then linear regression and random forest (RF) regression were respectively conducted using the monthly downscaled SIF product (CNN-SIF) to assess its feasibility to estimate field-scale yield. Results showed that the proposed stepwise approach for downscaling GOSIF worked well, indicating a high goodness of fit (R2 &gt; 0.85) with the referenced SIF as well as strong correlations to both GPP products and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) (the median r &gt; 0.90). On this basis, preferable accuracies (the optimal R2 = 0.62 and the ratio of prediction to deviation = 1.64) were also achieved for our proposed cotton yield estimation models in the Mosuowan region, Xinjiang only by the 0.0005° SIF products. With the assistance of NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), the higher performance was given (R2 = 0.67 and RPD = 1.72). This study reveals the importance of finer-resolution SIF products for accurate crop yield estimation and offers a promising and practical approach for estimating agricultural yield, especially for fragmented farmlands. © 2022 The Authors","Convolutional Neural Network; Cotton yield estimation; Downscaling; Field scale; Sentinel-2; Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence","Chlorophyll; Convolutional neural networks; Cotton; Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Fluorescence; Food supply; Photosynthesis; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Convolutional neural network; Cotton yield; Cotton yield estimation; Down-scaling; Field scale; Sentinel-2; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Xinjiang; Yield estimation; Convolution; agricultural development; artificial neural network; chlorophyll; cotton; crop yield; downscaling; estimation method; fluorescence; solar radiation; China",Article,Scopus

Elucidating the responses of crop productivity to drought is essential for informing agricultural management and ensuring food security. Here we used satellite-derived solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data and vegetation indices to evaluate the impacts of the 2012 drought on crop productivity in the U.S. Midwest. We used SIF from the global, OCO-2 based SIF product (GOSIF; 0.05°, 8-day), GOME-2 SIF product (0.5°, monthly), and three MODIS-derived vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, and NIRv). We compared the seasonal cycles and anomalies of SIF and VIs from 2008 to 2018. We also examined to what extent these proxies could capture the variations of gross primary production (GPP) for eddy covariance flux sites. SIF and VIs were able to capture the seasonal cycle in drought and normal years. SIF better captured the photosynthesis changes due to water and heat stresses than vegetation indices. In particular, GOSIF data with the finer spatio-temporal resolution was a good monitor of crop response to drought. Crop yield decreased by 25% in the 2012 drought relative to the multi-year mean, while GOSIF, NDVI, EVI, and NIRv reduced by 22%, 4%, 10%, and 8%, respectively. GOSIF had the strongest relationship with crop yield (R2 = 0.91), followed by NIRv (R2 = 0.89), EVI (R2 = 0.68) and NDVI (R2 = 0.48). Compared to the crop yield data, the mean difference of the yield estimates based on GOSIF, EVI, and NIRv were 379.32, 328.43, and 503.67 kg/ha, respectively. For both corn and soybeans, yield anomalies were better correlated with GOSIF anomalies than with NIRv and EVI anomalies. Our study demonstrated that SIF with finer spatio-temporal resolution has great potential for monitoring the responses of crop productivity to drought. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Crop yield; Drought; GOSIF; Gross primary production; Near-infrared reflectance of vegetation; OCO-2; Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence","crop production; drought; fluorescence; monitoring; Midwest; United States",Article,Scopus

However, traditional hydrologic flood routing techniques cannot effectively address the huge uncertainties caused by the many factors that lead to ice-jam flooding. In this paper, a hazard assessment system for regulating flood discharge schemes is developed; it is composed of a machine learning (ML) model, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a river-ice dynamic model (RIVICE) within a probabilistic method. The modelling system is to aid in the challenge of predicting ice-jam flooding downstream of reservoirs. The LSTM model forecasts the downstream flow under the operational discharge scheme and, combined with the RIVICE model, the backwater level profile of ice jams can be forecasted. Furthermore, a set of backwater level profiles can be provided by probabilistic modelling, and the probability of ice-jam flood inundation can be calculated by comparing backwater levels with the elevation of the river bank; this information can be used to warn of the hazard induced by operational discharges to better aid in the preparedness and mitigation of ice-jam floods.

Soil water storage (SWS) at a depth of 0-3.8 m showed positive (R+) or negative (R–) responses to precipitation. The mean SWS in different soil layers followed an order of R+ &gt; Rc &gt; R–. During the experiment, the 0-3.8 m SWS decreased by 34.5 mm (R+), 183.8 mm (Rc), and 218.9 mm (R–). The shoot biomass and grain yield varied little among three precipitation levels in 2014-2015, but was reduced by 50% in R- compared with Rc in 2015-2016. The R– and Rc treatments had higher water use efficiency (WUE) than R+ in 2014-2015, and Rc was the highest in 2015-2016. The proportions of soil water to water consumption in R+ and Rc increased from 22.5% in 2014-2015 to 42.5% in 2015-2016 on average, and for R– was stable over 2-yr (average 44.5%). Soil water plays a critical role in winter wheat performance under changes in precipitation, which should guide winter wheat production and soil water management in the future. © 2019 The author(s).",,,Article,Scopus

Since predictive accuracy depends partly on which indicators are used to identify food insecure households, it is important to assess the performance of indicators that are relatively easy and inexpensive to collect yet can proxy for the “gold standard” food security indicator, calorie intake. We study the effectiveness of different variable combinations and methods in predicting calorie-based food security among poor households and communities in rural Bangladesh. We use basic household information as a benchmark set for predicting calorie-based food security. We then assess the gain in predictive power obtained by adding subjective food security indicators (e.g., self-reported days without sufficient food), the dietary diversity score (DDS), and the combination of both sets to our model of calorie-based food security. We apply machine learning as well as traditional econometric methods in estimation. We find that the overall predictive accuracy rises from 63% to 69% when we add the subjective and DDS sets to the benchmark set. Our study demonstrates that while alternative indicators and methods are not always accurate in predicting calorie intake, DDS related indicators do improve accuracy compared to a simple benchmark set. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Dietary diversity; Food security; Machine learning; Poverty; Program targeting","econometrics; food policy; food security; machine learning; poverty; rural area; Bangladesh",Article,Scopus

To understand the implications of such increased production on water resources and stream quality at regional and local scales, we have applied a watershed model for the Upper Mississippi River Basin, where most of the current and future crop/residue-based biofuel production is expected. The model simulates changes in water quality (soil erosion, nitrogen and phosphorus loadings in streams) and resources (soil-water content, evapotranspiration, and runoff) under projected biofuel production versus the 2006 baseline year and a business-as-usual scenario. The basin average results suggest that the projected feedstock production could change the rate of evapotranspiration in the UMRB by approximately +2%, soil-water content by about -2%, and discharge to streams by -5% from the baseline scenario. However, unlike the impacts on regional water availability, the projected feedstock production has a mixed effect on water quality, resulting in 12% and 45% increases in annual suspended sediment and total phosphorus loadings, respectively, but a 3% decrease in total nitrogen loading. These differences in water quantity and quality are statistically significant (p < 0.05).

We implemented a remote sensing and evapotranspiration-based light use efficiency model globally and integrated abiotic environmental stressors (temperature, soil moisture, and vapor deficit stressors). The operational model (Global Yield Mapper in Earth Engine (GYMEE)) was validated against actual yield data for three agricultural schemes with different climatic, soil, and management conditions located in Lebanon, Brazil, and Spain. Field-level crop yield data on wheat, potato, and corn for 2015–2020 were used for assessment. The performance of GYMEE was statistically evaluated through root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean bias error (MBE), relative error (RE), and index of agreement (d). The results showed that the absolute difference between the modeled and predicted field-level yield was within ±16% for the analyzed crops in both Brazil and Lebanon study sites and within ±15% in the Spain site (except for two fields). GYMEE performed best for wheat crop in Lebanon with a low RMSE (0.6 t/ha), MAE (0.5 t/ha), MBE (−0.06 t/ha), and RE (0.83%). A very good agreement was observed for all analyzed crop yields, with an index of agreement (d) averaging at 0.8 in all studied sites. GYMEE shows potential in providing yield estimates for potato, wheat, and corn yields at a relative error of ±6%. We also quantified and spatialized the soil moisture stress constraint and its impact on reducing biomass production. A showcasing of moisture stress impact on two emphasized fields from the Lebanon site revealed that a 12% difference in soil moisture stress can decrease yield by 17%. A comparison between the 2017 and 2018 seasons for the potato culture of Lebanon showed that the 2017 season with lower abiotic stresses had higher light use efficiency, above-ground biomass, and yield by 5%, 10%, and 9%, respectively.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency and applicability of crop pattern prediction for the year 2050 with the CLUE-S model in an agricultural plain. The model was calibrated and validated based on the LULC changes to model future changes of the crop pattern by 2050. Twelve driving factors were utilised to quantify the relationship of LULC classes. The statistical relationship among the factors was examined with a Binomial Logistic Regression approach. Additionally, the magnitude of change in agricultural crop patterns between 2015 and 2050 was calculated according to local/regional policies and incorporated to the model as scenario layer. Future model results indicated that the cotton would increase by % 45 whereas maize would decrease by % 10 compared to 2015. The model performance was evaluated using the ground truth from the field observations considering the agricultural policies through the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) indicators. The mean ROC value for the agricultural crop patterns was calculated as 0.71, while ROC values for other LULC classes were over 0.90.

The new model has a similar model structure to the existing probability distributed rainfall runoff models (PDM), such as HyMOD. However, the model utilizes a new distribution function for soil water storage capacity, which leads to the SCS (Soil Conservation Service) curve number (CN) method when the initial soil water storage is set to zero. Therefore, the developed model is a unification of the PDM and CN methods and is called the PDM–CN model in this paper. Besides runoff modeling, the calculation of daily evaporation in the model is also dependent on the distribution function, since the spatial variability of soil water storage affects the catchment-scale evaporation. The generated runoff is partitioned into direct runoff and groundwater recharge, which are then routed through quick and slow storage tanks, respectively. Total discharge is the summation of quick flow from the quick storage tank and base flow from the slow storage tank. The new model with 5 parameters is applied to 92 catchments for simulating daily streamflow and evaporation and compared with AWMB, SACRAMENTO, and SIMHYD models. The performance of the model is slightly better than HyMOD but is not better compared with the 14-parameter model (SACRAMENTO) in the calibration, and does not perform as well in the validation period as the 7-parameter model (SIMHYD) in some areas, based on the NSE values. The linkage between the PDM–CN model and long-term water balance model is also presented, and a two-parameter mean annual water balance equation is derived from the proposed PDM–CN model. © 2022 by the authors.

However, other similar agroecosystems with extensive data resources can be of use. We propose a new predictive modeling approach based upon the concept of transfer learning to solve the problem of data deficiency in predicting productivity of agroecosystems, where productivity is a nonlinear function of various interacting biotic and abiotic factors. We describe the process of building metamodels (machine learning models built and trained on simulation data) from simulations built for one agroecosystem (US wild blueberry) as the source domain, where the data resource is abundant. Metamodels are evaluated and the best metamodel representing the system dynamics is selected. The best metamodel is re-parameterized and calibrated to another agroecosystem (Northeast China bog blueberry) as the target domain where field collected data are lacking. Experimental results showed that our metamodel developed for wild blueberry achieved 78% accuracy in fruit-set prediction for bog blueberry. To demonstrate its usefulness, we applied this calibrated metamodel to investigate the response of bog blueberry to various weather conditions. We found that an 8% reduction in fruit-set of bog blueberry is likely to happen if weather becomes warmer and wetter as predicted by climate models. In addition, southern and eastern production regions will suffer more severe fruit-set decline than the other growing regions. Predictions also suggest that increasing commercially available honeybee densities to 18 bees/m2 /min, or bumble bee densities to 0.6 bees/m2 /min, is a viable way to compensate for the predicted 8% climate induced fruit-set decline in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

Both environmental (climatic and edaphic) conditions and management factors affect the variabilities of crop yield. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive data-driven analysis in the U.S. Corn Belt to understand and model how rainfed corn yield is affected by climate variability and extremes, soil properties (soil available water capacity, soil organic matter), and management practices (planting date and fertilizer applications). Exploratory data analyses revealed that corn yield responds non-linearly to temperature, while the negative vapor pressure deficit (VPD) effect on corn yield is monotonic and more prominent. Higher mean yield and inter-annual yield variability are found associated with high soil available water capacity, while lower inter-annual yield variability is associated with high soil organic matter (SOM). We also identified region-dependent relationships between planting date and yield and a strong correlation between planting date and the April weather condition (temperature and rainfall). Next, we built machine learning models using the random forest and LASSO algorithms, respectively, to predict corn yield with all climatic, soil properties, and management factors. The random forest model achieved a high prediction accuracy for annual yield at county level as early as in July (R2 = 0.781) and outperformed LASSO.

However, two open and interesting issues remain unknown: 1) whether hydrometeorological situations under droughts can be reproduced directly utilizing variability of atmospheric dynamics and 2) what specific roles atmospheric dynamics play in drought reconstruction. To explore these questions, this study employs three kinds of dynamic features (i.e., vertical velocity, relative vorticity, and horizontal divergence) for hydrometeorological reconstruction (e.g., precipitation and near-surface air temperature) under drought situations through a so-called XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) ensemble learning method. The study adopts two different reconstruction schemes (i.e., statistically preexisting dynamic–hydrometeorological relationships and interannual variability) and finds dynamically based reconstruction feasible. The three main achievements are as follows. 1) Regarding different hydrometeorological situations reconstructed with preexisting dynamic–hydrometeorological relationships, good reconstruction performance can be captured with the same or different lead times, depending on whether the evolution of dynamic anomalies (e.g., vertical motion and relative vorticity) is temporally asynchronous. 2) Reconstruction on the interannual scale performs relatively well, seemingly regardless of seasonality and drought-inducing mechanisms. 3) More importantly, from interpretable perspectives, global-scale analysis of dynamic contributions helps discover unexpected dynamic drought-inducing roles and associated latitudinal modulation. That is, low-level cyclonic/anticyclonic anomalies contribute to drought development in the northern middle and high latitudes, while upper-level vertical subsidence contributes significantly to tropical near-surface temperature anomalies concurrent with droughts. These achievements could provide guidance for dynamically based drought monitoring and prediction in different geographic regions. © 2022 American Meteorological Society.","Atmospheric circulation; Drought; Hydrologic cycle; Machine learning","air temperature; annual variation; anticyclone; atmospheric circulation; atmospheric dynamics; cyclone; drought; hydrological cycle; hydrometeorology; machine learning; precipitation (chemistry); subsidence; surface temperature; temperature anomaly; vorticity",Article,Scopus

The main objective of this research is to develop an operational methodology for predicting rice yield that is utilized to assess the impacts of drought and flood disasters on agricultural productivity taking Jiangxi, China as an example. For this purpose, we first calculated the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) using monthly rainfall data of 83 stations from 1960 to 2020 to identify the disastrous years and their spatial extent of impact. Then, time-series MODIS data from 2000 to 2020, Landsat images, digital elevation model (DEM) were obtained and utilized for rice plantation mapping using decision-tree algorithm and yield estimation. The identified 3-cropping rice plantations were converted into rice masks for calculating the county-level cumulative NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) to match the reported county-level annual rice yield for building remote sensing-based rice yield models taking the averages of 2016–2019 as test. By comparing the determination coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and prediction accuracy of the models, we found that the best model for rice yield estimation is Y D = 4.899 × 10−6×NDVI 2 + 2.891 × NDVI + 98511.218 (R2 = 0.898). This model was applied to estimate the county-level annual rice production of 2014 and 2015, and provincial annual rice production of 2010–2019 for validation and prediction. The agreement with the government-reported yield reaches 97–98% at provincial level and the models were hence considered reliable. After verification, the models were applied to other remained years after 2010 for estimating the provincial annual rice production. Then, a new disaster indicator, that is, the disaster composite index (DCI) was developed for assessing the disaster impact on annual rice production in a pilot area around Nanchang City. Results show that developed models are capable of achieving rice yield estimation using both MODIS data for regional and Landsat data for local scale. In comparison with the normal or least affected year, impacts of drought and flood were successfully evaluated using DCI for pilot area and their relationship was created.

Moreover, cotton and soybean are cultivated together in some areas, further increasing the difficulty of cotton extraction. In this paper, an innovative method for cotton area estimation using Sentinel-2 images, land use status data (LUSD), and field survey data is proposed. Three areas in Hubei province (i.e., Jingzhou, Xiaogan, and Huanggang) were used as research sites to test the performance of the proposed extraction method. First, the Sentinel-2 images were spatially constrained using LUSD categories of irrigated land and dry land. Seven classification schemes were created based on spectral features, vegetation index (VI) features, and texture features, which were then used to generate the SVM classifier. To minimize misclassification between cotton and soybean fields, the cotton and soybean separation index (CSSDI) was introduced based on the red band and red-edge band of Sentinel-2. The configuration combining VI and spectral features yielded the best cotton extraction results, with F1 scores of 86.93%, 80.11%, and 71.58% for Jingzhou, Xiaogan, and Huanggang. When CSSDI was incorporated, the F1 score for Huanggang increased to 79.33%. An alternative approach using LUSD for non-target sample augmentation was also introduced. The method was used for Huangmei county, resulting in an F1 score of 78.69% and an area error of 7.01%.

Cultivar differences can significantly influence potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tuber yield prediction using remote sensing technologies. The objective of this study was to improve potato yield prediction using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing by incorporating cultivar information with machine learning methods. Small plot experiments involving different cultivars and nitrogen (N) rates were conducted in 2018 and 2019. UAV-based multi-spectral images were collected throughout the growing season. Machine learning models, i.e., random forest regression (RFR) and support vector regression (SVR), were used to combine different vegetation indices with cultivar information. It was found that UAV-based spectral data from the early growing season at the tuber initiation stage (late June) were more correlated with potato marketable yield than the spectral data from the later growing season at the tuber maturation stage. However, the best performing vegetation indices and the best timing for potato yield prediction varied with cultivars. The performance of the RFR and SVR models using only remote sensing data was unsatisfactory (R2 = 0.48–0.51 for validation) but was significantly improved when cultivar information was in-corporated (R2 = 0.75–0.79 for validation). It is concluded that combining high spatial-resolution UAV images and cultivar information using machine learning algorithms can significantly improve potato yield prediction than methods without using cultivar information. More studies are needed to improve potato yield prediction using more detailed cultivar information, soil and landscape variables, and management information, as well as more advanced machine learning models. © 2021 by the authors.

In order to further improve the accuracy of estimating winter wheat yield through remote sensing, this study analyzed the quantitative relationship between satellite remote sensing variables obtained from HJ-CCD images and the winter wheat yield, and used the partial least square (PLS) algorithm to construct and validate the multivariate remote sensing models of estimating the yield. The research showed a close relationship between yield and most remote sensing variables. Significant multiple correlations were also recorded between most remote sensing variables. The optimal principal components numbers of PLS models used to estimate yield were 4. Green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI) were sensitive variables for yield remote sensing estimation. Through model development and model validation evaluation, the yield estimation model’s coefficients of determination (R2) were 0.81 and 0.74 respectively. The root mean square error (RMSE) were 693.9 kg ha−1 and 786.5 kg ha−1. It showed that the PLS algorithm model estimates the yield better than the linear regression (LR) and principal components analysis (PCA) algorithms. The estimation accuracy was improved by more than 20% than the LR algorithm, and was 13% higher than the PCA algorithm. The results could provide an effective way to improve the estimation accuracy of winter wheat yield by remote sensing, and was conducive to large-area application and promotion. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"article; least square analysis; linear regression analysis; nonhuman; principal component analysis; quantitative analysis; remote sensing; senescence; soil; vegetation; winter wheat",Article,Scopus

The recently developed simulated observation of point cloud (SOPC) method can generate high spatial resolution winter wheat effective leaf area index (SOPC-LAIe) maps from the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based point cloud data without ground-based measurements. In this study, the SOPC-LAIe maps, for the first time, were applied to the simple algorithm for yield estimation (SAFY) to generate the sub-field biomass and yield maps. First, the dry aboveground biomass (DAM) measurements were used to determine the crop cultivar-specific parameters and simulated green leaf area index (LAI) in the SAFY model. Then, the SOPC-LAIe maps were converted to green LAI using a normalization approach. Finally, the multiple SOPC-LAIe maps were applied to the SAFY model to generate the final DAM and yield maps. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the estimated and measured yield is 88 g/m2, and the relative root mean squire error (RRMSE) is 15.2%. The pixel-based DAM and yield map generated in this study revealed clearly the within-field yield variation. This framework using the UAV-based SOPC-LAIe maps and SAFY model could be a simple and low-cost alternative for final yield estimation at the sub-field scale. © 2020 by the authors.","Biomass estimation; Leaf area index; Point cloud; SAFY model; Spatial variability; UAV; Yield","Antennas; Biomass; Crops; Mean square error; Above ground biomass; Ground based measurement; High spatial resolution; Point cloud data; Precision farming; Root mean square errors; SIMPLE algorithm; Yield estimation; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)",Article,Scopus

Thus, determination of the relationship between them is crucial for food security and support importing-exporting strategies. The aim of this work was to analyze the aptitude of temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) to forecast maize yield. MODIS/AQUA enhanced vegetation index and land surface temperature (LST) at 1 km were used to calculate TVDI and maize yield over a large agricultural area of Argentine Pampas. The comparison between TVDI and official yield statistics was carried out to derive regression models in two agro-climatic zones, obtaining linear and quadratic adjustments. The models account for between 73% and 83% of yield variability, with the best prediction in the humid zone. The RMSE values ranged from 14% to 19% of average yield. The bias showed a slightly higher difference between predicted and observed yield data in semi-Arid zone. The models showed aptitude to estimate yield with reasonable accuracy 8-12 weeks before harvest. In addition, the TVDI-maize yield relationship and the impact of submonthly water stress were evaluated at field scale using yield measurements to ensure the analysis on maize. The highest \text{R}^{2} (0.61) was obtained using monthly values suggesting that the entire critical stage should be taken into account for yield forecasting. Although these results would not be directly extrapolated to other agricultural regions in the world, the proposed model is promising for forecasting spatial yield in other regions with poor data coverage several weeks before harvest. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Optical-Thermal; soil moisture; stress index; temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI)","Agriculture; Arid regions; Atmospheric temperature; Food supply; Regression analysis; Soil moisture; Vegetation; Agricultural areas; Enhanced vegetation index; Index measurements; Land surface temperature; Reasonable accuracy; Remotely sensed temperature; Soil moisture availability; Temperature-vegetation dryness indices; Forecasting; agricultural land; Aqua (satellite); crop yield; forecasting method; maize; MODIS; remote sensing; soil moisture; temperature profile; vegetation index; Argentina; Pampas; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

(1) Background: Tree-ring width chronologies have been successfully applied for crops yield reconstruction models. We propose application of separated earlywood and latewood width chronologies as possible pre-dictors improving the fitness of reconstruction models. (2) Methods: The generalized yield series of main crops (spring wheat, spring barley, oats) were investigated in rain-fed and irrigated areas in semiarid steppes of South Siberia. Chronologies of earlywood, latewood, and total ring width of Siberian larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.) growing in forest-steppe in the middle of the study area were tested as predictors of yield reconstruction models. (3) Results: In the rain-fed territory, separation of earlywood and latewood allowed increasing variation of yield explained by reconstruction model from 17.4 to 20.5%, whereas total climatic-driven component of variation was 41.5%. However, both tree-ring based models explained only 7.7% of yield variation in the irrigated territory (climate inclusion increased it to 34.8%). Low temperature sensitivity of larch growth was the main limitation of the model. A 240-year (1780–2019) history of crop failures and yield variation dynamics were estimated from the actual data and the best reconstruction model. (4) Conclusions: Presently in the study region, breeding of the environment-resistant crops varieties compensates the increase of temperature in the yield dynamics, preventing severe harvest losses. Tree-ring based reconstructions may help to understand and forecast response of the crops to the climatic variability, and also the probability of crop failures, particularly in the rain-fed territories. © 2021 by the authors.

Production efficiency models (PEMs) estimate Gross Primary Production (GPP) as a function of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy, which is derived from Earth observation. GPP can be summed over the growing season and adjusted by a crop-specific harvest index to estimate yield. Although PEMs have many advantages over other crop yield models, they are not widely used, because performance is relatively poor. Here, a new PEM is presented that addresses deficiencies for macro-scale application: Production Efficiency Model Optimized for Crops (PEMOC). It was developed by optimizing functions from the literature with GPP estimated by eddy covariance flux towers in the United States. The model was evaluated using newly developed Earth observation products and county-level yield statistics for major crops. PEMOC generally performed better at the field and county level than another commonly used PEM, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer GPP (MOD17). PEMOC and MOD17 estimates of GPP had an R2 and root mean squared error (RMSE) over the growing season of 0.71–0.89 (9.87–17.47 g CO2 d−1) and 0.59–0.83 (6.86–22.20 g CO2 d−1) with flux tower GPP. PEMOC produced R2s and RMSE of 0.70 (0.52), 0.60 (0.61), and 0.62 (0.59), while MOD17 produced R2s and RMSE of 0.65 (0.57), 0.53 (0.66), and 0.65 (0.57) with corn, soybean, and winter wheat crop yield anomalies. The sample size of rice was small, so yields were compared directly. PEMOC and MOD17 produced R2s and RMSE of 0.53 (3.42 t ha−1) and 0.40 (4.89 t ha−1). The most sizeable model improvements were seen for C3 and C4 crops during emergence/senescence and peak season, respectively. These improvements were attributed to C3 and C4 partitioning, optimized temperature and moisture constraints, and an evapotranspiration-based soil moisture index. © 2018","Biomass; Earth observation; Evapotranspiration; NPP; WUE","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Efficiency; Evapotranspiration; Macros; Mean square error; Observatories; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Earth observation data; Earth observation products; Earth observations; Fraction of photosynthetically active radiations; Gross primary production; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Physiological informations; Root mean squared errors; Crops; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural modeling; biomass; crop yield; Earth; ecophysiology; eddy covariance; efficiency measurement; estimation method; evapotranspiration; flux measurement; growing season; MODIS; net primary production; optimization; primary production; remote sensing; water use efficiency; United States; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

To investigate the effects of depth and input dimensions of the proposed model, careful validations are performed by extensive numerical simulation. The results give an optimal depth (19) and recommend a limited input dimension (under 200). Furthermore, compared with the baseline models, including support vector regression, decision tree regression, and residual regression, our proposed model with the optimal depth performs best. Ultimately, DenseNet regression is applied to predict relative humidity, and the outcome shows a high correlation with observations, which indicates that our model could advance environmental data science. © 2022 by the authors.

Multiple field measurements and aerial surveys were carried out examining the response of oat on Silicon and Sulfur foliar fertilization treatments thereby monitoring their effects on the physiology, production and stress tolerance. Parallel application of in situ (elevation, soil pH, NDVI, SPAD, chlorophyll content) and aerial (NDVI, NDRE) surveys including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provided a diverse source of data for evaluation.

However, the effects of tree canopy structure on the microenvironment and associated crop yield remain unclear. We set up a field experiment with four tree forms of almonds (Amygdalus communis L.), delayed open-central shape (DC), semicircle small-canopy shape (SC), open-center shape (OC), and high-stem shape (HS), which were intercropped with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) separately. We measured the wheat yields and the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), temperature, humidity, and red/far-red light ratio at various intercropped positions (1 m, 2 m, and 3 m apart from tree line). The results showed that wheat yield and yield components were affected jointly by the tree forms and the intercropping position. Compared with monoculture wheat, the yields of intercropped wheat with DC, SC, OC, and HS were decreased by 63.7%, 18.2%, 35.4%, and 33.0%, respectively. Tree form is largely influential to PAR, red light/far-red light, temperature, and humidity in the intercropped areas. The PAR in the intercropped wheat area was SC > HS/OC > DC, and PAR was increased with the distance from the tree line. PAR correlated significantly with R/FR, mean daily temperature, and relative humidity. PAR measured for wheat at various growth and development stages had significant positive correlations with thousand kernel weight, number of spikes, kernel number per spike, and grain yield. The structural equation model revealed that the yields of wheat were affected primarily by the PAR at the flowering and filling stages, with a contribution of up to 68%. Choosing a proper tree form (i.e., SC) and pruning to increase the trunk height or to remove the center pole is important to increase the quantity of light penetration and thereby increase the potential of wheat grain yields. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Agroforestry management; Light; Microenvironment; Tree form; Triticum aestivum L; Yield","agroforestry; growth and development; intercropping; wheat; China",Article,Scopus

In this study, a holistic analysis of the determinants and challenges of supplying microlife insurance in Ghana is carried out using factor analysis with principal component analysis. Primary data were sourced from 193 respondents related to the development of microlife insurance products. Out of 20 critical determinants extracted for the supply of microlife insurance products, four principal groups/components were established. They include affordable but profit-oriented products, active consideration of consumer-oriented conditions, strong internal position and controls, and favourable external factors. Further, 39 challenges associated with supplying microlife insurance products were identified and divided into five major groups: poor premium income, asymmetric information, weak internal systems, increased industry-related challenges and unfavourable external factors. The findings could serve as a checklist for microlife insurers to develop measures to sustain microlife insurance products while they mitigate obstacles to improve net profits from products.

Although statistical modeling is commonly used in the water sector, machine learning is still an emerging tool and can provide insights to optimize operations. Random forest (RF), a machine learning model, and multiple linear regression (MLR) were used in this study to model the mass balance of biosolids from a complex biosolids management area. The RF model outperformed (R2 = 0.89) the MLR model (R2 = 0.49) and showed that rainfall was a major factor impacting distribution. Storage for dried biosolids would help decouple drying operations from wet weather and increase distribution. This study demonstrated how machine learning can assist in decision-making processes for long-term planning at WRRFs. Practitioner Points: Random forest predicted the 7-day average mass balance of biosolids from a complex biosolids management area. Decoupling biosolids drying operations from wet weather was identified as the highest operational priority.

Within many developing countries there is often strong reliance on traditional bioenergy from fuels such as charcoal, which is typically cheaper and readily available compared to fossil fuels.

Modern bioenergy using resources such as agricultural wastes and residues and through growing energy crops can provide alternative low carbon renewable energy opportunities. This research applies the Biomass Resource Model to explore potential bioenergy opportunities in Kenya. Attributional LCA analyses is undertaken to evaluate the potential GHG savings that may be achieved if briquettes produced from Kenyan biomass are used to replace fossil and traditional bioenergy fuels for household cooking and for industry. Kenyan agriculture can provide large opportunities for bioenergy - crop residues and animal wastes potentially providing up to 15.6 and 7.9 Mt (odt) by 2050. Implementing an energy crop planting strategy where 1% of available suitable lands are utilised by 2050 could produce >7 Mt of biomass fuels, rising to >36 Mt if 5% of lands were planted.

A need was identified to assess the usefulness and reliability of satellite-based weather estimates in the lower Vaal River Catchment due to the scarcity of weather data. We explored the utility of Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data for streamflow simulation in an important agricultural catchment in South Africa, using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). First, we compared CFSR precipitation against rain gauge measurements at an annual time step. Two models were set up, one with conventional gauge weather data obtained from the South African Weather Services (SAWS) and the Agricultural Research Council (ARC), and the other with CFSR data. Calibration and validation of the models were performed using Sequential Uncertainty Fitting ver.2 (SUFI-2) algorithm of the SWAT Calibration Uncertainties Program (SWAT- CUP) at five stream gauge sites, with the data split between 2003 to 2008 and 2009 to 2013 for calibration and validation respectively. A low statistical agreement between CFSR precipitation and rain gauge data was obtained. The model with gauge data slightly outperformed CFSR model before calibration and during validation, whereas CFSR performed better mainly during calibration. Overall, both models achieved fair simulations of streamflow and long-term monthly streamflow regime at both the main catchment outlet and interior sub-catchments. While conventional gauge data remain the most accurate and reliable data source, CFSR can play a role as an alternative data input where there is inadequate gauge data. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CFSR; Hydrological modelling; Lower Vaal River; Satellite-based weather; SWAT","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Calibration; Rain; Rain gages; Runoff; Satellites; Stream flow; Agricultural catchments; Agricultural research; Calibration and validations; Calibration uncertainty; Sequential uncertainty fittings; Soil and water assessment tool; Streamflow simulations; Weather variability; Data streams; annual variation; catchment; computer simulation; data set; estimation method; numerical model; satellite imagery; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; weather forecasting; South Africa; Vaal River",Article,Scopus

However, the representation of freeze-thaw cycles has been often simplified in large scale watershed models. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which has been widely used to understand and assess hydrologic budgets and water resources management, employs a simplified empirical approach to estimate soil temperature and determine the freezing and thawing status of soils. Here, we compared the performance of a physically-based soil temperature module and the built-in empirical approach in SWAT against field measurements at surface and 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 cm depths at six stations of the U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) within the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). In general, SWAT consistently underestimated winter soil temperatures and overestimated frozen days at all soil depths, while the modified version of SWAT (equipped with the physically-based soil temperature model; referred to as TSWAT) pronouncedly reduced the bias in estimated winter soil temperatures and frozen days compared with SWAT. Model performance assessment is conducted with three statistical coefficients, i.e., Bias (°C), the coefficient of determination (R 2 ), and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS). Statistical analyses show that TSWAT accurately simulated surface and soil temperatures at the five depths with R 2 and NS values greater than 0.82 at most sites, and Bias values were generally within the range of −1 to 1 °C during winter and ranged between −2.09 and 2.58 °C in non-winter seasons. The differences in freeze-thaw cycle representation between SWAT and TSWAT translate into noticeable discrepancies in simulated key hydrologic variables, such as surface runoff, percolation, and baseflow. Compared against long-term observed streamflow (1980–2015), TSWAT outperformed SWAT in capturing variations in monthly streamflow in both winter and non-winter seasons. These results and analyses highlight the value of improving freeze-thaw cycle representation for enhanced hydrologic modeling in large watersheds that are subject to freeze-thaw cycles. © 2019","Freeze-thaw cycles; Soil temperature; Streamflow; SWAT","Budget control; Freezing; Soils; Solvents; Stream flow; Temperature; Thawing; Water resources; Watersheds; Coefficient of determination; Freeze-thaw cycles; Model performance assessments; Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient; Soil and water assessment tool; Soil temperature; SWAT; Water resources management; Coefficient of performance; freeze-thaw cycle; hydrological modeling; performance assessment; simulation; soil and water assessment tool; soil depth; soil temperature; statistical analysis; streamflow; Mississippi River; United States",Article,Scopus

Most wheat production studies use the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to estimate the production and yield of wheat and other crops. On the one hand, few studies use the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) to determine crop yield and production on a regional level. This is possibly due to a lack of continuity of MERIS. On the other hand, the emergence of Sentinel 2 open new possibilities for the research and application of MTCI. This study has built two empirical models to estimate wheat production and yield in Andalusia. To this end, the study used the complete times series (weekly images from 2006–2011) of the MTCI vegetation index from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) sensor associated with the Andalusian yearbook for agricultural and fishing statistics (AEAP—Anuario de estadísticas agrarias y pesqueras de Andalucía). In order to build these models, the optimal development period for the plant needed to be identified, as did the time-based aggregation of MTCI values using said optimal period as a reference, and relation with the index, with direct observations of production and yield through spatial aggregation using coverage from the Geographic Information System for Agricultural Parcels (SIGPAC—Sistema de información geográfica de parcelas agrícolas) and requests for common agricultural policy (CAP) assistance.

Soil erosion, a major mechanism of land degradation, removes SOC and transfers it to the hydrosphere or the atmosphere, thereby affecting key ecosystem functions and services. The Mediterranean region is highly susceptible to land degradation because of erosion due to heavy rains following long, dry, hot summers. Although the Mediterranean landscape typically has a high altitude and incline, the soil is brittle and soft and is easily washed away by rain. Thus, vast regions in Turkey have been afflicted by this type of soil degradation. This study aimed to (1) estimate the temporal distribution of water erosion in the Seyhan River Basin, (2) assess the spatial distribution of SOC and (3) estimate the depletion of SOC through soil erosion using the Pan-European Soil Erosion Risk Assessment model, a physically based, regionally scaled soil erosion model. The annual amount of soil eroded from the Seyhan River Basin is estimated to be 7.8million tonnes per hectare (tha-1year-1). The amount of fertile soil loss from agricultural areas is ∼1.2million tonnes per year. The maximum amount of soil erosion occurs in maintenance scrubland and degraded forest areas, contributing to 68% of erosion, followed by that in agricultural land, contributing to 27% of erosion, with the remaining in forests and urban areas. © CSIRO 2017.","Mediterranean environment; PESERA; SOC; soil erosion","Agriculture; Ecology; Ecosystems; Erosion; Forestry; Organic carbon; Rain; Risk assessment; Risk perception; System-on-chip; Watersheds; Mediterranean environment; Mediterranean landscapes; Mediterranean watersheds; PESERA; Soil erosion; Soil erosion modeling; Soil erosion risk assessment; Temporal distribution; Soils; brittle deformation; ecosystem modeling; land degradation; Mediterranean environment; soil carbon; soil fertility; soil organic matter; spatial distribution; temporal distribution; water erosion; watershed; Seyhan Basin; Turkey",Article,Scopus

This can help alleviate food insecurity and the economical sustainability of farming at large. For this purpose, seasonal climate forecasts are used to generate crop forecasts. This study assesses two methods for linking seasonal climate forecasts with crop models to improve crop yield predictability in the Iberian Peninsula (IP). Crop models usually require daily weather data and therefore, we tested two methods to disaggregate seasonal climate forecasts into daily weather realizations: (1) a conditional stochastic weather generator (predictWTD) and (2) a simple forecast probability resampler (FResampler1).These methods were evaluated under three seasonal rainfall forecasts by analyzing the impacts on rainfed wheat yield and on irrigation requirements and yields of maize crop. In addition, we estimated the gross margins (€ ha− 1) and the production risks associated with contrasting scenarios of seasonal rainfall forecasts (dry and wet). Both methods provided comparable predictability and therefore, both seem feasible options for using seasonal forecasts to establish yield forecasts and irrigation requirements. The large impact of crop prices and of irrigation cost on gross margins for both crops suggests that using a combination of information on expected market prices and crop forecast based on seasonal climate forecasts can be an effective tool for farmer's decision-making, especially under dry forecast situation and/or in locations with low annual precipitation. These methods can help to quantify the benefits and risks from the seasonal weather forecasts to farmers in the IP. The anticipation of risks and the opportunity that skillful climate and crop forecast provide allows for windows of opportunity to prepare and pre-empt mitigating actions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Crop forecasts; Crop model; Iberian Peninsula; Maize; Stochastic weather generators; Wheat","agricultural market; agricultural modeling; agrometeorology; climate prediction; crop yield; cropping practice; decision making; irrigation system; maize; seasonal variation; sustainability; weather forecasting; wheat; Iberian Peninsula; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Many studies have been devoted to addressing this issue. The similarity regionalization approach, a commonly used strategy, is usually limited by subjective selection of similarity measures. This paper presents an application of a partitioned update scheme based on the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to reduce the prediction uncertainties. This scheme performs real-time updating for states and parameters of a distributed hydrological model by assimilating gauged streamflow. The streamflow predictions are constrained by the physical rainfall-runoff processes defined in the distributed hydrological model and by the correlation information transferred from gauged to ungauged basins. This scheme is successfully demonstrated in a nested basin with real-world hydrological data where the subbasins have immediate upstream and downstream neighbours. The results suggest that the assimilated observed data from downstream neighbours have more important roles in reducing the streamflow prediction errors at ungauged locations. The real-time updated model parameters remain stable with reasonable spreads after short-period assimilation, while their estimation trajectories have slow variations, which may be attributable to climate and land surface changes. Although this real-time updating scheme is intended for streamflow predictions in nested basins, it can be a valuable tool in separate basins to improve hydrological predictions by assimilating multi-source data sets, including ground-based and remote-sensing observations. © 2014 Author(s).",,"Real-time updating; State parameter estimation; Streamflow prediction; data set; Kalman filter; parameterization; prediction; rainfall-runoff modeling; real time; streamflow",Article,Scopus

The framework combines an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based surrogate model, an optimization algorithm (Genetic Algorithm), and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation to find the best lift-up design that maximizes either pedestrian wind comfort or thermal comfort or both.

This article presents a comprehensive review of research dedicated to the application of ML in the oil palm agricultural industry over the last decade (2011–2020). A systematic review was structured to answer seven predefined research questions by analysing 61 papers after applying exclusion criteria. The works analysed were categorized into two main groups: (1) regression analysis used to predict fruit yield, harvest time, oil yield, and seasonal impacts and (2) classification techniques to classify trees, fruit, disease levels, canopy, and land. Based on defined research questions, investigation of the reviewed literature included yearly distribution and geographical distribution of articles, highly adopted algorithms, input data, used features, and model performance evaluation criteria. Detailed quantitative– qualitative investigations have revealed that ML is still underutilised for predictive analysis of oil palm. However, smart systems integrated with machine vision and artificial intelligence are evolving to reform oil palm agri-business. This article offers an opportunity to understand the significance of ML in the oil palm agricultural industry and provides a roadmap for future research in this domain. © 2021 by the authors.

For sustainable agriculture to adapt the ongoing change in climate and social structure is a major challenge for scientists and researchers. The approach needs information from various sources and its use in the relevant field, which lead to a growing interest in knowledge discovery from large data. Data mining techniques provide effective solutions for this problem as it supports the automation of extracting significant data to obtain knowledge and trends, the elimination of manual tasks, easier data extraction directly from electronic sources, and transfer to secure electronic system of documentation, which will increase the agriculture productions from same limited resources. In a nutshell, the aim of this chapter is to gain insight into the applications of data mining techniques in smart farming, which direction to employ sustainable agriculture and identify the challenges to be addressed. © 2022 by IGI Global.

Big data and data analysis methods and models are important tools in food security (FS) studies for gap analysis and preparation of appropriate analytical frameworks. These innovations necessitate the development of novel methods for collecting, storing, processing, and extracting data. Methodology. The primary goal of this study was to conduct a critical review of agricultural big data and methods and models used for FS studies published in peer-reviewed journals since 2010. Approximately 130 articles were selected for full content review after the pre-screening process. Results. There are different sources of data collection, including but not limited to online databases, the internet, omics, Internet of Things, social media, survey rounds, remote sensing, and the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database. The collected data require analysis (i.e., mining, neural networks, Bayesian networks, and other ML algorithms) before data visualization using Python, R, Circos, Gephi, Tableau, or Cytoscape. Approximately 122 models, all of which were used in FS studies worldwide, were selected from 130 articles. However, most of these models addressed only one or two dimensions of FS (i.e., availability and access) and ignored the other dimensions (i.e., stability and utilization), creating a gap in the global context. Conclusions. There are certain FS gaps both worldwide and in the United Arab Emirates that need to be addressed by scientists and policymakers. Following the identification of the drivers, policies, and indicators, the findings of this review could be used to develop an appropriate analytical framework for FS and nutrition.

Two machine-learning techniques, gradient boosting (GB) and random forests (RF), were used to predict stand mean height of dominant and codominant trees (HT), trees per hectare (Tree·ha1), and basal area per hectare (BA·ha1) based on data sets collected from extensively and intensively managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations in the West Gulf Coastal Plain region. Models were evaluated using coefficient of determination (R2) and bias by applying models to independent tests and validation data sets and then comparing to conventional statistical models (Coble-2017) currently being used in the region. For extensively managed plantations, the GB models had less bias than the RF models. For model precision (R2), the GB models were consistently better than the RF models, and the HT model was the best, followed by those of Tree·ha1 and BA·ha1. Even for BA·ha1, the GB and RF models had R2 over 0.81. GB and RF models outperformed the Coble-2017 model; differences were not substantial for Tree·ha1 but were significant for HT and BA·ha1 (R2 = 0.96, 0.95, and 0.88 for HT and 0.84, 0.81, and 0.76 for BA). Important predictors identified by GB and RF and their contributions to the models were similar. For intensively managed plantations, GB and RF were similarly accurate in predicting HT and Tree·ha1, but GB outperformed RF in predicting BA·ha1 (R2 = 0.87 versus 0.75). We conclude that both GB and RF, although the former is preferred, can be effective in predicting future stand attributes. Forest managers can use the models presented here to predict quantitative information required for managing loblolly pine plantations in the region. © 2021, Canadian Science Publishing.

Each of the models was constructed in such a way that the yield prediction can be carried out on three dates: April 15th, May 31st, and June 30th. For model building, artificial neural networks with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) topology were used, on the basis of meteorological data (temperature and precipitation) and information about mineral fertilisation. The data were collected from the years, 2008-2015, from 328 production fields located in Greater Poland, Poland. An assessment of the quality of forecasts produced based on neural models was verified by determination of forecast errors using RAE (relative approximation error), RMS (root mean square error), MAE (mean absolute error) error indicators, and MAPE (mean absolute percentage error). An important feature of the produced prediction models is the ability to realize the forecast in the current agrotechnical year on the basis of the current weather and fertiliser information. The lowest MAPE error values were obtained for the neural model WR15_04 (April 15th) based on the MLP network with structure 15:15-18-11-1:1, which reached 7.51%. Other models reached MAPE errors of 7.85% for model WR31_05 (May 31st) and 8.12% for model WR30_06 (June 30th). The performed sensitivity analysis gave information about the factors that have the greatest impact on winter rapeseed yields. The highest rank of 1 was obtained by two networks for the same independent variable in the form of the sum of precipitation within a period from September 1st to December 31st of the previous year. However, in model WR15_04, the highest rank obtained a feature in the form of a sum of molybdenum fertilization in the current year (MO_CY). The models of winter rapeseed yield produced in the work will be the basis for the construction of new forecasting tools, which may be an important element of precision agriculture and the main element of decision support systems. © 2018 by the authors.","MLP network; Neural model; Precision agriculture; Sensitivity analysis; Winter rapeseed; Yield prediction","agricultural technology; artificial neural network; crop yield; fertilizer application; molybdenum; precision agriculture; sensitivity analysis; topology; Poland [Central Europe]; Brassica napus",Article,Scopus

This study combined a variety of environmental and agricultural factors and assessed the waterlogging risk of winter wheat from the aspects of sensitivity of hazard formative environments, hazard risk, and vulnerability of hazard-affected body using multi-source data. Furthermore, it constructed a compound waterlogging risk assessment model to classify the study area into high, relatively high, moderate, and low risky areas, respectively. The results showed that the proposed model could more comprehensively reflect the occurrence mechanism of winter wheat waterlogging by synchronizing geographical, agricultural, and meteorological factors.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of LULC on the hydrologic characteristics of Palico watershed in Batangas, Philippines using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Model inputs used were the 1989 and 2013 LULC maps and climatological and hydrologic data. Good agreement was obtained between simulated and observed streamflow values during model calibration (NSE=0.84 &amp; R2=0.86), and validation (NSE=0.61 &amp; R2=0.68). For the entire watershed, reduction in forest cover and rangeland resulted to an increase in surface runoff and decreases in baseflow or dry season flow and groundwater recharge. LULC changes affected the water quantity and timing of occurrence. Subbasin with 22% increase in forest cover and rangeland increased the baseflow by 1% to 15% and reduced the streamflow by 1% to 17% during the rainy months. Another subbasin with 54% forest loss resulted to more pronounced rainfall-runoff response with 11% to 17% decrease in baseflow and 4% to 24% increase in streamflow during rainy months. Finding the balance between these two opposite LULC change scenarios is crucial for the attainment of water security and sustainability in the watershed and in the areas it serves. © 2016, University of the Philippines Los Banos.

A version of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, calibrated in a previous study to estimate annual runoff, sediment and total phosphorus (TP) fluxes from the Castor subwatershed into the Pike River watershed, which, in turn, flows into the Missisquoi Bay, used static landscapes and single land uses to arrive at its predictions. However, in reality, farmers do rotate crops. Therefore, the present study’s objective was to quantify the impact of soil heterogeneities on land use change patterns in the Castor subwatershed from 1999 to 2011. Data from a 24-point soil survey within the Castor subwatershed were partitioned and regionalized into 5, 10, 15, 20 and 24 heterogeneous regions or configurations. Using the standard soils map (with mean properties) employed in several prior studies in the subwatershed, a sixth configuration termed “Reference,” was also developed. All 6 configurations were factorially combined with either 1999 or 2011 land use data to yield 12 different versions of the SWAT model and quantify the heterogeneities and uncertainty of soil properties on land use change. For hydrology, it was discovered that there were no marked differences in the predictions, which was attributable to the use the SCS-CN subroutine which masks the physical properties of soil parameters within the same hydrologic group. We evaluated all the models for two periods i.e. 1991-1999 and 2000-2007. All the 1999 land use SWAT configurations underestimated runoff, sediment and TP whereas all the 2011 land use SWAT set ups gave higher and more accurate values. For both land use periods, the 5 Region models both showed higher and more accurate estimates, than those set ups with a greater number of regions, but were similar in accuracy to the Reference model set-ups. Since the 5-region configurations showed the highest within-zone heterogeneity, it can be concluded that having many regions (many sampling points as regions) does not necessarily increase SWAT’s prediction accuracy. © 2015 ISEIS All rights reserved","Curve number; Land use; Partitioning; Total phosphorus","algal bloom; calibration; discharge; flux measurement; heterogeneity; land use change; mapping method; nutrient enrichment; phosphorus; regionalization; runoff; soil property; soil quality; spatiotemporal analysis; uncertainty analysis; watershed; Canada; Castor River; Lake Champlain; Missisquoi Bay; Quebec [Canada]; algae",Article,Scopus

This study aims to develop a semi-automated approach using Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite data and associated vegetation indices to extract annual cropping pattern in Muzaffarpur district of Bihar, India at a fine scale (1:50,000). Three vegetation indices (VIs) - NDVI, EVI2 and NDSBVI, were calculated using three seasonal (Kharif, Rabi and Zaid) IRS Resourcesat 2 LISS-III images. Threshold reference values for vegetation and non-vegetation thematic classes were extracted based on 40 training samples over each of the seasonal VI. Using these estimated value range a decision tree was established to classify three seasonal VI stack images which reveals seven different cropping patterns and plantation. In addition, a digitised reference map was also generated from multi-seasonal LISS-III images to check the accuracy of the semi-automatically extracted VI based classified image.

In fact, this approach may lead to inefficient N use by the crop, resulting in both economic losses and environmental issues. To overcome these drawbacks, several optical-oriented, site-specific management systems have been developed to consider the effect of the aforementioned sources of variability and modulate N applications to the actual crop nutrient status and requirements. In this study, a novel approach that integrates proximal sensing, seasonal weather forecasts and crop modelling to manage site-specific N fertilization in durum wheat is proposed. This approach is based on four successive steps: (1) optimal N supply is estimated by means of a crop model fed with a mix of observed and forecast weather data; (2) actual crop N uptake is estimated using proximal sensing; (3) N prescription maps are created merging crop model and proximal sensing information; (4) N-Variable Rate Application (N-VRA). The aforementioned approach was implemented in a 13.6-ha field characterized by large soil variability in texture and organic matter content. Results indicated that the system was able to capture spatial variability in crop N uptake and manage N distribution through N-VRA leading to a substantial reduction of the spatial variability in yield and protein content while reducing the total amount of N supplied compared to uniform treatments.

The sensitivities of Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model were tested for changes in horizontal resolution (convection permitting versus parameterized) on the replication of West African monsoon for the year 2014. Sensitivity test was also performed for response of rainfall to changes in microphysics (MP) and planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes. Generally, the result shows that WRF is able to replicates rainfall distribution with an adequate representation of the dynamical features of West African monsoon system. The high-resolution (wrf-4km) shows dry bias along the coast of the Gulf of Guinea but generally outperforms wrf-24km run especially in replication of the extreme rainfall distribution. The dry bias along the coastal area is suggested to not to be only related to convection but mostly to microphysics and PBL parameterisation schemes. Differences were noticed between the dynamics of WRF and ERA-interim outputs despite the use of spectral nudging in the experiment which then suggest strong interactions between scales. These differences were observed to be restricted mainly to the low-layer monsoon flow in JJA. Both runs at 24 and 4 km hardly simulate the typical diurnal distribution of rainfall. The sensitivity of WRF to MP (only sophisticated MP were tested) and PBL reveals a stronger impact of PBL than MP on rainfall distribution and the most significant added value over the Guinean coast and surroundings area was provided by the configurations using non-local PBL scheme (as ACM2). The changes in MP and PBL schemes in general seem to have less effect on the explicit runs (wrf-4km) in the replication of the rainfall over the Gulf of Guinea and the surroundings seaboard. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Convection permitting; High resolution; Parameterization; Rainfall; West Africa monsoon; WRF","atmospheric convection; climate modeling; climate variation; computer simulation; extreme event; monsoon; rainfall; regional climate; spatial distribution; Atlantic Ocean; Guinea; Gulf of Guinea",Article,Scopus

Next, the SVD (singular value decomposition) algorithm is applied to decompose all selected inputs, thus capturing the most relevant oscillatory features more clearly; then, the monthly lagged data are incorporated into a random forest model to generate future precipitation anomalies. The proposed model is applied in four districts of Pakistan and benchmarked by means of a standalone kernel ridge regression (KRR) model that is integrated with NSGA-SVD (hybrid NSGA-SVD-KRR) and the NSGA-RF and NSGA-KRR baseline models.

Estimates of precipitation and vegetation greenness are the two dominant satellite datasets. However, ignoring additional moisture- and energy-related processes that influence the response of vegetation to rainfall leads to an incomplete representation of the hydrologic cycle. This study evaluates the added value of considering multiple independent satellite-based variables to design, calibrate, and validate weather insurance indices on the African continent. The satellite data include two rainfall datasets, soil moisture, the evaporative stress index (ESI), and vegetation greenness. We limit artificial advantages by resampling all datasets to the same spatial (0.258) and temporal (monthly) resolution, although datasets with a higher spatial resolution might have an added value, if considered as the single source of information for localized applications. A higher correlation coefficient between the moisture-focused variables and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), an indicator for vegetation vigor, provides evidence for the datasets’ capability to capture agricultural drought conditions on the ground. The Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) rainfall dataset, soil moisture, and ESI show higher correlations with the (lagged) NDVI in large parts of Africa, for different land covers and various climate zones, than the African Rainfall Climatology, version 2 (ARC2), rainfall dataset, which is often used in WII.

However, the decisions framed through the application of such models are highly affected by the model input data accuracy. On a global scale, the majority of watersheds are data-limited (DL), and model input data at required spatial and temporal resolutions are unavailable, incomplete, or low in quality. Thus, the hydrological simulations are significantly influenced by poor representation and characterization of the system, which affects the reliability of simulations in DL regions. This study quantifies the effects of global-scale dataset usage in ecohydrological simulations. The global-scale datasets are generally coarse in spatial resolution and significantly affect the hydrology and water quality simulations. The average annual flow simulations were 35.7% higher for DL scenarios as compared to the data-intensive scenario.

Our area of study around the typhoon’s path covers 15.7 Mha, and includes 47 of the 87 provinces in the Philippines. In validation areas our model predicts coconut tree density with a Mean Absolute Error of 5.9 Trees/ha. In Camarines Sur we estimated that 3.5 M of the 4.6 M existing coconut trees were damaged by the typhoon. Overall we estimated that 14.1 M coconut trees were affected by the typhoon inside our area of study. Our validation images confirm that trees are rarely uprooted and damages are largely due to reduced canopy cover of standing trees. On validation areas, our model was able to detect affected coconut trees with 88.6% accuracy, 75% precision and 90% recall.

This study explored the suitability of high spatio-temporal resolution Sentinel-2 imagery and the applicability of advanced machine learning techniques for estimating aboveground biomass at the paddock level in five dairy farms across northern Tasmania, Australia. A sequential neural network model was developed by integrating Sentinel-2 time-series data, weekly field biomass observations and daily climate variables from 2017 to 2018. Linear least-squares regression was employed for evaluating the results for model calibration and validation. Optimal model performance was realised with an R2 of ≈0.6, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of ≈356 kg dry matter (DM)/ha and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 262 kg DM/ha. These performance markers indicated the results were within the variability of the pasture biomass measured in the field, and therefore represent a relatively high prediction accuracy. Sensitivity analysis further revealed what impact each farm’s in situ measurement, pasture management and grazing practices have on the model’s predictions. The study demonstrated the potential benefits and feasibility of improving biomass estimation in a cheap and rapid manner over traditional field measurement and commonly used remote-sensing methods. The proposed approach will help farmers and policymakers to estimate the amount of pasture present for optimising grazing management and improving decision-making regarding dairy farming. © 2021 by the authors.

A geographically isolated wetland (GIW) module for Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was developed to couple surface water storage and subsurface water dynamics to characterize hydroperiod. The new GIW module includes the following features: (1) a flexible geometric formula to characterize wetland surface water area, volume, and depth; (2) a revised algorithm to account for evaporation from both water and soil surfaces in wetlands; (3) application of the Richards equation to couple surface water storage and subsurface water dynamics; (4) use of Darcy's law with an effective hydraulic conductivity parameter to simulate groundwater discharge. We tested the GIW module using observed daily water level data from four wetlands at two sites (including restored and natural wetlands with and without a low-permeability soil layer) in the Delmarva Peninsula, USA. The results show that the wetland module reasonably reproduced observed water levels for both restored and natural wetlands with and without a low-permeability soil layer. The module was also able to reasonably simulate saturated and unsaturated portions of the soil corresponding to wet and dry periods.

The objectives of the study were to assess modelling requirements for describing shallow groundwater and tile drainage dynamics and to evaluate how tile drains affect groundwater flow across the redox interface, where nitrate reduction in the subsurface occurs. The study was conducted on a 33-hectare tile drained field within a Weichsel till area in Fensholt catchment, Denmark. The study consisted of 2.5 years high-frequency monitoring and numerical modelling using a variably-saturated 3D hydrological model (FEFLOW) with a detailed representation of the tile drain network. Field data showed extremely rapid increases, up to 1 m per day, in the groundwater heads when the autumn water surplus starts. Drain discharge was found to follow the dynamics in heads. High-frequency monitoring (at least once per day) is therefore necessary in order to capture the dynamics in shallow groundwater and tile discharge. The dynamics showed simultaneous rapid increase in groundwater heads down to a depth of 22 m, illustrating the key importance of deeper geology in understanding the hydrological processes in this area. The temporal dynamics in head and drain discharge were successfully captured by the hydrological model and the steepness of the retention curve was found to be important for this. The calibrated model was successfully tested against discharge in the stream draining a larger area. The model results showed, that tile drains affect the water flow in the area and significantly decrease the downward fluxes across the redox interface, located on average at 3.6 m depth. Tile drains therefore have a large effect on the amount of nitrate reduction in the subsurface and on the nitrate fluxes to receiving surface waters. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Field scale; High-frequency data; Hydrological modeling; Shallow groundwater; Temporal dynamics; Tile drainage","Catchments; Climate models; Cultivation; Groundwater flow; Hydraulics; Nitrates; Salinity measurement; Field scale; High frequency data; Hydrological modeling; Shallow groundwater; Temporal dynamics; Tile drainage; Groundwater; catchment; drainage; groundwater flow; groundwater-surface water interaction; hydraulic head; hydrodynamics; hydrological modeling; interface; numerical model; redox conditions; till; water table; Denmark; Poland [Central Europe]; Vistula River",Article,Scopus

Climate forecasting centres around the globe now routinely run global climate models (GCMs) to provide ensemble forecasts. However, raw GCM forecasts require post-processing to improve their reliability and to enable systematic integration with crop models. Post-processing to meet crop model input requirements is highly challenging and simple bias-correction methods can perform poorly in this regard. As a result of the difficulties, GCM forecasts are often sidelined in favour of other inputs such as climate analogues. In this study, we evaluate two variants of a recently-developed post-processing method designed to systematically and reliably calibrate and downscale GCM forecasts for use in crop models. In one variant, local GCM forecasts of rainfall, temperature and solar radiation are post-processed directly. The second variant is a novel adaption in which the predictive input is instead the GCM's forecast of a large-scale climate pattern, in this case related to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. The post-processed climate forecasts, which are in the form of ensemble time series, are used to drive an APSIM-sugar model to generate long-lead forecasts of biomass in north-eastern Australia from 1982 to 2016. A rigorous probabilistic assessment of forecast attributes suggests that local GCM forecast calibration provides the most skilful forecasts overall although the ENSO-related forecasts give more skilful biomass forecasts at certain times, implying model combination could be worthwhile to maximise skill. The generated biomass forecasts are unbiased and reliable for short to long lead times, suggesting that the downscaling methods will be of value to trial in a range of crop forecast applications, and support the quantitative, meaningful use of GCM forecasts in agriculture. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","APSIM; Crop yield; Ensemble forecasting; Forecast verification; Sugarcane","biomass; calibration; crop yield; downscaling; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; general circulation model; global climate; solar radiation; weather forecasting; Australia",Article,Scopus

High spatial and temporal resolution spectral data acquired by multispectral and conventional cameras (or red, green, blue (RGB) sensors) onboard UAVs can be useful for plant water status determination and, as a consequence, for irrigation management. A study in a vineyard located in south-eastern Spain was carried out during the 2018, 2019, and 2020 seasons to assess the potential uses of these techniques. Different water qualities and irrigation application start throughout the growth cycle were imposed. Flights with RGB and multispectral cameras mounted on a UAV were performed throughout the growth cycle, and orthoimages were generated. These orthoimages were segmented to include only vegetation and calculate the green canopy cover (GCC). The stem water potential was measured, and the water stress integral (Sψ) was obtained during each irrigation season. Multiple linear regression techniques and artificial neural networks (ANNs) models with multispectral and RGB bands, as well as GCC, as inputs, were trained and tested to simulate the Sψ. The results showed that the information in the visible domain was highly related to the Sψ in the 2018 season. For all the other years and combinations of years, multispectral ANNs performed slightly better. Differences in the spatial resolution and radiometric quality of the RGB and multispectral geomatic products explain the good model performances with each type of data. Additionally, RGB cameras cost less and are easier to use than multispectral cameras, and RGB images are simpler to process than multispectral images. Therefore, RGB sensors are a good option for use in predicting entire vineyard water status. In any case, field punctual measurements are still required to generate a general model to estimate the water status in any season and vineyard. © 2022 by the authors.","ANN; machine learning; multispectral images; RGB images; UAV; vineyard; water stress",,Article,Scopus

For many of those applications, precise knowledge of the distribution of crop types is essential. Various machine and deep learning models have been used for automated crop classification using microwave remote sensing time series. However, the application of these approaches on a large spatial and temporal scale is barely investigated. In this study, the performance of two frequently used algorithms, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forest (RF), for crop classification based on Sentinel-1 time series and meteorological data on a large spatial and temporal scale is assessed. For data from Austria, the Netherlands, and France and the years 2015–2019, scenarios with different spatial and temporal scales were defined. To quantify the complexity of these scenarios, the Fisher Discriminant measurement F1 (FDR1) was used. The results demonstrate that both classifiers achieve similar results for simple classification tasks with low FDR1 values. With increasing FDR1 values, however, LSTM networks outperform RF. This suggests that the ability of LSTM networks to learn long-term dependencies and identify the relation between radar time series and meteorological data becomes increasingly important for more complex applications. Thus, the study underlines the importance of deep learning models, including LSTM networks, for large-scale applications. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aims to define homogenous regions and optimum planting dates for sugarcane using simulated water-limited yield in the state of Goiás, Brazil. Yw was simulated using crop model and 24 planting dates across the year, including gridded weather data and soil water availability to the crop over the state in a grid cell size of 0.5 × 0.5°. The crop model was evaluated comparing simulated and measured yield tendency across planting dates. Homogeneous regions were obtained based on Yw, using the Ward’s method and Euclidean distance. The crop model was able to replicate yield tendency across planting dates. The clustering divided the state into four homogenous regions, where optimum planting period had different intervals due to the interaction with climate and soil. The optimum planting window had four dates for the region with lower Yw (105 t ha−1).

Given the importance of soil moisture (SM) for crop development, the objective of this study was to investigate the use of passive microwave-derived estimates of surface SM obtained by the SM Ocean Salinity Mission (SMOS) satellite for forecasting canola yields across the Canadian Prairies within Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's (AAFC) Canadian Crop Yield Forecaster (CCYF) model. Weekly SMOS SM observations were combined with climate variables and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) platform and used as an input for forecasting canola yields at the township-scale across the Canadian Prairies from 2010 to 2016. Top predictors were identified, and regression models were built using a robust least angle regression (RLARS) and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) scheme. SM was found to provide a better descriptor of canola stress than the more widely utilized NDVI, being selected as a predictor in 74.2 % of developed ecodistrict models over the 7-year period, compared to just 41.2 % for NDVI. The difference between model R2 values (i.e. R2diff) when SMOS SM predictors were included and excluded from the forecast, respectively, revealed varying degrees of model improvements; however, the majority of ecodistricts under study (53.3 %) showed improved model fit (i.e. R2diff &gt; 0) with observed canola yields when SMOS SM indices were included as potential predictors within the CCYF. Overall, greater improvements in the CCYF performance were observed in Manitoba and Saskatchewan where meteorological stations are more sparsely distributed. However, performance for both sets of model inputs was relatively low with R2 values ranging from 0 to 0.74 (mean = 0.13) and from 0 to 0.52 (mean = 0.12) across the study area both when SM was included and excluded from the model, respectively. These findings suggest that while SMOS SM observations may provide a more effective indicator of canola yields, the CCYF's performance at the township-scale, where interannual yield variability is often quite high, is limited by the short temporal satellite record. © 2020","Canola; CCYF; Passive microwave; SMOS; Soil moisture; Yield forecast","AVHRR; crop yield; forecasting method; NDVI; satellite imagery; soil moisture; Canada; Manitoba; Prairie Provinces; Saskatchewan; Brassica napus var. napus; Indicator indicator",Article,Scopus

Improved agronomy and the release of cultivars suited to a wider range of environments have facilitated the expansion of canola production into new environments. To maximise grain yield at earlier sowing dates and in new environments, growers need to know the most suitable development pattern for their environment and sowing date to reduce production losses associated with frost, heat and drought at flowering. A simulation analysis was conducted at 77 locations across the Australian cropping zone to determine the optimal period for flowering to start in order to maximise long-term yield. The simulation accounted for effects of frost, heat and water stress on yield as well as duration of biomass accumulation. The optimal start of flowering period (OSF) was a function of the environment rather than the cultivar, and the relative importance of frost, heat and water stress varied with location. We found that the OSF was earlier (mid to late July), in most Mediterranean environments of Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria and later (August to September) in the southern temperate environments of Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales (NSW). In medium and low rainfall areas of NSW, temperature extremes and rainfall interacted so that the OSF occurred in mid-July to mid-August. In low rainfall environments the duration of the optimal period was shorter (19–35 days) in most cases than in high rainfall environments (30–52 days). Knowledge of the OSF for a location, will allow breeders to develop cultivars with appropriate phenological characteristics for target environments. For growers, an understanding of the OSF, combined with an appropriate phenology classification of commercial cultivars, will allow selection of cultivar and sowing date combinations which decrease the risk of stress and maximise productivity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Critical period; Drought; Frost; Heat; Phenology; Rapeseed; Simulation model; Stress","agronomy; canola; cultivar; drought; environmental stress; farm size; flowering; frost; heating; Mediterranean environment; numerical model; phenology; rainfall; simulation; sowing date; temperature; water stress; yield response; Australia; Brassica napus; Brassica napus var. napus",Article,Scopus

To plan the location of such tile drain measures, it is important to know where in the landscape drain flow is generated and to understand the key factors governing drain flow dynamics. In the present study, we test two approaches to assess spatial patterns in drain flow generation and thereby assess the importance of including geological information. The approaches are the widely used topographical wetness index (TWI), based solely on elevation data, and hydrological models that include the subsurface geology. We set-up an ensemble of 20 hydrological models based on 20 stochastically generated geological models to predict drain flow dynamics in the clay till Norsminde catchment in Denmark and test the results against TWI. We find that the hydrological models predict observed daily drain flow reasonably well. High drain flow volumes were found in stream valleys and in wetlands and lower drain flow volumes in the more hilly parts of the catchment. In spite of the apparent connection to the landscape, there was no statistically significant correlation between TWI and drain flow at grid scale (100 × 100 m). TWI was therefore not found to be a sufficient index on its own to assess where drain flow is generated, especially in the highlands of the catchment. The geology below 3 m was found to have a large impact on the drain flow, and correlations between sand percentage in the subsurface geology and drain flow volume were found to be statistically significant. Geological uncertainty therefore give rise to uncertainty on simulated drain flow, and this uncertainty was found to be high at the model grid scale but decreasing with increasing scale. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","drain flow; geology; hydrological modelling; spatial patterns; topographical wetness index (TWI); uncertainty","Catchments; Geology; Runoff; Drain flow; Hydrological modelling; Spatial patterns; topographical wetness index (TWI); uncertainty; Uncertainty analysis; fluid dynamics; hydrogeology; hydrological modeling; spatial data; steady-state equilibrium; subsurface flow; tile drain; uncertainty analysis; Denmark",Article,Scopus

Out of 13 variables, 5 variables were selected to build the BP ANN model, and we used cross validation for the accuracy assessment. The results show that: (1) the modeled mean AGB (2001–2016) provides a reasonable spatial distribution that is similar to the field measurements but reveals more details and has better spatial coverage than the limited field measurements are able to provide; (2) the overall trend of AGB in the TRHR is increasing more than decreasing (44.4% vs 29.2%, respectively) and has a stable area of 26.4%; and (3) the BP ANN model achieves better results than do the traditional multi-factor regression models (R2: 0.75–0.85 vs 0.40–0.64, RMSE: 355–462 vs 537–689 kg DW/ha).

These parameters can be derived from MODIS with high accuracy, but their temporal resolution is too low to obtain high-temporal-resolution SSR retrievals. In order to obtain hourly cloud parameters, an artificial neural network (ANN) is applied in this study to directly construct a functional relationship between MODIS cloud products and Multifunctional Transport Satellite (MTSAT) geostationary satellite signals. In addition, an efficient parameterization model for SSR retrieval is introduced and, when driven with MODIS atmospheric and land products, its root mean square error (RMSE) is about 100 W m-2 for 44 Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) stations. Once the estimated cloud parameters and other information (such as aerosol, precipitable water, ozone) are input to the model, we can derive SSR at high spatiotemporal resolution. The retrieved SSR is first evaluated against hourly radiation data at three experimental stations in the Haihe River basin of China. The mean bias error (MBE) and RMSE in hourly SSR estimate are 12.0 W m-2 (or 3.5 %) and 98.5 W m-2 (or 28.9 %), respectively.

Development, control and maintenance of these strategies are highly dependent on temporally and spatially continuous information on crop status at the field scale. This paper introduces the application of a process-based, coupled hydro-agroecological model (PROMET) for the simulation of temporally and spatially dynamic crop growth on agriculturally managed fields. By assimilating optical remote sensing data into the model, the simulation of spatial crop dynamics is improved to a point where site-specific farming measures can be supported. Radiative transfer modeling (SLC) is used to provide maps of leaf area index from Earth Observation (EO). These maps are used in an assimilation scheme that selects closest matches between EO and PROMET ensemble runs. Validation is provided for winter wheat (years 2004, 2010 and 2011). Field samples validate the temporal dynamics of the simulations (avg. R2 = 0.93) and > 700 ha of calibrated combine harvester data are used for accuracy assessment of the spatial yield simulations (avg. RMSE = 1.15 t·ha-1). The study shows that precise simulation of field-scale crop growth and yield is possible, if spatial remotely sensed information is combined with temporal dynamics provided by land surface process models.

The model was calibrated through comparing model outputs with observations to ensure reliable hydrologic, crop yield, and water quality simulations. The model results indicated that, 5% of total nitrogen (TN) load and 12% of total phosphorus (TP) load could be reduced at the watershed outlet by implementing the conservation tillage system of ""rice parachute transplanting with no-tillage and straw mulching"" for paddy rice fields which account for 9% of the watershed area. It is valuable to develop conservation tillage systems suitable for other types of agricultural land in southern China. When modeling the impacts of various fertilization levels derived from recommended fertilizer doses for medium fertility soil of the Pearl River Delta region where the watershed is located, the total crop yield was estimated to decrease by only 2% for up to 24% and 28% reduction in TN and TP loads at the watershed scale, respectively. The crop yields versus nutrient losses relationship simulated by SWAT indicated that great effects in TN and TP loads reduction could be achieved at the expense of minimal impacts on crop yield through optimal fertilization.

A case in point is remote sensing images (RSI), now available in large-scale RSI archives, which have attracted a considerable amount of research on image classification within the remote sensing community. The basic task of single-target multi-class image classification considers the case where each image is assigned exactly one label from a predefined finite set of class labels. Recently, however, image annotations have become increasingly complex, with images labeled with several labels (instead of just one). In other words, the goal is to assign multiple semantic categories to an image, based on its high-level context. The corresponding machine learning tasks is called multi-label classification (MLC). The classification of RSI is currently predominantly addressed by deep neural network (DNN) approaches, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can be utilized as feature extractors as well as end-to-end methods. After only considering single-target classification for a long period, DNNs have recently emerged that address the task of MLC. On the other hand, trees and tree ensembles for MLC have a long tradition and are the best-performing class of MLC methods, but need predefined feature representations to operate on. In this work, we explore different strategies for model training based on the transfer learning paradigm, where we utilize different families of (pre-trained) CNN architectures, such as VGG, EfficientNet, and ResNet. The architectures are trained in an end-to-end manner and used in two different modes of operation, namely, as standalone models that directly perform the MLC task, and as feature extractors. In the latter case, the learned representations are used with tree ensemble methods for MLC, such as random forests and extremely randomized trees. We conduct an extensive experimental analysis of methods over several publicly available RSI datasets and evaluate their effectiveness in terms of standard MLC measures. Of these, ranking-based evaluation measures are most relevant, especially ranking loss. The results show that, for addressing the RSI-MLC task, it is favorable to use lightweight network architectures, such as EfficientNet-B2, which is the best performing end-to-end approach, as well as a feature extractor. Furthermore, in the datasets with a limited number of images, using traditional tree ensembles for MLC can yield better performance compared to end-to-end deep approaches. © 2023 by the authors.","convolutional neural networks; multi-label classification; remote sensing; tree ensemble methods","Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Image classification; Learning systems; Network architecture; Semantics; Transfer learning; Classification of remote sensing image; Convolutional neural network; End to end; Ensemble methods; Feature extractor; Multi-label classifications; Remote sensing images; Remote-sensing; Tree ensemble method; Tree ensembles; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

One hundred hybrids were evaluated under sub-optimal and optimal N environments for two years. The experimental layout was a 10 × 10 alpha lattice design with two replications for two experiments. The results obtained showed that, the genotypes evaluated varied for grain yield and the characters measured under sub-optimal and optimal N conditions. Grain yield reduction due to N stress was 40.9%. General and specific combining ability (GCA) and (SCA) effects for mean squares varied for grain yield demonstrating the importance of additive and non-additive genetic effects for the hybrids evaluated under the study conditions. Even though significant variations were detected for GCA and SCA, GCA which is the additive gene action component mainly controlled the heritage of grain yield under both conditions. Inbred line 15 was identified as the superior parent with positive and significant GCA for grain yield under sub-optimal N. Genotypic correlation studies displayed that grain yield was positively correlated with ears per plant under sub-optimal N and was also positively associated with anthesis-silking interval under high N.

The optimal number of hidden layers of the deep belief network model and the number of nodes contained in the hidden layer were obtained through experiments. The results show that the first, second, and third hidden layers have 8, 6, and 10 nodes, respectively; the prediction accuracy of the deep belief network model is more accurate than that of the BP neural network and wavelet neural network. Besides, the absolute value of the prediction error of the deep belief model is within 0.1, which has good prediction accuracy. In short, the deep belief model has a good development prospect in agricultural product price forecasting, and it can provide relevant reference for the establishment and research of other agricultural product price forecasting models. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Agricultural information system; Agricultural product price forecast; Deep belief network; Internet of Things; Planting benefit","Agricultural products; Agricultural robots; Backpropagation; Costs; Forecasting; Information systems; Information use; Multilayer neural networks; Vegetables; Agricultural information systems; BP neural networks; Deep belief networks; Development prospects; Internet of thing (IOT); Prediction accuracy; Prediction errors; Wavelet neural networks; Internet of things",Article,Scopus

The machine learning-based methods produced greater accuracy than the Jarvis-type model in predicting gs from leaf age, atmospheric [CO2], photosynthetically active radiation, vapour pressure deficit, temperature, time of day, and soil water availability (i.e. phenological and environmental variables determining gs).

Pakistan has its GDP based on agriculture, however it relies on manual monitoring of crops, which is a labour intensive and ineffective method. In contrast to this, several cutting edge technology-based solutions are being employed in the developed countries to enhance the crop yield with the optimal use of resources. To this end, we have proposed an integrated approach for monitoring crop health using IoT, machine learning and drone technology. The integration of these sensing modalities generate heterogeneous data which not only varies in nature (i.e. observed parameter) but also has different temporal fidelity. The spatial resolution of these methods is also different, hence, the optimal integration of these sensing modalities and their implementation in practice are addressed in the proposed system. In our proposed solution, the IoT sensors provide the real-time status of environmental parameters impacting the crop, and the drone platform provide the multispectral data used for generating Vegetation Indices (VIs) such as Normalized Difference vegetation Index (NDVI) for analyzing the crop health. The NDVI provides information about the crop based on the chlorophyll content, which offers limited information regarding the crop health. In order to obtain a rich and detailed knowledge about crop health, the variable length time series data of IoT sensors and multispectral images were converted to a fixed-sized representation to generate crop health maps. A number of machine and deep learning algorithms were applied on the collected data wherein deep neural network with two hidden layers was found to be the most optimal model among all the selected models, providing an accuracy of (98.4%). Further, the health maps were validated through ground surveys and by agriculture experts due to the absence of reference data. The proposed research is basically an indigenous, technology based agriculture solution capable of providing important insights into the crop health by extracting complementary features from multi-modal data set, and minimizing the crop ground survey effort, particularly useful when the agriculture land is large in size. © 2013 IEEE.","crop health; Internet of Things (IoT); NDVI; precision agriculture","Agricultural robots; Crops; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Drones; Health; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Modal analysis; Multilayer neural networks; Remote sensing; Surveys; Vegetation; Chlorophyll contents; Complementary features; Cutting edge technology; Environmental parameter; Internet of Things (IOT); Multi-modal approach; Multispectral images; Normalized difference vegetation index; Internet of things",Article,Scopus

Therefore, alternative options are needed to be developed to mitigate the dangers associated with crop failure due to prevalence of disease and changing weather conditions that causes drought and loss of fertility in arable lands. Furthermore, It is also important to identify commercialisation potential of underutilised crops apart from biophysical and land qualities. The economic and demographic characteristics of an area which is conducive for normal commercial crops can be used to benchmark commercialisation potentials for underutilised crops. Hence, this project aims to assess the commercialisation possibility of underutilised crops on a large scale for under-developed areas with currently no possibility of growing commercial crops probably due to climate, soil characteristics. Support Vector Machine (SVM) method was implemented in conjunction with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and associated fitness functions to generate training data from approximate models which was developed for normal cash crops. The results showed that accurate classifications are obtainable even when the training is done with data from approximate and artificially generated data through implementation of a Genetic algorithm which includes constraints that reflect physical conditions found in rural villages. The simulation results showed that SVM is capable of acting as a filter for the inaccuracy in training data which is inherently present in the approximate models, thus allowing for better classification to be done on training data. This method can be used for rapid assessment of commercialisation potentials of underutilised crops in rural development programmes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Decision making; Economic models; Genetic algorithm; Land potential; Support Vector Machine; Synthetic data; Underutilised crops","Classification (of information); Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Regional planning; Support vector machines; Commercialisation; Demographic characteristics; Economic feasibility assessment; Economic models; Physical conditions; Rural development; Soil characteristics; Synthetic data; Crops; accuracy assessment; agricultural land; climate conditions; commercialization; decision making; disease prevalence; drought stress; economic activity; economic analysis; environmental assessment; feasibility study; genetic algorithm; rural development; support vector machine",Article,Scopus

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the performance of the SWAT model's built-in empirical soil temperature module and a physically-based soil temperature module using four years of daily soil temperature measurements at three depths (i.e., 5, 10, and 50 cm) across 10 monitoring stations in and around the Choptank River Watershed, Maryland, USA. Model performance is assessed according to three coefficients of accuracy, i.e., Bias, Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS), and coefficient of determination (R 2 ). Model performance of SWAT and the modified version of SWAT (i.e., MSWAT; equipped with the physically-based soil temperature module) is also compared in winter and non-winter seasons. Results show that R 2 and NS for different soil depths across 10 stations are all greater than 0.95 and 0.90, respectively, for both SWAT and MSWAT. This indicates that both SWAT and MSWAT reproduce well variations of measured soil temperatures at all soil depths for all stations. The results also show that SWAT and MSWAT tend to underestimate soil temperatures in both winter and non-winter seasons at all soil depths across 10 stations, and MSWAT improves soil temperature simulation by reducing absolute values of Bias, especially at surface soil layers in winter. We found out that a better representation of surface residue is needed in the physically-based soil temperature module for applications in agricultural watersheds of temperature regions.

Alternative and sustainable agricultural practices are important, as they may help minimize the carbon footprint from agriculture. We developed a framework to account for the carbon footprint (C-footprint), i.e., cumulative greenhouse gas generation of various stages in the cultivation of the crop rotation system of corn-soybean-oats. We obtained real-farm data for this analysis from a biological farming and management company (referred to as bio-farming), and benchmarked this footprint against a conventional farm baseline. The analysis included process modeling i.e., the upstream manufacture of fertilizers and crop applications, local mixing and transport of solid fertilizers (in the bio-farming scenario), on-farm fuel use by farm machinery, as well as agricultural modeling of on-farm soil interactions using the soil &amp; water assessment tool (SWAT). Results varied based on individual crops, and showed that bio-farming practices generated a 44% lower C-footprint for corn, 69% lower footprint for soy and 70% lower footprint for oats compared to conventional farming on a kgCO2e/bushel basis. The on-field (N2O) emissions contributed most significantly to the total carbon footprint at 70%, 96%, and 89% of the total emissions in corn, soy and oats, respectively. C-footprint results of all crops showed a high dependence on the yield of the respective crop. Sensitivity analyses showed that the application of lime and lack of cover crop increased C-footprint.

The optimization problem is formulated as a multi-objective one, with the objective function consisting of the end-of-season yield and total irrigation. In order to compute the sub-optimal irrigation schedules, a hybrid formulation is presented, according to which a single irrigation event is optimized for the five subsequent days, while irrigation during the rest of the season is assumed to be triggered at some soil water levels which are determined as part of the optimization. This hybrid formulation minimizes the number of decision variables so that solving the optimization problem requires less than one minute on an i5-3470 PC. Such an efficient procedure can be executed whenever new weather forecasts become available and could be integrated in a web-based decision support system. In order to test the proposed approach we used nine years of climatic data from Northern Greece and a locally-calibrated AquaCrop model for cotton crop. We considered three extreme cases with respect to the weather forecasts: perfect weather forecasts available for the whole season; perfect short-term weather forecasts available daily for the five subsequent days and historical weather data available as forecasts for the rest of the season; and only historical weather available as forecasts. The results show that re-computing the sub-optimal solution minimizes the negative effect of imperfect weather forecasts.

The Alegria River watershed (Basque Country, northern Spain) is an agricultural area dominated by a Quaternary shallow aquifer that has suffered nitrate-related problems since the 1990s. Our objective was to use the SWAT hydrological water quality model for long-term backward simulation (1990–2011) considering main changes in management practices to determine their impact on water quality. Hydrology, crop yield, nitrogen losses and soil nitrogen budgets were simulated satisfactorily. Nitrogen budgets indicated that annual N inputs exceed outputs (which consider main N loss pathways), resulting in mean N surpluses of 114 and 65 kg ha-1 year-1 in the periods 1990–1999 and 2000–2011, respectively. In the long-term, trends in N surplus generally follow those of fertilization input, which directly affect groundwater nitrate concentration. The characteristics of the aquifer and non-point source pollution have enabled us to properly simulate the historical trends in N concentration in the Vitoria-Gasteiz aquifer. Editor Z.W.

Additionally, other procedures such as model calibration, which may require thousands of model iterations, can increase running time and thus further reduce rapid modeling and analysis. Using the widely-applied SWAT as an example, this study demonstrates how to parallelize a serial hydrological model in a Windows® environment using a parallel programing technology-Message Passing Interface (MPI). With a case study, we derived the optimal values for the two parameters (the number of processes and the corresponding percentage of work to be distributed to the master process) of the parallel SWAT (P-SWAT) on an ordinary personal computer and a work station. Our study indicates that model execution time can be reduced by 42%-70% (or a speedup of 1.74-3.36) using multiple processes (two to five) with a proper task-distribution scheme (between the master and slave processes). Although the computation time cost becomes lower with an increasing number of processes (from two to five), this enhancement becomes less due to the accompanied increase in demand for message passing procedures between the master and all slave processes. Our case study demonstrates that the P-SWAT with a five-process run may reach the maximum speedup, and the performance can be quite stable (fairly independent of a project size). Overall, the P-SWAT can help reduce the computation time substantially for an individual model run, manual and automatic calibration procedures, and optimization of best management practices. In particular, the parallelization method we used and the scheme for deriving the optimal parameters in this study can be valuable and easily applied to other hydrological or environmental models. © 2013.","Hydrological model; Message passing; Parallelization; SWAT","Climate models; Hydrology; Personal computers; Automatic calibration; Best management practices; Hydrological modeling; Hydrological models; Message passing interface; Parallelizations; Soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; Message passing; best management practice; calibration; environmental modeling; hydrological modeling; optimization; parameterization; performance assessment; project design; software",Article,Scopus

Model-simulated long-term streamflow, and soybean and corn yields for the watershed were compared with available observed data. The results showed good agreement between simulated and observed values. The average yield predicted by the calibrated SWAT model was 11 Mg ha-1 (from 8 to 13 Mg ha-1) for switchgrass and 34 Mg ha-1 (from 25 to 45 Mg ha-1) for miscanthus. Both switchgrass and miscanthus yields were determined higher in the central part of the YRB than in other areas. The economic analysis estimated the average farm-gate breakeven prices of switchgrass and miscanthus at $111 Mg-1 and $39 Mg-1, respectively. The breakeven prices of both switchgrass and miscanthus were estimated lower in the central regions of the YRB than in the other areas of the watershed due to higher crop yields. Conversely, the breakeven prices of both crops were higher in the northern regions of the watershed due to lower crop yields. This study demonstrated that SWAT-simulated bioenergy crop yields at the watershed scale can be used effectively in watershed-scale economic analysis to determine the farm-gate breakeven price, which may provide useful information to producers and watershed managers who are charged with significant land use decisions. © 2012 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Bioenergy crop; Breakeven price; Crop yield; SWAT; Watershed modeling.","Bio-energy; Break-even prices; Crop yield; SWAT; Watershed modeling; Agriculture; Biofuels; Computer simulation; Costs; Economic analysis; Landforms; Plants (botany); Watersheds; bioenergy; crop yield; data set; economic analysis; energy crop; grass; numerical model; soybean; Mississippi; United States; Yazoo Basin; Glycine max; Miscanthus; Panicum virgatum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Both increased corn growth for ethanol production and perennial dedicated energy crop growth for cellulosic feedstocks are potential sources to meet the rising demand for biofuels. However, these measures may cause adverse environmental consequences that are not yet fully understood. This study 1) evaluates the long-term impacts of increased frequency of corn in the crop rotation system on water quantity and quality as well as soil fertility in the James River Basin and 2) identifies potential grasslands for cultivating bioenergy crops (e.g. switchgrass), estimating the water quality impacts. We selected the soil and water assessment tool, a physically based multidisciplinary model, as the modeling approach to simulate a series of biofuel production scenarios involving crop rotation and land cover changes. The model simulations with different crop rotation scenarios indicate that decreases in water yield and soil nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration along with an increase in NO3-N load to stream water could justify serious concerns regarding increased corn rotations in this basin. Simulations with land cover change scenarios helped us spatially classify the grasslands in terms of biomass productivity and nitrogen loads, and we further derived the relationship of biomass production targets and the resulting nitrogen loads against switchgrass planting acreages. The suggested economically efficient (planting acreage) and environmentally friendly (water quality) planting locations and acreages can be a valuable guide for cultivating switchgrass in this basin.

However, existing models are very complex and require hundreds of variables to perform accurately. Due to these shortcomings, large-scale applications of crop models are limited. In order to address these limitations, reliable crop models were developed using a deep neural network (DNN) – a new approach for predicting crop yields. In addition, the number of required input variables was reduced using three common variable selection techniques: namely Bayesian variable selection, Spearman's rank correlation, and Principal Component Analysis Feature Extraction. The reduced-variable DNN models were capable of estimating future crop yields for 10,000,000 different weather and irrigation scenarios while maintaining comparable accuracy levels to the original model that used all input variables. To establish clear superiority of the methodology, the results were also compared with a very recent feature selection algorithm called min-redundancy max-relevance (mRMR). The results of this study showed that the Bayesian variable selection was the best method for achieving the aforementioned goals. Specifically, the final Bayesian-based DNN model with a structure of 10 neurons in 5 layers performed very similarly (78.6% accuracy) to the original DNN crop model with 400 neurons in 10 layers, even though the size of the neural network was reduced by 80-fold.

They are mainly designed at a specific spatial scale, the field. But with the new spatial data being made available in modern agriculture, they are being more and more applied at multiple and changing scales. These applications range from typically at broader scales, to perform regional or national studies, or at finer scales to develop modern site-specific management approaches. These new approaches to the application of crop models raise new questions concerning the evaluation of their performance, particularly for downscaled applications. This article first reviews the reasons why practitioners decide to spatialize crop models and the main methods they have used to do this, which questions the best place of the spatialization process in the modelling framework. A strong focus is then given to the evaluation of these spatialized crop models. Evaluation metrics, including the consideration of dedicated sensitivity indices are reviewed from the published studies. Using a simple example of a spatialized crop model being used to define management zones in precision viticulture, it is shown that classical model evaluation involving aspatial indices (e.g. the RMSE) is not sufficient to characterize the model performance in this context. A focus is made at the end of the review on potentialities that a complementary evaluation could bring in a precision agriculture context. © 2022, The Author(s).","Crop model uncertainty; Scaling methods; Sensitivity analysis; Spatial pattern; Spatialization","numerical model; precision agriculture; spatial data; viticulture",Review,Scopus

In this study, we distinguished the developmental progression of winter wheat as three phenological periods. In each phenological period, the vegetation indices and meteorological factors were optimized. Then the accuracy and spatiotemporal transferability of the phenological piecewise modelling was compared with that of the whole-season modelling based on four regression methods (i.e. multiple linear regression, artificial neural network, support vector regression and random forest). The results showed that the optimal combinations of variables for the whole-season modelling and the phenological piecewise modelling were different. Compared with the whole-season models, the R2 for the phenological piecewise models improved by 1.4% to 7.6%, the root mean square error (RMSE) decreased by 1.1% to 8.2% among four regression methods . In addition, compared with the whole-season models, the spatiotemporal transferability for the phenological piecewise models was generally better.

These models were also evaluated to model the internal DEF (IDEF) across the northwestern, southeastern, northern, and western regions around the wetland. Furthermore, the main factors controlling DEF and IDEF were identified based on the importance value (IV) of predictors in the best model. The results showed that the ERT model increased the prediction accuracies by an average of 40%, compared to the MARS model. According to the IV obtained from the ERT model, aerosol optical depth (IV = 0.28), wetland discharge (IV = 0.25), near-surface wind speed (IV = 0.08), and erosive winds frequency (IV = 0.07) were identified as the most important factors controlling DEF across the northeastern and southwestern regions of the wetland. However, the erosive wind speed was detected as the major factor affecting the IDEF in the northern (IV = 0.16), western (IV = 0.18), and southeastern (IV = 0.65) regions of study wetland. It was also found that vapor pressure with IV of 0.32 had the greatest effect on IDEF variations across the northwestern region of the wetland.

Cultivated in most of the world, cotton is one of the economically most important agricultural crops. Its cultivation in tropical regions has made it the target of a wide spectrum of agricultural pests and diseases, and efficient solutions are required. Moreover, the symptoms of the main pests and diseases cannot be differentiated in the initial stages, and the correct identification of a lesion can be difficult for the producer. To help resolve the problem, the present research provides a solution based on deep learning in the screening of cotton leaves which makes it possible to monitor the health of the cotton crop and make better decisions for its management. With the learning models GoogleNet and Resnet50 using convolutional neural networks, a precision of 86.6% and 89.2%, respectively, was obtained.

This is critical as population, food demand, and background tropospheric ozone are projected to increase over the next several decades. Visual scores of common ozone damage have been used to identify ozone-stress in bio-indicator plants. This paper evaluates the use of a visual scoring metric of ozone damage applied to soybeans. The scoring of the leaves is then combinedwith hyperspectral data to identify spectral indices specific to ozone damage. Two genotypes of soybean, Dwight and Pana, that have shown different sensitivities to ozone, were grown and visually scored for ozone-specific damage on multiple dates throughout the growing season. Leaf reflectance, foliar biophysical properties, and yield data were collected. Additionally, ozone bio-indicator plants, snap beans, and common milkweed, were investigated with visual scores and hyperspectral leaf data for comparison. The normalized difference spectral index (NDSI) was used to identify the significant bands in the visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR) that best correlated with visual damage score when used in the index. Results were then compared to multiple well-established indices. Indices were also evaluated for correlation with seed and pod weight. The ozone damage scoring metric for soybeans evaluated in August had a coefficient of determination of 0.60 with end-of-season pod weight and a Pearson correlation coefficient greater than 0.6 for photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration. NDSI [R558, R563] correlated best with visual scores of ozone damage in soybeans when evaluating data from all observation dates. These wavelengths were similar to those identified as most sensitive to visual damage in August when used in NDSI (560 nm, 563 nm). NDSI [R560, R563] in August had the highest coefficient of determination for individual pod weight (R2 = 0.64) and seed weight (R2 = 0.54) when compared against 21 well-established indices used for identification of pigment or photosynthetic stress in plants. When evaluating use of spectral bands in NDSI, longer wavelengths in SWIR were identified as more sensitive to ozone visual damage. Trends in the bands and biophysical properties of the soybeans combined with evaluation of ozone data indicate likely timing of significant ozone damage as after late-July for this season. This work has implications for better spectral detection of ozone stress in crops and could help with efforts to identify ozone tolerant varieties to increase future yield. © 2019 by the authors.","Ambient ozone; Hyperspectral data; Soybean; Visual damage scoring","Correlation methods; Crops; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Plants (botany); Seed; Ambient ozones; Biophysical properties; Coefficient of determination; Hyperspectral Data; Normalized differences; Pearson correlation coefficients; Soybean; Visual damage scoring; Ozone",Article,Scopus

The Nile delta provides two thirds of Egypt's agriculture land, but is threatened by urban sprawl. The paper aims to quantify urban expansion over a 45 year period using 6 time points from 1972 to 2017, and its impacts on agricultural potential, soil organic carbon stocks, and implications for water use. The study used multi-temporal satellite data and remote sensing techniques (Maximum Likelihood supervised classification, and NDVI), soil sampling and analysis, data on water irrigation, and agroecological system and ecosystem services model (MicroLEIS, InVEST) to assess the effects of land use change. Urban area increased by a factor of 5, from 452 km2 in 1972 to 2644 km2 in 2017. The greatest losses occurred to the fertile Vertic Torrifluvent soils on the older delta, which lost 1734 km2. Soil organic carbon (0–75 cm depth) lost as a result of soil sealing from urbanisation rose from 25,000 to 141,000 Mg C over the 45 years. As a result of increased pressure on delta land, agriculture expanded into the higher desert areas outside the delta, on marginal land sustained by intensive fertiliser use and irrigation, which in turn puts pressure on water use. Therefore, rapid urban expansion has resulted in a loss of soil carbon and a shift in agriculture from fertile soils to marginal soils, requiring more capital inputs, which is ultimately less sustainable. Modelling suggested that soil management improvement could make better use of fertile soils within the Delta currently affected by high salinity and poor drainage. Future planning should encourage urban expansion on the less fertile soils outside of the delta, while improving suitability of existing agricultural land and minimising land degradation within the delta. © 2019","InVEST ecosystem services model; NDVI; Soil organic carbon; Urban sprawl; Water use","organic carbon; water; carbon; agricultural land; agroecology; fertilizer application; irrigation system; land degradation; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil fertility; urban sprawl; urbanization; water use; agricultural land; Article; controlled study; cultivated land; ecosystem; environmental impact; environmental parameters; fluid intake; normalized difference vegetation index; remote sensing; rural area; salinity; soil depth; soil fertility; soil management; soil quality; spatiotemporal analysis; stock assessment; urban area; urbanization; agriculture; Egypt; soil; Egypt; Nile Delta; Agriculture; Carbon; Ecosystem; Egypt; Soil; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

Abstract: Predicting phenotypes from genetic (G), environmental (E), and management (M) conditions is a long-standing challenge with implications to agriculture, medicine, and conservation. Most methods reduce the factors in a dataset (feature engineering) in a subjective and potentially oversimplified manner. Deep neural networks such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MPL) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can overcome this by allowing the data itself to determine which factors are most important. CNN models were developed for predicting agronomic yield from a combination of replicated trials and historical yield survey data. The results were more accurate than standard methods when tested on held-out G, E, and M data (r = 0.50 vs. r = 0.43), and performed slightly worse than standard methods when only G was held out (r = 0.74 vs. r = 0.80). Pre-training on historical data increased accuracy compared to trial data alone. Saliency map analysis indicated the CNN has “learned” to prioritize many factors of known agricultural importance. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",,"Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Environmental management; Forecasting; Agronomic yields; Feature engineerings; Genomic predictions; Historical data; Management data; Pre-training; Saliency map; Survey data; Multilayer neural networks; crop; data mining; genetics; genomics; growth, development and aging; machine learning; maize; phenotype; procedures; Crops, Agricultural; Data Mining; Genomics; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Phenotype; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Appropriate selection of traits and novel methods are required to forecast yield and to identify water stress tolerant wheat genotypes on sodic soils. In this study, we proposed a thermal remote sensing and machine learning-based approach to help predict the biomass and grain yields of wheat genotypes grown with variable water stress in sodic soil environments. We employed unmanned aerial vehicle-based thermal imaging to quantify water stress of 18 contrasting wheat genotypes grown on moderately sodic (MS) and highly sodic (HS) soils in north-eastern grains growing regions of Australia and related these to ground-measured plant biomass and grain yields. We evaluated crop water stress indices; standardized canopy temperature index, crop water stress index, stomatal conductance index, vapour pressure deficit, and crop stress index, which were computed from thermal imagery and on-site agro-meteorological parameters close to flowering. We then employed a classification and regression tree (CRT) as a supervised machine learning algorithm to classify crop water stress and predict biomass and grain yields as a function of crop water stress indices. The CRT accurately predicted biomass yield (coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.86; root mean square error (RMSE) = 41.3 g/m2 and R2 = 0.75; RMSE = 47.7 g/m2 for the MS and HS site) and grain yield (R2 = 0.78; RMSE = 16.7 g/m2 and R2 = 0.69; RMSE = 23.2 g/m2 for the MS and HS site, respectively).

Hence, the estimation of within-field variability of GY is pivotal for the agricultural management, especially in the current global change context. In this sense, Earth Observation Systems (EOS) are key technologies that use satellite data to monitor crop yield, which can guide the application of precision farming. Yet, novel research is required to improve the multiplatform integration of data, including data processing, and the application of this discipline in agricultural management. This article provides a novel methodological analysis and assessment of its applications in precision farming. It presents an integration of wheat GY, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), combine harvester data, and EOS Sentinel-2 multispectral bands. Moreover, it compares several indices and machine learning (ML) approaches to map within-field wheat GY. It also analyses the importance of multi-date remote sensing imagery and explores its potential applications in precision agriculture. The study was conducted in Spain, a major European wheat producer. Within-field GY data was obtained from a GPS combine harvester machine for 8 fields over three seasons (2017–2019) and consecutively processed to match Sentinel-2 10 m pixel size. Seven vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, EVI, RVI, TGI, CVI and NGRDI) as well as the biophysical parameter LAI (leaf area index) retrieved with radiative transfer models (RTM) were calculated from Sentinel-2 bands. Sentinel-2 10 m resolution bands alone were also used as variables. Random forest, support vector machine and boosted regressions were used as modelling approaches, and multilinear regression was calculated as baseline. Different combinations of dates of measurement were tested to find the most suitable model feeding data. LAI retrieved from RTM had a slightly improved performance in estimating within-field GY in comparison with vegetation indices or Sentinel-2 bands alone. At validation, the use of multi-date Sentinel-2 data was found to be the most suitable in comparison with single date images. Thus, the model developed with random forest regression (e.g. R2 = 0.89, and RSME = 0.74 t/ha when using LAI) outperformed support vector machine (R2 = 0.84 and RSME = 0.92 t/ha), boosting regression (R2 = 0.85 and RSME = 0.88 t/ha) and multilinear regression (R2 = 0.69 and RSME = 1.29 t/ha). However, single date images at specific phenological stages (e.g. R2 = 0.84, and RSME = 0.88 t/ha using random forest at stem elongation) also posed relatively high R2 and low RMSE, with potential for precision farming management before harvest. © 2022 The Author(s)","Grain yield; Machine learning; Precision farming; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Wheat","agricultural production; crop production; crop yield; estimation method; precision agriculture; remote sensing; Sentinel; wheat",Article,Scopus

This study was conducted in a 11.07 ha area under Mediterranean climate in Northern Italy to evaluate the spatial variability and the relationships between six remotely sensed vegetation indices (VIs) and grain yield (GY) in five consecutive years. A total of 25 satellite (Landsat 5, 7, and 8) images were downloaded during crop growth to obtain the following VIs: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), EnhancedVegetation Index (EVI), Soil AdjustedVegetation Index (SAVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Green Chlorophyll Index (GCI), and Simple Ratio (SR). The surveyed crops were durum wheat in 2010, sunflower in 2011, bread wheat in 2012 and 2014, and coriander in 2013. Geo-referenced GY and VI data were used to generate spatial trend maps across the experimental field through geostatistical analysis. Crop stages featuring the best correlations between VIs and GY at the same spatial resolution (30 m) were acknowledged as the best periods for GY prediction. Based on this, 2-4 VIs were selected each year, totalling 15 VIs in the five years with r values with GY between 0.729** and 0.935**. SR and NDVI were most frequently chosen (six and four times, respectively) across stages from mid vegetative to mid reproductive growth. Conversely, SAVI never had correlations high enough to be selected. Correspondence analysis between remote VIs and GY based on quantile ranking in the 126 (30 m size) pixels exhibited a final agreement between 64% and 86%. Therefore, Landsat imagery with its spatial and temporal resolution proved a good potential for estimating final GY over different crops in a rotation, at a relatively small field scale. © 2019 by the authors.","Crop rotation; Field spatial variability; Geostatistics; Grain yield prediction; Landsat imagery; Spectral vegetation indices","Grain (agricultural product); Image enhancement; Vegetation; Crop rotation; Geo-statistics; Grain yield; Landsat imagery; Spatial variability; Spectral vegetation indices; Crops",Article,Scopus

Although many remote sensing approaches have been developed to estimate maize yields, few have been tested under lodging conditions. Thus, the feasibility of existing approaches under lodging conditions and the influence of lodging on maize yield estimates both remain unclear. To address this situation, this study develops a lodging index to quantify the degree of lodging. The index is based on RGB and multispectral images obtained from a low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle and proves to be an important predictor variable in a random forest regression (RFR) model for accurately estimating maize yield after lodging. The results show that (1) the lodging index accurately describes the degree of lodging of each maize plot, (2) the yield-estimation model that incorporates the lodging index provides slightly more accurate yield estimates than without the lodging index at three important growth stages of maize (tasseling, milking, denting), and (3) the RFR model with lodging index applied at the denting (R5) stage yields the best performance of the three growth stages, with R2 = 0.859, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1086.412 kg/ha, and a relative RMSE of 13.1%. This study thus provides valuable insight into the precise estimation of crop yield and demonstra\tes that incorporating a lodging stress-related variable into the model leads to accurate and robust estimates of crop grain yield.

A review is performed to investigate and analyze the past 12 years (from 2010 to 2021) of research work regarding orchard yield prediction and estimation. According to our investigation, the most widely used input features in yield prediction systems are various vegetation indices information of plants, while machine learning is the most modeling method applied. In addition, machine vision systems based on image processing and deep learning have been developed rapidly in the field of agriculture and is also widely applied in orchard yield prediction. Finally, major challenges and countermeasures for orchard yield prediction and estimation are discussed. Complicated natural environments with inconsistent horticultural management practices are still critical challenges for large scale commercialization of researched yield prediction methods. Therefore, combination of engineering technology optimization and standardization of agronomic management practices are necessary to realize automatic operation in complex agricultural fields.

Therefore, having a good fruit yield forecast with anticipation allows making timely correct decisions for providing the resources, transport, and cold storage contracts, among others. Therefore, fruit yield over or underestimation could cause important inefficiencies with regards to FSC. Because of its relevance, a method based on machine learning (ML) techniques that uses spectrometric vegetation data is proposed. This method, known as Spectrometry Based Method for Fruit Production Forecast (SBM-Fruit), allows exploring the georeferenced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), collected in different phenological stages, aiming to capture spatial and temporal dependency in the fruit yield forecast. In the first step of SBM-Fruit, several clusters are obtained in a clustering process using the georeferenced NDVI in all phenological stages as input, while, in the second step, two validation functions are used for determining the best clustering. Finally, in the third step, the predictor variables of the best clustering are incorporated into an artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting the fruit yield. The SBM-Fruit was applied to forecast table grape yield of an orchard located in the Valparaíso Region, Chile. The results show fruit yield estimations with mean errors around 0.013 percent for every spatial zone of the orchard, forecasted at least two months in advance. The use of the SBM-Fruit would allow FSC stakeholders to make better decisions, improving the coordination of the FSC stages, and reducing costs and fruit losses. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial neural network; Fruit yield forecast; Machine learning; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; Spatial Fuzzy c-Means algorithm","algorithm; artificial neural network; fruit; NDVI; orchard; phenology; vegetation type; Chile",Article,Scopus

However, it is quite difficult to build such systems owing to the lack of data imbalance problems and large number of classes. To solve these issues, we propose a transfer learning-based technique in which we use Efficient-Net, which is pre-trained on ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on QuT Fish Database, which is a large scale dataset. Furthermore, prior to the activation layer, we use Global Average Pooling (GAP) instead of dense layer with the aim of averaging the results of predictions along with having more information compared to the dense layer. To check the validity of our model, we validate our model on the validation set which achieves satisfactory results. Also, for the localization task, we propose an architecture that consists of localization aware block, which captures localization information for better prediction and residual connections to handle the over-fitting problem. Actually, the residual connections help the layer to combine missing information with the relevant one. In addition, we use class weights and Focal Loss (FL) to handle class imbalance problems along with reducing false predictions. Actually, class weights assign less weights to classes having fewer instances and large weights to classes having more number of instances.

First, the features were retrieved using the Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2, and Landsat-8 imagery. Then, training data and various feature selection algorithms including recursive feature elimination (RFE), random forest (RF), and Boruta were used for optimal feature selection. Various classifiers, including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and RF, were implemented to create maps of land crops relying on optimal features and training data.

The APSIM Eucalyptus and Pinus models simulated plantation growth within 2% of observed growth where the water table was at 4 m depth for eucalypts (height 28 m, MAI 32 m3 ha−1 year−1) and at 23 m for pines (height 37 m, MAI 20 m3 ha−1 year−1).

Simulated aquifer N concentrations, evapotranspiration, and net N mineralization and leaching (emergent properties of modelling) were similar to measured values. These results strengthen the plausibility that aquifer N uptake by plantations could be contributing to tree growth.

Therefore, the Dubai Emirate began relying on new technology to increase productivity and efficiency. Agriculture applications also depend on accurate land monitoring for timely food security control and support actions. However, traditional monitoring requires field surveys to be performed by experts, which is costly, slow, and rare. Agriculture monitoring systems must be furnished with sustainable land use monitoring solutions, starting with remote sensing using drone surveys for affordable, efficient, and time-sensitive agriculture mapping. Hence, the Dubai Municipality is currently using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to map the farming areas all over the Emirate, support locating lands conducive to cultivation, and create an accurate agriculture database contributing to the decision-making process in determining areas suitable for crop growth. This study used a novel object detection method coupled with geospatial analysis as an integrated workflow to detect individual crops. The UAV flights were executed using a Trimble UX5 (HP) over twelve communities across the Dubai Emirate for six months. Detection methods were applied to high-resolution drone images, consisting of RGB and near-infrared (NIR) bands. Advanced geoprocessing tools were also used to analyze, evaluate, and enhance the results. The performance of detection of the selected deep learning models are discussed (vegetation cover accuracy = 85.4%, F1-scores for date palms and ghaf trees = 96.03% and 94.54% respectively, with respect to visual interpretation ground truth); moreover, sample images from the datasets are used for demonstrations. The main aim is to offer specialists a solution for measuring and assessing living green vegetation cover derived from the processed images that is integrated. The results provide insight into using UAS and deep learning algorithms as a solution for sustainable agricultural mapping on a large scale. © 2021 The Author(s)","Agriculture mapping; Deep learning; Drone mapping; GIS; Multispectral images; Precision agriculture; UAS; UAV",,Article,Scopus

An artificial neural network analyst model was advanced based on the information from the well-tested model HYDRUS-2D/3D. Artificial neural network knowledge is reported as an intermittent to physical-based modeling of subsurface water distribution from trickle emitters. Three options are prospected to create input-output functional relations from information created using a numerical model (HYDRUS-2D). Artificial neural networks are a tool for modeling of non-linear systems in various engineering fields. These networks are effective tools for modeling non-linear systems. Each artificial neural network includes an input layer and an output layer between which there are one or some hidden layers. In each layer, there are one or several processing elements or neurons. The neurons of the input layer are independent variables of the understudy issue and the neurons of the output layer are its dependent variables. An artificial neural system, through exerting weight on inputs and by using an activation function, attempts to achieve a desirable output. In this research, in order to calculate the drain spacing in an unsteady state in a region situated in the northeast of Ahwaz, Iran, with different soil properties and drain spacing, the artificial neural networks have been used. The neurons in the input layer were specific yield, hydraulic conductivity, depth of the impermeable layer, and height of the water table in the middle of the interval between the drains in two-time steps. The neurons in the output layer were drain spacing. The network designed in this research included a hidden layer with four neurons. The distance of drains computed via this method had a good agreement with real values and had a high precision in comparison with other methods. This was done for three types of linear activation functions and hyperbolic and sigmoid tangents.

Forecasts are generated in January, for the coming harvest in March–September. A linear model using ridge regularized regression produced consistently good predictions compared with other machine learning algorithms including lasso, support vector regression and random forest. Adding meteorological variables offered little improvement over using only remote sensing variables. The 2019 forecast root mean square error at the block level was 0.8 t/ha, and mean absolute percentage error was 20.9%. When block level predictions were aggregated across the multiple orchards per region, production prediction errors were between 0–15% from 2016–2019.

To accomplish this goal, numerous areas are required for Napier grass plantations. Before introducing crops, the land potential of the country and the impact of crops on the environment should be assessed. The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model is very useful in investigating crop impacts and land potential. Unfortunately, the crop growth parameters of Napier grass are yet to be identified and, thus, conducting effective analysis has not been possible. Accordingly, in this study, parameter calibration and SWAT model validation of Napier grass production in Thailand was carried out using datasets from eight sites with 93 samples. Parameter sensitivity analysis was performed prior to parameter calibration, the results of which suggest that the radiation use efficiency and potential harvested index are both highly sensitive. The crop growth parameters were calibrated in order of their sensitivity index ranking, and the final values were obtained by reducing the root mean square error from 10.77 to 1.38 t·ha−1 . The validation provides satisfactory results with coefficient of determination of 0.951 and a mean error of 0.321 t·ha−1 . Using the developed model and calibrated parameters, local Napier grass dry matter yield can be evaluated accurately. The results reveal that, if only abandoned area in Thailand is used, then Napier grass can provide roughly 33,600–44,900 GWh of annual electricity, and power plant carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions can be reduced by approximately 21.2–28.3 Mt-CO2 . The spatial distribution of estimated yield obtained in this work can be further utilized for land suitability analysis to help identify locations for Napier grass plantations, anaerobic digesters, and biogas power plants. © 2021 by the authors.

The study area is located in the Little Hungarian Plain, including the former swamp basins of Hanság and Tóköz in Hungary. The vegetation survey data were evaluated by statistical methods (TWINSPAN method), and vegetation maps of the areas were prepared. Topsoil samples near the relevés were gathered for further laboratory tests. Soil profiles were opened by a Pürckhauer soil sampler for on-site description of the soil horizons and classification. Surface models provided a base for the preparation of contour maps that could be compared with the vegetation pattern. We found that of the two dominant vegetation types, mesotrophic wet meadows were associated with Mollic Gleysols, while non-tussock sedge beds were associated with Histic Gleysols. At the transitions of the two soil classes, the subgroup of non-tussock sedge beds is the dominant type. The soil class only determined the plant association on a habitat level, but it could not reason the fine pattern of the plant communities on the same soil class. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed to investigate the relationship between the distribution of dominant species and soil parameters. Several soil parameters combined have a significant effect on the distribution of dominant species. In conclusion, we found that the formation of association types strongly depends on the soil characteristics of the area, and that it is closely related to it. However, in the formation of the fine mosaic pattern, the driving ecological factors are the microrelief and the length of the saturated or flooded soil conditions. © 2021 Sciendo.

Seasonal forecasting in the grainbelt of Western Australia (WA) is difficult because climate drivers that affect the Australian continent have little influence on the south-west corner. The Statistical Seasonal Forecast system was developed to provide skilful forecasts to assist on-farm decision making in the south-west of WA. It has now been operational from 2013 to 2018. This article describes the models and methods used to create forecasts, the results of forecast validation, and verification of the accuracy of six years of operational seasonal forecasts. Forecast validation was performed using leave-one-out cross-validation. It showed positive skill, lower for late spring and summer forecasts that rises in autumn and is highest for forecasting winter rainfall. Skill for forecasting growing season (May to October) is good for lead times of up to three months. Verified skill of the operational forecasts is lower than estimated using cross-validation. The operational system performed reasonably well at forecasting 3-month periods, and for most years it showed better skill than climatology. Verified skill for growing season forecasts is higher than that of forecasting any 3-month period, with higher skill in the south. With only a small sample of six years of forecasts, longer-term accuracy may be better or worse. To test whether declining accuracy is a risk, use of a less generous measure of forecast validation is recommended. © 2019","Forecast accuracy; Forecast validation; Forecast verification; Partial least squares regression; Seasonal rainfall; South-West Western Australia; Statistical seasonal forecast","Decision making; Least squares approximations; Rain; Risk assessment; Statistical methods; Forecast accuracy; Forecast verifications; Partial least squares regression; Seasonal forecasts; Seasonal rainfall; Western Australia; Forecasting; accuracy assessment; agricultural application; climatology; least squares method; rainfall; seasonal variation; statistical analysis; weather forecasting; Australia; Western Australia",Article,Scopus

Optimal solutions tended to prioritize conversion of land in eastern AWR subbasins where yield and water quality objective improvements were greatest. A small number of subbasins contributed to basin-wide water quality improvements, whereas subbasins contributing to economic benefits were more spatially dispersed, indicating that water quality responses are more likely to constrain feedstock placement.

We evaluated the applicability of combining RapidEye satellite imagery-derived vegetation indices with topographic variables derived from high-resolution data obtained from proximal sensors to estimate winter wheat yield, protein content, and Ng. Results indicate that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference red edge index (NDRE), terrain curvature, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index, and solar radiation are the most relevant co-variables that contribute to spatial variability of yield and Ng.

To provide spatially distributed rainfall data, point measurements are interpolated. However, in low density measurement networks, the use of different interpolation methods may result in large differences and hence in deviations from the actual spatial distribution of rainfall. Our study aims at analyzing different rainfall interpolation schemes with regard to their suitability to produce spatial rainfall estimates in a monsoon dominated region with scarce rainfall measurements. The study was carried out in the meso-scale catchment of the Mula and the Mutha Rivers (2036km 2) upstream of the city of Pune, India. Rainfall data from 16 rain gauges were spatially interpolated using seven different methods, including Thiessen polygons, statistical, and geostatistical approaches. The two most suitable covariates for rainfall interpolation were identified as (i) distance in wind direction from the main orographic barrier and as (ii) a 0.05° pattern of mean annual rainfall derived from satellite data acquired by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Consequently, these two covariates were used in the regression-based interpolation approaches. The quality of the different methods was assessed using a two step validation approach: (i) Cross-validation was used to evaluate the capability to reproduce measured data. (ii) Spatially integrated interpolation performance was assessed by using a hydrologic model to calculate runoff and compare modeled to measured runoff. By this assessment, the regression-based methods showed the best performance. We found that the choice of the covariate had a significant impact on precipitation and runoff amounts, as well as on the temporal course of runoff events. Our results show, that the decision on the suitable interpolation scheme should not only be based on the comparison with point measurements, but should also take the representativeness of the given measurement network as well as of the interpolated spatial rainfall distribution into account. The successful application of regression-based interpolation methods using a high resolution TRMM pattern as covariate is very promising as it is transferable to other data scarce regions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","India; Interpolation; Kriging; Rainfall; SWAT; TRMM","Annual rainfall; Covariates; Cross validation; Daily rainfall; Environmental applications; Geostatistical approach; High resolution; Hydrologic models; India; Interpolation method; Interpolation schemes; Kriging; Mesoscale; Orographic barriers; Point measurement; Precipitation and runoff; Rain gauges; Rainfall data; Rainfall interpolation; Rainfall measurements; Satellite data; Significant impacts; Spatial interpolation; Spatial rainfall; SWAT; TRMM; Tropical rainfall measuring missions; Validation approach; Wind directions; Catchments; Interpolation; Quality control; Rain gages; Regression analysis; Runoff; Spatial distribution; Rain; comparative study; data set; interpolation; kriging; rainfall; rainfall-runoff modeling; raingauge; regression analysis; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; TRMM; India; Maharashtra; Mula Basin; Mutha Basin; Pune",Article,Scopus

Like many Mediterranean areas, this basin is characterized by water shortages and diffuse pollution from agricultural sources. Hence the objective of this study was to develop possible land use and land management scenarios that could constitute an alternative to the current watershed management. Several land use and land management scenarios were formulated and analyzed with local stakeholders, and two were selected and simulated as realistic in consideration of the socio-economical aspects of the study area. Scenario 1 involves agricultural practices that include a reduction in fertilizer use to meet the Water Framework Directive requirements for "" good"" status of water bodies. Scenario 2 introduces rapeseed cultivation, replacing durum wheat in a small area, to investigate the impact of biofuel plant cultivation on water quality. Each option was assessed by considering the effects on water quality, crop yields and economic benefits. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was applied to simulate hydrological processes and evaluate current and future nutrient loads. This model requires adequate streamflow data for calibration and validation. However, as is the case for many Mediterranean basins, insufficient data were available. Therefore, a methodology was developed and tested to calibrate hydrological processes based on the transposition of a parameter set from a gauged catchment located in the same region. This study suggests that a sound use of fertilizers could substantially reduce the amount of nutrients flowing into surface waters, although the effects of such a policy on crop yield and farm income would be negative in some cases. Moreover, the results clearly predict that the replacement of durum wheat with rapeseed (a biofuel crop), could offer a margin of profit, but would have a negative impact on water quality due to increased nutrient losses. Consequently, this option is unsuitable for this area. Furthermore, it can be inferred from these results that the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources may have a negative impact on the objectives of the EU Water Framework Directive. Clearly, this process needs to be regulated, taking into account environmental and socio-economical aspects. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Biofuel crops; Land use scenarios; SWAT model; Ungauged basin; Water quality","biofuel; land management; land use; numerical model; socioeconomic status; stakeholder; streamflow; water management; water quality; watershed; Italy; Sardinia; Brassica napus; Triticum aestivum; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum",Article,Scopus

Taking a case of a multifunctional landscape in the central HKH region, we aimed to assess the biophysical production possibilities of major ES, their relationships and co-occurrence, and dynamic interactions at different spatial scales. We quantified and mapped six major ES (crop production, timber production, carbon sequestration, soil conservation, water yield, and habitat quality) at two spatial scales: landscape level (functional unit) and watershed level (management unit). Further, we analysed the relationship and interactions among all the possible pairs of the considered ES. All six ES were found to have a positive correlation, except crop production which showed a significant negative correlation with soil conservation. Moreover, we delineated 186 watersheds in the landscape and clustered them based on their biophysical potentials for the supply of ES. Gap statistics from K-means clustering identified three main clusters of watersheds (i.e., agriculture-dominated, poor-performing uplands, and multifunctional). The supply of ES from downstream watersheds was substantially higher than that of the upstream watersheds. We then discussed the interrelationships among ES at various spatial scales and suggested policy instruments for ecosystem management. The relationship among ES shows dynamic forms of spatial distribution, which need to be sustainably managed for minimizing trade-offs and maximizing synergies through the consideration of an integrated watershed management approach, improved agronomy practices, and global climate actions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Co-occurrence; Mapping and quantification; Multifunctional watersheds, mountain landscapes; Trade-offs in ecosystem services",,Article,Scopus

This article presents the hydrological modeling of the Mahanadi catchment up to Hirakud, located in the states of Chhattisgarh and Odisha in India, using the modified version of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with an interface of ArcView Geographic Information System software to predict soil erosion and sediment transport to the reservoir for improving its useful life. The data sources used in the study were: terrain data 90 m resolution of Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, Land Use and Land Cover derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, soil map published by National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning, India and meteorological data collected from India Meteorological Department, India. The study involves the analysis of sensitive parameters of the simulated data (discharge 15, sediment load 6); 5-year calibration and 3-year validation on daily basis to predict the discharge and sediment load. The sensitivity analysis was carried out using the Latin Hypercube and One-factor-At-a-Time. The results also show that the prediction of sediment yield is highly sensitive to the sizes of different sub-basins due to the sensitivity of topographic factors used in the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation. The graphical as well as statistical results achieved in this study indicate that the model is capable to identify critical erosion-prone areas within the watershed on the scale of sub-watershed which helps the hydrologists to introduce effective management practices at the lowest cost. The study shows that about 34% area of total catchment falls under high or above soil erosion zones with combination of coarse loamy type of soil and agricultural type of land use and land cover condition. The results of this study also identify regions of high sediment yield and sediment delivery ratio. To enhance the SWAT model performance, it is recommended to use sub-daily data and to prioritize soil erosion at the Hydrological Response Units level for improvement of watershed management. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Erosion; Hirakud reservoir; Prioritization; Sediment delivery ratio; Sediment yield; SWAT","Agricultural robots; Catchments; Digital storage; Erosion; Forecasting; Interface states; Land use; Meteorology; Reservoirs (water); Runoff; Sediment transport; Sensitivity analysis; Soil conservation; Soil surveys; Topography; Water conservation; Water management; Watersheds; Enhanced thematic mappers; Geographic information system software; Hydrological response unit; Modified universal soil loss equations; Reservoir storage capacity; Sediment delivery ratio; Shuttle radar topography mission; Soil and water assessment tool; Soils; modeling; prioritization; sediment transport; sediment yield; software; soil and water assessment tool; soil erosion; topography; Hirakud Reservoir; India; Odisha",Article,Scopus

To capture unknown and complex dependencies from multiple spatiotemporal factors, i.e., autocorrelated, meteorological causal, meteorological spatial factors, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal feature extraction and fusion network inspired by humans’ multi-level cognition process, namely, SFEF-Net, including the data pre-processing stage, transfer pre-training stage, spatiotemporal feature extraction stage, and spatiotemporal feature fusion stage. Specifically, inspired by humans’ empirical analysis, the 24 Solar Terms knowledge and Pearson correlation coefficient analysis are utilized to respectively select input timestamps and influencing factors in the first stage. Inspired by humans’ associative learning, a Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) layer with powerful remember capability is trained via weather data from multiple neighbored monitoring stations in the second stage, and further is transferred for better feature extraction. Inspired by humans’ independent analysis, every factor is separately captured and analyzed via the pre-trained LSTM layer in the third stage, which also coincides with the philosophical idea of divide and conquer. Inspired by humans’ comprehensive consideration, extracted features are fused level by level via the attention mechanism with dynamic weights in the fourth stage, which avoids invalid dependencies between multiple features and overfitting. The real-world daily average air temperature forecasting in Shaanxi Province, China is taken to demonstrate the SFEF-Net beyond 12 baseline methods. Additionally, forecasts of drastic change period, ablation analysis, multiple steps, and different stations further present the effectiveness of the SFEF-Net. © 2022","Attention mechanism; Deep learning; Multi-level cognition process; Spatiotemporal systems; Weather forecast","Correlation methods; Decision making; Extraction; Factor analysis; Long short-term memory; Weather forecasting; Attention mechanisms; Deep learning; Features extraction; Features fusions; Memory network; Multi-level cognition process; Multilevels; Spatio-temporal system; Spatiotemporal feature; Weather forecast; Feature extraction",Article,Scopus

Image preprocessing stage - applying an integrated excess green and excess red difference (ExGR) index. The classification stage is the application of the method that we choose depending on the system's operating conditions. At the final stage, a neural network trained using the Resilient Propagation method is used, which determines the rate of watering of plants in the current sector of the location of the sprinkler.

In this study, artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF) and classic linear multiple regression (MLR) analyses were applied and compared to forecast the BPH population using weather and host-plant phenology factors during the crop dry season from 2006 to 2016 in the central plain of Thailand. Data from satellite earth observation was used to monitor crop phenology factors affecting BPH population density. An ANN model with integrated ground-based meteorological variables and satellitederived host plant variables was more accurate for short-term forecasting of the peak abundance of BPH when compared with RF and MLR, according to a reasonably validating dataset (RMSE of natural log-transformed (ln) BPH light trap catches = 1.686, 1.737, and 2.015, respectively). This finding indicates that the utilization of ground meteorological observations, satellite-derived NDVI time series, and ANN have the potential to predict BPH population density in support of integrated pest management programs.

Application of pollution fate and transport models in semi-arid regions has been challenging because of unique hydrological characteristics and limited data availability. Significant temporal and spatial variability in rainfall events, complex interactions between soil, vegetation and topography, and limited water quality and hydrological data due to insufficient monitoring network make it a difficult task to develop reliable models in semi-arid regions. The performances of these models govern the final use of the outcomes such as policy implementation, screening, economical analysis, etc. In this study, a deterministic distributed fate and transport model, SWAT, is applied in Lake Mogan Watershed, a semi-arid region dominated by dry agricultural practices, to estimate nutrient loads and to develop the water budget of the watershed. To minimize the discrepancy due to limited availability of historical water quality data extensive efforts were placed in collecting site-specific data for model inputs such as soil properties, agricultural practice information and land use. Moreover, calibration parameter ranges suggested in the literature are utilized during calibration in order to obtain more realistic representation of Lake Mogan Watershed in the model. Model performance is evaluated using comparisons of the measured data with 95%CI for the simulated data and comparison of unit pollution load estimations with those provided in the literature for similar catchments, in addition to commonly used evaluation criteria such as Nash-Sutcliffe simulation efficiency, coefficient of determination and percent bias. These evaluations demonstrated that even though the model prediction power is not high according to the commonly used model performance criteria, the calibrated model may provide useful information in the comparison of the effects of different management practices on diffuse pollution and water quality in Lake Mogan Watershed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Diffuse pollution; Lake Mogan; Modelling; Nutrients; Semi-arid; SWAT","Agriculture; Arid regions; Budget control; Catchments; Lakes; Land use; Models; Nutrients; Pollution; Quality control; Water pollution; Water quality; Watersheds; Coefficient of determination; Diffuse pollution; Fate and transport modeling; Hydrological characteristics; Semi arid; Sustainable management; SWAT; Temporal and spatial variability; Lake pollution; ground water; nitrogen; phosphorus; surface water; lake pollution; modeling; nutrient enrichment; pollutant transport; semiarid region; water budget; watershed; Article; catchment; controlled study; environmental policy; evapotranspiration; hydrology; irrigation (agriculture); land use; nonbiological model; nonhuman; nutrient content; pollution fate and transport model; pollution transport; precipitation; predictive value; sediment; semiarid climate; sensitivity and specificity; soil moisture; topography; urbanization; validation process; vegetation; water pollution; water quality; watershed; Ankara [Turkey]; Mogan Lake; Turkey",Article,Scopus

This region is comprised of two large river basins, the intensely row-cropped Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) and Ohio-Tennessee River Basin (OTRB), which are considered the key contributing areas for the Northern Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Thus, in this area it is of utmost importance to ensure that intensive agriculture for food, feed and biofuel production can coexist with a healthy water environment. To address these objectives within a river basin management context, an integrated modeling system has been constructed with the hydrologic Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, capable of estimating river basin responses to alternative cropping and/or management strategies. To improve modeling performance compared to previous studies and provide a spatially detailed basis for scenario development, this SWAT Corn Belt application incorporates a greatly refined subwatershed structure based on 12-digit hydrologic units or 'subwatersheds' as defined by the US Geological Service. The model setup, calibration and validation are time-demanding and challenging tasks for these large systems, given the scale intensive data requirements, and the need to ensure the reliability of flow and pollutant load predictions at multiple locations. Thus, the objectives of this study are both to comprehensively describe this large-scale modeling approach, providing estimates of pollution and crop production in the region as well as to present strengths and weaknesses of integrated modeling at such a large scale along with how it can be improved on the basis of the current modeling structure and results. The predictions were based on a semi-automatic hydrologic calibration approach for large-scale and spatially detailed modeling studies, with the use of the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting algorithm (SUFI-2) and the SWAT-CUP interface, followed by a manual water quality calibration on a monthly basis.

Grain production in China has remarkably improved since its founding in 1949, but the growth remains uneven across regions. The goal of this research was to assess the determinants of the yields of three major food crops (maize, rice, and wheat) in China and the mechanism of their responses to increased crop yields. Boosted regression tree models were created to capture the linked complex predictor-response relationships between crop yields and individual explanatory variables using prefecture-level agricultural statistics in China coupled with geographic data during the period from 1952 to 2017. The results showed that technological inputs (e.g., fertilizers, electricity consumption, and power of agricultural machinery) played a key role in the increase of crop yields, which explained 47%, 39%, and 62% of the variances in the yields of maize, rice, and wheat during the period 1952–2017, respectively. However, the contribution of technology became weaker over time, while the contribution of agro-environmental conditions and structural characteristics of administrative regions became stronger. Partial dependence plots indicated that encouraging higher technological inputs, accelerating large-scale grain production, shortening the urban-rural income gap, and improving the education of farmers were conductive to increasing crop yields. Overall, our results suggest that grain production policies aimed at increasing crop yields should better reflect the spatial heterogeneity of yield gaps; low-yield-gap regions should improve the utilization efficiency of water and fertilizer and formulate measures to inhibit non-grain production on cultivated land, while high-yield-gap regions should focus on improving technological inputs and promoting agricultural restructuring. This study provides deep insights into the processes of how individual explanatory variables affect crop yields, which is essential to develop differentiated grain production policies and provide valuable references for shortening yield gaps in high-yield-gap regions. © 2022","Boosted regression trees; China; Crop yields; Grain production policies; Sustainable agriculture","education; growth rate; China",Article,Scopus

This study investigated the use of remotely sensed phenology, climate data and machine learning for estimating yield at a resolution suitable for optimising crop management in fields. We used spatially weighted growth curve estimation to identify the timing of phenological events from sequences of Landsat NDVI and derive phenological and seasonal climate metrics. Using data from a 17,000 ha study area, we investigated the relationships between the metrics and yield over 17 years from 2003 to 2019. We compared six statistical and machine learning models for estimating yield: multiple linear regression, mixed effects models, generalised additive models, random forests, support vector regression using radial basis functions and deep learning neural networks. We used a 50-50 train-test split on pad-dock-years where 50% of paddock-year combinations were randomly selected and used to train each model and the remaining 50% of paddock-years were used to assess the model accuracy. Using only phenological metrics, accuracy was highest using a linear mixed model with a random effect that allowed the relationship between integrated NDVI and yield to vary by year (R = 0.67, MAE = 0.25 t ha−1, RMSE = 0.33 t ha−1, NRMSE = 0.25). We quantified the improvements in accuracy when seasonal climate metrics were also used as predictors. We identified two optimal models using the combined phenological and seasonal climate metrics: support vector regression and deep learning models (R = 0.68, MAE = 0.25 t ha−1, RMSE = 0.32 t ha−1, NRMSE = 0.25). While the linear mixed model using only phenological metrics performed similarly to the nonlinear models that are also seasonal climate metrics, the nonlinear models can be more easily generalised to estimate yield in years for which training data are unavailable. We conclude that long-term hindcasts of wheat yield in fields, at 30 m spatial resolution, can be produced using remotely sensed phenology from Landsat NDVI, climate data and machine learning. © 2021 by the authors.

The performance of each vegetation index to a certain condition is different and needs to be interpreted, correspondingly. This study aimed to assess the most suitable vegetation index to identify the crop response against elevated air temperatures, heat stress, and herbicide damage. The spectral reflectance, yield components, and growth parameters such as plant height, leaf area index (LAI), and above-ground dry matter of paddy rice, which was cultivated in a temperature gradient field chamber to simulate global warming conditions, were observed from 2016 to 2018. The relationships between the vegetation indices and the crop parameters were assessed considering stress conditions. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) represented the changes in plant height (R-square = 0.93) and the LAI (R-square = 0.901) before the heading stage. Furthermore, the NDVI and the cumulative growing degree days had a Sigmoid curve and an R-square value of 0.937 under the normal growth case, but it decreased significantly in the herbicide damage case. This characteristic was useful for detecting the damaged crop growth condition. Additionally, to estimate the grain yield of paddy rice, the medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS) terrestrial chlorophyll index was better: R-square = 0.912; root mean square error = 95.69 g/m2. Photochemical reflectance index was sensitive to physiological stress caused by the heatwave, and it decreased in response to extremely high air temperatures. These results will contribute towards determining vegetation indices under stress conditions and how to effectively utilize them. © 2020 by the authors.","Crop stress; Growing degree days (GDD); MTCI; NDVI; PRI; Temperature gradient field chamber (TGFC)","Atmospheric temperature; Crops; Cultivation; Global warming; Herbicides; Mean square error; Physiological models; Reflection; Thermal stress; Weed control; Crop growth condition; Medium resolution imaging spectrometers; Normalized difference vegetation index; Photochemical reflectance index; Physiological stress; Root mean square errors; Spectral reflectances; Temperature gradient fields; Vegetation",Article,Scopus

Plant height and yield are important traits for crop improvement. The traditional plant height and yield measurement are labor intensive and time consuming. Therefore, it is essential to estimate these two parameters rapidly and efficiently. The purpose of this study was to provide an alternative way to accurately identify and evaluate faba bean germplasm and breeding materials. Results: The results showed that 80% of the maximum plant height extracted from two-dimensional red–green–blue (2D-RGB) images had the best fitting degree with the ground measured values, with the coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) were 0.9915, 1.4411 cm and 5.02%, respectively. In terms of yield estimation, support vector machines (SVM) showed the best performance (R2 = 0.7238, RMSE = 823.54 kg ha−1, NRMSE = 18.38%), followed by random forests (RF) and decision trees (DT). Conclusion: The results of this study indicated that it is feasible to monitor the plant height of faba bean during the whole growth period based on UAV imagery.

Because the United States is a major producer and exporter of wheat to the world market, accurate and timely forecasting of wheat yield in the United States (U.S.) is fundamental to national crop management as well as global food security. Previous studies mainly have focused on developing empirical models using only satellite remote sensing images, while other yield determinants have not yet been adequately explored. In addition, these models are based on traditional statistical regression algorithms, while more advanced machine learning approaches have not been explored. This study used advanced machine learning algorithms to establish within-season yield prediction models for winter wheat using multi-source data to address these issues. Specifically, yield driving factors were extracted from four different data sources, including satellite images, climate data, soil maps, and historical yield records. Subsequently, two linear regression methods, including ordinary least square (OLS) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and four well-known machine learning methods, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and deep neural network (DNN), were applied and compared for estimating the county-level winter wheat yield in the Conterminous United States (CONUS) within the growing season. Our models were trained on data from 2008 to 2016 and evaluated on data from 2017 and 2018, with the results demonstrating that the machine learning approaches performed better than the linear regression models, with the best performance being achieved using the AdaBoost model (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.51 t/ha, MAE = 0.39 t/ha). Additionally, the results showed that combining data from multiple sources outperformed single source satellite data, with the highest accuracy being obtained when the four data sources were all considered in the model development. Finally, the prediction accuracy was also evaluated against timeliness within the growing season, with reliable predictions (R2 &gt; 0.84) being able to be achieved 2.5 months before the harvest when the multi-source data were combined. © 2020 by the authors.","CONUS; Machine learning; Multi-source data; Winter wheat; Yield prediction","Adaptive boosting; Crops; Decision trees; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Food supply; Forecasting; International trade; Least squares approximations; Remote sensing; Satellites; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Least absolute shrinkage and selection operators; Linear regression methods; Linear regression models; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning methods; Satellite remote sensing; Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.); Yield prediction models; Learning systems",Article,Scopus

Existing spatial interpolation methods have relatively low accuracy, and the resolution of available long-term gridded products of air temperature for China is coarse. Point observations from meteorological stations can provide long-term air temperature data series but cannot represent spatially continuous information. Here, we devised a method for spatial interpolation of air temperature data from meteorological stations based on powerful machine learning tools. First, to determine the optimal method for interpolation of air temperature data, we employed three machine learning models: random forest, support vector machine, and Gaussian process regression. A comparison of the mean absolute error, root mean square error, coefficient of determination, and residuals revealed that a Gaussian process regression had high accuracy and clearly outperformed the other two models regarding the interpolation of monthly maximum, minimum, and mean air temperatures. The machine learning methods were compared with three traditional methods used frequently for spatial interpolation: inverse distance weighting, ordinary kriging, and ANUSPLIN (Australian National University Spline). Results showed that the Gaussian process regression model had higher accuracy and greater robustness than the traditional methods regarding interpolation of monthly maximum, minimum, and mean air temperatures in each month. A comparison with the TerraClimate (Monthly Climate and Climatic Water Balance for Global Terrestrial Surfaces), FLDAS (Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System), and ERA5 (ECMWF, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, Climate Reanalysis) data sets revealed that the accuracy of the temperature data generated using the Gaussian process regression model was higher. Finally, using the Gaussian process regression method, we produced a long-term (January 1951 to December 2020) gridded monthly air temperature data set, with 1 km resolution and high accuracy for China, which we named GPRChinaTemp1km. The data set consists of three variables: monthly mean air temperature, monthly maximum air temperature, and monthly minimum air temperature. The obtained GPRChinaTemp1km data were used to analyse the spatiotemporal variations of air temperature using Theil-Sen median trend analysis in combination with the Mann-Kendall test. It was found that the monthly mean and minimum air temperatures across China were characterised by a significant trend of increase in each month, whereas monthly maximum air temperatures showed a more spatially heterogeneous pattern, with significant increase, non-significant increase, and non-significant decrease. The GPRChinaTemp1km data set is publicly available at 10.5281/zenodo.5112122 (He et al., 2021a) for monthly maximum air temperature, at 10.5281/zenodo.5111989 (He et al., 2021b) for monthly mean air temperature, and at 10.5281/zenodo.5112232 (He et al., 2021c) for monthly minimum air temperature. © 2022 Copernicus GmbH.

As it turns out, the region appears to be underrepresented in the existing compendium of Earth science and hydrology-focused journal papers when it comes to significant discussion on terrestrial hydrology and freshwater science. This prominent gap is largely precipitated by increasing number of constraints that include lack of considerable and robust investments in gauge measurements for meteorological and hydrological applications, poor funding of research institutions and other disincentives, among other factors. In this manuscript, the challenges and problems in large-scale terrestrial hydrology-focused investigation in West Africa are reviewed. Using a dossier of some recent contributions in the field of remote sensing hydrology, this review also highlights some of the progress in terrestrial hydrology and the opportunities that exist for hydro-geodetic research in West Africa that leverage on sustained investments in satellite geodetic missions. It is noted that West Africa is still a pristine environment for hydrology-focused research and can benefit from recent advancements in sophisticated space agency programs such as the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, which undoubtedly has revolutionized terrestrial hydrology research around the world for nearly two decades. Given the poor density of gauge stations and limited ground observations, hydrological research in West Africa is expected to benefit more from independent space observations and multi-resolution data. This is because the lack of sufficient in-situ data for the parameterizations and adequate initialization of outputs from hydrological models and reanalysis data for hydrological applications results in poor representation of the West African land surface and hydrological state variables. To further improve our contemporary understanding of West Africa’s terrestrial hydrology, the continued evaluation/validation of these observations and space-borne measurements is advocated. © 2019, Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences & Polish Academy of Sciences.","Climate variability; Droughts; Rainfall; River discharge; Terrestrial hydrology","Drought; Gages; Geodesy; Rain; Remote sensing; Tropics; Water resources; Climate variability; Gravity recovery and climate experiments; Multiresolution data; Pristine environments; Research institutions; River discharge; Space agency programs; Sustained investment; Hydrology; climate conditions; climate variation; drought; geodesy; hydrological modeling; rainfall; river discharge; water resource; West Africa",Review,Scopus

For this purpose, the WP and economic water productivity (WPe) were estimated using agronomic technologies. The impact of agronomic technologies on WP and WPe was carried out in two parts of field monitoring and modeling using novel intelligent approaches. Extreme learning machine (ELM), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and artificial neural network (ANN) methods were used to model WP and WPe. A dataset including 200 field data was collected from five treatment and control sections in the Malekan region, located in the southeast of Lake Urmia, Iran, for the crop year 2020–2021. Six different input combinations were introduced to estimate WP and WPe. The models used were evaluated using mean squared error (RMSE), relative mean squared error (RRMSE), and efficiency measures (NSE). Field monitoring results showed that in the treatment fields, with the application of agronomic technologies, the crop yield, WP, and WPe increased by 17.9%, 30.1%, and 19.9%, respectively. The results explained that irrigation water in farms W1, W2, W3, W4, and W5 decreased by 23.9%, 21.3%, 29.5%, 16.5%, and 2.7%, respectively. The modeling results indicated that the ANFIS model with values of RMSE = 0.016, RRMSE = 0.018, and NSE = 0.960 performed better in estimating WP and WPe than ANN and ELM models.

Whilst index insurance can help farmers cope with the financial consequences of extreme weather, a major challenge for index insurance is basis risk, where insurance payouts cor-relate poorly with actual crop losses. We analyse to what extent the use of crop simulation models and crop phenology monitoring can reduce basis risk in index insurance. Using a biophysical pro-cess-based crop model (Agricultural Production System sIMulator (APSIM)) applied for rice pro-ducers in Odisha, India, we simulate a synthetic yield dataset to train non-parametric statistical models to predict rice yields as a function of meteorological and phenological conditions. We find that the performance of statistical yield models depends on whether meteorological or phenological conditions are used as predictors and whether one aggregates these predictors by season or crop growth stage. Validating the preferred statistical model with observed yield data, we find that the model explains around 54% of the variance in rice yields at the village cluster (Gram Panchayat) level, outperforming vegetation index-based models that were trained directly on the observed yield data.

Its representative advantage lies in the ability to characterize changeable cloud morphology and simulate complex non-linear relationships. The deep network is trained using ground measured GSR values at 90 Chinese radiation stations in 2008 as well as the radiative transfer model simulation at the top of Mt. Everest which serves as constraints of extrapolation for high elevation regions. The extensibility of trained network is validated at 5 independent stations in 2008, yielding an overall coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.82, and at all stations in 2007 along with an R2 of 0.88. Comparative experiments confirm that the combination of spatial pattern and point information can lead to more accurate estimation of hourly GSR, achieving a minimum root mean square error (RMSE) of 84.18 W/m2 (0.30 MJ/m2), 1.92 MJ/m2 and 1.08 MJ/m2 in hourly, daily total and monthly total scales, respectively.

In this study, Random Forests statistical analysis was used on a database of 499 surveyed inland valleys in four study zones in three West African countries. The goal of the study was to assess parameters that indicate (are predictors for) high potential for development of rice-based systems in inland valleys. These parameters are related to the biophysical (hydrology, soil, climate, and topography) and socio-economic (demography, accessibility, and markets) environments. Farmer group surveys and secondary data from existing publicly available spatial data sets were used. The analysis revealed that, across the four research areas, the following parameters were relevant predictors for rice development: (1) distance from the inland valley to the nearest market; (2) distance from the inland valley to the nearest rice mill; (3) population density in the immediate environment of the inland valley; (4) total nitrogen in the top 20 cm of the soil profile; (5) land elevation; and (6) soil texture on the upper slope of the inland valley. Several predictors were highly important for specific research areas, but not for all, thus showing the diversity in the studied agricultural landscapes. These predictors included soil fertility management, source of irrigation water, and the percentage of female farmers in the inland valley. The identified relevant predictors will be used to map the potential rice production development of the inland valleys.

However, traditional methods for AGB measurement are time-consuming and only provide a low number of spatiotemporal measurements. Newly developed remote sensing platforms such as UAVs and new generation satellites allow unprecedented large-scale and frequent monitoring of rangeland vegetation that is typically produced in marginal lands characterized by high surface heterogeneity. This study used high-resolution UAV data and the new multi-spectral VENμS satellite to monitor AGB production for two consecutive years in a Mediterranean and semiarid grassland rangeland in Israel. We then studied the effects of grazing intensity and precipitation along the growing season on AGB. Data were collected from two long-term ecological research sites with plots under controlled grazing pressures (i.e., no grazing, moderate, and intensive grazing). We used high-spatial-resolution UAV imagery for land cover classification in order to mask different levels of mixed pixels in the VENμS satellite images along the growing season. A support vector regression model (SVM) for satellite-based AGB estimation was developed using more than 600 ground-truth AGB measurements collected during 2019–2020. The effect of the percentage cover for mixed pixel removal was examined. The results showed an improvement in the prediction model by 35% and reduced the RMSE by half for the support vector machine regression model's best prediction. The best AGB prediction results were achieved by including satellite pixels with over 50% vegetation cover. For the first time in Eastern Mediterranean rangelands, our study illustrates the benefits of high-integrated remote sensing data (i.e., satellite and UAV) for generating more accurate AGB estimations even in highly heterogeneous ecosystems in terms of surface cover.

Four iterative runs of the model were carried out with improved parameterization of soils and crop management without any change in the model. Improving model inputs changed much more the spatial distribution of simulated N losses than their mean values. STICS slightly underestimated the crop yields compared to the observed values at the administrative district scale. The platform also slightly underestimated the nitrate concentration at the outlet level with a mean difference ranging from −1.4 to −9.2 mg NO3 L−1 according to the aquifer during the last decade. This outcome should help the stakeholders in decision-making to prevent nitrate pollution and provide new specifications for STICS development. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cropping system; MODCOU; Nitrate pollution; Nitrogen leaching; Quality assurance; STICS; Water drainage","aquifer; concentration (composition); cropping practice; decision making; groundwater; groundwater pollution; hydrological modeling; intensive agriculture; land use; nitrate; quality control; spatial distribution; water quality; France; Normandie; Seine Basin; ground water; nitric acid derivative; nitrogen; agriculture; analysis; chemistry; crop; environmental monitoring; France; hydrology; procedures; reproducibility; soil; soil pollutant; spatiotemporal analysis; theoretical model; water pollutant; water quality; Agriculture; Crops, Agricultural; Environmental Monitoring; France; Groundwater; Hydrology; Models, Theoretical; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Reproducibility of Results; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality",Article,Scopus

Evaluation of hydrological responses and biofuel production potential of hypothetical land use change from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) to cellulosic bioenergy crops enables better understanding of the associated key agroecosystem processes and provides for the feasibility assessment of the targeted land use change in the SHP. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to assess the impacts of replacing cotton with perennial Alamo switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), Miscanthus × giganteus (Miscanthus sinensis Anderss. [Poaceae]), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and annual biomass sorghum on water balances, water use efficiency and biofuel production potential in the Double Mountain Fork Brazos watershed. Under perennial grass scenarios, the average (1994–2009) annual surface runoff from the entire watershed decreased by 6–8% relative to the baseline cotton scenario. In contrast, surface runoff increased by about 5% under the biomass sorghum scenario. Perennial grass land use change scenarios suggested an increase in average annual percolation within a range of 3–22% and maintenance of a higher soil water content during August to April compared to the baseline cotton scenario. About 19.1, 11.1, 3.2 and 8.8 Mg ha−1 of biomass could potentially be produced if cotton area in the watershed would hypothetically be replaced by Miscanthus, switchgrass, big bluestem and biomass sorghum, respectively. Finally, Miscanthus and switchgrass were found to be ideal bioenergy crops for the dryland and irrigated systems, respectively, in the study watershed due to their higher water use efficiency, better water conservation effects, greater biomass and biofuel production potential, and minimum crop management requirements. © 2015 The Authors.

However, strategies to estimate its yield are questionable given the characteristics of this crop; in this context, robust techniques, such as those based on machine learning, may be an alternative. Thus, the aim of the present study was to estimate the yield of a coffee crop using multispectral images and machine learning algorithms. Yield data from a same study area in 2017, 2018 and 2019, Sentinel 2 images, Random Forest (RF) algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN) and Linear Regression (LR) were used. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the absolute Pearson correlation and coefficient of determination values. The Sentinel 2 satellite images proved to be favorable in estimating coffee yield. Despite the low spatial resolution in estimating agricultural variables below the canopy, the presence of specific bands such as the red edge, mid infrared and the derived vegetation indices, act as a countermeasure. The results show that the blue band and green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) exhibit greater correlation with yield. The NN algorithm performed best and was capable of estimating yield with 23% RMSE, 20% MAPE and R² 0.82 using 85% of the training and 15% of the validation data of the algorithm.

Timely harvesting is critical to secure adequate forage quality. However, farmers face challenges not only to decide the optimal harvesting time but to predict the optimum levels for both forage production and quality. Fortunately, remote sensing technologies can significantly contribute to obtaining production and quality insights, providing scalability, and supporting complex farming decision-making. Therefore, we aim to develop a systematic review of the current scientific literature to identify the current status of research in remote sensing for alfalfa and to evaluate new perspectives for enhancing prediction of both biomass and quality (herein defined as crude protein and fibers) for alfalfa. Twelve papers were included in the database from a total of 198 studies included in the initial screening process. The main findings were (i) more than two-thirds of the studies focused on predicting biomass; (ii) half of the studies used terrestrial platforms, with only 33% using drones and 17% using satellite for remote sensing; (iii) no studies have used satellites assessed alfalfa quality traits; (iv) improved biomass and quality estimations were obtained when remote sensing data was combined with environmental information; (v) due to a direct relationship between biomass and quality, modeling them algorithmically improves the accuracy of estimation as well; (vi) from spectral wavelengths, dry biomass was better estimated in regions near 398, 551, 670, 730, 780, 865, and 1077 nm, wet biomass in regions near 478, 631, 670, 730, 780, 834, 933, 1034, and 1538 nm, and quality traits identified with narrow and very specific wavelengths (e.g., 398, 461, 551, 667, 712, and 1077 nm).

Compared with complex mechanism models, sampling statistical surveys and empirical models based on multi-source data have better reliability and operability for county-level or city-level yield estimation. Previous studies have proposed many factors related to winter wheat yield, but systematic research on the selection and analysis of multi-source factors is lacking. On the basis of remote sensing, meteorological, and statistical data, this study systematically explored the influence of key-phase growth-environment-landscape features on winter wheat yield estimation at the county-level and determined the best time phase and characteristic parameters. The considered features included crop condition, environmental forcing (e. g., precipitation, light, and temperature), and farmland landscape. The key phases were the key periods of winter wheat yield formation (P1—P5), which were extracted from the NDVI curve of the crop growth process. Random Forest (RF) regression models were developed using different combinations of phases and features to simulate statistical wheat yield data and evaluate the importance of different combinations via an accuracy assessment. The performance of the models built from each layer combination was compared using the Mean Relative Error (MRE), Root Mean-Squared Error (RMSE), Normalized Root Mean-Squared Error (NRMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2). Data on years 2014—2017 were used to build the models, and 2018 data were utilized for validation. Results showed that P2, P3, and P4 resulted in higher accuracy than P1 and P5 in terms of single phases. The model accuracy using multi-phase features was higher than that of using single phases, and the combination of P2 and P4 was the best. Among all the features, crop growth features had the greatest impact on yield estimation accuracy, whereas the addition of environmental forcing factors (e.g., water, light, and temperature) did not significantly improve the accuracy. The addition of farmland landscape features could effectively improve the accuracy of yield estimation. Moreover, five important features (PROP, NDVI_P2, B2_P2, ED, and B1_P4) were selected, and a yield estimation model was established to obtain the county-level yield of winter wheat in Hebei Province. The MRE of wheat yield estimation at the county level in 2018 was as low as 2.85%, and the RMSE, NRMSE, and R2 were 253.25 kg/ha, 4.09%, and 0.83, respectively. Conclusion Multi-phase performance is better than single-phase performance. Combining crop growth features with farmland landscape features (RMSE of 247.79 kg/ha) provides more accurate estimates than using crop growth features alone (RMSE of 295.95 kg/ ha). Furthermore, the RF model produces good yield estimation results.

Remote sensing products were generated using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 time series data and calibrated with data collected from farmers’ fields. We derived maps showing spatial variation in crop extent, crop growth stages and leaf area index (LAI), which are crucial in yield assessment. Crop classification was performed on Sentinel-2 time series data using spectral matching techniques (SMTs) and crop management information collected from field surveys along with ground data. The locations of crop cutting experiments (CCEs) was identified based on crop extent maps. LAI was derived based on the SAVI (soil-adjusted vegetation index) equation were using Landsat 8-time series data.

However, very few studies were performed to adapt crop models to simulate these systems. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the current capacity of the APSIM Next Generation model to estimate Piatã palisadegrass growth and soil water in different positions in a silvopastoral system with eucalyptus by looking at the impact of modelling belowground and aboveground competition separately. METHODS: A field experiment was conducted from December 2014 to January 2016 in a silvopastoral system with eucalyptus trees arranged in single rows, in East-West orientation, with 15 m between rows and 2 m between trees in the rows. This experiment was conducted under grazing management and rainfed conditions, during 11 growth cycles, with pasture variables, soil moisture and microclimatic conditions assessed at four distances from the eucalyptus north row (0.00 m, 3.75 m, 7.50 m and 11.25 m). APSIM testing was performed in two ways: focusing on belowground competition for soil water and nitrogen, using a multi-root-zone approach, and focusing on competition for solar radiation, using the measured data of solar radiation at each position. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The APSIM-Tropical Pasture model was effective in simulating pasture growth when only competition for solar radiation was considered (R2 from 0.75 to 0.86, Agreement index (d) from 0.88 to 0.96, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) between 0.32 and 0.85). These simulations are promising taking into account the difficulties to simulate pasture growth in silvopastoral systems with grazing; however, in systems with strong belowground competition for soil water and nutrients, this approach has strong limitations. Simulations of pasture growth were not as effective when using the multi-root-zone approach (R2 between 0.57 and 0.87, d between 0.53 and 0.74, and NSE from −5.32 to −1.20), despite reasonable simulations of soil water for the positions between the tree rows (R2 between 0.70 and 0.80, d from 0.91 to 0.94, and NSE between 0.60 and 0.77). In view of these results, improvements should be performed in APSIM to better simulate silvopastoral systems, mainly for solar radiation transmission and tree roots growth and distribution. SIGNIFICANCE: This study allowed identifying the key drivers of competition within the studied environment and to inform where the main efforts should be targeted in building a more effective model for silvopastoral systems. This is important to help model development teams in organising and optimising their efforts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agroforestry; Brachiaria brizantha; Grazing; Solar radiation; Tree-crop interactions; Tropical pasture model","dicotyledon; grass; growth response; simulation; soil water; solar radiation; Eucalyptus; Urochloa brizantha",Article,Scopus

The selection of suitable hybrids and fertilizers is among the methods that can directly influence sustainable agriculture and economic efficiency at the farm level, providing accurate site-specific nutrient management strategies for yield maximization. This experiment included two fertilizer sources in ten maize hybrids in four replications for three consecutive years (2018–2020). The experiment was carried out at the Látókép Crop Production Experimental Site of the University of Debrecen, Hungary. The results of the ANOVA showed that genotype, year, and fertilizer levels had various effects on grain yield, oil, protein, and starch content. FAO340 had maximum grain yield on different fertilizers (NPK and N), and FAO350 had maximum protein content. To gain the best performance and maximum yield of maize on protein and oil, FAO350 is recommended for protein and FAO340 for oil content. The parameters of grain yield, oil content, protein content, and starch content affected by NPK fertilizer provide the stability of grain yield parameters. FAO360, FAO420, and FAO320 hybrids had their maximum desirable N fertilizer doses and NPK fertilizer stability in this research. These results indicate that FAO360, FAO420, and FAO330 hybrids had their maximum potential yield in different fertilizer and environmental conditions. Based on this multi-year study, the complete NPK fertilizer with 150 kg/ha nitrogen, 115 kg/ha potassium, 135 kg/ha phosphorus is recommended to be used on maize hybrids. © 2021 by the authors.

It argues that while fully or partially automating discretionary EIA decisions is legally and technically problematic, there is significant potential for data-driven decision-making tools to provide superior analysis and predictions to better inform EIA processes. Discretionary decision-making is desirable for EIA decisions given the inherent complexity associated with environmental regulation and the prediction of future impacts. This article demonstrates that current ADM tools cannot adequately replicate human discretionary processes for EIAs—even if there is human oversight and review of automated outputs. Instead of fully or partially automating EIA decisions, data-driven decision-making can be more appropriately deployed to enhance data analysis and predictions to optimise EIA decision-making processes. This latter type of ADM can augment decision-making processes without displacing the critical role of human discretion in weighing the complex environmental, social and economic considerations inherent in EIA determinations. © The Author/s 2021","automated decision making; data-driven decision making; discretionary decisions; Environmental impact assessments",,Article,Scopus

This study quantified the spatial patterns of variability in soil and crop properties to delineate MZs for site-specific soil fertility characterization of potato fields through proximal sensing of fields. Grid sampling strategy was adopted to collect soil and crop data from two potato fields in Prince Edward Island (PEI). DUALEM-2 sensor, Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR-300), GreenSeeker were used to collect soil ground conductivity parameter horizontal coplanar geometry (HCP), soil moisture content (θ), and normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI), respectively. Soil organic matter (SOM), soil pH, phosphorous (P), potash (K), iron (Fe), lime index (LI), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) were determined from soil samples collected from each grid. Stepwise regression shortlisted the major properties of soil and crop that explained 71 to 86% of within-field variability. The cluster analysis grouped the soil and crop data into three zones, termed as excellent, medium, and poor at a 40% similarity level. The coefficient of variation and the interpolated maps characterized least to moderate variability of soil fertility parameters, except for HCP and K that were highly variable. The results of multiple means comparison indicated that the tuber yield and HCP were significantly different in all MZs. The significant relationship between HCP and yield suggested that the ground conductivity data could be used to develop MZs for site-specific fertilization in potato fields similar to those used in this study. © 2020 by the authors.","Management zones; Precision agriculture; Proximal sensing; Soil health; Soil variability",,Article,Scopus

Late-season biomass production is information growers need to maximize cover crop benefits and schedule field operations. Statistical learning, built upon statistical and computational algorithms that “learn” from data, may help to improve predictions of cover crop biomass as a function of initial soil inorganic nitrogen levels. Three models—Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Ridge, and Random Forest (RF)—were trained and optimized on a 3-yr allometric and remote sensing dataset of cereal rye responses to N fertilization in the mid-Atlantic northern and southeastern United States. Shoot biomass (mean, 9,800 kg ha−1) was accurately predicted with a RF model (RMSE, 2,039 kg ha−1). Targeting shoot N content (mean, 107 kg ha−1), on the other hand, LASSO made accurate and more stable predictions (RMSE, 34 kg ha−1). Early-season information (cover crop C/N ratio, tiller counts, and ground-sensed normalized difference vegetation index) contributed to enhancing biomass and N content predictions. A final test on untrained data revealed that 92 and 73% of the predictions from either algorithm corresponded to ground-truthed biomass and shoot N content observed under different N regimes.

To the best of our knowledge, there is a research gap on proposing and evaluating computational models to automate and individualize the feeding of the animals and its impact on milk production. In this way, this work proposes the MooCare model, designed to assist producers in the management of dairy cattle, in order to obtain better productivity indexes. Using the Internet of Things devices, MooCare performs the automation and individualization of the animals feeding. Data gathered using such devices enable the MooCare scientific contribution, which consists of providing the milk production forecasting of each cow, using the ARIMA prediction engine. Thus, farmers can be notified in advance, so enabling them to react in terms of designing a better nutritional plan, which can be individualized for each cow. The evaluations comprise a simulation based on data of cow lactation obtained from a real farm. The experiments presented encouraging results since the assertiveness of the prediction indicated small differences if compared to the actual milk production.

This study aimed to quantify and map the dry matter yield (DMY) and nitrogen yield (NY) of French grasslands resulting from cutting and grazing practices, based on the existing diversity of grassland vegetation, management, soil and climate conditions, using a research version of the STICS crop model called PâturSTICS. This model simulates daily dry matter (DM), nitrogen (N) and water fluxes involved in the functioning of grasslands and crops in response to management and environmental conditions. It was improved to represent deposition of animal waste on grassland soils during grazing and to simulate DM production and N content of grasses and legumes more accurately. Simulations were performed for locations across France on a high-resolution grid composed of pedoclimatic units (PCU) obtained by combining the spatial resolutions of climate and soil. The main grassland types and associated management types were determined for each PCU and then simulated over 30 years (1984–2013). Using the simulated values, predictive metamodels of annual grassland DMY and NY were developed from easily accessible explanatory variables using a random forest approach. Annual model predictions were aggregated and averaged at the PCU scale, then compared to regional observations. Predicted DMY agreed with available observations, except in semi-mountainous and mountainous regions, where PâturSTICS tended to overpredict DMY, probably because it ignores effects of snow, frost and slope, and due to how it represents effects of temperature and water stress on plant growth. According to results, three-quarters of French grasslands produce and export at least 7.6 t DM ha−1 yr−1 and 172 kg N ha−1 yr−1, respectively. One-quarter of French grasslands produce and export at least 10.7 t DM ha−1 yr−1 and 254 kg N ha−1 yr−1, respectively. The latter are located mainly in north-western France, the north-western Massif Central, the French Alps and the western Pyrénées, all of which have environmental conditions favourable for grass growth. The metamodels developed are interesting proxies for PâturSTICS’ predictions of grassland DMY and NY. Our results provided valuable knowledge that promotes better use of the potential forage production of French and European grasslands to improve protein self-sufficiency and N fertilisation management in ruminant livestock systems. © 2019","Dry matter yield; France; Grassland; Modelling; Nitrogen yield; STICS","agricultural modeling; crop yield; dry matter; environmental conditions; grassland; nitrogen; resolution; water stress; Alps; France; Massif Central; Pyrenees; Animalia; Poaceae",Article,Scopus

In this study, water consumption for irrigated agriculture was estimated across the U.S. to improve understanding of water budgets in different regions. Published data on cropping patterns and water application were used in conjunction with a national-scale analysis to estimate water application and crop water consumption using the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) watershed model. Crop water consumption estimates were based on evapotranspiration, with supporting information on the diversity of crops, irrigated area, water quantity and source, and local weather conditions. Quantification of water consumption supports broader analyses of the food-energy-water nexus and allows evaluation of the efficiency of irrigation water use at different spatial scales. Focusing on 2005 data, it is estimated that 60% of water reported as withdrawn from various sources is applied to fields, indicating a potentially large and poorly understood conveyance loss that occurs in a small number of states. Of the field-applied irrigation water, roughly 65% is directly used by crops or is lost in the field, with large regional variations. This may be compared to consumption estimates in prior studies that ranged from 16% to 90%. Areas that dominate the national aggregate estimate of crop water consumption include California’s Central and Imperial Valleys, areas overlying the Ogallala Aquifer in the central U.S., the Lower Colorado Basin, and the eastern part of the Pacific Northwest Basin. © 2019 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers","Crop water use; Irrigated agriculture; SWAT; Water withdrawal; Watershed model","Aquifers; Budget control; Crops; Groundwater resources; Irrigation; Watersheds; Crop water use; Irrigated agriculture; SWAT; Water withdrawal; Watershed modeling; Water supply; estimation method; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; soil and water assessment tool; water use; watershed; California; Central Valley [California]; Colorado Basin [North America]; Imperial Valley; Ogallala Aquifer; Pacific Northwest; United States",Article,Scopus

To address the need for quantitative estimates of time patterns of tillage practices, this study proposes modeling the time patterns using the Markov chains framework and estimating the probabilities of transition from one tillage-crop combination to another tillage-crop combination from time-ordered spatially aggregated data. We developed a first-order, four-state Markov chain model of tillage-crop dynamics in corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) production systems and estimated the transition probabilities for the state of Iowa using the 1992 to 1997 data collected by the Conservation Technology Information Center. The transition probabilities strongly suggest that the majority of NT acreage is not in continuous but rather in rotational NT, i.e., NT crop production in rotation with conventional or other tillage systems. We find that the probability of two-year continuous NT is 8%, and that 70% of Iowa cropland has never used NT over two consecutive years. When three-year tillage history is considered on corn acreage, 3% is in continuous NT, 62% has never used NT, and the rest of the acreage is in rotational NT. When three-year tillage history is considered on soybean acreage, 4% is in continuous NT, 56% has never used NT, and the rest of the acreage is in rotational NT. The methodology presented is applicable to corn-soybean production systems in other regions and is generalizable to other cropping systems. Regional estimates of the use of rotational and continuous NT are likely to benefit simulation modeling for the assessment of the environmental effects of alternative tillage practices.

This study evaluated crop sub-model parameters of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a widely used, physically based, hydrological model. Baseline SWAT crop parameters were calibrated at the model hydrologic-response-unit-scale using 10 years of replicated field-scale data at one site and validated using 5 years at a second site for corn and grain sorghum, and new parameters were developed and tested for sweet sorghum (bioenergy crop) using 4 years of unreplicated field data. Calibration of crop yields focused on four parameters: lower harvest index (WYSF), harvest index for optimal growing condition (HVSTI), radiation use efficiency (BIO_E), and maximum leaf area index (BLAI). Calibration improved model performance and resulted in slight changes to SWAT default values for four parameters for corn and sorghum. These results provide important preliminary parameters for modeling sweet sorghum in SWAT; both BIO_E and BLAI were greater than default values for grain sorghum. Calibrated parameters improved model performance in validation of corn but not grain sorghum, which was heavily influenced by drought conditions and possibly other management differences at the validation site. Results of this study support use of site-specific, rather than default or off-site, calibration of crop-model parameters to minimize effects on model performance of different soil, water, and nutrient management conditions.

Despite the availability of the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) which provides remotely sensed data on crop type in the US on an annual basis, crop rotation patterns remain poorly mapped due to the lack of tools that allow for consistent and efficient analysis of multi-year CDLs. This study presents the Representative Crop Rotations Using Edit Distance (RECRUIT) algorithm, implemented as a Python software package, to select representative crop rotations by combining and analyzing multi-year CDLs. Using CDLs from 2010 to 2012 for 5 states in the US Midwest, we demonstrate the performance and parameter sensitivity of RECRUIT in selecting representative crop rotations that preserve crop area and capture land-use changes.

This was further used to differentiate between growth characteristics for an irrigated intensive agriculture over a northern India state (e.g. Punjab) and a rainfed ill-posed agriculture over a central India state (e.g. Madhya Pradesh) using time-series data sets for five growing years (June-April): 1996-1997, 1997-1998, 1998-1999, 1999-2000, and 2000-2001. The triangular scatter between RET and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showed that the minimum RET increases linearly with NDVI producing a 'basal line' that represents relative canopy transpiration only. A clear distinction in scatter was found between the two contrasting agro-ecosystems showing a higher RET or root zone wetness in irrigated than rainfed systems. In rainfed rice-growing regions, an inverse correlation (0.6-0.75) was found between RET and the Keetch-Byram meteorological drought index (KBDI), and a substantial reduction in RET was also found in a sub-normal (2000) compared with a normal (1999) monsoon season. RET estimates were found to be most sensitive to atmospheric transmissivity followed by other land-surface radiation budget inputs, such as NDVI, LST, and albedo. Error propagation due to three surface parameters is the opposite of that for transmissivity. The maximum possible error in clear-sky NOAA PAL RET was estimated to be 12-15%. This test study would be helpful in deriving RET using optical and thermal data from a suite of current and future Indian geostationary satellite sensors for monitoring growing conditions.",,"Agriculture; Budget control; Geostationary satellites; Atmospheric transmissivity; Canopy transpirations; Growing conditions; Growth characteristic; Inverse correlation; Meteorological drought; Normalized difference vegetation index; Substantial reduction; Evapotranspiration; data set; energy balance; error analysis; estimation method; evapotranspiration; NOAA satellite; radiation budget; satellite sensor; time series; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia",Article,Scopus

Here, we added a sediment diagenesis and sediment carbon (C) resuspension module into the SWAT-C model and tested it for simulating both particulate organic C (POC) and dissolved organic C (DOC) fluxes using 4 years of monthly observations (2014-2017) in the Tuckahoe watershed (TW) in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region. Results: Sensitivity analyses show that parameters that regulate POC deposition in river networks are more sensitive than those that determine C resuspension from sediments. Further analyses indicate that allochthonous contributions to POC and DOC are about 36.6 and 46 kgC ha-1 year-1, respectively, while autochthonous contributions are less than 0.72 kgC ha-1 year-1 for both POC and DOC (less than 2% of allochthonous sources). The net deposition of POC on the riverbed (i.e., 11.4 kgC ha-1 year-1) retained ca. 31% of terrestrial inputs of POC. In addition, average annual buried C was 0.34 kgC ha-1 year-1, accounting for only 1% of terrestrial POC inputs or 3% of net POC deposition. The results indicate that about 79% of deposited organic C was converted to inorganic C (CH4 and CO2) in the sediment and eventually released into the overlying water column. Conclusion: This study serves as an exploratory study on estimation of C fluxes from terrestrial to aquatic environments at the watershed scale. We demonstrated capabilities of the SWAT-C model to simulate C cycling from uplands to riverine ecosystems and estimated C sinks and sources in aquatic environments. Overall, the results highlight the importance of including carbon cycle dynamics within the riverbed in order to accurately estimate aquatic carbon fluxes and stocks. The new capabilities of SWAT-C are expected to serve as a useful tool to account for those processes in watershed C balance assessment. © 2020 The Author(s).","DOC; POC; Resuspension; Sediment diagenesis","aquatic environment; carbon cycle; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; diagenesis; dissolved organic carbon; particulate organic carbon; resuspension; river bed; terrestrial environment; watershed; Maryland; Mid-Atlantic States; Tuckahoe River; United States; Peltandra virginica",Article,Scopus

In this study, we built machine learning (random forest, gradient boosting, and stacking) and traditional linear models to identify the relation between the runoff coefficient and its influencing factors, including topography, climate, land cover, and soil. The cross-validation results show that the machine learning models greatly outperform the traditional linear model in predicting runoff coefficient. High-resolution (0.1°) runoff coefficient and runoff maps for the China's transboundary river basins riparian countries were produced and compared with other estimates at the country level. The best water resources estimates achieved from the machine learning model are consistent with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations AQUASTAT database (root-mean-square error = 76.97 km 3 /year, normalized root-mean-square error = 12%) at the country level. This outperformed two currently available runoff products: the UNH/GRDC Global Composite Runoff Fields and the Global Streamflow Characteristics Dataset. The study also demonstrated that accurate precipitation data can improve runoff and water resources estimation accuracy and that climate and topographic factors have a controlling role in prediction, whereas the influences of land cover and soils are weak.

In this context, we used artificial intelligence (AI) and the long-short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) method to explore and forecast future urban–rural vegetation disparities (ΔEVI, where EVI is the enhanced vegetation index) in Pakistan's six megacities using MODIS EVI data. The forecast results revealed that ΔEVI is decreasing in all cities. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) were used to evaluate LSTM-RNN.

In winter, grape root is prone to freezing damage owing to natural phenomenon such as early and late frost, and methods to assess disaster risk at the grape parcel level is one of the current research hotspots. However, there are two problems at present; first is the lack of grape parcel maps and second is that scale of disaster risk assessment is limited to the level of administrative divisions and grid systems. Therefore, according to the perennial characteristics of the grapes and clear texture of the open-air grape parcels based on public data sets (Sentinel-2A/B) and high-quality winery address information, combined with Google Earth engine (GEE) platform, Google Earth, and Ovitalmap, this study designs a collection scheme of open-air grape parcel samples and non-grape parcel samples, analyzes the environmental characteristics of the distribution of high-quality wineries, constructs a classification feature database in three aspects (time, terrain, and vegetation), uses the random forest classification method to classify open-air grape parcels in the eastern Helan Mountains in 2019, and conducts a late frost disaster risk assessment of the open-air grape parcel. The results show that: (1) The high-quality wineries are mainly distributed in the elevation of 1106–1240 m, with the average slope of 0.82°, the organic matter content of 10.79–14.27 g/kg, the P content of 24.87–37.58 mg/kg, the K content of 116–166 mg/kg, the pH 8.38–8.55, N content of 0.65–0.98 g/kg, annual average active accumulated temperature ≥10 °C of 3490–3590 °C, annual average rainfall of 189–201 mm, the annual average sunshine duration of 7.3–7.6 h, annual average air temperature of 8.8–9.4 °C, annual average temperature difference of 12.7–13.2 °C, annual average frost-free period at 263–270 d and annual average relative air Humidity of 50–54%. (2) The overall classification accuracy of open-air grape parcels reached 98.96% and the verification accuracy of ground truth parcel samples reached 87.89%. The open-air grape parcels in the eastern Helan Mountains are mainly distributed in Helan County, Xixia District, Yongning County, and Qingtongxia City. (3) The highest risk of late frost was found in Xixia District and the lowest risk in Yongning County. Helan County was higher than Qingtongxia City in the medium risk of late frost. The typical small area high risk includes Liangtian Town, the experimental field of Ningxia Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences in Zhenbeibao Town, Yuhuang Winery in Ganchengzi Village, and the State-run Warm Spring Farm in Helan County. Thus, the sample collection and augmentation scheme are feasible, the open-air grape classification accuracy is high and its result is consistent with field investigation, which can provide accurate parcel-level disaster risk assessment and provide decision support for agricultural departments and farmers. © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Random forest (RF), artificial neural networks (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machines (SVM) were used to develop models. Training and validation of these models were conducted using in-situ observations from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) from 2001 to 2016. The rule of the traditional Köppen-Geiger (K-G) climate classification was used to classify climate regions. The input variables were land surface temperature (LST) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), monthly precipitation data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 product, and the Digital Elevation Map (DEM) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The overall accuracy (OA) based on validation data from 2001 to 2016 for all models was high over 95%. DEM and minimum winter temperature were two distinct variables over the study area with particularly high relative importance. ANN produced more realistic spatial distribution of the classified climates despite having a slightly lower OA than the others. The accuracy of the models using high altitudinal in-situ data of the Mountain Meteorology Observation System (MMOS) was also assessed. Although the data length of the MMOS data was relatively short (2013 to 2017), it proved that the snowy, dry and cold winter and cool summer class (Dwc) is widely located in the eastern coastal region of South Korea. Temporal shifting of climate was examined through a comparison of climate maps produced by period: from 1950 to 2000, from 1983 to 2000, and from 2001 to 2013. A shrinking trend of snow classes (D) over the Korean Peninsula was clearly observed from the ANN-based climate classification results. Shifting trends of climate with the decrease/increase of snow (D)/temperate (C) classes were clearly shown in the maps produced using the proposed approaches, consistent with the results from the reanalysis data of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC). © 2019 Park et al.

The adoption of corn stover removal, switchgrass, and/or Miscanthus biofuel cropping systems was simulated to assess the impact of cellulosic biofuel production on pollutant losses. The stover removal results indicate removal of 20 or 50% of corn stover in the BRW would have negligible effects on streamflow and relatively minor or negligible effects on sediment and nutrient losses, even on higher sloped cropland. Complete cropland conversion into switchgrass or Miscanthus, resulted in reductions of streamflow, sediment, nitrate, and other pollutants ranging between 23-99%. The predicted nitrate reductions due to Miscanthus adoption were over two times greater compared to switchgrass, with the largest impacts occurring for tile-drained cropland. Targeting of switchgrass or Miscanthus on cropland ≥2% slope or ≥7% slope revealed a disproportionate amount of sediment and sediment-bound nutrient reductions could be obtained by protecting these relatively small areas of higher sloped cropland. Overall, the results indicate that all biofuel cropping systems could be effectively implemented in the BRW, with the most robust approach being corn stover removal adopted on tile-drained cropland in combination with a perennial biofuel crop on higher sloped landscapes.

The study focused mainly on three fundamental aspects, namely descriptive modelling, predictive modelling, and spatial modelling of expected risks and vulnerability to drought. Thus, out of 417 articles across all studies on drought, 226 articles published from 2010 to 2022 were analyzed to provide a global overview of the current state of knowledge on multivariate drought modelling using the inclusion criteria. The main objective is to review the recent available scientific evidence regarding multivariate drought modelling based on the joint use of geospatial technologies and artificial intelligence. The analysis focused on the different methods used, the choice of algorithms and the most relevant variables depending on whether they are descriptive or predictive models. Criteria such as the skill score, the given game complexity used, and the nature of validation data were considered to draw the main conclusions. The results highlight the very heterogeneous nature of studies on multivariate modelling of agricultural drought, and the very original nature of studies on multivariate modelling of agricultural drought in the recent literature. For future studies, in addition to scientific advances in prospects, case studies and comparative studies appear necessary for an in-depth analysis of the reproducibility and operational applicability of the different approaches proposed for spatial and temporal modelling of agricultural drought. HIGHLIGHTS The components and fundamentals of multivariate modelling of agricultural drought were discussed. The importance of hybrid artificial intelligence models is widely discussed in improving the performance of traditional machine learning models. Quantum machine learning algorithms are weakly explored in multivariate drought modelling. Therefore, future studies should explore this approach. The major challenge of multivariate modelling of drought frequency is mainly related to the difference in the return periods of the different variables (time-shifted and spatially effects). © 2022 The Author(s).

The silvopastoral system is an efficient alternative to full sun pastures that could be used to sustainably intensify animal and crop production. However, the adoption of this system is being held back by a lack of knowledge on how the trees in such a system should be arranged in order to avoid detrimental effects on pasture growth. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test different arrangements of trees in the Eucalyptus-Marandu palisade grass silvopastoral system and to evaluate its performance in different regions of Brazil. METHODS: A functional-structural plant model was developed to simulate radiation interception by trees and was then coupled to the CROPGRO-Perennial Forage model to simulate the production of forage biomass. Considering solar radiation as the main resource under competition, water interactions that occur under-ground between Eucalyptus and Maranu palisade grass were not considered. The models were calibrated with experimental data collected in silvopastoral systems in Brazil. The silvopastoral systems were selected according to a combination of tree row spacing (15, 30, and 45 m), two row orientations (north-south and east-west), and single or triple rows. Simulations were replicated for different tree ages (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 years) representing different levels of shading. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our simulations show that the tree arrangement has a significant effect on the incidence of radiation on the pasture, resulting in different levels of forage production. Row spacing of 30 and 45 m is suitable for providing forage for the animals for several years. In contrast, tree arrangements with a row spacing of 15 m or triple lines demand more careful planning and management, taking into account the soil and climatic characteristics of each region. Lower declines in the forage production were observed in arrangements of 45 m, varying from 1000 and 3000 kg ha−1 after 6 years of system establishment. In this period, the annual production level was lower than 14,000 kg ha−1 for arrangments with row spacing of 15 and 30 m, being recommend pruning and thinning practices aiming to increase the radiation incidence within the system. SIGNIFICANCE: The approach used in this study can be extended to other combinations of species and environments to aid the planning and management of this kind of system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CROPGRO-perennial forage; Functional-structural plant modeling; Intercropping; Livestock-forest","agroforestry; angiosperm; crop production; environmental management; forage; pasture; solar radiation; Brazil; Eucalyptus",Article,Scopus

However, these studies have been limited to monitor the vertical distribution of HABs due to the optical complexity of inland water. Therefore, this study applied a deep neural network model to monitor the vertical distribution of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), phycocyanin (PC), and turbidity (Turb) using drone-borne hyperspectral imagery, in-situ measurement, and meteoroidal data. The pigment concentrations were measured between depths of 0 m and 5.0 m with 0.05 m intervals. Here, four state-of-the-art data-driven model structures (ResNet-18, ResNet-101, GoogLeNet, and Inception v3) were adopted for estimating the vertical distributions of the harmful algal pigments. Among the four models, the ResNet-18 model showed the best performance, with an R2 value of 0.70. In addition, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) substantially provided informative reflectance band ranges near 490 nm and 620 nm in the hyperspectral image for the vertical estimation of pigments. Therefore, this study demonstrated that the explainable deep learning model with drone-borne hyperspectral images has the potential to estimate Chl-a, PC, and Turb vertical distributions and to show influential features that contribute to describing the vertical profile phenomena. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cyanobacteria; Drone-borne hyperspectral image; Explainable deep learning model; Vertical profile","Deep neural networks; Drones; Hyperspectral imaging; Remote sensing; Chlorophyll a; Cyanobacterium; Drone-borne hyperspectral image; Explainable deep learning model; Harmful algal blooms; Hyper-spectral imageries; Inland waters; Learning models; Vertical distributions; Vertical profile; Spectroscopy; chlorophyll a; phycocyanin; pigment; chlorophyll; algal bloom; cyanobacterium; spectral analysis; vertical distribution; vertical profile; algal bloom; Article; concentration (parameter); deep learning; deep neural network; environmental monitoring; hyperspectral imagery; image processing; imaging and display; nonhuman; surface property; turbidity; water quality; environmental monitoring; Cyanobacteria; Varanidae; Chlorophyll; Chlorophyll A; Deep Learning; Environmental Monitoring; Harmful Algal Bloom; Phycocyanin",Article,Scopus

Remote and proximal sensing offer the possibility to cut crop monitoring costs traditionally associated with surveys and censuses. Fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), chlorophyll concentration (CI) and normalized difference vegetation (NDVI) indices were used in crop monitoring, but their comparative performances in sorghum monitoring is lacking. This work aimed therefore at closing this gap by evaluating the performance of machine learning modelling of in-season sorghum biomass yields based on Sentinel-2-derived fAPAR and simpler high-throughput optical handheld meters-derived NDVI and CI calculated from sorghum plants reflectance. Bayesian ridge regression showed good cross-validated performance, and high reliability (R2 = 35%) and low bias (mean absolute prediction error, MAPE = 0.4%) during the validation step. Hand-held optical meter-derived CI and Sentinel-2- derived fAPAR showed comparable effects on machine learning performance, but CI outperformed NDVI and was therefore considered as a good alternative to Sentinel-2's fAPAR. The best times to sample the vegetation indices were the months of June (second half) and July.

This research project evaluated the performance of the combination of three Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) approaches in the forecasting of the monthly rainfall anomalies for Southwestern Colombia. For this purpose, we applied the Non-linear Principal Component Analysis (NLPCA) approach to get the main modes, a Neural Network Autoregressive Moving Average with eXogenous variables (NNARMAX) as a model, and an Inverse NLPCA approach for reconstructing the monthly rainfall anomalies forecasting in the Andean Region (AR) and the Pacific Region (PR) of Southwestern Colombia, respectively. For the model, we used monthly rainfall lagged values of the eight large-scale climate indices linked to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon as exogenous variables. They were cross-correlated with the main modes of the rainfall variability of AR and PR obtained using NLPCA. Subsequently, both NNARMAX models were trained from 1983 to 2014 and tested for two years (2015–2016). Finally, the reconstructed outputs from the NNARMAX models were used as inputs for the Inverse NLPCA approach. The performance of the ANN approaches was measured using three different performance metrics: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Pearson’s correlation (r). The results showed suitable forecasting performance for AR and PR, and the combination of these ANN approaches demonstrated the possibility of rainfall forecasting in these sub-regions five months in advance and provided useful information for the decision-makers in Southwestern Colombia. © 2020 by the authors.

Although, such models are used by several plantation researchers and managers, improved options and sensitivity to soil characteristics, genotype, and management options are desirable. A new generation of forest productivity modelling needs to extend previous capabilities and incorporate modern software engineering technologies. Our objective was to develop and evaluate an Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) Next Generation model for simulating the growth of Eucalyptus grandis and hybrids with or of E. globulus and E. urophyylla. The model simulates stem, canopy and root development, resource capture and use (light, water, N), and C and N allocation as mediated by climate, soil, genotype physiological characteristics and management. Tree dimensions (stem diameter, height, volume) are calculated as empirical functions of above-ground biomass. Datasets used for model calibration or independent evaluation were from diverse conditions in Australia (5 sites) and Brazil (13 sites), and at several of these sites there were treatments for fertilizer, irrigation or genotype. For the calibration and evaluation datasets, model performance was very good for above-ground biomass (Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency, NSE = 0.96 and 0.84 respectively). Notwithstanding this general performance, and as an example, local calibration improved performance in one of the independent test datasets, suggesting that applications of the model for specific sites or clones may benefit from parameterization to local conditions. Simulation of management for weed cover, N fertilizer and genotype are also demonstrated. As the model performed well and has high flexibility, it warrants consideration by forest plantation managers and researchers for knowledge synthesis and operational productivity predictions of Eucalyptus and other plantation genotypes. © 2020","APSIM Next Generation; Climate; Forecast; Forestry; Genotype; Management; Nitrogen; Productivity; Soil; Water; Weeds; Yield","Agricultural robots; Climate models; Fertilizers; Forestry; Managers; Productivity; Software engineering; Above ground biomass; Agricultural production system; Empirical functions; Forest productivity; Knowledge synthesis; Physiological characteristics; Process-based modelling; Soil characteristics; Physiological models; aboveground biomass; dicotyledon; fertilizer application; forest management; genotype; growth; hybrid; plantation forestry; Calibration; Eucalyptus Grandis; Fertilizers; Forestry; Management; Performance; Production; Productivity; Australia; Brazil; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus globulus; Eucalyptus grandis",Article,Scopus

Irrigated stream-aquifer systems present a unique challenge in this effort, due to complex groundwater-surface water interactions and the high level of human intervention in managing irrigation practices. This paper has two objectives: first, to detail a method for constructing and applying a coupled SWAT-MODFLOW to irrigated stream-aquifer systems; and second, to use the model to quantify the effects of decreasing irrigation on hydrological responses and crop yield. The method is applied to a 734 km2 study region in the Lower Arkansas River Valley, an alluvial valley in Colorado, USA, which has been intensively irrigated for over 100 years and is threatened by shallow water tables. Therefore, a reduction in applied irrigation amounts has the double benefit of conserving water and decreasing waterlogging, given that crop yield can be maintained for food production. The results indicate that an approximate 10% decrease in total applied irrigation water results in decreases of 6% in surface runoff, 8% in evapotranspiration, and 4% in recharge water. It also results in an increase of 4% in groundwater return flow to the Arkansas River, and an actual increase in groundwater levels due to the decrease in groundwater pumping, pointing to the need for targeted irrigation reduction strategies to decrease waterlogging occurrence. The irrigation reduction yields an average 9% decrease in corn and alfalfa yield. This modeling approach is in general transferable to other similar irrigated river valleys. © 2019 by the authors.","Crop yield; Groundwater-surface water interactions; Hydrological response; Intensively irrigation; Modeling; SWAT-MODFLOW","Aquifers; Crops; Groundwater resources; Irrigation; Landforms; Models; Water management; Water supply; Crop yield; Ground water-surface water interactions; Hydrological response; Irrigation practices; Lower arkansas river valleys; Shallow water tables; Swat-modflow; Water management strategies; Rivers; alfalfa; aquifer; crop yield; groundwater resource; groundwater-surface water interaction; irrigation system; maize; pumping; river water; shallow water; soil and water assessment tool; water use efficiency; waterlogging; Arkansas Valley; Colorado; United States; Medicago sativa; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

A simulation at 50 km grid spacing is performed with the standard version of the RegCM4.5 model (control run), followed by three vegetation change experiments at the Sahel-Sahara interface (15° N and 20° N): forest, tall grass, and short grass savanna. The impacts of land cover change are assessed by analyzing the difference between the altered runs and the control one in different sub-domains (western Sahel, central Sahel, eastern Sahel, and Guinea). Results show that the presence of forest, tall grass, and short grass savanna at the Sahel-Sahara interface tends to decrease the mean summer surface temperature in the whole domain. Nevertheless, this decrease is more pronounced over the Central Sahel when considering the forest experiment. This temperature decrease is associated with a weakening (strengthening) of the sensible (latent) heat flux in the whole domain. An analysis of the radiation field is performed to better explain the changes noted in the latent heat flux, the sensible heat flux, and the surface temperature. When considering the rainfall signal, the analysis shows that the afforestation options tend to alter the precipitation in the considered sub-domains substantially by increasing it in the whole Sahel region, with strong interannual variability. This rainfall increase is associated with an increase of the atmospheric moisture. Finally, we investigated the impacts of the afforestation options on some features of the rainfall events, and on the atmospheric dynamics during wet and dry years. All afforestation options tend to increase the frequency of the number of rainy days in regions located south of 18° N during both periods. Nevertheless, this increase is stronger over the Central and Eastern Sahel during wet years in the forest case. All afforestation experiments induce an increase (decrease) of the low-levels monsoon flux in the Eastern Sahel (western Sahel) during both periods. At the mid-levels, the three afforestation options tend to move northward and to decrease the intensity of the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) south of 13° N during wet and dry years.The intensity of the AEJ is weaker during the wet period. The vegetation change experiments also affect the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ), especially during wet years, by increasing its intensity over the southern Sahel. The analysis of the activity of African EasterlyWaves (AEWs) patterns exhibits a decrease of the intensity of these disturbances over the Sahel during both periods. This may be due to the weakening of the meridional temperature contrast between the continent and the Gulf of Guinea due to the Sahel-Sahara surface temperature cooling induced by the afforestation. In summary, this study shows that during both periods, the increase of the atmospheric moisture due to the afforestation is associated with favorable AEJ/TEJ configurations (weaker and northward position of the AEJ; stronger TEJ) which in turn may create a stronger convection and then, an increase in the Sahel rainfall. This Sahel rainfall increase is associated with a strengthening of the intense and heavy rainfall events which may impact diversely local populations. © 2018 by the authors.","Interannual variability; Rainfall; Reforestation; RegCM4; Temperature; West Africa; Wind dynamics",,Article,Scopus

It has received limited attention compared to other sources of ISIS revenues such as oil, looting, ransom, foreign donations and various forms of taxation. We estimate winter crops production of wheat and barley in ISIS-controlled areas in both Syria and Iraq for the years 2014–2015 and irrigated summer crops production (cotton) in Northeast Syria. We show that remote sensing can give a credible estimation of agricultural production in the absence of statistics. With evidence from MODIS Aqua and Terra Satellites as well as Landsat imagery, we find that agricultural production in ISIS-controlled Syrian and Iraqi zones has been sustained in 2014 and 2015, despite the detrimental impact of conflict. After a drought in 2014 production was able to capitalize on improved rainfalls in 2015. First indications show that the winter grain harvest of 2016 in Iraqi territories of ISIS was significantly above pre-conflict mean and below pre-conflict mean in its Syrian territories. We also show how water flows along the Euphrates have impacted production. We estimate the revenue that ISIS can derive from wheat and barley production and the likely magnitude of an exportable surplus. Agricultural production gives the group a degree of resilience, although its economy is not sustainable in the longer run and could be affected by military collapse. Taxation of recurrent income streams such as agriculture will become more important for ISIS as its extractive sources of revenues show signs of dwindling. Beside non-grain food imports, agricultural production is crucial for its political legitimacy by ensuring food provision to the broader population. Food security considerations would require a high priority in any post-ISIS reconstruction effort and would need to include the rehabilitation of supply chains for agricultural inputs such as quality seeds and fertilizers. © 2016 The Author(s)","Agriculture; Food security; Iraq; Remote sensing; Syria; Terrorism finance","agricultural development; crop production; finance; food provisioning; food security; food supply; GIS; income; MODIS; remote sensing; tax system; Terra (satellite); terrorism; Iraq; Syrian Arab Republic; Gossypium hirsutum; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

However, different stakeholders in the agri-food sector require different levels of accuracy and lead times in which a yield prediction should be available. For the producers, predictions during the growing season are essential to ensure that information is available early enough for the timely implementation of agronomic decisions, while industries can wait until later in the season to optimize their production process and increase their production traceability. In this study, we used machine learning algorithms, dynamic and static predictors, and a phenology approach to determine the time for issuing the yield prediction. In addition, the effect of data reduction was evaluated by comparing results obtained with and without principal component analysis (PCA). Gaussian process regression (GPR) was the best for predicting maize yield. Its best performance (nRMSE of 13.31%) was obtained late in the season and with the full set of predictors (vegetation indices, meteorological and soil predictors). In contrast, neural network (NNET) and support vector machines linear basis function (SVMl) achieved their best accuracy with only vegetation indices and at the tasseling phenological stage. Only slight differences in performance were observed between the algorithms considered, highlighting that the main factors influencing performance are the timing of the yield prediction and the predictors with which the machine learning algorithms are fed. Interestingly, PCA was instrumental in increasing the performances of NNET after this stage. An additional benefit of the application of PCA was the overall reduction between 12 and 30.20% in the standard deviation of the maize yield prediction performance from the leave one-year outer-loop cross-validation, depending on the feature set. © 2022 by the authors.","dimensionality reduction; machine learning; multi-source data; phenology; Sentinel-2; yield prediction","Data reduction; Food supply; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Supply chains; Support vector machines; Vegetation; Dimensionality reduction; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Maize yield; Multisource data; Performance; Phenology; Principal-component analysis; Sentinel-2; Yield prediction; Principal component analysis",Article,Scopus

At first, data types, phenotype traits, current ML models, and evaluation technique will be identified through a literature survey. This study found that the phenotype and genotype data are widely used in oil palm breeding programs. The average bunch weight, bunch number, and fresh fruit bunch are the most important characteristics that can influence the genetic improvement of progenies. Although machine learning approaches have been applied to increase the productivity of the crop, most studies focus on molecular markers or genotypes for plant breeding, rather than on phenotype. Theoretically, the use of phenotypic data related to offspring should predict high breeding values by using ML.

Yield is a complex trait and reliant on various related variables called yield components. In this study, the five most important yield component traits in soybean were measured using a panel of 250 genotypes grown in four environments. These traits were the number of nodes per plant (NP), number of non-reproductive nodes per plant (NRNP), number of reproductive nodes per plant (RNP), number of pods per plant (PP), and the ratio of number of pods to number of nodes per plant (P/N). These data were used for predicting the total soybean seed yield using the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Random Forest (RF), machine learning (ML) algorithms, individually and collectively through an ensemble method based on bagging strategy (E-B). The RBF algorithm with highest Coefficient of Determination (R2) value of 0.81 and the lowest Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of 148.61 kg.ha-1, and 185.31 kg.ha-1, respectively, was the most accurate algorithm and, therefore, selected as the meta- Classifier for the E-B algorithm.

Furthermore, for the first time in this study, we allied the E-B with the genetic algorithm (GA) to model the optimum values of yield components in an ideotype genotype in which the yield is maximized. The results revealed a better understanding of the relationships between soybean yield and its components, which can be used for selecting parental lines and designing promising crosses for developing cultivars with improved genetic yield potential. © 2021 Yoosefzadeh-Najafabadi et al.

In this chapter, artificial neural network (ANN) model is trained with three neighboring station-based wheat yields to predict the yield for two nearby objective stations that share a common geographic boundary in the agricultural belt of Pakistan. A total of 2700 ANN models (with a combination of hidden neurons, training algorithm, and hidden transfer/output functions) are developed by trial-and-error method, attaining the lowest mean square error, in which the 90 best-ranked models for 3-layered neuronal network are utilized for wheat prediction. Models such as learning algorithms comprised of pure linear, tangent, and logarithmic sigmoid equations in hidden transfer/output functions, executed by Levenberg-Marquardt, scaled conjugate gradient, conjugate gradient with Powell-Beale restarts, Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno quasi-Newton, Fletcher-Reeves update, one-step secant, conjugate gradient with Polak-Ribiére updates, gradient descent with adaptive learning, gradient descent with momentum, and gradient descent with momentum adaptive learning method are trained. For the predicted wheat yield at objective station 1 (i.e., Toba Taik Singh), the optimal architecture was 3-14-1 (input-hidden-output neurons) trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and logarithmic sigmoid as activation and tangent sigmoid as output function, while at objective station 2 (i.e., Bakkar), the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm provided the best architecture (3-20-1) with pure liner as activation and tangent sigmoid as output function. The results are benchmarked with those from minimax probability machine regression (MPMR) and genetic programming (GP) in accordance with statistical analysis of predicted yield based on correlations (r), Willmott’s index (WI), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (EV), root mean-squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). For objective station 1, the ANN model attained the r value of approximately 0.983, with WI ≈ 0.984 and EV ≈ 0.962, while the MPMR model attained r ≈ 0.957, WI ≈ 0.544, and EV ≈ 0.527, with the results attained by GP model, r ≈ 0.982, WI ≈ 0.980, and EV ≈ 0.955. For optimal ANN model, a relatively low value of RMSE ≈ 192.02 kg/ha and MAE ≈ 162.75 kg/ha was registered compared with the MPMR (RMSE ≈ 614.46 kg/ha; MAE ≈ 431.29 kg/ha) and GP model (RMSE ≈ 209.25 kg/ha; MAE ≈ 182.84 kg/ha). For both objective stations, ANN was found to be superior, as confirmed by a larger Legates-McCabe’s (LM) index used in conjunction with relative RMSE and MAE. Accordingly, it is averred that ANN is considered as a useful data-intelligent contrivance for predicting wheat yield by using nearest neighbor yield. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The combination of their high temporal frequency with their extended geographical coverage generally associated with low costs per area unit makes these images a convenient choice at both national and regional scales. Several qualitative and quantitative approaches can be clearly distinguished, going from the use of low resolution satellite imagery as the main predictor of final crop yield to complex crop growth models where remote sensing-derived indicators play different roles, depending on the nature of the model and on the availability of data measured on the ground. Vegetation performance anomaly detection with low resolution images continues to be a fundamental component of early warning and drought monitoring systems at the regional scale. For applications at more detailed scales, the limitations created by the mixed nature of low resolution pixels are being progressively reduced by the higher resolution offered by new sensors, while the continuity of existing systems remains crucial for ensuring the availability of long time series as needed by the majority of the yield prediction methods used today. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Agriculture; Low resolution; Remote sensing; Yield forecasts","Fundamental component; Geographical coverage; High temporal frequency; Low resolution; Low resolution images; Operational systems; Performance anomaly; Qualitative and quantitative approaches; Agriculture; Crops; Forecasting; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery",Review,Scopus

With an increasing amount of “big data” from earth observation and rapid advances in ML, increasing opportunities for novel methods have emerged to aid in earth environmental monitoring. Over the last decade, a typical and state-of-the-art ML framework named deep learning (DL), which is developed from the traditional neural network (NN), has outperformed traditional models with considerable improvement in performance. Substantial progress in developing a DL methodology for a variety of earth science applications has been observed. Therefore, this review will concentrate on the use of the traditional NN and DL methods to advance the environmental remote sensing process. First, the potential of DL in environmental remote sensing, including land cover mapping, environmental parameter retrieval, data fusion and downscaling, and information reconstruction and prediction, will be analyzed. A typical network structure will then be introduced. Afterward, the applications of DL environmental monitoring in the atmosphere, vegetation, hydrology, air and land surface temperature, evapotranspiration, solar radiation, and ocean color are specifically reviewed.

Without N constraint in ecosystem models, the simulated benefits from CO2 fertilization and CO2-induced increases in water use efficiency (WUE) may be overestimated. In this study, satellite observations of a relative measure of chlorophyll content are used as a proxy for leaf photosynthetic N content globally for 2003–2011. Global gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration are estimated under elevated CO2 and N-constrained model scenarios. Results suggest that the rate of global GPP increase is overestimated by 85% during 2000–2015 without N limitation. This limitation is found to occur in many tropical and boreal forests, where a negative leaf N trend indicates a reduction in photosynthetic capacity, thereby suppressing the positive vegetation response to enhanced CO2 fertilization. Based on our carbon-water coupled simulations, enhanced CO2 concentration decreased stomatal conductance and hence increased WUE by 10% globally over the 1982 to 2015 time frame. Due to increased anthropogenic N application, GPP in croplands continues to grow and offset the weak negative trend in forests due to N limitation. Our results also show that the improved WUE is unlikely to ease regional droughts in croplands because of increases in evapotranspiration, which are associated with the enhanced GPP. Although the N limitation on GPP increase is large, its associated confidence interval is still wide, suggesting an urgent need for better understanding and quantification of N limitation from satellite observations. ©2017.

The current study focused on a basin in the Brazilian Amazon and had the following three objectives: (1) to perform an effective diagnosis of flow and sediment yield, (2) to evaluate the impacts of LULC changes over the last 40 years on the hydro-sedimentological variables, and (3) to investigate the impacts of the possible trends or breaking points in the flow, surface runoff, and sediment yield series. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model validation showed that the simulated results were consistent with the data measured in the dynamic reproduction of flow seasonality. Furthermore, changes in LULC altered surface runoff, sediment yield, and flow according to the Mann-Kendall and Pettitt non-parametric tests. It was also observed that the sub-basins in which pastureland is predominant are more susceptible to increased surface runoff and sediment yield. According to trend and homogeneity tests, these sub-basins had break points in the time series of these variables. On the other hand, in the sub-basins whose land cover is predominantly forest, the time series is homogeneous and trendless. The current study highlighted the impacts that 40 years of LULC changes in an Amazonian basin had on hydro-sedimentological variables, which, in turn, can play an important role in changing the hydrological cycle, consequently these changes can also impact diverse human activities in the region, such as agribusiness, livestock, energy production, food security, and public water supply. Thus, it is concluded that the SWAT model is a good estimator of hydro-sedimentological processes in Amazonian basins and can be used by decision makers in the management of water and environmental resources. © 2021 International Research and Training Centre on Erosion and Sedimentation / the World Association for Sedimentation and Erosion Research","Amazon basin; Hydrological modeling; Sediment yield; SWAT model","hydrological cycle; hydrological modeling; land cover; land use change; runoff; sediment yield; sedimentology; soil and water assessment tool; Amazon Basin; Brazil",Article,Scopus

In agriculture, more efficient use of natural resources is at the heart of sustainable intensification. However, technical improvements do not directly translate into resource savings because producers and consumers adapt their behaviour to such improvements, often resulting in a rebound effect, where part or all of the potential resource savings are offset. In extreme cases, increases in efficiency may even result in higher, instead of lower, resource consumption (the Jevons paradox). Rebound effects are particularly complex in agricultural land and soil management, where multiple resources are used simultaneously and efficiency gains aim to lower the need for farmland, water, energy, nutrients, pesticides, and greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, quantification of rebound effects is a prerequisite for generating realistic scenarios of global food provision and for advancing the debate on land sparing versus land sharing. However, studies that provide an overview of rebound effects related to the resources used in agriculture or guidelines for assessing potential rebound effects from future innovations are lacking. This paper contributes to closing this gap by reviewing the current state of knowledge and developing a framework for a structured appraisal of rebound effects. As a test case, the proposed framework is applied to emerging technologies and practices in agricultural soil management in Germany. The literature review revealed substantial evidence of rebound effects or even Jevons’ paradox with regard to efficiency increases in land productivity and irrigation water use. By contrast, there were few studies addressing rebound effects from efficiency increases in fertilizer use, pesticide application, agricultural energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions. While rebound effects are by definition caused by behavioural adaptations of humans, in agriculture also natural adaptations occur, such as resistance of pests to certain pesticides. Future studies should consider extending the definition of rebound effects to such natural adaptations. The test case revealed the potential for direct and indirect economic rebound effects of a number of emerging technologies and practices, such as improved irrigation technologies, which increase water productivity and may thereby contribute to increases in irrigated areas and total water use. The results of this study indicated that rebound effects must be assessed to achieve realistic estimates of resource savings from efficiency improvements and to enable informed policy choices. The framework developed in this paper is the first to facilitate such assessments. © 2019 The Authors","Agriculture; Efficiency; Impact assessment; Irrigation; Jevons paradox; Land sparing","Agriculture; Agronomy; Behavioral research; Economic analysis; Efficiency; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Pesticide effects; Productivity; Soils; Water management; Water supply; Efficiency improvement; Emerging technologies; Impact assessments; Irrigation water use; Jevons paradox; Pesticide applications; Resource consumption; Technical improvement; Economic and social effects",Review,Scopus

Therefore, knowledge of pasture above-ground canopy features help understand the crop status. This paper finds how to construct machine learning models to predict above-ground canopy features in Brachiaria pasture from ground truth data (GTD) and remote sensing at larger (satellite data on the cloud) and smaller (unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)) scales. First, we used above-ground biomass (AGB) data obtained from Brachiaria to evaluate the relationship between vegetation indices (VIs) with the dry matter (DM). Next, the performance of machine learning algorithms was used for predicting AGB based on VIs obtained from ground truth and satellite and UAV imagery. When comparing more than twenty-five machine learning models using an Auto Machine Learning Python API, the results show that the best algorithms were the Huber with R2 = 0.60, Linear with R2 = 0.54, and Extra Trees with R2 = 0.45 to large scales using satellite. On the other hand, short-scale best regressions are K Neighbors with an R2 of 0.76, Extra Trees with an R2 of 0.75, and Bayesian Ridge with an R2 of 0.70, demonstrating a high potential to predict AGB and DM.

Lowering the groundwater in natural and man-made slopes can help to mitigate the hazards. Subsurface drainage systems equipped with pumps have traditionally been regarded as a temporary remedy for lowering the groundwater in geosystems, whereas long-term usage of pumping-based techniques is uncommon due to the associated high operational costs in labor and energy. This study investigates the intelligent control of groundwater in slopes enabled by deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a subfield of machine learning for automated decision-making. The purpose is to develop an autonomous geosystem that can minimize the operating cost and enhance the system’s safety without introducing human errors and interventions. To prove the concept, a seepage analysis model was implemented using a partial differential equation solver, FEniCS, to simulate the geosystem (i.e., a slope equipped with a pump and subjected to rainfall events). A Deep Q-Network (i.e., a DRL learning agent) was trained to learn the optimal control policy for regulating the pump’s flow rate. The objective is to enable intermittent control of the pump’s flow rate (i.e., 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the pumping capacity) to keep the groundwater close to the target level during rainfall events and consequently help to prevent slope failure. A comparison of the results with traditional proportional-integral-derivative-controlled and uncontrolled water tables showed that the geosystem integrated with DRL can dynamically adapt its response to diverse weather events by adjusting the pump’s flow rate and improve the adopted control policy by gaining more experience over time. In addition, it was observed that the DRL control helped to mitigate slope failure during rainfall events. © 2022 by the authors.","Deep Q-Network; deep reinforcement learning; intelligent control; landslide; seepage analysis; slope stability analysis","Decision making; Deep learning; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Pumps; Rain; Reinforcement learning; Seepage; Two term control systems; Deep Q-network; Deep reinforcement learning; Energy; Geosystems; Rainfall event; Reinforcement learnings; Seepage analysis; Slope failure; Slope stability analysis; Subsurface drainage system; Landslides; ground water; human; machine learning; Groundwater; Humans; Machine Learning",Article,Scopus

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of an AquaCrop model for maize growth simulation under different soil conditions (humic acid (HA) and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)) and dosages and different levels of irrigation in the Shandong coastal saline–alkali area, China, and to optimize the amount of irrigation. Three years of experiments were carried out in the growing season of maize (Ludan 510) in 2019, 2020, and 2021. The dosages of HA were 5, 15, 25, and 35 g/m2, the dosages of CMC were 1, 2, 3, and 5 g/m2, and the levels of irrigation from 2019 to 2021 were all 120 mm. The model was calibrated with data from 2019, and the model was verified with data from 2020 to 2021, according to the recommended corn parameters in the AquaCrop model manual. The results showed that the model had a good simulation effect on canopy coverage, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of less than 15.2%, and the simulated aboveground biomass and yield were generally low. The simulated value of soil water content was generally high, with some treatments having errors of more than 15.0%. The simulation effect of irrigated maize from 2019 to 2020 was better than maize in 2021. The simulation effect of HA was better than that of CMC, while the simulation effect of a low-gradient modifier was better than that of high-gradient conditioner when compared with CMC. In conclusion, the AquaCrop model could be a viable method for predicting maize development under different soil conditioners in this area. The suitable levels of irrigation under HA and CMC treatments were 47.0–65.9 mm and 61.0–92.4 mm, respectively, according to the principle of high yield and water use efficiency. The results provided a reference for optimizing the drip irrigation of maize under the application of soil conditioners in coastal saline–alkali areas. © 2022 by the authors.

Here we assess the WUE of maize in the Hetao Irrigation District, which is a representative irrigation district in the arid region of Northwest China. Specifically, we firstly mapped the location of the maize field by using a remote sensing/phenological–based vegetation classifier and then quantified the maize water use and yield by using a dual-source remote-sensing evapotranspiration (ET) model and a crop water production function, respectively. Validation results show that the adopted phenological-based vegetation classifier performed well in mapping the spatial distributions and inter-annual variations of maize planting, with a kappa coefficient of 0.86. In addition, the ET model based on the hybrid dual-source scheme and trapezoid framework also obtained high accuracy in spatiotemporal ET mapping, with an RMSE of 0.52 mm/day at the site scale and 26.21 mm/year during the maize growing season (April–October) at the regional scale. Further, the adopted crop water production function showed high accuracy in estimating the maize yield, with a mean relative error of only 4.3%. Using the estimated ET, transpiration, and yield of maize, the mean maize WUE based on ET and transpiration in the study region were1.94 kg/m3 and 3.06 kg/m3, respectively.

Owing to the demand and supply gap may diminish food production due to diseases in plants, such as bacterial disease, viral disease, and fungal diseases. Early recognition of such diseases and applying an appropriate pesticide or fertiliser can improve crop yield. Accordingly, early plant disease detection necessitates continuous crop monitoring from its initial stages. Recently some research works have been proposed as remedial measures. However, such methodologies utilise costly equipment that is infeasible for small-scale farmers. Thus, there is a need for a cost-effective plant-disease-detection approach. This study embellishes the challenges and opportunities in plant disease detection. Correspondingly, this research proposes an ensemble deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis approach using a combination of AlexNet, ResNet50, and VGG16 deep learning-based models. It effectively ascertains plant diseases by analysing the plant leaf images. A broad set of experiments were conducted using different plant leaf image datasets such as cherry, grape, maize, pepper, potato, strawberry, and cardamom to evaluate the robustness of the proposed approach.

It is well known that temporal assessment of land surface temperature and UHI are inevitable for city planning and ecosystem monitoring. Landsat-derived LST is widely used for urban temperature studies including the study of the urban heat island (UHI). In this study, remote sensing (RS) techniques have been used for the estimation and forecasting of LST and identification of UHI in one of the fast-growing cities of Tamil Nadu state, India, using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. Satellite data between the period 2008 and 2018 was used in the model study. Analysis of the images and model results show that there is a progressive increasing trend of LST in built-up areas. LST values obtained from model study exhibited a negative relationship with land use and land cover (LULC) for Chennai city and surrounding area.

As a result, models calibrated in one region cannot normally be migrated to another without significant modifications. Currently in these regions, non-transferable machine learning models are habitually trained over small local data sets. Here we show that transfer learning (TL), in the senses of weight initialization and weight freezing, allows long short-term memory (LSTM) streamflow models that were pretrained over the conterminous United States (CONUS, the source data set) to be transferred to catchments on other continents (the target regions), without the need for extensive catchment attributes available at the target location. We demonstrate this possibility for regions where data are dense (664 basins in Great Britain), moderately dense (49 basins in central Chile), and scarce with only remotely sensed attributes available (5 basins in China). In both China and Chile, the TL models showed significantly elevated performance compared to locally trained models using all basins. The benefits of TL increased with the amount of available data in the source data set, and seemed to be more pronounced with greater physiographic diversity. The benefits from TL were greater than from pretraining LSTM using the outputs from an uncalibrated hydrologic model. These results suggest hydrologic data around the world have commonalities which could be leveraged by deep learning, and synergies can be had with a simple modification of the current workflows, greatly expanding the reach of existing big data.

Thus, appropriate and reliable yield forecasts are fundamental to ensure price stability and food security around the globe. In this study, we developed a Machine Learning (ML) approach to combine satellite and climate data with antecedent wheat yield information (YieldBaseLine) from 2004 – 2018, at municipal level, in Mexico. We compared the performance of four linear (generalized linear model –glm-, ridge regression –ridge-, lasso, partial least squares –pls-) and four non-linear algorithms (k-nearest neighbours –kknn-, support vector machine radial –svmR-, extreme gradient boosting -xgbTree- and random forest –rf) before harvest time. Additionally, we evaluated their performance using five different feature selection scenarios (No FS, FS = 0.9, FS = 0.75, FS = 0.9 and YieldBaseLine). The models were independently tested using two different approaches: random sampling and selective sampling. In the random sampling, the non-linear models performed generally better under the FS = 0.5 scenario, whereas the non-linear models were less sensitive to feature reduction. The results also evidenced the capacity of the YieldBaseLine predictor, combined with satellite and climate data, to address the inter-annual and spatial variability in the study area. The highest prediction accuracy was obtained by the rf method (No FS) with R2 = 0.84. To further prove the model's operability in a simulated real-case scenario, we held out the last year records (2018) to test the models. The best performing model was again the rf (R2 = 0.81). This study proposes a robust methodology to model crop yield (at large scale) and it may be used with operative purposes. Therefore, it can be of interest to decision and law makers, producers, authorities or the wheat industry. In addition, it can help to establish appropriate food security and trading policies.

Five relevant vegetation indices, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), rice growth vegetation index (RGVI), moisture stress index (MSI), and leaf area index (LAI), were used to develop several empirical yield prediction models for rice production. For this research, Sentinel-2 images with 10 m spatial resolution was used for the haor area of Bangladesh. To calibrate and validate the remote sensing images at such large spatial and temporal scales, ground reference data of the vegetation indices were used. The generated models were validated using both parametric (simple and multiple) and nonparametric (artificial neural network, ANN) regression analyses. The crop yield models that were developed using regression analyses showed very significant agreement with the ground reference yield information. The best estimated performances for the RGVI (R2 = 0.44), NDVI (R2=0.63), NDVI (R2 = 0.55), and NDVI (R2 = 0.67) in the simple regression analyses were observed for 2017, 2018, and 2019 and the average of seasons from 2017 to 2019. On the other hand, the composite NDVI-RGVI (R2 = 0.65), NDVI-NDWI (R2 = 0.56), and NDVI-MSI (R2 = 0.69) indices were the best-performing vegetation indices for developing boro rice yield prediction models using multiple regression. Nevertheless, in the ANN-based machine-learning results, NDVI exhibited higher accuracy for the average boro rice season (2017–2019) by using a simple regression approach (R2 = 0.84) and multiple regression analysis (R2 = 0.91) of the average NDVI-MSI composite index. Validation between the actual and predicted yields showed that more than 70% of the study area can be accurately predicted using vegetation indices with ground reference mean yield data. Moreover, in 2018, the predicted yields by using simple and multiple linear regression were 4.25 and 4.23 MT/ha, respectively. The developed models are applicable 118–132 days after planting (DAT) in any similar environment for agricultural practices. Therefore, the yield prediction models of boro rice at the maturity stage can be useful for farm risk management, insurance premium determinations, and relevant stakeholder decision-making to mitigate the effects of extreme flash flood events. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial neural network; Boro rice; Flash flood; Regression analyses; Remote sensing; Satellite; Vegetation indices; Yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

However, many statistical prediction models using remote sensing data cannot extend to the regional scale without considering the regional climate. This paper first introduced the hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) method to solve maize-yield prediction problems over years and regions. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), calculated by the spectrum of the Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI), and meteorological data were introduced as input parameters in the maize-yield prediction model proposed in this paper. We built models using 100 samples from 10 areas, and used 101 other samples from 34 areas to evaluate the model’s performance in Jilin province. HLM provided higher accuracy with an adjusted determination coefficient equal to 0.75, root mean square error (RMSEV) equal to 0.94 t/ha, and normalized RMSEV equal to 9.79%. Results showed that the HLM approach outperformed linear regression (LR) and multiple LR (MLR) methods. The HLM method based on the Landsat 8 OLI NDVI and meteorological data could flexibly adjust in different regional climatic conditions. They had higher spatiotemporal expansibility than that of widely used yield estimation models (e.g., LR and MLR). This is helpful for the accurate management of maize fields. © 2021 by the authors.

First, a diagnostic statistical test based on the correlation coefficient is performed to determine relationships between inputs denoting historical behaviour and the target (Hsig) at one lag of 30-min (t – 1) scale. Subsequently, the data are split into training and testing subsets, following a normalization process, and the MLR-CWLS hybridized model is then trained and validated on the testing dataset adopted from eastern coastal zones of Australia that has a high potential for wave energy generation. Hybridized MLR-CWLS model is benchmarked against competing modelling approaches (multivariate adaptive regression splines-MARS, M5 Model Tree, and MLR) via statistical score metrics. The results show that the hybridized MLR-CWLS model is able to generate reliable forecasts of Hsig relative to the counterpart comparison models.

The post-processing method comprises: (1) the Yeo-Johnson transformation to handle the non-normal distribution of daily ETo, (2) the bi-variate normal distribution to formulate the relationship between transformed raw forecasts and observations, and (3) the Schaake shuffle to establish realistic temporal behaviour in each ensemble member. For three distinct Australian case-study locations, ETo forecasts derived from raw ACCESS-S1 outputs are positively correlated with observations up to 16 days ahead. However, raw forecasts verify more poorly than naïve climatology forecasts because of significant bias and poor ensemble spreads. Post-processing the raw ACCESS-S1 ETo improves skill and reliability markedly. Skilful daily ETo forecasts are achieved in the first week, and the skill of cumulative ETo forecasts extends beyond two weeks into the future.

For large-scale watershed modeling, weather data are either generated by using interpolation methods or derived from assimilated datasets. In the present study, we compared model performances of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), as driven by interpolation weather data, and NASA North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase Two (NLDAS2) weather dataset in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). The SWAT model fed with different weather datasets were used to simulate monthly stream flow at 11 United States Geological Survey (USGS) monitoring stations in the UMRB. Model performances were evaluated based on three metrics: coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS), and percent bias (Pbias). The results show that, after calibration, the SWAT model compared well at all monitoring stations for monthly stream flow using different weather datasets indicating that the SWAT model can adequately produce long-term water yield in UMRB. The results also show that using NLDAS2 weather dataset can improve SWAT prediction of monthly stream flow with less prediction uncertainty in the UMRB. We concluded that NLDAS2 dataset could be used by the SWAT model for large-scale watersheds like UMRB as a surrogate of the interpolation weather data. Further analyses results show that NLDAS2 daily solar radiation data was about 2.5 MJ m-2 higher than the interpolation data. As such, the SWAT model driven by NLDAS2 dataset tended to underestimate stream flow in the UMRB due to the overestimation in evapotranspiration in uncalibrated conditions. Thus, the implication of overestimated solar radiation by NLDAS2 dataset should be considered before using NLDAS2 dataset to drive the hydrological model. © 2019 by the authors.","Reanalysis climate data; Stream flow; SWAT; Watershed modeling","Interpolation; Large dataset; Meteorology; NASA; Rivers; Solar radiation; Stream flow; Watersheds; Climate data; Coefficient of determination; Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient; North american land data assimilation systems; Soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; United states geological surveys; Watershed modeling; Digital storage; data set; evapotranspiration; hydrological modeling; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; water yield; watershed; Mississippi River; United States",Article,Scopus

Many successful applications have been made in crop yield estimation using remotely sensed products, such as vegetation index (VI) from multispectral imagery. However, VI-based approaches are only suitable for estimating rice grain yield at the middle stage of growth but have limited capability at the ripening stage. In this study, an efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was proposed to learn the important features related to rice grain yield from low-altitude remotely sensed imagery. In one major region for rice cultivation of Southern China, a 160-hectare site with over 800 management units was chosen to investigate the ability of CNN in rice grain yield estimation. The datasets of RGB and multispectral images were obtained by a fixed-wing, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which was mounted with a digital camera and multispectral sensors. The network was trained with different datasets and compared against the traditional vegetation index-based method. In addition, the temporal and spatial generality of the trained network was investigated. The results showed that the CNNs trained by RGB and multispectral datasets perform much better than VIs-based regression model for rice grain yield estimation at the ripening stage. The RGB imagery of very high spatial resolution contains important spatial features with respect to grain yield distribution, which can be learned by deep CNN.

However, the transformation of data into knowledge for decision making remains a major challenge. In the Brazilian sugarcane industry, the current use of PA technology is very far from its full potential for site-specific management, mainly because yields are not temporally or spatially monitored. The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the physical and chemical properties of soils and sugarcane yield, thereby identifying the soil parameters that determine the final productivity of the field. Two sugarcane fields were monitored from 2011 to 2014. During the crop season, soil samples and yield data were collected annually. A random forest algorithm was applied to investigate the influence of different soil attributes on yield using data that were collected spatially over the study period. The results showed that the amount of available soil organic matter (OM), clay content and cation exchange capacity (CEC) are important factors impacting sugarcane yield variation. Furthermore, it was found that the temporal variability in yield is caused mainly by the variability in soil pH over the study period.

However, preprocessing of critical data such as soils information can be laborious and time-consuming. The objective of this work was to preprocess the Soil Landscapes of Canada (SLC) database to offer a country-level soils dataset in a format ready to be used in SWAT simulations. A twolevel screening process was used to identify critical information required by SWAT and to remove records with information that could not be calculated or estimated. Out of the 14 063 unique soil records in the SLC, 11 838 records with complete information were included in the dataset presented here. Important variables for SWAT simulations that are not reported in the SLC database (e.g., hydrologic soils groups (HSGs) and erodibility factor (K)) were calculated from information contained within the SLC database. These calculations, in fact, represent a major contribution to enabling the present dataset to be used for hydrological simulations in Canada using SWAT and other comparable models. Analysis of those variables indicated that 21.3 %, 24.6 %, 39.0 %, and 15.1% of the soil records in Canada belong to HSGs 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. This suggests that almost twothirds of the soil records have a high (i.e., HSG 4) or relatively high (i.e., HSG 3) runoff generation potential. A spatial analysis indicated that 20.0 %, 26.8 %, 36.7 %, and 16.5% of soil records belonged to HSG 1, HSG 2, HSG 3, and HSG 4, respectively. Erosion potential, which is inherently linked to the erodibility factor (K), was associated with runoff potential in important agricultural areas such as southern Ontario and Nova Scotia. However, contrary to initial expectations, low or moderate erosion potential was found in areas with high runoff potential, such as regions in southern Manitoba (e.g., Red River Valley) and British Columbia (e.g., Peace River watershed).

However, studies have identified deficiencies in the auto-irrigation algorithms in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) including the continuation of irrigation during the non-growing season and an inability to simulate growth stage-specific irrigation. Consequently, new and representative auto-irrigation algorithms were developed using 1) a uniform, single season MAD and 2) a growth stage-specific MAD with options for seasonal growth stage partitioning based on scheduled date and accumulated heat units.

Both existing grasslands and marginal croplands have been suggested as targets for conversion to switchgrass, but the resulting production potentials and hydrologic impacts are not clear. The objectives of this study were to model switchgrass production on existing grasslands (scenario-I) and on marginal croplands that have severe to very severe limitations for crop production (scenario-II) and to evaluate the effects on evapotranspiration (ET) and streamflow. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to the 1063 km2 Skeleton Creek watershed in north-central Oklahoma, a watershed dominated by grasslands (35%) and winter wheat cropland (47%). The simulated average annual yield (2002–2011) for rainfed Alamo switchgrass for both scenarios was 12 Mg ha-1. Yield varied spatially under scenario-I from 6.1 to 15.3 Mg ha-1, while under scenario-II the range was from 8.2 to 13.8 Mg ha-1. Comparison of average annual ET and streamflow between the baseline simulation (existing land use) and scenario-I showed that scenario-I had 5.6% (37 mm) higher average annual ET and 27.7% lower streamflow, representing a 40.7 million m3 yr-1 streamflow reduction. Compared to the baseline, scenario-II had only 0.5% higher ET and 3.2% lower streamflow, but some monthly impacts were larger. In this watershed, the water yield reduction per ton of biomass production (i.e. hydrologic cost-effectiveness ratio) was more than 5X greater under scenario-I than under scenario-II. These results suggest that, from a hydrologic perspective, it may be preferable to convert marginal cropland to switchgrass production rather than converting existing grasslands. © 2017, Public Library of Science.

Energy crops such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and miscanthus (Miscanthus X giganteus) can grow well throughout the continental United States; however, most studies on the water quality impacts of land-use change from bioenergy policy are based in the Midwest. Insufficient research has been conducted to determine whether the results from the Midwest are applicable to other regions in the United States. This study compares water quality impacts of converting from corn to switchgrass in the Midwest (Upper Cedar watershed) and Southeast (Lumber watershed) with nitrogen loading to surface water as a proxy metric for overall water quality impacts using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The analysis shows that the fraction of nitrogen runoff compared to the fertilizer applied is 36% in Upper Cedar as compared to 6% in Lumber. Existing management practices like tile-drainage and land-cover like riparian wetlands contribute to this difference in the baseline nitrate export from each watershed. The potential reduction in nitrogen loading per potential liter of ethanol to surface waters, which account for both nitrate export and productivities, from the baseline corn-soy to switchgrass is about 40% for the Upper Cedar watershed and around 80% for the Lumber watershed. Although, the trend in reduction is similar in both watersheds, this study shows that results extrapolated from the Midwest may not be representative of other bioenergy producing regions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Land-use change; Nitrogen; Panicum virgatum L.; Switchgrass; Water quality","Crops; Cultivation; Land use; Lumber; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Plants (botany); Water quality; Watersheds; Bio-energy; Land-use change; Management practices; Miscanthus x giganteus; Panicum virgatum l; Regional differences; Soil and water assessment tool; Switchgrass; Surface waters; bioenergy; biomass power; energy crop; environmental impact assessment; grass; land use change; management practice; nitrate; nitrogen; runoff; soil and water assessment tool; water quality; wetland; Midwest; United States; Miscanthus; Miscanthus x giganteus; Panicum virgatum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

However, it is still challenging to model crop yields based on remotely sensed data due to the variation in radiation use efficiency (RUE) across crop types and the effects of spatial heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a production efficiency model-based method to estimate corn and soybean yields with MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data by explicitly handling the following two issues: (1) field-measured RUE values for corn and soybean are applied to relatively pure pixels instead of the biome-wide RUE value prescribed in the MODIS vegetation productivity product (MOD17); and (2) contributions to productivity from vegetation other than crops in mixed pixels are deducted at the level of MODIS resolution. Our estimated yields statistically correlate with the national survey data for rainfed counties in the Midwestern US with low errors for both corn (R2 = 0.77; RMSE = 0.89 MT/ha) and soybeans (R2 = 0.66; RMSE = 0.38 MT/ha). Because the proposed algorithm does not require any retrospective analysis that constructs empirical relationships between the reported yields and remotely sensed data, it could monitor crop yields over large areas. © 2013 by the authors.","Crop yield; Modis gpp; Radiation use efficiency; Remote sensing; Spatial heterogeneity","Crops; Efficiency; Pixels; Productivity; Radiation effects; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Vegetation; Crop yield; Empirical relationships; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer datum; Modis gpp; Radiation use efficiency; Remote sensing techniques; Spatial heterogeneity; Vegetation productivity; Data handling",Article,Scopus

In agricultural systems, the growing demand for stable crop production requires the adoption of useful tools for the sustainable intensification of agriculture. While organic farming systems face various drawbacks, which affect crop yield. Among the limiting factors, weed management is one of the most difficult aspects of organic farming. Objective: The aim of the study was (i) to evaluate the effect of weed pressure on yield spatial variability (ii) to analyze the spatial variability of yield and yield components based on hand-sampled yield data (iii) to evaluate the ability of the most commonly used vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Sentinel-2 satellite platforms to understand within-field spatial and temporal variability during the crop cycle (iv) to evaluate the ability of the cluster analysis procedures on NDVI satellite data to identify, discriminate and map sub-areas with different yield, yield components, and weed pressure at the farm level in an organic farming system. Methods: Remote sensing techniques (Sentinel-2 images), vegetation index (NDVI), cluster analysis (Hierarchical clustering Ward's minimum variance approach) and hand-sampled data (georeferenced yield and yield components field data) were used for understanding the spatio-temporal behavior of crops. Results and conclusions: The cluster analysis of NDVI data from Sentinel-2 collected at eight different stages detected the crop spatial and temporal variability at an early stage. In an open field of 24 ha, an area of about 9 ha, showed a high weed level with a yield average value 78 % lower than the most productive cluster area. The yield components, especially the spike number per square meter, also recorded very low values, mainly due to the negative effect of the high presence of weeds (in particular oats), which reached average values of 250 g m-2. An area of 7.3 ha showed the highest yield at harvest with a yield value 45 % higher than the mean harvest data. The study highlights that from the early tillering stage to the booting stage the NDVI maps derived from the Satellite Sentinel-2 and clustered by Ward's method represent the weeds distribution impact on crop yield and yield components and an early warning for the assessment of one of the most important limiting factors in organic farming. Significance: Sentinel-2 data and cluster analysis can improve an efficient assessment and management strategies in an organic farming agricultural system. Furthermore, the use of precision agriculture tools in organic farming can lead to a site‐specific management at the farm level and therefore a sustainable intensification of agriculture systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","NDVI; Remote sensing; Spatio-temporal; Sustainable yield; Weed; Wheat",,Article,Scopus

Producing these maps at detailed scales requires exhaustive field surveys that can be laborious, time-consuming, and expensive to replicate. With a growing archive of remote sensing data, there are enormous opportunities to exploit dense satellite image time series (SITS), temporal sequences of images over the same area. Generally, crop type mapping relies on single-sensor inputs and is solved with the help of traditional learning algorithms such as random forests or support vector machines. Nowadays, deep learning techniques have brought significant improvements by leveraging information in both spatial and temporal dimensions, which are relevant in crop studies. The concurrent availability of Sentinel-1 (synthetic aperture radar) and Sentinel-2 (optical) data offers a great opportunity to utilize them jointly; however, optimizing their synergy has been understudied with deep learning techniques. In this work, we analyze and compare three fusion strategies (input, layer, and decision levels) to identify the best strategy that optimizes optical-radar classification performance. They are applied to a recent architecture, notably, the pixel-set encoder–temporal attention encoder (PSE-TAE) developed specifically for object-based classification of SITS and based on self-attention mechanisms. Experiments are carried out in Brittany, in the northwest of France, with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series. Input and layer-level fusion competitively achieved the best overall F-score surpassing decision-level fusion by 2%. On a per-class basis, decision-level fusion increased the accuracy of dominant classes, whereas layer-level fusion improves up to 13% for minority classes. Against single-sensor baseline, multi-sensor fusion strategies identified crop types more accurately: for example, input-level outperformed Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 by 3% and 9% in F-score, respectively. We have also conducted experiments that showed the importance of fusion for early time series classification and under high cloud cover condition. © 2021 by the authors.

The core element of the framework is the derivation of a composite agricultural performance index which is composed of different subindicators taking into account cropping intensity, crop diversity, crop rotations, fallow land frequency, land utilization, water use efficiency, and water availability. We derive these subindicators from net primary productivity and evapotranspiration data obtained from the MODIS sensor on board the Terra satellite during the observation period from 2000 to 2016, as well as from cropland maps created through multiannual classification of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We classified pixel-based NDVI time series covering more than 8 × 106 ha of irrigated cropland based on a hierarchical approach concatenating unsupervised and supervised classification techniques to automatically generate and refine training labels, which are then used to train a decision fusion classifier, achieving an average overall accuracy of 78%. The results give unprecedented insights into spatial patterns of agricultural performance in the ASB.

While modelers and water managers rely on stand-alone ET estimation model application in their planning and management, several uncertainties including model structure, parameter set, and initial condition exist, cascading in ET calculation leading to inaccurate results. In this study, an ensemble data assimilation approach is employed to explore the benefit of remotely sensed actual ET to improve the simulations of the widely used Priestley-Taylor ET model while accounting for uncertainties. The study is conducted at farm-scale for three different crops (corn, cotton, and soybean) in the Mobile River basin in Deep South United States, which has experienced severe droughts during the cropping seasons in the past. Prior to employing data assimilation, the Priestley-Taylor model is modified for each crop to simulate actual ET instead of reference ET. Following which the model is calibrated over 320,000 farms in the river basin for identifying the optimal parameters. The calibrated model is later used for the Open-Loop simulation, as well as in the development and implementation of data assimilation. The simulated and observed actual ET is used to calculate the Kalman gain and update the model initialization every time step during the assimilation period.

Over the last few years, global potato production has been increasing. This growth has created many opportunities for developing a wide range of value-added products from these crops. However, this requires monitoring the quality components of the tubers, such as moisture content, starch content, and soluble solid content. In particular, moisture content is one of the key quality parameters important for ensuring quality control throughout the supply chain and processing for consumer consumption. Ideally, moisture content would be estimated at the field level; however, current methods used by the industry to assess moisture content are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and destructive. Hence, the purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of hyperspectral imaging to quantify the moisture content of unpeeled potatoes before they were subsequently stored and processed. Hyperspectral images are collected from 47 intact potato tubers, with partial least squares regression (PLSR) models developed to predict moisture content from these spectra. The models showed predictive abilities for moisture content with acceptable ratios of prediction to deviation (RPDs) when considering the complete wavelength range (R2 = 0.53, RPD = 1.46, root mean square error (RMSE) = 5.04%) or the β-coefficient wavelength selection technique (R2 = 0.53, RPD = 1.47, RMSE = 5.02%). Furthermore, the prediction ability increased by more than 10% when the model wavelength was narrowed down to 733–970 nm. This study demonstrates the potential of using hyperspectral imaging for the quality assessment of intact, unpeeled potatoes, although further work is required to improve the model quality and implement this approach using remote sensing imagery. © 2022 by the authors.","hyperspectral imaging; infield assessment; moisture content; post-harvest handling; potato",,Article,Scopus

In pistachio trees, as in other woody crops, the volume of the canopy is a key factor that affects the pistachio crop load, water requirements, and quality. However, canopy/crown monitoring is time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it is traditionally carried out by measuring tree dimensions in the field. Therefore, methods for rapid tree canopy characterization are needed for providing accurate information that can be used for management decisions. The present study focuses on developing a new, fast, and low-cost technique, based on two main steps, for estimating the canopy volume in pistachio trees. The first step is based on adequately planning the UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) flight according to light conditions and segmenting the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) imagery using machine learning methods. The second step is based on measuring vegetation planar area and ground shadows using two methodological approaches: a pixel-based classification approach and an OBIA (object-based image analysis) approach. The results show statistically significant linear relationships (p &lt; 0.05) between the ground-truth data and the estimated volume of pistachio tree crowns, with R2 &gt; 0.8 (pixel-based classification) and R2 &gt; 0.9 (OBIA). The proposed methodologies show potential benefits for accurately monitoring the vegetation of the trees. Moreover, the method is compatible with other remote sensing techniques, usually performed at solar noon, so UAV operators can plan a flexible working day. Further research is needed to verify whether these results can be extrapolated to other woody crops. © 2022 by the authors.","aerial; drone; image analysis; leaf area; machine learning; pistachio; precision agriculture; random forest; spatial variability","Agricultural robots; Antennas; Crops; Forestry; Image analysis; Machine learning; Pixels; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Vegetation mapping; Aerial vehicle; Image-analysis; Leaf area; Machine-learning; Pistachio; Precision Agriculture; Random forests; Red green blues; Spatial variability; Woody crop; Drones",Article,Scopus

On-farm agroforestry systems can reduce dependency on off-farm fuel; however, the output of on-farm produced fuel is typically uncertain as production potentials are often not known. In this paper, we have developed allometric equations to model the above-ground woody biomass (AGWB) production from intercropped Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp (Gliricidia) shrubs and Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. (pigeon pea) plants. Methods: We used a destructive sampling approach, for measuring the dendrometric characteristics, such as the root collar diameter at a 20 cm stem height (RCD20) and the stem height to estimate the AGWB production. The models are based on 112 Gliricidia and 80 pigeon pea observations from annually pruned plants. Seven allometric equations were fitted to derive the best-fit models for the AGWB production. Results: We found that using a natural log-transformed linear model with RCD20 as a single predictor variable provides the highest explanatory value to estimate the AGWB production (Gliricidia: R2 = 95.7%, pigeon pea: R2 = 91.4%) while meeting Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimator requirements. Adding stem height as an additional variable to predict the AGWB production does not improve model accuracy enough to justify the extra work for including it. Conclusions: While on-farm pigeon pea plants produced a stable amount of woody biomass per annum, annual fuelwood production from Gliricidia shrubs increased over the years. Compared to the annual fuelwood consumption data from the literature, our results show that on-farm produced fuelwood can substantially offset the demand for off-farm fuel, potentially resulting in household fuelwood autarky. © 2021, The Author(s).","Agroforestry; Energy mix; Energy self-sufficiency; Food security; Intercropping; Smallholder farmer","Biomass; Deforestation; Fuels; Wood products; Above-ground woody biomass; Agroforestry; Biomass productions; Energy mix; Energy self-sufficiency; Food security; Fuelwood; Intercropping; Pigeon pea; Smallholder farmers; Food supply; allometry; crop production; estimation method; legume; semiarid region; shrub; spatiotemporal analysis; Tanzania; Cajanus cajan; Gliricidia; Gliricidia sepium",Article,Scopus

The salt-affected soil is predominant in the Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve (ELWNNR) in the Northwestern China. It influences the development of agricultural economy. Rapid and accurate measurement of the soil salt content (SSC) is significant for the soil salinization control. However, the traditional method of obtaining soil salt is time-consuming and laborious. Nowadays, it is an unprecedented perspective to monitor soil salinity through Sentinel-2A multispectral remote sensing image to construct three-dimensional spectral index. In this study, through soil salt data of 97 ground-truth measurements, Sentinel-2A data-derived spectral indices, based on particle swarm optimization support vector machine (PSO-SVM), gray wolf optimization support vector machine (GWO-SVM) and differential evolution support vector machine (DE-SVM) algorithm to construct a best soil salt inversion models. The results show that three-band (3D) spectral index has better correlation with soil salinity than single band and two-band (2D) spectral index, among TBI5 and TBI7 has a high correlation with the salinity of the soil, and the points are concentrated on the 1:1 line. Therefore, this approach could be applied to estimate the soil salinity in the Ebinur Lake region. The established models were validated using the Machine learning algorithm. The DE-SVM model performed the best by the three Model of accuracy with R2, Bias, and SEP2C of 0.56, − 2.03, and 8.62, respectively. Therefore through the soil salinity value predicted by the modeling constructs a linear relationship with the indexes TBI5 and TBI7, and draw the soil salt inversion map, soil salinity around the lake is relatively high, and decreases outward along the lake, which is consistent with the field. The result from this model will be useful for soil salinization monitoring in the study area and can provide theoretical support for the estimation of SSC in arid and semi-arid areas. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Machine learning algorithm; Sentinel-2A; Spectral indices","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Arid regions; Lakes; Learning algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Remote sensing; Saline water; Soils; Support vector machines; Water quality; Accurate measurement; Agricultural economy; Arid and semi-arid areas; Differential Evolution; Farming activities; Linear relationships; Modeling construct; Multispectral remote sensing image; Soil surveys; algorithm; ground-based measurement; human activity; index method; land degradation; machine learning; remote sensing; saline soil; salinity; satellite data; Sentinel; soil analysis; spectral analysis; China; Ebinur Lake; Xinjiang Uygur; Canis lupus; Varanidae",Article,Scopus

We modified the DRAINMOD model to simulate macropore flow using a simple approach as part of developing the DRAINMOD-P model to simulate phosphorus dynamics in artificially drained agricultural lands. The Hagen-Poiseuille's law was used to estimate the flow capacity of macropores. When ponding depths on the soil surface are greater than Kirkham's depth, water is assumed to flow through macropores directly to tile drains without interaction with the soil matrix. In the modified model, macropore size is adjusted based on wet or dry conditions while connectivity is altered by tillage. The model was tested using a 4-year data set from a subsurface drained field in northwest Ohio. The soils at the field are classified as very poorly drained and are prone to desiccation cracking. The modified model predicted the daily and monthly subsurface drainage with average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values of 0.48 and 0.59, respectively. The cumulative drainage over the 4-year simulation period was under-predicted by 8%. The new macropore component was able to capture about 75% of 60 peak drainage flow events. However, surface runoff was over-predicted for the entire study period. Annual water budgets using measured data (precipitation, subsurface drainage, and surface runoff) and model predictions (evapotranspiration, vertical seepage, and change in storage) were not balanced with an average annual imbalance of 6.4 cm. The lack of closure in the water balance suggests that errors may have occurred in field measurements, particularly, surface runoff. Overall, incorporating macropore flow into DRAINMOD improved predictions of daily drainage peaks and enabled the model to predict subsurface drainage flux contributed by macropore flow, which is critical for expanding DRAINMOD to simulate phosphorus transport in subsurface drained agricultural land. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural drainage; Cracking soil; Hydrologic modeling; Preferential flow","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Budget control; Digital storage; Forecasting; Groundwater flow; Matrix algebra; Phosphorus; Runoff; Soils; Water pollution; Agricultural fields; Agricultural land; Hagen-Poiseuille's law; Model modification; Phosphorus dynamics; Phosphorus transport; Subsurface drainages; Subsurface drains; Drainage; agricultural land; drainage; field method; macropore; model test; phosphorus; runoff; simulation; soil surface; Ohio; United States",Article,Scopus

However, current PM2.5 estimation studies rely heavily on satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, and the limited transit times of polar-orbiting satellites such as Terra and Aqua, nighttime gaps in data from geostationary satellites such as Himawari-8, and cloud contamination reported for both types of satellites challenge the estimation of spatiotemporally continuous PM2.5 concentrations. In this study, spatiotemporal PM2.5 characteristic was constructed by the spatiotemporal fusion method. Specifically, multi-source data, including spatiotemporal, periodic, meteorological, vegetation, anthropogenic and topological characteristics, were incorporated into an ensemble learning method that combined extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k-nearest neighbour (KNN) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) algorithms in level 1 and used linear regression (LR) for integration in level 2. The optimized stacking strategy that considered PM2.5 spatiotemporal autocorrelation was called the ST-stacking model.

In order to further improve the accuracy of estimating grain protein content (GPC) through remote sensing, this study analyzed the quantitative relationship between 14 remote sensing variables obtained from images of environment and disaster monitoring and forecasting small satellite constellation system equipped with wide-band CCD sensors (abbreviated as HJ-CCD) and field-grown winter wheat GPC. The 14 remote sensing variables were normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), nitrogen reflectance index (NRI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), structure intensive pigment index (SIPI), plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), difference vegetation index (DVI), ratio vegetation index (RVI), Rblue (reflectance at blue band), Rgreen (reflectance at green band), Rred (reflectance at red band) and Rnir (reflectance at near infrared band). The partial least square (PLS) algorithm was used to construct and validate the multivariate remote sensing model of predicting wheat GPC. The research showed a close relationship between wheat GPC and 12 remote sensing variables other than Rblue and Rgreen of the spectral reflectance bands. Among them, except PSRI and Rblue, Rgreen and Rred, other remote sensing vegetation indexes had significant multiple correlations. The optimal principal components of PLS model used to predict wheat GPC were: NDVI, SIPI, PSRI and EVI. All these were sensitive variables to predict wheat GPC. Through modeling set and verification set evaluation, GPC prediction models’ coefficients of determination (R2) were 0.84 and 0.8, respectively. The root mean square errors (RMSE) were 0.43% and 0.54%, respectively. It indicated that the PLS algorithm model predicted wheat GPC better than models for linear regression (LR) and principal components analysis (PCA) algorithms. The PLS algorithm model’s prediction accuracies were above 90%. The improvement was by more than 20% than the model for LR algorithm and more than 15% higher than the model for PCA algorithm.

In these regions, inter-annual variation in climatic factors (such as rainfall) combined with anthropogenic factors (such as civil war) pose major risks to food security. Thus, an operational crop production estimation and forecasting system is required to help decision-makers to make early estimates of potential food availability. Data from NASA's MODIS with official crop statistics were combined to develop an empirical regression-based model to forecast winter wheat and barley production in Iraq. The study explores remotely sensed indices representing crop productivity over the crop growing season to find the optimal correlation with crop production. The potential of three different remotely sensed indices, and information related to the phenology of crops, for forecasting crop production at the governorate level was tested and their results were validated using the leave-one-year-out approach. Despite testing several methodological approaches, and extensive spatio-temporal analysis, this paper depicts the difficulty in estimating crop yield on an annual base using current satellite low-resolution data. However, more precise estimates of crop production were possible. The result of the current research implies that the date of the maximum vegetation index (VI) offered the most accurate forecast of crop production with an average R2 = 0.70 compared to the date of MODIS EVI (Avg R2 = 0.68) and a NPP (Avg R2 = 0.66). When winter wheat and barley production were forecasted using NDVI, EVI and NPP and compared to official statistics, the relative error ranged from − 20 to 20%, − 45 to 28% and − 48 to 22%, respectively. The research indicated that remotely sensed indices could characterize and forecast crop production more accurately than simple cropping area, which was treated as a null model against which to evaluate the proposed approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Crop yield/production forecasting; EVI; MODIS; NDVI; NPP and Iraq; Vegetation phenology","Agriculture; Arid regions; Biology; Cultivation; Decision making; Error statistics; Food supply; Forecasting; NASA; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Crop yield; MODIS; NDVI; NPP and Iraq; Vegetation phenology; Crops; arid region; barley; crop production; crop yield; MODIS; NDVI; phenology; primary production; remote sensing; semiarid region; wheat; accuracy; Article; barley; crop production; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; food insecurity; forecasting; harvest period; Iraq; priority journal; quality control; seasonal variation; vegetation; wheat; winter; article; growing season; harvest; Iraq; nonhuman; phenology; plant yield; productivity; spatiotemporal analysis; vegetation; winter wheat; Iraq; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

However, there are seldom sufficient observed data sets available that supply requisite spatial and temporal resolution and coupled multi-parameter constituents for rigorous model performance assessment. Four years of hydroclimate and water quality data were used to validate SWAT model estimates of monthly stream flow, suspended sediment, total phosphorus, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and total inorganic nitrogen from 5 nested-scale gauging sites located in a multiple-land-use watershed of the central USA. The uncalibrated SWAT model satisfactorily simulated monthly stream flow with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values ranging from 0.50 near the headwaters, to 0.75 near the watershed outlet. However, the uncalibrated model did not accurately simulate monthly sediment, total phosphorus, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and total inorganic nitrogen with NSE values < 0.05. Calibrating the SWAT model to multiple gauging sites within the watershed improved estimates of monthly stream flow (NSE = 0.83), sediment (NSE = 0.78), total phosphorus (NSE = 0.81), nitrate (NSE = 0.90), and total inorganic nitrogen (NSE = 0.86).

However, representing marginal lands into a distributed model such as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a challenge due to a rigid framework used for watershed sub-division. In this study, we developed a Geographic Information System (GIS) based approach for implementing targeted land use i.e. marginal lands into the SWAT model and evaluated the applicability of the approach on a 8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) watershed scale. Comparative results showed that conventional targeting approach overestimates the benefit of targeting marginal lands for Alamo switchgrass (Panicum virgatum, L) and giant miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) production due to simulation of larger area under marginal land category. Compared to baseline condition, which corresponds to no biofuel crop production on marginal lands, the pollutant losses under new targeting approach with simulation of Alamo switchgrass and giant miscanthus on marginal lands were substantially lower. The new targeting approach advances the science behind landscape representation in the SWAT model - that has potential to be used in future targeting studies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Biofuel crops; Marginal land; SWAT; Targeting; Water quality","Biofuels; Crops; Cultivation; Geographic information systems; Land use; Plants (botany); Water quality; Watersheds; Base-line conditions; Distributed modeling; Marginal lands; Second generation; Soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; Targeting; Water quality impact; Quality control; agricultural modeling; biofuel; crop production; digital elevation model; environmental modeling; environmental research; GIS; grass; land use; mapping method; water quality; watershed; Miscanthus; Miscanthus x giganteus; Panicum virgatum",Article,Scopus

In this study, a 3.93 ha agricultural field in Denmark was separated into two parts of well-drained (WD) and poorly-drained (PD) based on the installation depth of the tile drains. The field was continuously monitored for drainage, soil water dynamics, nitrogen leaching through the drains, and grain dry matter and nitrogen yields in a 4-year period (2017–2020). Furthermore, denitrification potential of the top 1 m of the soil at both parts of the field was measured through the denitrifying enzyme activity assay, and a 1D Daisy model was utilized to capture the differences between water and nitrogen balances at WD and PD. Results indicated that on average over the 4 years, annual harvested nitrogen in the crops at PD was 14% lower compared to WD, with a significant reduction of 33% in 2017–2018, that coincided with the longest period of waterlogging at PD. Moreover, greater losses of nitrogen through leaching from drainage and other pathways were measured at the PD (109 kg N ha−1 ya−1) compared to the WD (95 kg N ha−1 ya−1). Based on the simulations, losses through preferential flow pathways to the drains dominated at PD and most of the denitrification is expected to occur within the topsoil. Future studies could significantly benefit from monitoring the redox dynamics in the top 30 cm of the PD soils, and increasing the depth of tiles drains by redrainage could reduce the N losses of poorly drained agricultural soils. © 2022","Denitrification; Modelling; Nitrogen leaching; Redox potential; Tile drainage","bromide; ground water; nitrogen; soil water; nitrogen; water; agricultural soil; enzyme activity; leaching; sandy loam; soil drainage; soil nitrogen; waterlogging; agricultural land; Article; climate; concentration (parameter); crop; crop rotation; denitrification; Denmark; enzyme activity; fertilizer application; fluid balance; grain; harvesting; land drainage; leaching; nitrogen balance; oxidation reduction reaction; sandy loam; sensitivity analysis; simulation; soil property; soil water content; sowing; surface soil; waterlogging; agriculture; sand; soil; Denmark; Agriculture; Nitrogen; Sand; Soil; Water",Article,Scopus

Current understanding of drought across extensive spatial measures, around the world, is considerably limited. As case studies to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing space-based solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) across extensive spatial measures, here, we have used data from 2007 to 2017 in Heilongjiang and Jiangsu provinces of China. The onset of the 2015 drought was accompanied by a substantial response of SIF from vegetation in both the provinces; these data were associated with changes in soil moisture, standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index, and emissivity. Our findings suggest that SIF can effectively provide the spatial and temporal progress of drought, as inferred through substantial associations with SIF normalized by absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (related to φF) and by photosynthetically active radiation (SIFpar). For the depiction of onset to drought, SIF, φF, and SIFpar provide a significant association and a quicker response than the leaf area index and the normalized difference vegetation index. Furthermore, we found that the correlation between gross primary productivity and SIF is highly substantial in both Heilongjiang (R2 = 0.85, p < 0.001) and Jiangsu (R2 = 0.75, p < 0.001) during the drought period.

The past several decades have witnessed the emergence of conservation tillage practices to combat soil erosion and degradation. However, the effects of conservation tillage on crop water productivity (CWP) remain uncertain, especially from a regional-scale perspective. Here, we used an improved process-based agroecosystem model (DLEM-Ag) to quantify the long-term effects of conservation tillage (e.g., no-tillage, NT; reduced tillage, RT) on CWP (defined as the ratio of crop productivity to evapotranspiration) of corn and soybean across the Ohio River Basin during 1979–2018. Our results revealed an average increase of 2.8% and 8.4% in CWP for corn and soybean, respectively, under the NT adoption scenario. Compared to the conventional tillage scenario, NT and RT would enhance CWP, primarily due to reductions in evapotranspiration, particularly evaporation. Further analysis suggested that, although NT and RT may decrease surface runoff, these practices could also increase subsurface drainage and nutrient loss from corn and soybean farmland via leaching. These results indicate that conservation tillage should be complemented with additional water and nutrient management practices to enhance soil water retention and optimize nutrient use in the region's cropland. Our findings also provide unique insights into optimizing management practices for other areas where conservation tillage is widely applied. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation tillage; Crop water productivity (CWP); No-tillage; Ohio River Basin (ORB); Process-based agroecosystem model","Crops; Cultivation; Ecosystems; Evapotranspiration; Food supply; Groundwater flow; Nutrients; Rivers; Soil conservation; Soil moisture; Watersheds; Conservation tillage; Crop water productivity; Management practises; No tillage; Ohio River; Ohio river basin; Process-based agroecosystem model; River basins; Water productivity; Productivity; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural land; agricultural management; conservation tillage; crop production; food security; maize; nutrient loss; nutrient use efficiency; soybean; Ohio Basin; United States; Glycine max",Article,Scopus

For large-scale applications, FCC is usually estimated from remotely sensed data by inverting radiative transfer models (RTMs) or using data-driven regressions. In this article, we proposed a hybrid model, which combines a 3-D RTM and transfer learning-based convolutional neural network (T-CNN), to estimate FCC from very high-resolution satellite images (e.g., Chinese GaoFen-2, 1 m resolution with 4 bands). Unlike common hybrid models that are purely trained with simulation data, T-CNN combines simulation data-based pre-training and actual data-based transfer learning, which is a widely used technique in artificial intelligence for fine-tuning models. The performance of T-CNN was compared with a random forest (RF) model and two general CNN models, including CNN trained with actual dataset only (data-CNN) and CNN trained with RTM simulation data only (RTM-CNN). Results on the independent validation dataset (not used in training stage) showed that T-CNN had higher accuracy (RMSE = 0.121, R2 = 0.83), compared with RF (RMSE = 0.26, R2 = 0.61), Data-CNN (RMSE = 0.142, R2 = 0.81), and RTM-CNN (RMSE = 0.144, R2 = 0.73), which indicates that T-CNN has a strong transferability. Tests on different training sizes showed that T-CNN (0.084 < RMSE < 0.108) provided constantly better performances than RF (0.116 < RMSE < 0.122) and data-CNN (0.103 < RMSE < 0.128), which demonstrates the potential of T-CNN as an alternative to RTM-based inversion and data-driven regressions to estimate FCC, especially when training data is imbalanced and inadequate. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","convolutional neural network (CNN); forest canopy cover (FCC); Three-dimensional (3-D) radiative transfer model; transfer learning","Biological systems; Convolution; Decision trees; Forestry; Neural networks; Radiative transfer; Three dimensional computer graphics; Timber; 3d radiative transfer model; Biological system modeling; Canopy cover; Convolutional neural network; Forest canopies; Forest canopy cover; Radiative transfer modelling; Solid modelling; Three-dimensional display; Transfer learning; Three dimensional displays; accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; data set; forest canopy; forest cover; model validation; radiative transfer; regression analysis; satellite imagery; three-dimensional modeling",Article,Scopus

However, little is known about interconnections between EMF and taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities of rare and abundant bacteria. Using MiSeq sequencing and multiple statistical analyses, we evaluated the maintenance of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities of rare and abundant bacteria and their contributions to EMF in salinized agricultural soils (0.09 to 19.91 dS/m). Rare bacteria exhibited closer phylogenetic clustering and broader environmental breadths than abundant ones, while abundant bacteria showed higher functional redundancies and stronger phylogenetic signals of ecological preferences than rare ones. Variable selection (86.7%) dominated rare bacterial community assembly, and dispersal limitation (54.7%) and variable selection (24.5%) determined abundant bacterial community assembly. Salinity played a decisive role in mediating the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes and showed significant effects on functions and diversities of both rare and abundant bacteria. Rare bacterial taxonomic a-diversity and abundant bacterial phylogenetic a-diversity contributed significantly to EMF, while abundant bacterial taxonomic a-diversity and rare bacterial phylogenetic a-diversity did not. Additionally, abundant rather than rare bacterial community function had a significant effect on soil EMF. These findings extend our knowledge of environmental adaptation of rare and abundant bacteria and highlight different contributions of taxonomic and phylogenetic a-diversities of rare and abundant bacteria to soil EMF. IMPORTANCE Soil salinization is a worldwide environmental problem and threatens plant productivity and microbial diversity. Understanding the generation and maintenance of microbial diversity is essential to estimate soil tillage potential via investigating ecosystem multifunctionality. Our sequence-based data showed differences in environmental adaptations of rare and abundant bacteria at taxonomic and phylogenetic levels, which led to different contributions of taxonomic and phylogenetic a-diversities of rare and abundant bacteria to soil EMF. Studying the diversity of rare and abundant bacteria and their contributions to EMF in salinized soils is critical for guiding soil restoration.

Designing and deploying a WSN is a challenging and multivariate task, dependent on the considered environment. For example, a need for network synchronization arises in such networks to correlate acquired measurements. This work focuses on the design and installation of a WSN that is capable of facilitating the sensing aspects of smart and precision agriculture applications. A system is designed and implemented to address specific design requirements that are brought about by the considered environment.

The proposed system was installed on an olive grove to assess its effectiveness in providing a low-cost system, capable of acquiring synchronized measurements.

Measuring evapotranspiration (ET) and its parameters (stomatal conductance (gs), leaf area index (LAI), canopy temperature (Tc), and soil moisture (SM)) across cropping systems is costly and time-consuming. However, interpretation of remotely-sensed data can facilitate the effective assessment of relative ET demands among competing forest landuses. This study develops and tests geospatial models informed by a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), vegetation vigor index (VVI), and other spectral information to estimate ET and its parameters, which are measured on experimental watersheds with young pines and natural understory (YP), switchgrass only (SG), and young pine intercropped with switchgrass (IC). The treatment watersheds were replicated on three sites located across the Southeastern U.S. in Carteret, NC; Calhoun, MS; and Greene, AL. Despite the growth inconsistency for the SG only treatment, remote modeling estimation of ET parameters yielded an acceptable R2 &gt; 0.70, and the ET model yielded R2 of 0.50 and a standard error of prediction of 0.94. However, ET and ET parameter model estimation for the IC performed somewhat less satisfactorily, with an R2 of 0.47, 0.59, 0.56, 0.81, and 0.57 for ET, LAI, gs, Tc, and SM, respectively, potentially due to inconsistencies in Landsat image pixel size and landuse homogeneity. Moreover, ET parameter models for the YP site performed rather poorly, with R2 = 0.28, 0.63, and 0.76 for LAI, gs, and Tc, respectively. Additionally, image analysis automation was created with Python scripting and geospatial models. The findings from this study suggest that inclusion of more spatial variability, sound data mining, ultra-high resolution imagery and advanced image processing approaches to account for potential modeling uncertainties can enhance the predictive capability of models to remotely estimate environmental parameters including ET. Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) based models provided promising results for estimating ET and ET parameters using remotely-sensed digital information when they are prepared with advanced data mining, but it is likely that laypersons may find these models difficult to use. However, forest managers with access to neural network software can use our devised RBFN training models for estimating those forest hydrologic parameters with better accuracy. © 2019","ArcGIS ModelBuilder; Canopy temperature; Data mining; Evapotranspiration; Landsat; Orthoimagery; Python script; RBFN; Software development; Soil moisture; SPOT; Stomatal conductance; Visual basics studios","Budget control; Computer software; Data mining; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; High level languages; Image enhancement; Personnel training; Radial basis function networks; Remote sensing; Software design; Software engineering; Soil moisture; Uncertainty analysis; Vegetation; Watersheds; ArcGIS ModelBuilder; Canopy temperature; LANDSAT; Orthoimagery; Python script; RBFN; SPOT; Stomatal conductance; Parameter estimation; ArcGIS; automation; coniferous tree; cropping practice; data mining; evapotranspiration; grass; image analysis; image processing; intercropping; Landsat; remote sensing; software; soil moisture; stomatal conductance; Panicum virgatum",Article,Scopus

A network of land-based National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) weather stations has been typically used as a primary source of climate input for agro-ecosystem models. However, the network may lack the density to adequately capture spatial climate variability throughout large watersheds. High-resolution weather datasets based on 4 km × 4 km grid, such as Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) and Parameter–Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM), have become increasingly available as alternatives to conventional land-based networks. The goal of this study was to evaluate impacts of the three weather datasets, NCDC, NEXRAD, and PRISM, on hydrologic processes in an agricultural catchment in Kansas. A method of collecting and processing three sets of weather input datasets was developed and applied to a calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for the Smoky Hill River watershed (SHRW) in west-central Kansas, which is sparsely covered by NCDC weather stations with fair to poor range of NEXRAD coverage. SHRW is a typical agricultural catchment in the Central Great Plains; research findings here may be applicable to large areas of the US with similar topography and climate conditions. The SWAT model based on PRISM dataset was able to capture daily streamflow alterations with a greater accuracy compared to NCDC and NEXRAD based SWAT models. With three different weather inputs, SWAT with NCDC consistently overestimated monthly stream discharges, while the SWAT models based on NEXRAD and PRISM datasets tended to underestimate monthly high flows of over 8 m3 s− 1 and overestimate monthly low flows of below 1 m3 s− 1. In general, all models overestimated streamflow in dry years and underestimated streamflow in wet years, however, the PRISM-based model generated smaller bias than the models utilizing NEXRAD or NCDC. The use of PRISM resulted in better statistical performance metrics for streamflow. The conducted study suggests that gridded weather datasets can significantly improve simulated streamflow at daily, monthly and yearly scales as compared to traditional land-based networks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate data; Kansas; NCDC; NEXRAD; PRISM; SWAT","agricultural catchment; air temperature; climate effect; comparative study; data set; discharge; hydrological response; NEXRAD; precipitation (climatology); soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; Great Plains; Kansas; United States",Article,Scopus

To date, limited field scale AFs models are available to simulate all possible ESS and BD together. We conducted an extensive systematic review of available agroforestry (AF), BD, and soil erosion models for the simulation potential of seven most desirable ESS in AFS. Simple to complex AF models have an inherent limitation of being objective-specific. A few complex and dynamic AF models did not meet the recent interest and demands for the simulation of ESS under AFS. Further, many ESS modules especially soil erosion, GHGs emission, groundwater recharge, onsite water retention, nutrients and pesticide leaching, and BD are often missing in available AF models, while some existing soil erosion models can be used in combination with AF models. Likewise mechanistic and process-based BD diversity models are lacking or found limited simulation potential for ESS under AFS. However, further efforts of model development and improvement (integration and coupling) are needed for the better simulation of complex interactive processes belonging to ESS under AFS. There are different possibilities but a proficient modeling approach for better reliability, flexibility, and durability is to integrate and couple them into a process-based dynamic modular structure. Findings of the study further suggested that crop modeling frameworks (MFW) like SIMPLACE and APSIM could be potential ones for the integration and coupling of different suitable modeling approaches (AF, soil protection, GHGs emission, flood prevention, carbon sequestration, onsite water retention, ground recharge, nutrient leaching, and BD modules) in one platform for dynamic process based ESS estimation on daily basis at the field scale.

The atmospheric CO2 growth rates would have been much larger if natural sinks in the land biosphere and ocean had not removed over half of this anthropogenic CO2. As these CO2 emissions grew, uptake by the ocean increased in response to increases in atmospheric CO2 partial pressure (pCO2). On land, gross primary production also increased, but the dynamics of other key aspects of the land carbon cycle varied regionally. Over the past three decades, CO2 uptake by intact tropical humid forests declined, but these changes are offset by increased uptake across mid- and high-latitudes. While there have been substantial improvements in our ability to study the carbon cycle, measurement and modeling gaps still limit our understanding of the processes driving its evolution. Continued ship-based observations combined with expanded deployments of autonomous platforms are needed to quantify ocean-atmosphere fluxes and interior ocean carbon storage on policy-relevant spatial and temporal scales. There is also an urgent need for more comprehensive measurements of stocks, fluxes and atmospheric CO2 in humid tropical forests and across the Arctic and boreal regions, which are experiencing rapid change.

We applied a novel topography-based algorithm to estimate areas and volumes of ~455,000 surface depressions (&gt;1 ha) across the UMRB (in addition to lakes and reservoirs) and subsequently aggregated their effects per subbasin. Compared to a “no depression” conventional model, our depression-integrated model (a) improved streamflow simulation accuracy with increasing upstream abundance of depression storage, (b) significantly altered the spatial patterns and magnitudes of water yields across 315,000 km2 (70%) of the basin area, and (c) provided realistic spatial distributions of rootzone wetness conditions corresponding to satellite-based data. Results further suggest that storage capacity (i.e., volume) alone does not fully explain depressions' cumulative effects on landscape hydrologic responses. Local (i.e., subbasin level) climatic and geophysical drivers and downstream flowpath-regulating structures (e.g., reservoirs and dams) influence the extent to which depression storage volume in a subbasin causes hydrologic effects. With these new insights, our study supports the integration of surface depression storage and thereby catalyzes a reassessment of current hydrological modeling and management practices for basin-scale studies. ©2020.

Determining optimal N fertilizer rates that reach both economic and environmental objectives is a key challenge in cotton systems because of the inherent within-field variability and relatively low N fertilizer use efficiency (NFUE). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to model optimal N fertilizer rates by accounting for within-field variability through management zone (MZ) delineation across a cotton field in Queensland, Australia. METHODS: MZs were delineated using satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the crop simulation model, Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), was automatically calibrated with a grid-search optimization algorithm and validated across two cotton seasons. A total of 336 different N fertilizer scenarios were subsequently evaluated at pre-planting and top-dressing to observe the effect on profit margin and NFUE. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The MZ delineation analysis determined that within-field variability could be best represented by two MZs, one of which displaying subsoil constraints due to high carbonate concentrations. The use of the auto-calibration algorithm led to a successful validation of the model with a Wilmott d-index of agreement ranging between 0.75 (soil nitrate) and 0.96 (aboveground biomass and plant N), respectively. The subsequent N scenario simulations indicated that by reducing N fertilizer rates by 80 and 30 kg N ha−1 across the two MZs, respectively, compared to the current industry average, profits could be maximized through maintaining yields while reducing N inputs. SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, these results demonstrate the potential of combining remote sensing-derived MZs and crop model auto-calibration techniques to support the cotton industry in achieving improved resource efficiency and profit margins. © 2022","Auto-calibration; Cotton; DSSAT; Management zones; Nitrogen; Remote sensing","cotton; fertilizer; management practice; NDVI; nitrogen; numerical model; remote sensing; Australia; Queensland",Article,Scopus

We described different types of models available in the field of modeling groundwater nitrate contamination, the models used, the input requirements of different models, and the evaluation metrics used. Out of all the models reviewed, stand-alone process-based models are predominantly used for modeling nitrate contamination, followed by integrated models, with HYDRUS and LEACHM models being the two most commonly used process-based models worldwide. Most models are evaluated using the statistical metric Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) followed by the correlation coefficient (r).

To address this issue, continuous research and development is required to determine the best machine learning (ML) algorithm for PV solar power output forecasting. Existing studies have established the superiority of the artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) algorithms in this field. However, more recent studies have demonstrated promising PV solar power output forecasting performances by the decision tree (DT), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms. Therefore, the present study aims to address a research gap in this field by determining the best performer among these 5 algorithms.

Yet the productivity of the major cereals - rice, wheat, and maize - in the region are far lower than their potential. Nutrient management plays a crucial role in improving cereal yields and economic return, and continued improvement in nutrient management practices and their on-farm implementation is required to develop locally relevant solutions that are site-specific, easy-to-develop and geared towards system resilience. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to conduct the comparative assessment of three nutrient management strategies for the three major cereals considering productivity, profitability and nutrient use efficiencies (NUE); estimate their potential yields and yield gaps; and explain the causes of yield variability across farmer-participatory on-farm trials in the EIGP of Nepal. METHODS: We compared three nutrient management strategies (farmer's fertilizer practice- FP, government recommendation -GR, and Nutrient Expert®- NE-based recommendation), in 600 on-farm trials. We used the NE DSS tool, APSIM – a cropping system simulation model, and machine learning (ML) approaches (Linear Mixed Effect model -LME; and Random Forest model - RF) for the three cereals using data from those trials. The NE and APSIM were chosen due to simplicity in use and their wider evaluation and application in fertilizer recommendation yield prediction; RF was chosen due to its robustness in predictive ability and identifying and ranking factors determining yield or other variables of interest. RESULTS: The NE-based fertilizer recommendations for maize, wheat and rice increased yield by about 3.5, 1.4, and 1.3 t ha−1 respectively, increased profits, and improved NUE over FP or GR. The risk analysis showed that at a given probability level, NE always resulted in higher yields of all cereals than GR or FP. APSIM identified 25th June as optimum transplanting date for rice and 10th December as optimum sowing date for maize and wheat and simulated long-term average potential yield of 7–7.5, 5–5.5 and 13–13.3 t ha−1 respectively for rice, wheat and maize. There were larger yield gaps between PY and FP (2.6–8.5 t ha−1) than PY and NE (2.0–3.7 t ha−1) across crops and villages. The LME model showed highly significant treatment and location effects for grain yield of all cereals. The point estimate of the difference for grain yield as estimated by Tukey's HSD test was highest for NE-FP and lowest for GR-FP for all crops. The RF model identified grain N uptake for rice and grain P and K uptakes for wheat and maize as most influential factors contributing to their grain yield under each nutrient management strategy. CONCLUSIONS: The NE-based nutrient management had significant effects over FP and GR leading to positive changes on yield and economic performance under varied growing environments. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings based on novel tools and approaches have important policy implications for increasing food security and profits from the major cereals by refining or improving the GR or FP and increasing their NUE in Nepal. Studies with larger sample size across varied agro-climatic zones in the EIGP and much of South Asia would help policy makers consider DSS tools and ML approaches suitable for upscaling and large-scale adoption by smallholder farmers. © 2021","APSIM; Partial factor productivity; Partial nutrient balance; Random Forest; Return on investment; Yield gap","agricultural management; cereal; crop production; cropping practice; demand analysis; livelihood; machine learning; nutrient dynamics; nutrient use efficiency; profitability; smallholder; Gangetic Plain; Nepal",Article,Scopus

Nitrogen (N) deficiency frequently contributes to the gap, but it is difficult to predict an appropriate rate of N to apply because of uncertainty about the forthcoming season and hence water limited potential yield and crop N requirements. We investigated closing the water limited yield gap attributable to N supply by maintaining a “bank” of soil mineral N that is nonlimiting for wheat yields in most seasons. The yield, loss of NO3−-N in leaching and denitrification, and gross margins of wheat crops were simulated at four Australian locations with contrasting soil types and potential yields, in response to N inputs calculated by reference to N banks ranging from 50 to 400 kg N ha-1, the Yield Prophet® decision support tool and the national average N rate. The N bank providing best yields at each location was close in amount to the long-term average rate calculated with Yield Prophet®. Compared to the national average rate of N fertiliser application (45 kg N ha-1), the highest-yielding N bank treatment on average increased the amount of N applied by 3–234 kg N ha-1, the fraction of water limited potential yield by 0.0 to 0.61, and gross margins by AUD 0–1,026 ha-1. Combined losses of N to the environment in NO3−leaching and through denitrification in these strategies also increased but by a disproportionately small amount compared to the increase in the amount applied (-3 to 8.5 kg N ha-1). These losses were relatively insensitive to the amount of N applied at three of the four locations; at the fourth location large episodic losses could occur from sandy soil despite low rainfall when the N bank exceeded water limited potential yield. The N bank approach to determining fertiliser rate has potential to sustainably reduce the yield gap where the target amount is matched to average site-specific yield potential. © 2020","APSIM; Denitrification; Gross margins; Nitrate leaching; Yield prophet","denitrification; leaching; precipitation intensity; sandy soil; soil nitrogen; water use efficiency; wheat; yield response",Article,Scopus

Commodity flows are a key data needed to compute virtual water but are typically available every 5 years in the United States (US). The lack of continuous, annual commodity flow data severely limits our ability to study and understand the drivers, evolution, and alterations of virtual water in the US. We build and evaluate a machine learning model using Random Forest (RF) to predict annual commodity and virtual water flow networks. The model is used to perform several modeling experiments and illustrate the prediction of annual virtual water flows in the US during 2013–2018. We show that the RF predictions consistently outperform those from a gravity model. The overall performance of the RF algorithm improves as commodities or regions are aggregated into coarser groups. Likewise, the inclusion of past commodity flows as an additional explanatory variable enhances the RF performance. The combination of RF classification and regression allows predicting both network connections and flows without comprising performance. Based on our RF predictions for 2013–2018, we find that temporal variations in virtual water flows can be large for some regions in the US, underscoring the need addressed by this study of reconstructing domestic virtual water changes over time. By capturing inter-regional water consumption interactions in space and time, such reconstructed data could be beneficial in the future for anticipating and managing local and regional water scarcity. © 2020","Complex network; Gravity model; Random forest; Spatial network; Trade; Water footprint","Decision trees; E-learning; Forecasting; Hydraulics; Machine learning; Random forests; Turing machines; Explanatory variables; Indispensable tools; Machine learning models; Network connection; Temporal variation; Virtual water-flow; Water requirements; Water sustainability; Flow of water; algorithm; classification; machine learning; regression analysis; spatial data; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; temporal variation; trade; water flow; water footprint; water management; United States",Article,Scopus

The Rio Loco watershed (RLW) in southwest Puerto Rico has been extensively modified, currently comprised of small mountainous rivers connected by reservoirs and irrigation canals to the Lajas Valley Agricultural Reserve (LVAR). The RLW has regularly supplied sediment to Guánica Bay; however, the total annual yield and subbasins most responsible have remained unknown. We estimated sediment yield for the lower RLW using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in separate scenarios to assess a range of conditions; a dry season scenario that modeled flow through the irrigation system and a wet season scenario that modeled flow through the natural river channel. Precipitation was similarly correlated with sediment yield in both seasons, with 1.5× more sediment per month predicted during the wet than dry season. The distribution of sediment yield among subbasins was the same in both seasons. The foothills north of the cement lined irrigation canal and subbasin north of Lago Loco were the largest source of sediment, both combined to produce nearly 40% of the total sediment reaching Guánica Bay. The next largest source was from subbasins that comprised a combination of agricultural and suburban land uses. Relative basin-scale model outputs for both the irrigation system and natural channel agree with empirical measurements from 2015.

The APSIM validation was carried-out using a long-term dataset of corn stover and grain yields from the North Central Region of IN.

Despite surmounting evidence of the field and landscape scale benefits of diversifying agricultural systems, path dependencies of US agriculture present barriers to such diversification pathways. This study aims to elucidate path dependencies of agricultural landscapes that (dis)incentivize crop diversification at the regional scale through two main research questions: 1) what are the biophysical and socioecological factors most predictive of agricultural diversity across the US; and 2) how do these factors vary regionally? Using a novel panel dataset constructed from several open-source databases, we use random forest (RF) permutation variable importance measures to identify and compare the factors most predictive of county-level crop diversity across nine US regions. Our results show that climate, land use norms, and farm inputs are consistently the most important categories for predicting agricultural diversity across regions; however, variability exists in the relative regional importance of variables within these categories. Thus, factors most strongly predictive of agricultural diversity across US landscapes operate distinctly at a regional level, emphasizing the need to consider multiple scales of influence. These distinct regional relationships contribute to path dependencies that present resistance to enhancing agricultural diversity. By more appropriately addressing the regional factors of US agricultural landscapes the constrain agricultural diversification, with an eye towards future cropscapes, we can shift current path dependencies toward a more resilient and adaptive US agricultural future. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Diversification; Path dependency; Region; United States","agricultural land; agriculture; crop plant; data set; factor analysis; land use; land use change; landscape ecology; United States",Article,Scopus

This paper analyses an ensemble of simulations from six regional climate models (RCMs) taking part in the coordinated regional downscaling experiment, the ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis (ERAI) and three satellite-based and observationally-constrained daily precipitation datasets, to assess the performance of the RCMs with regard to the intraseasonal variability. A joint analysis of seasonal-mean precipitation and the total column water vapor (also called precipitable water—PW) suggests the existence of important links at different timescales between these two variables over the Sahel and highlights the relevance of using PW to follow the monsoon seasonal cycle. RCMs that fail to represent the seasonal-mean position and amplitude of the meridional gradient of PW show the largest discrepancies with respect to seasonal-mean observed precipitation. For both ERAI and RCMs, spectral decompositions of daily PW as well as rainfall show an overestimation of low-frequency activity (at timescales longer than 10 days) at the expense of the synoptic (timescales shorter than 10 days) activity. Consequently, the effects of the African Easterly Waves and the associated mesoscale convective systems are substantially underestimated, especially over continental regions. Finally, the study investigates the skill of the models with respect to hydro-climatic indices related to the occurrence, intensity and frequency of precipitation events at the intraseasonal scale. Although most of these indices are generally better reproduced with RCMs than reanalysis products, this study indicates that RCMs still need to be improved (especially with respect to their subgrid-scale parameterization schemes) to be able to reproduce the intraseasonal variance spectrum adequately. © 2016, The Author(s).","Intraseasonal variability; Precipitation indices; Regional climate modeling; West African monsoon","climate modeling; convective system; easterly wave; ensemble forecasting; monsoon; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; West Africa",Article,Scopus

In addition, SWAT-CUP was recently developed and provides a decision-making framework that incorporates a semi-automated approach (SUFI2) using both manual and automated calibration and incorporating sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. In SWAT-CUP, users can manually adjust parameters and ranges iteratively between autocalibration runs. Parameter sensitivity analysis helps focus the calibration and uncertainty analysis and is used to provide statistics for goodness-of-fit. The user interaction or manual component of the SWAT-CUP calibration forces the user to obtain a better understanding of the overall hydrologic processes (e.g., baseflow ratios, ET, sediment sources and sinks, crop yields, and nutrient balances) and of parameter sensitivity. It is important for future calibration developments to spatially account for hydrologic processes; improve model run time efficiency; include the impact of uncertainty in the conceptual model, model parameters, and measured variables used in calibration; and assist users in checking for model errors.

Understanding the driving factors and developing predictive algorithms for Y0 will enhance the optimization of N fertilization in maize. Using a random forest algorithm, we analyzed data from 679 maize N fertilization studies (1031 Y0 observations) conducted between 1999–2019 in the United States and Canada. Predictability of Y0 was assessed while identifying determinant factors such as soil, crop management, and weather. The inclusion of weather variables as predictors improved the model efficiency (ME) from 51 up to 64 %, and reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) from 2.5 to 2.0 Mg ha−1, 34 to 27 % in relative terms (RRMSE). The most relevant predictors of Y0 were previous crop, irrigation, and soil organic matter (SOM), while the most influential weather data was linked to the radiation per unit of thermal time (Q quotient) around flowering and spring precipitations. The crop rotation effect resulted in Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) as the previous crop with the highest Y0 level (IQR = 11.5–15.0 Mg ha−1) as compared to annual legumes (IQR = 5.6–10.0 Mg ha−1) and other previous crops (IQR = 3.6–7.8 Mg ha−1). The Q quotient around flowering positively affected Y0, while spring precipitations and extreme temperature events during grain filling showed a negative association to Y0. Overall, these results reinforce the concept that yields are controlled not only by soil N supply but also by factors modifying plant demand and ability to capture N. Lastly, we foresee a promising future for the use of machine learning to address both prediction and interpretation of maize yield to obtain more reliable N guidelines. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Maize; Soil nitrogen supply; Yield forecast","assessment method; crop plant; crop rotation; crop yield; fertilizer application; maize; soil nitrogen; soil organic matter; temperature effect; uncertainty analysis; Canada; United States; Fabaceae; Medicago sativa; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The accurate estimation of GPP is critical to understanding the regional carbon cycle. With the development of machine learning (ML) theory, machine learning models are increasingly used to study complex phenomena with high variability in time and space. In this study, three machine learning models (Support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural network (ANN), and long short-term memory networks (LSTM)) were investigated for predicting GPP in northwest China and compared them with the traditional physical models. Carbon flux, various environmental factors, and maize growth indices were measured in the maize field over five years in northwest China. The rigorous analysis which included statistical comparison and cross-validation for the prediction of GPP confirmed that the machine learning models performed better than traditional physical models. And the SVR model performed the best among the considered ML models with the highest nash-efficiency coefficient and the lowest root mean squared error. The machine learning model also outperformed the traditional physical models on cloudy days and after irrigation. The SVR achieved good prediction accuracy and high stability. With different training data sets, the ANN and LSTM were relatively more sensitive to the training data set. When the training data was sufficient, SVR, ANN and LSTM could achieve similar prediction accuracy, but SVR was slightly higher. When the training data was small, the simulation accuracy of SVR was better than ANN and LSTM. The performance of ANN and LSTM was more sensitive to parameter selection, and the relationship between model performance and parameter selection had no obvious regularity. Based on this comprehensive comparison study, it was elicited that the SVR model can be successfully applied to GPP simulation of maize fields, which provided a new perspective for the application of machine learning modeling in GPP simulation. © 2022","Artificial neural network; Gross primary productivity; Long short-term memory networks; Support vector regression","Brain; Carbon dioxide; Forecasting; Irrigation; Learning systems; Mean square error; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Gross primary productivity; Long short-term memory network; Machine learning models; Maize fields; Memory network; NorthWest China; Physical modelling; Prediction accuracy; Support vector regression models; Support vector regressions; Long short-term memory; agricultural land; artificial neural network; drip irrigation; estimation method; growth; machine learning; maize; primary production; regression analysis; support vector machine; China",Article,Scopus

Currently, NPP observation at the canopy scale is primarily based on the chamber method. However, upscaling the spatial–temporal estimates of NPP at the canopy scale is still challenging. In this study, maize daytime NPP was measured by the chamber, and multispectral images of maize canopies were obtained via unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral system. We explored the potential of multispectral images for estimating maize daytime NPP at the canopy scale. Four machine learning algorithms were employed to estimate daytime NPP using ground factors and vegetation indices (VIs) × photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) independently. NPP estimation models based on the gradient boosting regression (GBR), random forest (RF), and support vector regression (SVR) using ground factors outperformed the VIs × PAR-based model, barring the ridge regression (RR) model. Among them, the GBR-based models performed better, and the model using ground factors (R2 = 0.958) outperformed those using VIs × PAR (R2 = 0.899). However, the ground factor-based GBR model was complex and contained more input parameters, thus making it highly-time and labor-intensive, and highly destructive. Moreover, ground factor-based GBR model could not reflect the variation of NPP in maize canopy. The VIs × PAR-based GBR model could explain 89.9% of the daytime NPP, and it only required two parameters, including VIs and PAR. Therefore, the VIs × PAR-based GBR model can easily obtain high resolution and long time-series NPP information nondestructively for a large range. This study reveals that maize daytime NPP can be estimated using high-resolution UAV multispectral images and provides a good reference for promoting the monitoring and upscaling of NPP observations. © 2022","Gradient boosting regression; Machine learning; Net primary productivity; UAV multispectral Remote sensing; Vegetation index","Adaptive boosting; Agriculture; Antennas; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Learning systems; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Aerial vehicle; Gradient boosting; Gradient boosting regression; Machine-learning; Multispectral remote sensing; Net primary productivity; Photosynthetic active radiations; Regression modelling; Unmanned aerial vehicle multispectral remote sensing; Vegetation index; Machine learning",Article,Scopus

This study used different vegetation indices and red-edge parameters calculated based on the canopy reflectance obtained from near-surface hyperspectral data and UAV hyperspectral data and used the partial least squares regression (PLSR) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods to estimate the yield of winter wheat at different growth stages. Verification was performed based on these two types of hyperspectral remote sensing data and the yield was estimated using vegetation indices and a combination of vegetation indices and red-edge parameters as the modeling independent variables, respectively, using PLSR and ANN regression, respectively. The results showed that, for the same data source, the optimal vegetation index for estimating the yield was the same in all of the studied growth stages; however, the optimal red-edge parameters were different for different growth stages. Compared with using only the vegetation indices as the modeling factor to estimate yield, the combination of the vegetation indices and red-edge parameters obtained superior estimation results. Additionally, the accuracy of yield estimation was shown to be improved by using the PLSR and ANN methods, with the yield estimation model constructed using the PLSR method having a better prediction effect. Moreover, the yield prediction model obtained using the near-surface hyperspectral sensors had a higher fitting and accuracy than the model obtained using the UAV hyperspectral remote sensing data (the results were based on the specific growth stressors, N and water supply). This study shows that the use of a combination of vegetation indices and red-edge parameters achieved an improved yield estimation compared to the use of vegetation indices alone.

Three types of parameters, including photosynthetic sensitive vegetation indices (VIs), canopy leaf area index (LAI), and crop plant nitrogen accumulation (PNA), obtained from UAV hyperspectral images were used to estimate rice GPC.

Quantifying the damage to crops caused by high temperatures can lead to more accurate estimates of crop yields. The remote sensing technique evaluates crop conditions indirectly but provides information related to crop physiology, growth, and yield. In this study, we aim to assess the crop damage caused by heat stress in paddy rice examined under elevated air temperatures in a temperature gradient field chamber from 2016 to 2019, using remote-sensed vegetation indices. A leaf-spectrometer, field-spectrometers, and a multi-spectral camera were used to monitor the conditions of paddy rice. Although, in the leaf- and canopy-scales, the values of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and photochemical reflectance index (PRI) decreased after the heading of rice under normal conditions, the decreasing sensitivity of NDVI and PRI was different depending on the degree of physiological heat stress by high temperature conditions. The NDVI after the heading under extremely high air temperature was not dropped and remained the value before heading. The PRI decreased at all air temperature conditions after the heading; the PRI of the plot exposed to the elevated air temperature was higher than that under ambient air temperature. Further, the relative change in NDVI and PRI after the heading exhibited a strong relationship with the ripening ratio of paddy rice, which is the variable related to crop yield.

Timely and accurate estimation of crop yield at the field scale is of great significance for crop management, harvest and trade. It ultimately enables farmers to optimize inputs and economic return. We selected an irrigated wheat field in a region near Kaifeng, Henan province, for this study. The terrain in that region is undulating and spatial differences. We used a low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing platform equipped with a multi-spectral camera, thermal infrared camera, and RGB camera to simultaneously obtain different remote sensing parameters during the key growth stages of wheat. Based on the extracted spectral reflectivity, thermal infrared temperature, and digital elevation information, we calculated the spatial variability of remote sensing parameters, and growth indices under different terrain characteristics. We also analyzed the correlations between vegetation indices, temperature parameters and wheat yield. By means of four machine learning methods, including multiple linear regression method (MLR), partial least squares regression method (PLSR), support vector machine regression method (SVR), and random forest regression method (RFR), we compared the yield estimation capability of single-modal data versus multimodal data fusion frameworks. The results showed that slope was an important factor affecting crop growth and yield. We observed significant differences in remote sensing parameters under different slope grades. Soil water content, water content of plants, and above-ground biomass at the three growth stages were significantly correlated with slope. Most of the vegetation indices and temperature parameters of three growth stages were significantly correlated with yield as well. Based on the strength of their correlation with yield, seven vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, EVI2, OSAVI, SAVI, NDRE, and WDRVI) and two temperature parameters (NRCT, CTD) were selected as the final input variables for the model. For the single-modal data framework, the model constructed with the vegetation indices was better than the yield model constructed with the temperature parameters, and the highest accuracy was obtained with a RFR model based on vegetation indices at filling stage (R2 = 0.724, RMSE = 614.72 kg hm-2, MAE = 478.08 kg hm-2). For the double modal data fusion approach, the highest accuracy resulted at flowering stage, using the temperature parameters combined with the vegetation indices of RFR model (R2=0.865, RMSE=440.73 kg hm-2, MAE=374.86 kg hm-2). Even higher accuracies were obtained, using the multimodal data fusion approach with a RFR model based on vegetation indices, temperature parameters and slope information at flowering stage (R2 = 0.893, RMSE = 420.06 kg hm-2, MAE = 352.69 kg hm-2), and the highest validation model (R2 = 0.892, RMSE = 423.55 kg hm-2, MAE = 334.43 kg hm-2) for fusion of the flowering stage. The results revealed that by using a multimodal data fusion framework of terrain factors combined with RFR, we can fully exploit the complementary and synergistic roles of different remote sensing information sources. This effectively improves the accuracy and stability of the yield estimation model, and provides a reference and support for crop growth monitoring and yield estimation. © 2022, Science Press.

This study examines the utility of Sentinel-2 satellite data and environmental variables to map soil nitrogen at smallholder maize farms. Three machine learning algorithms—random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and extreme gradient boosting (XG) were investigated for this purpose. The findings indicate that the RF (R2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.0076%) model performs slightly better than the GB (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 0.0083%) and XG (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.0077%) models.

This variety can serve as a full-fledged alternative to modern wheat but has a lower yield than modern varieties. It is commonly known that wheat growth is influenced by soil tillage technology (among other things). However, it is not known how soil tillage technology affects ancient varieties. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of different soil tillage technologies on the growth of the ancient Khorasan wheat variety in comparison to the modern Kabot spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) variety. The trial was arranged in six small plots, one half of which was sown by the Khorasan wheat variety and the other half of which was sown by the Kabot wheat variety. Three soil tillage methods were used for each cultivar: conventional tillage (CT) (20–25 cm), minimum tillage (MTC) with a coulter cultivator (15 cm), and minimization tillage (MTD) with a disc cultivator (12 cm). The soil surface of all of the variants were leveled after tillage (harrows & levelling bars). An unmanned aerial vehicle with multispectral and thermal cameras was used to monitor growth during the vegetation season. The flight missions were supplemented by measurements using the GreenSeeker hand-held sensor and plant and soil analysis. The results showed that the Khorasan ancient wheat was better suited the conditions of conventional tillage, with low values of bulk density and highvalues of total soil porosity, which generally increased the nutritional value of the yield in this experimental plot. At the same time, it was found that this ancient wheat does not deplete the soil. The results also showed that the trend of developmental growing curves derived from different sensors was very similar regardless of measurement method.

While developed countries have led the innovation and adoption of digital agriculture, the potential impact in developing countries— including in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region—is massive. This article synthesizes existing evidence to review the potential and current contribution of digital technologies to the agrifood sectors in MENA. Digital agriculture shows promise in addressing the key challenges facing the agri-food sector across MENA countries. Improvements in primary production, supply chain and logistics performance, and optimized use of scarce natural resources (notably agricultural water) could be notable, if digital technologies can be implemented as envisioned. Available evidence shows that adoption of digital agriculture is at early stages, generally led by high-value agricultural production targeting domestic markets in Gulf countries and export markets in Mashreq countries. Economic sustainability appears the strongest force for current adoption, with less focus on social or environmental sustainability. Public policies should not only foster the adoption of digital technologies in MENA but also ensure equity of access, transparency of use, data protections, and labor protections. Policymakers should move beyond traditional, production-centric views to deliver also on social and environmental sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

In the current research, the weighted additive soil quality index (SQIw), factor analysis (FA), and multiple linear regression (MLR) are used to assess the soil quality of rainfed winter wheat fields with two soil orders on 53.20 km2 of agricultural land in western Iran. A total of 18 soil quality indicators were determined for 100 soil samples (0–20 cm depth) from two soil orders (Inceptisols and Entisols). The soil properties measured were: PH, soil texture, organic carbon (OC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), electrical conductivity (EC), soil microbial respiration (SMR), carbonate calcium equivalent (CCE), soil porosity (SP), bulk density (BD), exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), mean weight diameter (MWD), available potassium (AK), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), available Fe (AFe), available Zn (AZn), available Mn (AMn), and available Cu (ACu). Wheat grain yield for all of the 100 sampling sites was also gathered. The SQIw was calculated using two weighting methods (FA and MLR) and maps were created using a digital soil mapping framework. The soil indicators determined for the minimum data set (MDS) were AK, clay, CEC, AP, SMR, and sand. The correlation between the MLR weighting technique (SQIw-M) and the rainfed wheat yield (r = 0.62) was slightly larger than that the correlation of yield with the FA weighted technique (SQIw-F) (r = 0.58). Results showed that the means of both SQIw-M and SQIw-F and rainfed wheat yield for Inceptisols were higher than for Entisols, although these differences were not statistically significant. Both SQIw-M and SQIw-F showed that areas with Entisols had lower proportions of good soil quality grades (Grades I and II), and higher proportions of poor soil quality grades (Grades IV and V) compared to Inceptisols. Based on these results, soil type must be considered for soil quality assessment in future studies to maintain and enhance soil quality and sustainable production. The overall soil quality of the study region was of poor and moderate grades. To improve soil quality, it is therefore recommended that effective practices such as the implementation of scientifically integrated nutrient management involving the combined use of organic and inorganic fertilizers in rainfed wheat fields should be promoted. © 2020 by the authors.","Big data; Data science; Digital soil mapping; Internet of things (IoT); Machine learning; Multiple linear regression; Principal component analysis; Smart agriculture; Soil quality index; Susceptibility; Sustainable food production; Wheat production",,Article,Scopus

Due to the lack of a high-resolution cropland dataset, impacts of land use change (LUC) on the LMAV ecosystem services have not been fully understood. In this study, we developed a novel framework by integrating the machine learning algorithm, county-level agricultural census, and satellite-based cropland products to reconstruct the LMAV cropland distribution during 1850–2018 at a 30-m resolution. Results showed that the LMAV cropland area increased from 0.78 × 104 km2 in 1850 to 6.64 × 104 km2 in 1980 and then decreased to 6.16 × 104 km2 in 2018. Cropland expansion rate was the largest in the 1960s (749 km2 yr−1) but decreased rapidly thereafter, whereas cropland abandonment rate increased substantially in recent decades with the largest rate of 514 km2 yr−1 in the 2010s. Our dataset has three notable features: (1) the depiction of fine spatial details, (2) the integration of the county-level census, and (3) the inclusion of a machine-learning algorithm trained by satellite-based land cover product. Most importantly, our dataset well captured the continuous increasing trend in cropland area from 1930–1960, which was misrepresented by other cropland datasets reconstructed from the state-level census. Our dataset would be important to accurately evaluate the impacts of historical deforestation and recent afforestation efforts on regional ecosystem services, attribute the observed hydrological changes to anthropogenic and natural driving factors, and investigate how the socioeconomic factors control regional LUC pattern. Our framework and dataset are crucial to developing managerial and policy strategies for conserving natural resources and enhancing ecosystem services in the LMAV. © 2020 The Authors","Afforestation; Cropland expansion; Ecosystem services; Land use change; Logistic regression; Marginal croplands","afforestation; agricultural land; ecosystem service; land use change; machine learning; reconstruction; regression analysis; remote sensing",Article,Scopus

Due to a lack of information about crop distribution over large agricultural areas, as well as the crop separation problem (based on remote sensing data) caused by the similarity of phenological cycles, a question arises regarding the relevance of using data obtained from the arable land mask of the region to predict the yield of individual crops. This study aimed to develop a regression model for soybean crop yield monitoring in municipalities and was conducted in the Khabarovsk Territory, located in the Russian Far East. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, an arable land mask, the meteorological characteristics obtained using the VEGA-Science web service, and crop yield data for 2010-2019 were used. The structure of crop distribution in the Khabarovsk District was reproduced in experimental fields, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) seasonal variation approximating functions were constructed (both for total district sown area and different crops). It was found that the approximating function graph for the experimental fields corresponds to a similar graph for arable land. The maximum NDVI forecast error on the 30th week in 2019 using the approximation parameters according to 2014-2018 did not exceed 0.5%. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 0.054. The maximum value of the NDVI, as well as the indicators characterizing the temperature regime, soil moisture, and photosynthetically active radiation in the region during the period from the 1st to the 30th calendar weeks of the year, were previously considered as parameters of the regression model for predicting soybean yield. As a result of the experiments, the NDVI and the duration of the growing season were included in the regression model as independent variables. According to 2010-2018, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the regression model was 6.2%, and the soybean yield prediction absolute percentage error (APE) for 2019 was 6.3%, while RMSE was 0.13 t/ha. This approach was evaluated with a leave-one-year-out cross-validation procedure. When the calculated maximum NDVI value was used in the regression equation for early forecasting, MAPE in the 28th-30th weeks was less than 10%. © 2020 by the authors.","Approximation; Arable land mask; NDVI; Remote sensing; Soybean crop yield","Agricultural robots; Crops; Electromagnetic wave emission; Errors; Food supply; Forecasting; Land use; Logistic regression; Mean square error; Radiometers; Soil moisture; Web services; Independent variables; Mean absolute percentage error; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer datum; Normalized difference vegetation index; Phenological cycles; Photosynthetically active radiation; Root mean square errors; Separation problems; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

This paper explores the performance of the pollen calendar as the most basic observation-oriented model for predicting daily concentrations of airborne Ambrosia, Betula and Poaceae pollen. Pollen calendars were calculated as the mean or median value of pollen concentrations on the same date in previous years of the available historic dataset, as well as the mean or median value of pollen concentrations of the smoothed dataset, pre-processed using moving mean and moving median. The performance of the models was evaluated by comparing forecasted to measured pollen concentrations at both daily and 10-day-average resolutions. This research demonstrates that the interpolation of missing data and pre-processing of the calibration dataset yields lower prediction errors. The increase in the number of calibration years corresponds to an improvement in the performance of the calendars in predicting daily pollen concentrations. However, the most significant improvement was obtained using four calibration years. The calendar models correspond well to the shape of the pollen curve. It was also found that daily resolution instead of 10-day averages adds to their value by emphasising variability in pollen exposure, which is important for personal assessment of dose-response for pollen-sensitive individuals. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Airborne pollen; Birch; Data-driven predictive modelling; Grass; Ragweed","analytical error; Article; birch; calibration; concentration (parameters); information processing; nonhuman; Poaceae; pollen analysis; pollination; prediction; priority journal; ragweed; seasonal variation",Article,Scopus

However, a shift in land use from cotton to perennial grasses and a change in land management such as the harvesting of mesquite for biofuel production can significantly affect regional hydrology and water quality. In this study, APEX and SWAT models were integrated to assess the impacts of replacing cotton with Alamo switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and Miscanthus × giganteus in the upstream subwatershed and harvesting mesquite in the downstream subwatershed on water and nitrogen balances in the Double Mountain Fork Brazos watershed in the SHP and TRP regions. Simulated average (1994–2009) annual surface runoff from the baseline cotton areas decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) by 88%, and percolation increased by 28% under the perennial grasses scenario compared to the baseline cotton scenario. The soil water content enhanced significantly under the irrigated switchgrass scenario compared to the baseline irrigated cotton scenario from January to April and August to October. However, the soil water content was depleted significantly under the dryland Miscanthus scenario from April to July relative to the baseline dryland cotton scenario. The nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and organic-N loads in surface runoff and NO3-N leaching to groundwater reduced significantly by 86%, 98%, and 100%, respectively, under the perennial grasses scenario. Similarly, surface runoff, and NO3-N and organic-N loads through surface runoff reduced significantly by 98.9%, 99.9%, and 99.5%, respectively, under the post-mesquite-harvest scenario. Perennial grasses exhibited superior ethanol production potential compared to mesquite.

In this Review, we discuss how approaches to estimate agricultural losses for index insurance have evolved from costly field-sampling-based campaigns towards lower-cost techniques using weather and satellite data. We identify advances in remote sensing and crop modelling for assessing agricultural conditions, but reliably and cheaply assessing production losses remains challenging in complex landscapes. We illustrate how an economic framework can be used to gauge and enhance the value of insurance based on earth-observation data, emphasizing that even as yield-estimation techniques improve, the value of an index insurance contract for the insured depends largely on how well it captures the losses when people suffer most. Strategically improving the collection and accessibility of reliable ground-reference data on crop types and production would facilitate this task.

We then explore the potential afforded by ML to fill gaps in our current methodological toolbox. We discuss use cases like the need for flexible functional forms, the use of unstructured data, and large numbers of explanatory variables in both prediction and causal analysis. We also highlight the challenges of complex simulation models including calibration, validation and computational demands and identify places where machine learning can help. We highlight these issues drawing from existing examples in agricultural and applied economics. To unpack the “black box” of ML, we present numerous approaches used in computer science and statistics for model interpretability. Finally, we highlight some ethical issues around the use of ML.

Studies conducted at tree or plot scales on the supply of ecosystem services (ES) suggest that agroforestry practices are a promising way to build multifunctional agricultural landscapes. However, the current characterization and understanding of how multiple ES are associated across such heterogeneous agricultural landscapes are still limited. This study provides the first characterization of the multiple ESs supplied by a Sahelian Faidherbia albida agroforestry parkland and their relationships. Relying on field data for 11 ES indicators, recent advances in remote sensing-derived information, and blending different ES mapping approaches, we first assessed the spatial heterogeneity of the supply of each ES. We found that the majority of ES indicators remained below ES potential values over the study area by 25 % to 50 %, revealing that there is a considerable scope for increasing the ES supply in the F. albida parkland. Then, using a scoring approach, we analyzed the supply of multiple ESs. We observed a large number of hotspots and a clear effect of the proximity of F. albida trees fostering the supply of multiple ESs in their vicinity. Finally, we mapped and analyzed the dominant relationships – trade-offs, synergies or losses – between ESs from a cooccurrence spatial approach. We showed that significant trade-offs and losses (58 % of the area) between ESs can exist in the F. albida parkland. Interestingly, we also showed that synergies occurred mainly up to 10 m from the F. albida trees, suggesting that synergies need to be increased beyond this threshold. By adopting an original ES valuation framework, we provided basic insights into ESs and their relationships.

Field experiments were conducted during 2017–18 and 2018–19 to obtain visible and thermal images of 24 wheat cultivars having different levels of WYR resistance at critical growth stages. Machine learning (ML) models were constructed using the combinations of image indices (IN) and partial least square regression (PLS) scores of image indices with disease severity (DS) and Yeo-Johnson (YJ) transformed values of disease severity. The results revealed that 26 visible and 2 thermal indices considered in this study have significant correlations with WYR. The models performances were evaluated using four possible dataset combinations of (1) disease severity + indices, (2) disease severity + PLS scores of indices, (3) YJ transformed disease severity + indices, and (4) YJ transformed disease severity + PLS scores. Disease severity with image derived indices was found to be the best dataset for the prediction of WYR severity using machine learning models with an R2 and d-index above 0.95 during calibration, while up to 0.67 and 0.87, respectively during validation.

Pests and diseases are a major obstacle to achieving this productivity outcome. Therefore, it is very important to develop efficient methods for the automatic detection, identification, and prediction of pests and diseases in agricultural crops. To perform such automation, Machine Learning (ML) techniques can be used to derive knowledge and relationships from the data that is being worked on. This paper presents a literature review on ML techniques used in the agricultural sector, focusing on the tasks of classification, detection, and prediction of diseases and pests, with an emphasis on tomato crops. This survey aims to contribute to the development of smart farming and precision agriculture by promoting the development of techniques that will allow farmers to decrease the use of pesticides and chemicals while preserving and improving their crop quality and production. © 2022 by the authors.","classification; detection; forecasting; machine learning; plant diseases and pests; precision farming; smart farming",,Review,Scopus

The extent of burned areas (BAs) is one of many indicators that reflect the magnitudes and impacts from fire events, and such information is also used for planning the response and recovery steps after the fire events. This information is usually derived using remote sensing (RS) data. However, the assessment on the performance using available RS data, possible RS data combinations, and existing methods is needed to regularly monitor the BA extent. This study aims to assess the performance from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar polarization (Pol.) and gray-level of co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textural features and the integration with Sentinel-2 spectral data (Spec.) for the monthly mapping of BA extent using machine learning algorithms, such as random forests (RFs) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). The study took place in the parts of Ogan Komering Ilir Regency and Banyuasin in South Sumatra Province, Indonesia. This area has complex land-use classes, such as natural vegetation and plantations (pulpwood and oil palm), which were affected by the 2019's fire events. Our study demonstrated that the combination between Pol. from Sentinel-1 and spectral data from Sentinel-2 (Diff.Pol + Spec.) yielded the best classification accuracy with the overall accuracy (OA) values ranging from 91.80% (XGB) to 95.80% (RF) with the producer's accuracy (PA) from 73.33% to 97.66% and user's accuracy (UA) from 76.69% to 89.80% for the BA class.

ReliefF algorithm with linear projection was employed to select the best combination of spectral indices in oil palm discrimination. Oil palm land cover was classified using random forest (RF) and modified AdaBoost algorithms.

To assess the impacts of soil water simulation approaches on various model outputs, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool was modified to accommodate an alternative soil water percolation method and tested at two geographically and climatically distinct, instrumented watersheds in the United States. Soil water was evaluated at the site scale via measured observations, and hydrologic and biophysical outputs were analysed at the watershed scale. Results demonstrated an improved Kling–Gupta Efficiency of up to 0.3 and a reduction in percent bias from 5 to 25% at the site scale, when soil water percolation was changed from a threshold, bucket-based approach to an alternative approach based on variable hydraulic conductivity. The primary difference between the approaches was attributed to the ability to simulate soil water content above field capacity for successive days; however, regardless of the approach, a lack of site-specific characterization of soil properties by the soils database at the site scale was found to severely limit the analysis. Differences in approach led to a regime shift in percolation from a few, high magnitude events to frequent, low magnitude events. At the watershed scale, the variable hydraulic conductivity-based approach reduced average annual percolation by 20–50 mm, directly impacting the water balance and subsequently biophysical predictions. For instance, annual denitrification increased by 14–24 kg/ha for the new approach.

Designed system explores integrated application of remote sensing (RS) sciences and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology. Terra MODIS 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maximum value composite (MVC) image product MOD13A1 of 500 m spatial resolution covering Bangladesh have been utilized for a period 2011–2017. Hence the district-wise sum of NDVI on pixel-by-pixel has been calculated from Jan–April during 2011–2017. Regression analysis between district-based pixel-wise summation of MODIS-NDVI and district-wise BBS (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics) estimated Boro production revealed strong correlation (R2 = 0.57–0.85) where in March most of the regression coefficient shows significant correlation due to maximize photosynthetic activities. Therefore, the highest regression coefficient value from derived set of coefficient value (BCP-Boro Crop Production Model 2) has been utilized to obtain year-wise rice productions for all the years (2011–2017). Global Positioning System (GPS)-based field verification, accuracy assessment and validation operation have been carried out at randomly selected geographical positions over the country using various statistical tools. The results demonstrate good agreement between estimated and predicted yearly Boro rice production during 2011–2017 time period with Mean Bias Error (MBE) = −29,881 to 19,431 M.Ton; Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 5238 to 11,852 M.Ton; Model Efficiency (ME) = (0.86–0.94); Correlation Coefficients = 0.65 to 0.87. Therefore MODIS-NDVI based regression model seems to be effective for Boro production forecasting. The system generally appears to be relatively fast, simple, reasonably accurate and suitable for nation-wide crop statistics generation and food security issues. © 2019 by the authors.

Electrical conductivity (EC) is expected to correlate with the pertinent factors that regulate the crop yield (i.e., soil texture, cation exchange, drainage conditions, organic matter level, salinity, and the subsoil characteristics), which in turn, can also acts to control the overall health of the crop. Utilizing a fast and efficient artificial intelligence approach, this study designs a hybrid predictive model integrating multilayer perceptron with the Firefly Algorithm (MLP-FFA), and then evaluates its performance in respect to the standalone MLP and the ordinary kriging (OK) model applied in agricultural locality of the Soofiyan, plains in Tabriz, northwest of Iran. To develop a spatial modelling framework, 126 distinct measurements of EC were obtained through a grid sampled at 1000 m × 1000 m spacing, partitioned in training (88) and testing (38) sets. Applying a ratio of nugget to sill to determine the spatial dependence, a spatial modelling strategy was utilized where the spherical, exponential, Gaussian and linear semi-variograms depicting the autocorrelation of the sampled points (latitude × longitude) over the study area were analyzed in ArcGIS to deduce the optimal data characteristics and the respective statistical model. Spherical semi-variogram was the optimal representor for EC, relative to its latitude and longitude, in agreement with the lowest Residual Sums of Squares (RSS) and the highest coefficient of determination (R2). Hybrid MLP-FFA and standalone MLP models were thus developed with latitude, longitude and measured electrical conductivity in the training set and evaluated in respect to the OK method by means of statistical scores: root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) including the normalized metrics represented by Willmott's Index (WI), Nash Sutcliffe's coefficient (ENS) and Legates &amp; McCabe's Index (ELM). Verified by diagnostic plots and grid-averaged metrics, the results revealed that the hybrid MLP-FFA model performed significantly better than both comparative models, with WI = 0.780 relative to 0.637 (MLP) and 0.714 (OK) models and ENS = 0.725 (vs. 0.511 &amp; 0.589) and ELM = 0.552 (vs. 0.402 &amp; 0.413), respectively. Expanded uncertainty, t-statistic and global performance indicators combining the R2, RMSE and mean bias error and a Taylor plot also confirmed the efficacy of the hybrid MLP-FFA over the standalone MLP and OK model. There was no significant difference between the results of standalone MLP and OK when evaluated through spatial trend maps, while the hybrid MLP-FFA model exhibited a better ability to establishing nonlinear relationships with electrical conductivity data, resulting in a better representation of the spatially modelled EC. Our results ascertain the prodigious performance of a hybrid MLP-FFA over a standalone MLP and ordinary kriging approaches, attributable to a better utility of the Firefly algorithm in improved spatial estimation of electrical conductivity. This study concludes that the hybrid MLP-FFA model should be explored to solve practical problems in soil physics, particularly in designing decision-support systems to attain agricultural precision. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Electrical conductivity; Firefly algorithm; Spatial estimation","Artificial intelligence; Bioluminescence; Crops; Decision support systems; Electric conductivity; Errors; Expert systems; Interpolation; Mean square error; Optimization; Soil mechanics; Coefficient of determination; Electrical conductivity; Firefly algorithms; Non-linear relationships; Proximal soil sensing; Root mean square errors; Soil electrical conductivity; Spatial estimation; Soils; ArcGIS; artificial intelligence; autocorrelation; bulk density; crop yield; electrical conductivity; kriging; soil analysis; soil chemistry; soil organic matter; spatial analysis; East Azerbaijan; Iran; Tabriz",Article,Scopus

Many studies have been undertaken globally to estimate grassland biomass by using satellite remote sensing data, but rarely in systems like Ireland's intensively managed, but small-scale pastures, where grass is grazed as well as harvested for winter fodder. Multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models were developed to estimate the grassland biomass (kg dry matter/ha/day) of two intensively managed grassland farms in Ireland. For the first test site (Moorepark) 12 years (2001-2012) and for second test site (Grange) 6 years (2001- 2005, 2007) of in situ measurements (weekly measured biomass) were used for model development. Five vegetation indices plus two raw spectral bands (RED=red band, NIR=Near Infrared band) derived from an 8-day MODIS product (MOD09Q1) were used as an input for all three models. Model evaluation shows that the ANFIS (R2 Moorepark = 0.85, RMSEMoorepark = 11.07; R2 Grange = 0.76, RMSEGrange = 15.35) has produced improved estimation of biomass as compared to the ANN and MLR.

It is therefore critical that forest dynamics are adequately represented in watershed models, such as the widely applied Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). SWAT's default parameterization generally produces unrealistic forest growth predictions, which we address here through an improved representation of forest dynamics using species-specific re-parameterizations. We applied this methodology to the two dominant pine species in the southeastern U.S., loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) and slash pine (Pinus elliotti). Specifically, we replaced unrealistic parameter values related to tree growth with physically meaningful parameters derived from publicly available remote-sensing products, field measurements, published literature, and expert knowledge. Outputs of the default and re-parameterized models were compared at four pine plantation sites across a range of management, soil, and climate conditions. Results were validated against MODIS-derived leaf area index (LAI) and evapotranspiration (ET), as well as field observations of total biomass. The re-parameterized model outperformed the default model in simulating LAI, biomass accumulation, and ET at all sites. The two parametrizations also resulted in substantially different mean annual water budgets for all sites, with reductions in water yield ranging from 13 to 45% under the new parameterization, highlighting the importance of properly parameterizing forest dynamics in watershed models. Importantly, our re-parameterization methodology does not require alteration to the SWAT code, allowing it to be readily adapted and applied in ongoing and future watershed modeling studies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass; Evapotranspiration; Leaf area index; MODIS; Southern pines; SWAT; Water balance","Atmospheric boundary layer; Biomass; Budget control; Climate models; Forestry; Groundwater; Parameterization; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Watersheds; Forest dynamics; Hydrologic cycles; Leaf Area Index; Parameterized model; Reparameterization; Soil and Water assessment tools; Southern pines; Surface dynamics; Water balance; Watershed modelling; Evapotranspiration; water; biomass; coniferous forest; evapotranspiration; forest dynamics; hydrological modeling; leaf area index; MODIS; soil and water assessment tool; water budget; Article; biomass; climate; controlled study; environmental management; evapotranspiration; geographic distribution; hydrological model; leaf area; loblolly pine; pine; Pinus elliotti; prediction; re parameterized Soil and Water Assessment Tool model; remote sensing; simulation; slash pine; soil; Soil and Water Assessment Tool model; surface runoff; United States; water supply; forest; hydrology; loblolly pine; tree; United States; Forests; Hydrology; Pinus taeda; Soil; Trees",Article,Scopus

Yet, the water balance of cultivated areas is strongly influenced by applied management practices (e.g. planting, irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting). The SWAT+ (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model represents agricultural land by default in a generic way, where the start of the cropping season is driven by accumulated heat units. However, this approach does not work for tropical and subtropical regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, where crop growth dynamics are mainly controlled by rainfall rather than temperature. In this study, we present an approach on how to incorporate crop phenology using decision tables and global datasets of rainfed and irrigated croplands with the associated cropping calendar and fertilizer applications in a regional SWAT+ model for northeastern Africa. We evaluate the influence of the crop phenology representation on simulations of leaf area index (LAI) and evapotranspiration (ET) using LAI remote sensing data from Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) and WaPOR (Water Productivity through Open access of Remotely sensed derived data) ET data, respectively. Results show that a representation of crop phenology using global datasets leads to improved temporal patterns of LAI and ET simulations, especially for regions with a single cropping cycle. However, for regions with multiple cropping seasons, global phenology datasets need to be complemented with local data or remote sensing data to capture additional cropping seasons. In addition, the improvement of the cropping season also helps to improve soil erosion estimates, as the timing of crop cover controls erosion rates in the model. With more realistic growing seasons, soil erosion is largely reduced for most agricultural hydrologic response units (HRUs), which can be considered as a move towards substantial improvements over previous estimates. We conclude that regional and global hydrological models can benefit from improved representations of crop phenology and the associated management practices. Future work regarding the incorporation of multiple cropping seasons in global phenology data is needed to better represent cropping cycles in areas where they occur using regional to global hydrological models. © Copyright:",,"Biology; Cultivation; Decision tables; Erosion; Hydrology; Land use; Remote sensing; Soils; Tropics; Agricultural land use; Crop phenology; Cropping seasons; Global datasets; Leaf Area Index; Management practises; Remote sensing data; Soil and Water assessment tools; Soil erosion; Tool models; Crops; agricultural land; agricultural management; hydrological change; land use; soil and water assessment tool",Article,Scopus

However, a current knowledge gap lies in the integration of AutoML technology and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) within image-based data classification tasks. Therefore, we employed a state-of-the-art (SOTA) and completely open-source AutoML framework, Auto-sklearn, which was constructed based on one of the most widely used ML systems: Scikit-learn. It was combined with two novel AutoML visualization tools to focus particularly on the recognition and adoption of UAS-derived multispectral vegetation indices (VI) data across a diverse range of agricultural management practices (AMP). These include soil tillage methods (STM), cultivation methods (CM), and manure application (MA), and are under the four-crop combination fields (i.e., red clover-grass mixture, spring wheat, pea-oat mixture, and spring barley). Furthermore, they have currently not been efficiently examined and accessible parameters in UAS applications are absent for them. We conducted the comparison of AutoML performance using three other common machine learning classifiers, namely Random Forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). The results showed AutoML achieved the highest overall classification accuracy numbers after 1200 s of calculation. RF yielded the second-best classification accuracy, and SVM and ANN were revealed to be less capable among some of the given datasets. Regarding the classification of AMPs, the best recognized period for data capture occurred in the crop vegetative growth stage (in May). The results demonstrated that CM yielded the best performance in terms of classification, followed by MA and STM. Our framework presents new insights into plant–environment interactions with capable classification capabilities.

In this study, the potential of exploiting three categories of ML regression models, including classical regression, shallow learning and deep learning for predicting soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from an agricultural field was explored. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, as well as various environmental, agronomic and soil data were measured at the site over a five-year period in Quebec, Canada. The rigorous analysis, which included statistical comparison and cross-validation for the prediction of CO2 and N2O fluxes, confirmed that the LSTM model performed the best among the considered ML models with the highest R coefficient and the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) values (R = 0.87 and RMSE = 30.3 mg·m−2·hr−1 for CO2 flux prediction and R = 0.86 and RMSE = 0.19 mg·m−2·hr−1 for N2O flux prediction). The predictive performances of LSTM were more accurate than those simulated in a previous study conducted by a biophysical-based Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2). The classical regression models (namely RF, SVM and LASSO) satisfactorily simulated cyclical and seasonal variations of CO2 fluxes (R = 0.75, 0.71 and 0.68, respectively); however, they failed to reasonably predict the peak values of N2O fluxes (R &lt; 0.25). Shallow ML was found to be less effective in predicting GHG fluxes than other considered ML models (R &lt; 0.7 for CO2 flux and R &lt; 0.3 for estimating N2O fluxes) and was the most sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. Based on this comprehensive comparison study, it was elicited that the LSTM model can be employed successfully in simulating GHG emissions from agricultural soils, providing a new perspective on the application of machine learning modeling for predicting GHG emissions to the environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural soil; Classical regression; Deep learning; Greenhouse gas emissions; Machine learning; Shallow learning","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Deep learning; Forecasting; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Mean square error; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Water quality; Agricultural fields; Comprehensive comparisons; Environmental phenomena; Machine learning models; Predictive performance; Root mean squared errors; Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2); Statistical comparisons; Long short-term memory; carbon dioxide; nitrous oxide; agricultural soil; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; greenhouse gas; machine learning; nitrous oxide; prediction; regression analysis; soil emission; agricultural soil; Article; biophysics; Canada; carbon footprint; controlled study; deep learning; greenhouse gas; machine learning; measurement accuracy; priority journal; process optimization; random forest; seasonal variation; simulation training; soil; Canada; Quebec [Canada]",Article,Scopus

Visualisation is a powerful technique used in these systems that provides an indispensable step in assisting end-users to understand and interpret the data. In this paper, we present a systematic review to synthesise literature related to the use of visualisation techniques in the domain of agriculture. The search identified 61 eligible articles, from which we established end-users, visualisation techniques and data collection methods across different application domains. We found visualisation techniques used in various areas of agriculture, including viticulture, dairy farming, wheat production and irrigation management. Our results show that the majority of DSSs utilise maps, together with satellite imagery, as the central visualisation.

Mathematical models are crucial for strategic and forecasting applications; however, models related to the banana crop are less common, and reviews on previous modelling efforts are scarce, emphasizing the need for evidence-based studies on this topic. Therefore, we reviewed 75 full-text articles published between 1985 and 2021 for information on mathematical models related to banana growth and, fruit and fibre yield. We analysed results in order to provide a descriptive synthesis of selected studies. According to the co-occurrence analysis, most studies were conducted on the mathematical modelling of banana fruit production. Modellers often used multiple linear regression models to estimate banana plant growth and fruit yield. Existing models incorporate a range of predictor variables, growth conditions, varieties, modelling approaches and evaluation methods, which limits comparative evaluation and selection of the best model. However, the banana process-based simulation model 'SIMBA' and artificial neural network have proven their robust applicability to estimate banana plant growth. This review shows that there is insufficient information on mathematical models related to banana fibre yield. This review could aid stakeholders in identifying the strengths and limitations of existing models, as well as providing insight on how to build novel and reliable banana crop-related mathematical models.

Therefore, phenotyping to enhance resilience to these abiotic stresses is critical for sustaining genetic gains in crop improvement programs. However, traditional methods for screening traits related to these stresses are slow, laborious, and often expensive. Remote sensing provides opportunities to introduce low-cost, less biased, high-Throughput phenotyping methods to capture large genetic diversity to facilitate enhancement of stress resilience in crops. This review focuses on four key physiological traits and processes that are critical in understanding crop responses to drought and heat stress during reproductive and grain-filling periods. Specifically, these traits include: (i) time of day of flowering, to escape these stresses during flowering; (ii) optimizing photosynthetic efficiency; (iii) storage and translocation of water-soluble carbohydrates; and (iv) yield and yield components to provide in-season yield estimates. Moreover, we provide an overview of current advances in remote sensing in capturing these traits, and discuss the limitations with existing technology as well as future direction of research to develop high-Throughput phenotyping approaches. In the future, phenotyping these complex traits will require sensor advancement, high-quality imagery combined with machine learning methods, and efforts in transdisciplinary science to foster integration across disciplines. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.","Drought stress; Field-based high-Throughput phenotyping; Heat stress; Photosynthetic efficiency; Remote sensing; Time of day of flowering; Water-soluble carbohydrates; Yield estimation",,Review,Scopus

In this study, soil physical and chemical variables and plots characteristics were used through linear mixed and random forest-based modeling to evaluate the determinants of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and crop water productivity (CWP) in rice in the Kou Valley irrigated scheme in Burkina Faso. Multi-temporal Landsat images were used within the Python module for the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land model to calculate rice ETa and CWP during the dry seasons of 2013 and 2014. Results showed noticeable spatial variations in PySEBAL-derived ETa and CWP in farmers’ fields during the study period. The distance between plot and irrigation scheme inlet (DPSI), plot elevation, sand and silt contents, soil total nitrogen, soil extractable potassium and zinc were the main factors affecting variabilities in ETa and CWP in the farmers’ fields, with DPSI being the top explanatory variable. There was generally a positive association, up to a given threshold, between ETa and DPSI, sand and silt contents and soil extractable zinc. For CWP the association patterns for the top six predictors were all non-monotonic; that is a mix of increasing and decreasing associations of a given predictor to either an increase or a decrease in CWP. Our results indicate that improving irrigated rice performance in the Kou Valley irrigation scheme would require growing more rice at lower altitudes (e.g. &lt; 300 m above sea level) and closer to the scheme inlet, in conjunction with a good management of nutrients such as nitrogen and potassium through fertilization. © 2023 The Authors","Irrigation performance; Machine learning; Soil property; Sub-Sahara Africa; Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL); Sustainable agriculture","Crops; Cultivation; Forestry; Interfacial energy; Irrigation; Nitrogen; Potassium; Remote sensing; Sea level; Zinc; Biophysical factors; Crop water productivity; Irrigation performance; Machine-learning; Soil property; Sub-Sahara Africa; Surface energy balance algorithm for land; Surface energy balance algorithm for lands; Sustainable agriculture; Machine learning; alternative agriculture; altitude; assessment method; climate conditions; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; Landsat; remote sensing; rice; satellite imagery; seasonal variation; semiarid region; soil property; Burkina Faso",Article,Scopus

The increasing interest in this crop requires accelerated selection and the development of new screening techniques. New analytical methods that are more accurate and less labor-intensive are needed to better characterize the effects of genetics and the environment on key traits under field conditions. We used persistent multispectral and photogrammetric UAV time-series imagery collected 10 times over the season, together with ground-truth data for thousands of Miscanthus genotypes, to determine the flowering time, culm length, and biomass yield traits. We compared the performance of convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures that used image data from single dates (2D-spatial) versus the integration of multiple dates by 3D-spatiotemporal architectures. The ability of UAV-based remote sensing to rapidly and non-destructively assess large-scale genetic variation in flowering time, height, and biomass production was improved through the use of 3D-spatiotemporal CNN architectures versus 2D-spatial CNN architectures. The performance gains of the best 3D-spatiotemporal analyses compared to the best 2D-spatial architectures manifested in up to 23% improvements in R2, 17% reductions in RMSE, and 20% reductions in MAE. The integration of photogrammetric and spectral features with 3D architectures was crucial to the improved assessment of all traits. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the integration of high-spatiotemporal-resolution UAV imagery with 3D-CNNs enables more accurate monitoring of the dynamics of key phenological and yield-related crop traits. This is especially valuable in highly productive, perennial grass crops such as Miscanthus, where in-field phenotyping is especially challenging and traditionally limits the rate of crop improvement through breeding. © 2022 by the authors.","biomass; convolutional neural networks; culm length; flowering time; Miscanthus; time series","Aerial photography; Antennas; Biomass; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Deep neural networks; Genes; Image enhancement; Integration; Network architecture; Photogrammetry; Remote sensing; Time series; % reductions; Aerial imagery; Convolutional neural network; Culm length; Flowering-time; Miscanthus; Neural network architecture; Perennial crops; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Times series; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)",Article,Scopus

To obtain grants, farmers have to apply every year according to the national/regional procedure that, presently, relies on the Geo‐Spatial Aid Application (GSAA). To ensure the properness of applications, national/regional payment agencies (PA) operate random controls through in‐field surveys. EU regulation n. 809/2014 has introduced a new approach to CAP controls based on Copernicus Sentinel‐2 (S2) data. These are expected to better address PA checks on the field, suggesting eventual inconsistencies between satellite‐based deductions and farmers’ declarations. Within this framework, this work proposed a hierarchical (HI) approach to the classification of crops (soya, corn, wheat, rice, and meadow) explicitly aimed at supporting CAP controls in agriculture, with special concerns about the Piemonte Region (NW Italy) agricultural situation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a comparison is made between HI and other, more ordinary approaches. In particular, two algorithms were considered as references: the minimum distance (MD) and the random forest (RF). Tests were operated in a study area located in the southern part of the Vercelli province (Piemonte), which is mainly devoted to agriculture. Training and validation steps were performed for all the classification approaches (HI, MD, RF) using the same ground data. MD and RF were based on S2‐derived NDVI image time series (TS) for the 2020 year. Differently, HI was built according to a rule‐based approach developing according to the following steps: (a) TS standard deviation analysis in the time domain for meadows mapping; (b) MD classification of winter part of TS in the time domain for wheat detection; (c) MD classification of summer part of TS in the time domain for corn classification; (d) selection of a proper summer multi‐spectral image (SMSI) useful for separating rice from soya with MD operated in the spectral domain. To separate crops of interest from other classes, MD‐based classifications belonging to HI were thresholded by Otsu’s method. Overall accuracy for MD, RF, and HI were found to be 63%, 80%, and 89%, respectively. It is worth remarking that thanks to the SMSI‐based approach of HI, a significant improvement was obtained in soya and rice classification. © 2022 by the authors.

However, early mapping of winter wheat using remotely sensed data is challenging because remote sensing observations can only be used for a part of the growth period. In this study, a framework was proposed for early season mapping of winter wheat using spectral and temporal information of Sentinel-2 images. First, time series of temporal and spectral features were derived using Whittaker smoothing. Subsequently, sensitivities of different parameters (i.e. input features, time interval, and length of time-series data) to early mapping were analyzed. Finally, early maps of winter wheat were generated based on optimal parameters. Results show that the earliest identifiable timing was delayed as the time interval of the time series increased. Winter wheat can be mapped in the early overwintering period (5 months before harvest) with an overall accuracy of 0.91, which is comparable to that of post-season mapping (0.94). In addition, the misclassification in early mapping was caused by uneven sample spatial patterns, natural conditions, and planting management; however, most errors can be gradually amended during the green-up and jointing periods, and the overall accuracy remained stable after the jointing stage. This study demonstrates that it is feasible to implement large-scale early mapping of winter wheat using satellite observations. The proposed approach potentially provides a reference for early mapping of other crop types in agricultural regions worldwide. © 2022 The Author(s).

Therefore, a comprehensive investigation is needed to evaluate the impact of land use change on the LST.

The results show that the built-up area in Dhaka city increased by 67% from 1993 to 2020 by replacing lowland mainly, followed by vegetation, bare soil and water bodies. LSTs found in the study area were ranged from 23.26 to 39.94 °C, 23.69 to 43.35 °C and 24.44 to 44.58 °C for the years 1993, 2007 and 2020, respectively. The increases of spatially distributed maximum and mean LST were found 4.62 °C and 6.43 °C, respectively, for the study period of 27 years while the change in minimum LST was not substantial. LST increased by around 0.24 °C per year and human thermal discomfort shifted from moderate to strong heat stress for the total study period due to the increase of built-up and bare lands.

The recent advances in sensing and computational technologies have led to the expanding accessibility of farmland data either obtained distantly or proximally. The increasing availability of massive data and unreservedly accessible open-source algorithms have prompted a quickened use of machine learning (ML) procedures to investigate soil conditions.

Although rice is an important food crop worldwide, yield gaps remain less investigated in Latin American rice systems. In this study, we evaluated field-level factors for closing yield gaps (based on attainable farm yield, defined as the mean of top 10 % of farmers) for rice production in Uruguay using crop management and yield records from 2012 to 2017, covering approximately 70,000 ha per year (40 % of total rice area).

Early seeding was identified as the most influential factor for reducing yield gaps in both systems, followed by N rate. Stand establishment was also important for closing yield gap in non-hybrid fields, while rotation with improved pasture was important in hybrid fields. When variables were categorized as input-related, manageable, or non-manageable, on average manageable factors (e.g. early planting and stand establishment) were more important than input-related factors (e.g. seed or fertilizer rate).

Precipitation indices for DAYMET and PRISM precipitation closely matched GHCN-D, whereas NLDAS and GLDAS showed weaker correlations. We also used these precipitation data as input to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model that confirmed similar trends in streamflow simulation. For stations with complete data, GHCN-D based SWAT-simulated streamflow variability better than gridded precipitation data. During low flow periods we found PRISM performed better, whereas both DAYMET and NLDAS performed better in high flow years. Our results demonstrate that combining gridded precipitation sources with gauge-based measurements can improve hydrologic model performance, especially for extreme events. © 2020 The Authors.

Satellite measurements can complement the restrictive coverage afforded by in-situ measurements and have the potential to facilitate the monitoring of cropland photosynthesis over a large spatial scale in a cost-effective manner. Traditionally, space-based monitoring of cropland photosynthetic activity, especially Light-use efficiency (LUE), has relied on empirical relationships between satellite spectral reflectance and ground climate and vegetation conditions. Space-borne retrievals of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), an independent measurement, has shown to provide a more direct estimation of photosynthetic activity than traditional methods, and may further allow the inference of LUE. This study has empirically explored the possibility of remotely monitoring large-scale LUE by calculating the ratio of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) normalized SIF to the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). We applied this calculation to demonstrate the spatial patterns and seasonal dynamics of LUE and its related measurements in response to land surface temperature (LST) across Australian rainfed croplands from 2007 to 2016. LST was used to provide an integrated measure of vegetation water and heat stress at the canopy level. Our results showed that LUE tends to be higher in the geographical middle zones than in either the warmer northern or the cooler southern regions. Temporally, we found that there was a seasonal asymmetry of LUE and its related measurements in response to LST change throughout the winter crop-growing season. Statistical tests revealed that the optimum LST range for satellite-based LUE was 16.6–17.6 °C during August. The more LST exceeded this optimum, the more sensitive LUE was found to be. Pixels in August with optimum LST across the ten-year sampling period (Augusts of 2007–2016) were distributed in the southern-middle to middle zones of the Australian rainfed croplands. Our results provide new opportunities for large-scale cropland heat and drought stress detection under a future warmer and drier climate and can also support remote analyses of crop photosynthetic activity over large spatial scales. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural remote sensing; Australian rainfed croplands; Enhanced vegetation index; Light-use efficiency; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence","Chlorophyll; Cost effectiveness; Cultivation; Efficiency; Fluorescence; Geographical regions; Land surface temperature; Photosynthesis; Remote sensing; Satellites; Thermal stress; Vegetation; Agricultural remote sensing; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Enhanced vegetation index; Light use efficiency; Rainfed; Crops; agricultural land; drought stress; fluorescence; growing season; light use efficiency; NDVI; photosynthetically active radiation; rainfed agriculture; remote sensing; satellite data; seasonal variation; spatial analysis; spectral reflectance; Australia",Article,Scopus

This study aims to investigate the potential use of suspended sediment concentration (SSC), water quality and remote sensing data to calibrate and validate a large-scale sediment model. Observed data from across 108 stations located in the Doce River basin was used for the period between 1997-2010. Ten calibration and validation experiments using the MOCOM-UA optimization algorithm coupled with the MGB-SED model were carried out, which, over the same period of time, resulted in 37 calibration and 111 validation tests. The experiments were performed by modifying metrics, spatial discretization, observed data and parameters of the MOCOM-UA algorithm. Results generally demonstrated that the values of correlation presented slight variations and were superior in the calibration step. Additionally, increasing spatial discretization or establishing a background concentration for the model allowed for improved results. In a station with high quantity of SSC data, calibration improved the ENS coefficient from-0.44 to 0.44.

The final model accounts for ~70% of the variation in winter wheat yield and can be used to forecast yields 1 mo before harvest. Spatially, it performs best in the northern and central portions of the Oklahoma winter wheat belt. Model performance is similar regardless of which moisture index is used. The correctly predicted yield variations in at least 9 of the 14 counties every year, and in the best case it correctly predicted yield variation in all counties.

The performances of the crop model for two different assimilation methods were compared by employing particle filters (PF) and the proper orthogonal decomposition-based ensemble four-dimensional variational (POD4DVar) strategies. The uncertainties of wheat yield estimates due to different assimilation temporal scales (phenological stages and temporal frequencies) and spatial scale were also analyzed. The results showed that, compared with the crop model without assimilation and with PF-based assimilation, a better yield estimate performance resulted when the POD4DVar-based strategy was used at the field scale. When using this strategy, root mean square errors (RMSE) of 523 kg·ha-1, 543 kg·ha-1 and 172 kg·ha-1 and relative errors (RE) of 5.65%, 5.91% and 7.77% were obtained at the field plot scale, a pixel scale of 1 km and the county scale, respectively. Although the best yield estimates were obtained when all of the observed LAIs were assimilated into the crop model, an acceptable estimate of crop yield could also be achieved by assimilating fewer observations between jointing and anthesis periods of the crop growth season. With decreasing assimilation frequency and pixel resolution, the accuracy of the crop yield estimates decreased; however, the computation time decreased. Thus, it is important to consider reasonable spatio-temporal scales to obtain tradeoffs between accuracy and effectiveness in regional wheat estimates. © 2017 by the authors.","Assimilation; Crop model; Four-dimensional variational; Leaf area index; Particle filter; Spatio-temporal; Uncertainties","Agriculture; Distributed computer systems; Mean square error; Monte Carlo methods; Pixels; Principal component analysis; Target tracking; Uncertainty analysis; Assimilation; Crop model; Four dimensional variational; Leaf Area Index; Particle filter; Spatio temporal; Uncertainties; Crops",Article,Scopus

The applied methodology consists of elaborating a custom‐developed analytical framework based on a dataset containing 22 relevant indicators, considering four main dimensions that describe the intricacies of the EU agricultural and rural environment, in the CAP context: rural, emissions, macroeconomic, and financial. The results highlight that an increase of the agricultural research and development funding, as well as the agriculture employment rate, negatively influence the degree of rural pov-erty. The rural GDP per capita is influenced by the size of the employment rate in agriculture. It seems that environmental sustainability, identified by both fertilizers used and emissions from agriculture parameters, significantly influences the GDP per capita. In predicting emissions in agriculture, the direct payment, degree of rural poverty, fertilizer use, employment in agriculture, and agriculture labor productivity are the main independent parameters with the highest future importance. It was found that when predicting direct payments, the rural employment rate, employment in agriculture, and gross value added must be considered the most. The agricultural, entrepreneurial income prediction is mainly influenced by the total factor productivity, while agricultural research and development investments depend on gross value added, direct pay-ments, and gross value added in the agricultural sector. Future research, related to prediction models based on CAP indicators, should also consider the marketing dimension. It is recommended for direct payments to be used to invest in upgrading the fertilizers technologies, since environmental sustainability will influence economic growth. © 2021 by the authors.

Among these impacts, mass loads with a high concentration of phosphorus (P) have a significant potential for point and diffuse pollution of freshwater. The objective of this work was to model P spatially in the Paraopeba River basin, namely in the main water course and 67 sub-basins, and temporally in the years of 2019, 2020, and 2021, after the rupture of B1 tailings dam of Vale, SA company in Brumadinho (Minas Gerais Brazil). The distribution of total phosphorus concentrations (Pt) in relation to environmental attributes (terrain slope, soil class, and land use) and stream flow was assessed with the help of SWAT, the well-known Soil and Water Assessment Tool, coupled with box-plot and cluster analyses. The Pt were obtained from 33 sampling points monitored on a weekly basis. Mean values varied from 0.02 to 1.1 mg/L and maximum from 0.2 to 15.9 mg/L across the basin. The modeling results exposed an impact on the quality of Paraopeba River water in a stretch extending 8.8–155.3 km from the B1 dam, related with the rupture. In this sector, if the contribution from the rupture could be isolated from the other sources, the average Pt would be 0.1 mg/L. The highest Pt (15.9 mg/L) was directly proportional to the urban area of a sub-basin intersecting the limits of Betim town and Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Region. In general, urban sprawl as well as forest-agriculture and forest-mining conversions showed a close relationship with increased Pt, as did sub-basins with a predominance of argisols and an accentuated slope (>20%). There were various moments presenting Pt above legal thresholds (e.g., >0.15 mg/L), mainly in the rainy season. © 2022 by the authors.

We evaluate the performance of a deep learning algorithm in predicting soil VWC using various combinations of the received signal strength (RSSI) from each buried wireless node, aboveground pathloss, the distance between wireless node and receive antenna (D), ST, air temperature (AT), relative humidity (RH), and precipitation as input parameters to the model. The AT, RH, and precipitation were obtained from a nearby weather station.

While substantial progress has been made since the early days of climate modeling, many challenges remain. A problem common to most coupled ocean-Atmosphere general circulation models (GCMs) is the cold sea surface temperature (SST) bias in the tropics. Despite this cold SST bias GCMs tend to produce too much precipitation over the tropical oceans, particularly south of the equator. Due to the close link between convection and surface winds, the precipitation biases in GCMs are also accompanied by surface wind biases. Particularly on the equator this strongly affects the simulated ocean currents and vertical temperature stratification. Precipitation biases over land surfaces likely contribute to biases over the equatorial oceans through their influence on the Walker circulation. This influence is particularly strong for the Atlantic basin, where GCMs typically overpredict precipitation over tropical South America and underpredict it over tropical Africa. Despite cold SST biases over much of the tropical oceans, warm SST biases dominate in the southeastern tropical Pacific and Atlantic. These warm biases appear to be due to a combination of surface wind biases (both on the equator and locally), excessive shortwave solar radiation due to insufficient low-level cloud, and weak oceanic stratification reducing the cooling effect of upwelling.

Different methods have been used to forecast yield with different levels of granularity, accuracy and timing. This chapter presents a critical review of the current seasonal crop yield forecasting methods found in the scientific literature. Extensive research has been conducted on crop yield forecast, particularly for wheat, maize, rice, barley, and soybean. Yield forecast are mainly based on field surveys, statistical regressions between historical yield and in-season variables (agrometeorological, or remotely sensed data), crop simulation models, or on integration between statistical modeling with dynamic process-based crop simulation models. A low number of studies rely on field surveys as a means to forecast yield, but they remain the main methods of yield forecast and estimation in several countries (i.e., USA). This chapter aims to report results found in peer-review journals for different crops, methods, geographies, and accuracies, and to end with a critical perspective on the advantage and disadvantage of the different methods currently employed by researchers and stakeholders. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Agrometeorological models; Barley; Crop models; Crop yield forecasting; In-season predictions; Maize; Remote sensing; Rice; Soybean; Wheat",,Book Chapter,Scopus

The increasing amount and variety of data captured and obtained by these emerging technologies in IoT offer the rice smart farming strategy new abilities to predict changes and identify opportunities. The quality of data collected from sensors greatly influences the performance of the modelling processes using ML algorithms. These three elements (e.g., BD, ML and IoT) have been used tremendously to improve all areas of rice production processes in agriculture, which transform traditional rice farming practices into a new era of rice smart farming or rice precision agriculture. In this paper, we perform a survey of the latest research on intelligent data processing technology applied in agriculture, particularly in rice production. We describe the data captured and elaborate role of machine learning algorithms in paddy rice smart agriculture, by analyzing the applications of machine learning in various scenarios, smart irrigation for paddy rice, predicting paddy rice yield estimation, monitoring paddy rice growth, monitoring paddy rice disease, assessing quality of paddy rice and paddy rice sample classification. This paper also presents a framework that maps the activities defined in rice smart farming, data used in data modelling and machine learning algorithms used for each activity defined in the production and post-production phases of paddy rice. Based on the proposed mapping framework, our conclusion is that an efficient and effective integration of all these three technologies is very crucial that transform traditional rice cultivation practices into a new perspective of intelligence in rice precision agriculture.

Meeting increasing demand for meat and other dairy products in a sustainable manner is a big challenge. At a field scale, Global Positioning System and groundbased sensor technologies provide promising tools for grassland and herd management with high precision. With the growth in availability of spaceborne remote sensing data, it is therefore important to revisit the relevant methods and applications that can exploit this imagery. In this article, we have reviewed the (i) current status of grassland monitoring/observation methods and applications based on satellite remote sensing data, (ii) the technological and methodological developments to retrieve different grassland biophysical parameters and management characteristics (i.e. degradation, grazing intensity) and (iii) identified the key remaining challenges and some new upcoming trends for future development. Important Findings The retrieval of grassland biophysical parameters have evolved in recent years from classical regression analysis to more complex, efficient and robust modeling approaches, driven by satellite data, and are likely to continue to be the most robust method for deriving grassland information, however these require more high quality calibration and validation data. We found that the hypertemporal satellite data are widely used for time series generation, and particularly to overcome cloud contamination issues, but the current low spatial resolution of these instruments precludes their use for field-scale application in many countries. This trend may change with the current rise in launch of satellite constellations, such as RapidEye, Sentinel-2 and even the microsatellites such as those operated by Skybox Imaging. Microwave imagery has not been widely used for grassland applications, and a better understanding of the backscatter behaviour from different phenological stages is needed for more reliable products in cloudy regions. The development of hyperspectral satellite instrumentation and analytical methods will help for more detailed discrimination of habitat types, and the development of tools for greater end-user operation.","Agricultural grassland; Grassland biomass; Grazing intensity; Pasture management; Remote sensing",,Article,Scopus

However, due to the variability of the reflectance data obtained from different active crop sensors and complexity of the environmental and management conditions for regional applications, accurate determination of crop N status and topdressing N rate only using active canopy sensor data is very challenging. The objectives of this study were to (1) develop an in-season N status diagnosis and recommendation model based on NNI prediction using multi-source data fusion with machine learning, and (2) evaluate the accuracy of N diagnosis and recommendation in terms of rice yield and NUE under diverse on-farm conditions. Thirty plot experiments and thirteen on-farm experiments were conducted in Qixing Farm, Jiansanjiang, Northeast China from 2008 to 2018, and the dataset was used for the model calibration, validation, and evaluation. Two indirect and one direct NNI prediction methods using simple regression, stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) and random forest regression (RFR) were compared for N diagnosis and then integrated into N recommendation model. The results indicated that combining environmental and agronomic variables with crop sensor data improved the SMLR and RFR model performance by 1–16% and 9–40% over the corresponding models only using crop sensor data, respectively. The direct NNI prediction approach achieved slightly better N status diagnostic accuracy (areal agreement = 84% and Kappa statistics = 0.71) than indirect NNI prediction strategies based on plant N uptake and ΔN estimation (areal agreement = 81% and Kappa statistics = 0.67) or aboveground biomass and plant N uptake estimation (areal agreement = 77% and Kappa statistics = 0.58) across plot experiments and diverse on-farm conditions, based on multi-source data fusion with random forest regression models. About 82% of recommended N rates by the developed integrated in-season rice N diagnosis and recommendation model were within ±10 kg ha−1 of the measured economic optimum N rate across different varieties, environmental conditions and transplanting densities. Precision rice management based on in-season N diagnosis and recommendation decreased N rates and increased N partial factor productivity (PFPN) by 23% over regional optimum rice management, and significantly increased yield (7–11%) and PFPN (33–77%) over farmer's management.

The development of salt-tolerant genotypes is critical for mitigating yield losses, and this journey begins with the identification of sensitive and tolerant plants. Numerous physiologic and molecular markers for detecting salt-tolerant wheat genotypes have been developed. One of them is proline, which has been used for a long time but has received little information about proline-related genes in wheat genotypes. In this study, proline content and the expression levels of proline-related genes (TaPTF1, TaDHN, TaSRG, TaSC, TaPIMP1, TaMIP, TaHKT1;4, TaGSK, TaP5CS, and TaMYB) were examined in sensitive, moderate, and tolerant genotypes under salt stress (0, 50, 150, and 250 mM NaCl) for 0, 12, and 24 h. Our results show that salt stress increased the proline content in all genotypes, but it was found higher in salt-tolerant genotypes than in moderate and sensitive genotypes. The salinity stress increased gene expression levels in salt-tolerant and moderate genotypes. While salt-stress exposure for 12 and 24 h had a substantial effect on gene expression in wheat, TaPTF1, TaPIMP1, TaMIP, TaHKT1;4, and TaMYB genes were considerably upregulated in 24 h. The salt-tolerant genotypes showed a higher positive interaction than a negative interaction. The TaPTF1, TaP5CS, TaGSK1, and TaSRG genes were found to be more selective than the other analyzed genes under salt-stress conditions. Despite each gene’s specific function, increasing proline biosynthesis functioned as a common mechanism for separating salt tolerance from sensitivity. © 2022 by the authors.","correlation network analysis; gene expression; proline-related genes; qRT-PCR; salt stress",,Article,Scopus

With the increasing demand for food and forage, intensive agricultural practices have been adopted in the maize production systems. In this direction, considerable research efforts have been made to examine the effects of different types of cover crops as a green manure on maize productivity; however, no consistent conclusions have been reached so far. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to examine the possibility of predicting the effects of winter cover crops (CC) integrated with different management practices on the morphological traits, yield, and yield components of maize. The experiment was carried out on chernozem soil from 2016 to 2020 as a randomized complete block design arranged as a split-split-plot with three replicates. The pea as a sole crop (P) and the mixture of pea and triticale (PT) are sown as winter CC with the following subplots: (i) CC used as green manure, and (ii) CC used as forage and removed before maize sowing. The artificial neural network is used for exploring nonlinear functions of the tested parameters and 13 categorical input variables for modeling according to the following factors: CC, way of using CC, N fertilization, and year. The computed maximums of plant height, number of leaves, number of internodes, plant density, number of ears, grain yield, 1000-grain weight, hectolitre weight, dry matter harvest residue, harvest index, leaves percentage, stems percentage, and ears percentage are as follows: 232.3 cm; 9.7; 10.2; 54,340 plants ha−1; 0.9; 9.8 t ha−1; 272.4 g; 67.0 kg HL−1; 9.2 t ha−1; 0.52; 18.9%; 36.0%, and 45.1%, respectively. The optimal result is obtained with peas used as green manure, with 50 kg N ha−1 and in the climatic conditions of 2018. Consequently, maize production under subsequent sowing periods can be successfully optimized by adapting selected management options for higher yield accomplishment. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial neural network; cover crops; crop performance; green manure; maize; yield",,Article,Scopus

This study examines the influence of urbanization on the FWLE nexus. Toward this end, land was deemed as an entry point. Therefore, the impact of urbanization on the nexus was explored based on changes in land use. We selected Shenzhen, a city in China, as the study area. First, a land change modeler was employed to analyze historical land-use changes from 2000 to 2010, to build transition potential submodels, and to project future land-use patterns for 2030 under a business-as-usual scenario. Second, based on land-use maps, we assessed habitat quality, water yield, and water supply from 2000 to 2030 using Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs. Moreover, crop production was estimated according to statistical materials. Finally, the study presents the analyses and discussion of the impacts of urbanization on ecosystem services related to the FWLE nexus. The results of land-use changes indicated that a significant expansion of artificial surfaces occurred in Shenzhen with varying degrees of decrease in cultivated land, forest, and grassland. Furthermore, habitat quality, water supply, and crop production decreased evidently due to rapid urbanization. In contrast, the total water yield indicated an upward trend owing to the increased water yield from increasing artificial surfaces, whereas water yield from other land-use areas declined, such as the forest and grassland. The results demonstrated a significant positive correlation between artificial surfaces and total water yield. However, negative correlations were observed in the interaction among habitat quality, water supply, and crop production. The study presented temporal and spatial assessments to provide an effective and convenient means of exploring the interactions and tradeoffs within the FWLE nexus, which, thus, contributed to the sustainable transformation of urbanization. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem services; Food–water–land–ecosystem nexus; InVEST; Land-use changes; Urbanization","Commerce; Crops; Cultivation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Land use; Artificial surfaces; Crop production; Ecosystem services; Food–water–land–ecosystem nexus; Forest and grassland; Habitat quality; InVEST; Landuse change; Urbanization; Water yield; Water supply; ecosystem service; land use change; trade-off; urban development; urban planning; urbanization; Article; China; crop production; cultivated land; ecosystem; ecosystem monitoring; environmental impact; environmental planning; food; forest; geographic distribution; grassland; habitat quality; land use; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; urbanization; water supply; China; ecosystem; environmental protection; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen; water; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Urbanization; Water",Article,Scopus

The effective monitoring of EWT in wheat under different nitrogen and water treatments is important for irrigation management in precision agriculture. This study aimed to investigate the performances of machine learning (ML) algorithms in retrieving wheat EWT. For this purpose, a rain shelter experiment (Exp. 1) with four irrigation quantities (0, 120, 240, 360 mm) and two nitrogen levels (75 and 255 kg N/ha), and field experiments (Exps. 2–3) with the same irrigation and rainfall water levels (360 mm) but different nitrogen levels (varying from 75 to 255 kg N/ha) were conducted in the North China Plain. The canopy reflectance was measured for all plots at 30 m using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted multispectral camera. Destructive sampling was conducted immediately after the UAV flights to measure total fresh and dry weight. Deep Neural Network (DNN) is a special type of neural network, which has shown performance in regression analysis is compared with other machine learning (ML) models. A feature selection (FS) algorithm named the decision tree (DT) was used as the automatic relevance determination method to obtain the relative relevance of 5 out of 67 vegetation indices (Vis), which were used for estimating EWT. The selected VIs were used to estimate EWT using multiple linear regression (MLR), deep neural network multilayer perceptron (DNN-MLP), artificial neural networks multilayer perceptron (ANN-MLP), boosted tree regression (BRT), and support vector machines (SVMs). The results show that the DNN-MLP with R2 = 0.934, NSE = 0.933, RMSE = 0.028 g/cm2, and MAE of 0.017 g/cm2 outperformed other ML algorithms (ANN-MPL, BRT, and SVM-Polynomial) owing to its high capacity for estimating EWT as compared to other ML methods. Our findings support the conclusion that ML can potentially be applied in combination with VIs for retrieving EWT. Despite the complexity of the ML models, the EWT map should help farmers by improving the real-time irrigation efficiency of wheat by quantifying field water content and addressing variability. © 2021 by the authors.

While improved estimates of cover crop N benefits could help promote their adoption, little information is currently available at the broad scale. We conducted a multi-site study to determine whether use of satellite images and site factors could fill this gap. Six spectral indices were extracted from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and used with modeling covariates to estimate cover crop properties and biomass N credits (biomass × N contents). The partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were calibrated and validated with samples from 42 cover crop fields located in the midwestern and northeastern United States collected in 2017–2018. Remote sensing (RS)-derived spectral indices strongly correlated (r &gt;.7) with red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) but not with rye (Secale cereale L.) biomass. Growing degree days (GDDs), cover height, ground cover percentage, and temperature often had high importance (variable importance in projection &gt;1) in PLSR models. Model predictive power was limited for estimates of biomass N credits when data from all validation sites and cover types were used (adjusted [adj] R2 =.52). However, models for both biomass (adj R2 =.81) and biomass N credits (adj R2 =.89) were successful for red clover fields. This suggests N benefits could be more effectively modeled for specific cover crop types. We also found RS-based estimation of C/N ratios performed moderately well when applied to the complete dataset (adj R2 =.54), suggesting a way to differentiate grass and legume cover crops that can potentially inform biogeochemical models. © 2020 The Authors.

As an alternative to the susceptible-infected-resistant (SIR)-based models, this study proposes a hybrid machine learning approach to predict the COVID-19, and we exemplify its potential using data from Hungary. The hybrid machine learning methods of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multi-layered perceptron-imperialist competitive algorithm (MLP-ICA) are proposed to predict time series of infected individuals and mortality rate. The models predict that by late May, the outbreak and the total morality will drop substantially. The validation is performed for 9 days with promising results, which confirms the model accuracy.

Best management practices implemented to improve water quality have met with limited success. Such lack of success is increasingly attributed to legacy nutrient stores in the subsurface that may act as sources after reduction of external inputs. However, current water-quality models lack a framework to capture these legacy effects. Here we have modified the SWAT (Soil Water Assessment Tool) model to capture the effects of nitrogen (N) legacies on water quality under multiple land-management scenarios. Our new SWAT-LAG model includes (1) a modified carbon-nitrogen cycling module to capture the dynamics of soil N accumulation, and (2) a groundwater travel time distribution module to capture a range of subsurface travel times. Using a 502-km2 Iowa watershed as a case study, we found that between 1950 and 2016, 25% of the total watershed N surplus (N Deposition + Fertilizer + Manure + N Fixation − Crop N uptake) had accumulated within the root zone, 14% had accumulated in groundwater, while 27% was lost as riverine output, and 34% was denitrified. In future scenarios, a 100% reduction in fertilizer application led to a 79% reduction in stream N load, but the SWAT-LAG results suggest that it would take 84 years to achieve this reduction, in contrast to the 2 years predicted in the original SWAT model. The framework proposed here constitutes a first step toward modifying a widely used modeling approach to assess the effects of legacy N on the time required to achieve water-quality goals. ©2019.

Many parameters and input variables, required by crop models but usually poorly known, can be supplied through the remote sensing technique. In the past decades, integration of remote sensing data and CSMs has gained increasing attention in both scientific communities and agricultural practice. This chapter starts with a general introduction of the procedure to assimilate remote sensing data into CSMs, followed by a brief description of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) model (Hoogenboom et al., 1999, 2004). Several assimilation methods of various degrees of complexity and integration are described, including the direct input, sequential, and variational assimilation techniques. Remote sensing data in solar, microwave, and thermal domains are presented for their capabilities in assimilating with crop growth models. Regional application examples are presented to illustrate the procedure of sensitivity study, cost function construction, crop yield estimation, and the hydrological simulation process.

The influence of species diversity and sensor specifications on the performances of various classification approaches are discussed. Based on the limitations of previous approaches, we propose a novel framework to map mangrove species at medium, high, and very-high spatial resolution using multispectral and hyperspectral images. The framework relies on a multitask convolutional neural network to achieve accurate classification at pixel and object (i.e. individual tree crown) level. It was successfully applied to the most comprehensive dataset of optical imagery ever collected over a mangrove forest, achieving accurate mapping of species on airborne (OA = 95 %, Kappa = 0.93) and spaceborne imagery (OA and Kappa up to 97 % and 0.95, respectively), including the newly-operating hyperspectral DESIS and PRISMA instruments. This study brings new insights into the role of spatial and spectral resolutions in mangrove species classification, particularly the importance of short-wave infrared bands. Multispectral imagery performs well at very-high to high resolutions (up to 10–20 m) but suffers from the lack of spectral information at medium resolution (30 m). Hyperspectral imagery provided the best results at sub-metric resolution (0.5 m) and satisfactory results at 30-m resolution (OA ≥ 85), and could benefit from implementing spectral unmixing in the latter case. Given the increasing attention accorded to mangroves, remote sensing will undoubtedly become an essential tool to monitor the diversity of these endangered ecosystems in the future. In that respect, efforts should concentrate on evaluating the capabilities of new and upcoming instruments and multisource data combination to improve mangrove species mapping and, more broadly, to meet conservation goals. © 2022 The Author(s)","Deep learning; Mangrove forest; Object-oriented classification; Optical imagery; Pixel-oriented classification; Species mapping","Conservation; Deep learning; Ecosystems; Forestry; Infrared radiation; Optical remote sensing; Pixels; Vegetation mapping; Deep learning; Mangrove forest; Mangrove species; Multispectral imagery; Object oriented classification; Optical imagery; Pixel-oriented; Pixel-oriented classification; Space-borne; Species mapping; Image classification; conservation status; mangrove; mapping method; pixel; satellite imagery; species diversity",Article,Scopus

Accurately estimating phenotyping traits of breeding maize at plot scale helps to promote gene mining for specific traits and provides a guarantee for accelerating the breeding of superior varieties. Constructing an efficient and accurate estimation model is the key to the application of UAV-based multiple sensors data. This study aims to apply the ensemble learning model to improve the feasibility and accuracy of estimating maize phenotypic traits using UAV-based red-green-blue (RGB) and multispectral sensors. The UAV images of four growth stages were obtained, respectively. The reflectance of visible light bands, canopy coverage, plant height (PH), and texture information were extracted from RGB images, and the vegetation indices were calculated from multispectral images. We compared and analyzed the estimation accuracy of single-type feature and multiple features for LAI (leaf area index), fresh weight (FW), and dry weight (DW) of maize. The basic models included ridge regression (RR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Gaussian process (GP), and K-neighbor network (K-NN). The ensemble learning models included stacking and Bayesian model averaging (BMA). The results showed that the ensemble learning model improved the accuracy and stability of maize phenotypic traits estimation. Among the features extracted from UAV RGB images, the highest accuracy was obtained by the combination of spectrum, structure, and texture features. The model had the best accuracy constructed using all features of two sensors. The estimation accuracies of ensemble learning models, including stacking and BMA, were higher than those of the basic models. The coefficient of determination (R2) of the optimal validation results were 0.852, 0.888, and 0.929 for LAI, FW, and DW, respectively. Therefore, the combination of UAV-based multisource data and ensemble learning model could accurately estimate phenotyping traits of breeding maize at plot scale.

Agricultural products will be in high demand by 2050 due to a 30% increase in the global population, so there is a need to devise new mechanisms for agriculture, and smart agriculture is one of those mechanisms; however, smart agriculture needs to be explored further to realize its potential fully. So, to explore the potential of this field, the researchers have used a corpus that is extracted from the Scopus database from the year 2008 to the year 2022 and applied the LDA technique. A corpus of 4309 articles was selected from the Scopus database to apply the latent Dirichlet analysis (LDA) model to predict research areas for smart agriculture. Using IoT technology, farmers and producers may better manage their resources, such as fertilizer consumption and the number of trips made by farm vehicles, while minimizing waste and maximizing productivity, including water, electricity, and other inputs. This data-driven experimental study identifies smart agriculture research trends by implementing a topic modeling technique previously used in smart agriculture.

Methods: This study developed a new method for differentiating maize from other summer crops based on the revised time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) method, a phenology-based classification method, by combining the phenological information of multiple spectral bands and indexes instead of one single index. First, we compared the phenological characteristics of four main summer crops in Henan Province of China in terms of multiple spectral bands and indexes. The key phenological periods of each band and index were determined by comparing the identification accuracy based on the county-level statistical areas of maize. Second, we improved the TWDTW distance calculation for multiple bands and indexes by summing the rank maps of a single band or index. Third, we evaluated the performance of a multi-band and multi-period TWDTW method using Sentinel-2 time series of all spectral bands and some synthetic indexes for maize classification in Henan Province. Results and Discussion: The results showed that the combination of red edge (740.2 nm) and short-wave infrared (2202.4 nm) outperformed all others and its overall accuracy of maize planting area was about 91.77% based on 2431 field samples. At the county level, the planting area of maize matched the statistical area closely. The results of this study demonstrate that the revised TWDTW makes effective use of crop phenological information and improves the extraction accuracy of summer crops’ planting areas over a large scale. Additionally, multiple band combinations are more effective for summer crops mapping than a single band or index input.

Landslide susceptibility mapping is an essential tool for predicting and mitigating landslides. This study aimed to investigate the application of deep learning algorithms based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with metaheuristic optimization algorithms, namely the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) and imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), to landslide susceptibility mapping. The study area was Icheon City, South Korea, for which an accurate landslide inventory dataset was available. The landslide inventory map was prepared and randomly divided into datasets of 70% for training and 30% for validation. Additionally, 18 landslide-related factors, including geo-environmental and topo-hydrological factors, were considered as predictive variables. The models were compared using area under the curve (AUC) values in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The validation results showed that optimized models based on CNN-GWO (AUC = 0.876, RMSE = 0.08) and CNN-ICA (AUC = 0.852, RMSE = 0.09) outperformed the standalone CNN model (AUC = 0.847, RMSE = 0.12).

Herein we calibrated and applied the CMRSET (CSIRO MODIS Reflectance-based Scaling EvapoTranspiration) model at the continental scale in Australia using five remotely sensed data products with spatial resolutions ranging from 500 m (MODIS, VIIRS), 30 m (Landsat) to 20 m (Sentinel-2), and temporal frequencies ranging from daily (MODIS, VIIRS) to multi-days (Landsat and Sentinel-2). The five remotely sensed data products were used to compute a crop factor (kc) based on two vegetation indices which modify Priestley-Taylor potential evapotranspiration estimates (ETp; calculated from nation-wide daily meteorological grids) to obtain ETa. CMRSET was calibrated using daily latent heat observations from 30 eddy covariance flux towers located across Australia, representing a wide variety of land covers and climates. To ensure that CMRSET adequately estimated open water evaporation, daily ETp estimates at six water sites were also added in the calibration network. The calibrated CMRSET model was able to estimate daily ETa observed at the flux towers with a relative Root Mean Squared Error (rRMSE)/coefficient of determination (R2) ranging between 0.15/0.96 (with Sentinel-2) to 0.26/0.93 (VIIRS). Additionally, we independently evaluated the performance of CMRSET by comparing the long-term (5 years or more) differences between mean annual precipitation and ETa with measured streamflow at 638 unimpaired catchments across Australia. The comparison showed a RMSE of 0.50 mm·d-1 (rRMSE of 0.26) and a R2 of 0.70. The CMRSET model performed better than or similarly when compared against two global ETa products based on MODIS optical and thermal data. Extending the suite of remotely sensed data products that CMRSET is calibrated with and using a network of sites located across vast climate and geographic ranges, means that CMRSET can now be used to estimate ETa at continental scales with multiple spatial resolutions and temporal frequencies. Compared to other available ETa products, CMRSET is more straightforward to operationalise, requires less data inputs, can capture ETa dynamics in areas with significant direct evaporation such as floodplains and lakes and does not require manual calibration to detect wet and dry pixels. © 2021","Eddy Covariance; Evapotranspiration; Google Earth Engine; Landsat; MODIS; Remote Sensing; Sentinel-2; VIIRS","Catchments; Evapotranspiration; Mean square error; Meteorology; Remote sensing; Australia; Eddy covariance; Evapotranspiration models; Google earth engine; Google earths; LANDSAT; Remote-sensing; Scalings; Sentinel-2; VIIRS; Radiometers; algorithm; calibration; error analysis; evapotranspiration; Landsat; MODIS; observational method; remote sensing; satellite data; Sentinel; spatial resolution; VIIRS; Australia",Article,Scopus

However, to manage the ever-increasing volumes of raw data successfully, new approaches must be explored. Under this scope, current work reports on the design and development of an IoT system, having in mind the case of olive groves, which are considered the dominant sector for agricultural activity in the Mediterranean Basin. The system incorporates the cloud/fog computing paradigm to equip the olive growers with a low-cost solution for accurate, reliable, and almost real-time monitoring of their crops. Its core is based on a three-layered network architecture, capable of dynamically balancing the generated load, by pushing cloud-elastic resources to the underlying fog network. As such, the premise of the approach lies in the conforming character of the system that allows for targeted alterations to its operational functionality to meet stringent latency and traffic load environmental monitoring constraints. To evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture, a demo prototype is developed and deployed in the facilities of the Ionian University. Experimental results illustrate the efficiency, flexibility, and scalability of the approach in terms of latency, achieving response time reduction across all platforms, a subject of the utmost importance when it comes to precision agriculture of the future. Moreover, it is shown that the system is capable of dynamic functionality adaptation, to meet network traffic load constraints, achieving high throughput (on average 95%) and addressing potential environmental dangers to olive oil production. © 2020 by the authors.

Abstract: The breeder’s equation is the foundational application of quantitative genetics to crop improvement. Guided by the variables that describe response to selection, emerging breeding technologies can make a powerful step change in the effectiveness of public breeding programs. The most promising innovations for increasing the rate of genetic gain without greatly increasing program size appear to be related to reducing breeding cycle time, which is likely to require the implementation of parent selection on non-inbred progeny, rapid generation advance, and genomic selection. These are complex processes and will require breeding organizations to adopt a culture of continuous optimization and improvement. To enable this, research managers will need to consider and proactively manage the, accountability, strategy, and resource allocations of breeding teams. This must be combined with thoughtful management of elite genetic variation and a clear separation between the parental selection process and product development and advancement process. With an abundance of new technologies available, breeding teams need to evaluate carefully the impact of any new technology on selection intensity, selection accuracy, and breeding cycle length relative to its cost of deployment.

This study reported a comprehensive global sensitivity analysis for DRAINMOD-FOREST, an integrated model for simulating water, carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) cycles and plant growth in lowland forests. The analysis was carried out for multiple long-term model predictions of hydrology, biogeochemistry, and plant growth. Results showed that long-term mean hydrological predictions were highly sensitive to several key plant physiological parameters. Long-term mean annual soil organic C content and mineralization rate were mainly controlled by temperature-related parameters for soil organic matter decomposition. Mean annual forest productivity and N uptake were found to be mainly dependent upon plant production-related parameters, including canopy quantum use efficiency and carbon use efficiency.

Parameters controlling forest production, C allocation, and specific leaf area highly affected long-term mean annual leaf area.

The information about current and future yield, termed a yield assessment in this paper, is an essential decision-making element for the grape and wine industry. Crop management, wine-making, commercial, accounting and strategic operations are all adapted to and all impact on the expected yield of the current vintage. Numerous yield assessment approaches have been proposed in the scientific literature. However, only a few of them have considered their adaptation to the operational context under the constraints, needs and strategies of commercial vineyards and wineries. The few studies that have worked on the operational implementation of yield assessment methods have only partially addressed this issue, concentrating their improvement efforts on a single step in the yield assessment process. This paper first proposes to review the characteristics of yield development in an operational context that must be taken into account by yield assessment methodsThese characteristics are consolidated into three main challenges for yield assessment methods: (i) addressing the complex temporality of yield development, (ii) ensuring a local monitoring of yield development and (iii) fitting to the operational needs and constraints to allow for relevant decision support systems in the field. The approaches of yield estimation, prediction and forecast are discussed in the context of these challenges. In a second step, the paper proposes a generic framework for the yield assessment process, including a review of the variables that are used to explain grapevine yield. Issues and proposals from the literature associated respectively with measurement, sampling and yield modelling are reviewed and the need for improved modelling of relationships between explanatory variables and the desired, reported yield variable is discussed. The yield assessment methods found in the literature are categorised and compared according to measurement, estimation and modelling approaches, and then according to the three challenges identified for yield assessment in operational conditions, such that the yield assessment method is adapted to commercial needs and not to research objectives. In conclusion, concrete proposals for new grape yield assessment methods are discussed in order to investigate the as yet unexplored opportunities for the improvement in yield assessment in operational contexts that have been identified in the paper. These considerations could easily be transposed to other perennial crops. © 2021","Climate; Measurement; Operational; Sampling; Uncertainty; Wine; Yield models","agricultural management; assessment method; crop plant; crop yield; decision support system; detection method; forecasting method; vine; viticulture; yield response",Review,Scopus

Canopy structure-and chlorophyll-sensitive VIs derived from Sentinel-2 images were used to estimate the start and end of the growing season (SOS and EOS, respectively) during the period 2016-2018, for an SRC poplar (Populus spp.) plantation in Lochristi (Belgium). Three different filtering methods (Savitzky-Golay (SavGol), polynomial (Polyfit) and Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS) and five SOS-and EOS threshold methods (first derivative function, 10% and 20% percentages and 10% and 20% percentiles) were applied to identify the optimal methods for the determination of phenophases. Our results showed that the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) had the best fit with GPP phenology, as derived from eddy covariance measurements, in identifying SOSand EOS-dates. For SOS, the performance was only slightly better than for several other indices, whereas for EOS, MTCI performed markedly better. The relationship between SOS/EOS derived from GPP and VIs varied interannually. MTCI described best the seasonal pattern of the SRC plantation's GPP (R2 = 0.52 when combining all three years). However, during the extreme dry year 2018, the Chlorophyll Red Edge Index performed slightly better in reproducing growing season GPP variability than MTCI (R2 = 0.59; R2 = 0.49, respectively). Regarding smoothing functions, Polyfit and HANTS methods showed the best (and very similar) performances. We further found that defining SOS as the date at which the 10% or 20% percentile occurred, yielded the best agreement between the VIs and the GPP; while for EOS the dates of the 10% percentile threshold came out as the best. © 2020 by the authors.

However, plant stress may also be profitable since it behaves hormetically; at low doses, it stimulates positive traits in crops, such as the synthesis of specialized metabolites and additional stress tolerance. The controlled exposure of crops to low doses of stressors is therefore called hormesis management, and it is a promising method to increase crop productivity and quality. Nevertheless, hormesis management has severe limitations derived from the complexity of plant physiological responses to stress. Many technological advances assist plant stress science in overcoming such limitations, which results in extensive datasets originating from the multiple layers of the plant defensive response. For that reason, artificial intelligence tools, particularly Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), have become crucial for processing and interpreting data to accurately model plant stress responses such as genomic variation, gene and protein expression, and metabolite biosynthesis. In this review, we discuss the most recent ML and DL applications in plant stress science, focusing on their potential for improving the development of hormesis management protocols. © 2022 by the authors.

Therefore, proper irrigation management is critical in achieving sustainable agriculture by increasing crop yield while conserving water resources. Remote sensing has demonstrated a great promise in monitoring crop status including crop water status based on the spectral vegetation index (VI). Therefore, the vegetation growth (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI), vegetation water status (shortwave crop reflectance index, SCRI), and vegetation drought stress (moisture stress index, MSI) indices were calculated to assess the impact of irrigation management on canopy water status in a cluster of winter wheat fields in a semi-arid area in three non-consecutive growing seasons with different seasonal rainfall amounts and distributions. The winter wheat fields were typically irrigated six times in each growing season according to a fixed phenological-based irrigation scheduling. Results showed that NDVI, SCRI, and MSI had a high correlation with the remotely sensed locally calibrated leaf area index (LAI), among which NDVI had the strongest correlation (r = 0.9). The analysis revealed that the combined use of VIs succeeded in detecting spatial and temporal crop drought stress levels during the growing seasons. Furthermore, the normalized difference water index (NDWI) was interpreted to quantitatively classify the level and extent of drought stress in the winter wheat fields. The results of the NDWI analysis revealed that 62%, 100%, and 72% of the irrigated winter wheat fields have experienced some levels of drought stress during the normal growing season with wet spring, normal growing season with wet autumn, and dry growing season, respectively. The drought stress was basically due to the lack of effective rainfall during spring in March and April when crops have the highest vegetative growth, irrespective of the rainfall amount during autumn and winter. This revealed the importance of timely irrigation management during spring time. In addition, paired anomaly analysis of the NDVI, MSI, and SCRI with the wheat grain yields could identify good and poor wheat fields and recognize proper management zones of the wheat fields in terms of potential grain production. The findings of this study demonstrated that remote sensing is a strong and reliable tool in irrigation management to help sustain food production in arid or semi-arid areas with limited water resources. © 2023 The Authors","Anomaly analysis; Drought stress; Irrigation management; Leaf area index; Spectral vegetation indices; Wheat grain yield","Arid regions; Cultivation; Drought; Grain (agricultural product); Irrigation; Rain; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Water resources; Anomaly analysis; Drought stress; Grain yield; Growing season; Irrigation management; Leaf Area Index; Spectral vegetation indices; Wheat grain yield; Wheat grains; Winter wheat field; Crops",Article,Scopus

Wheat quality is primarily determined by the grain protein content (GPC) and composition, and both of these are affected by nitrogen (N) levels in the plant as it develops during the growing season. Hyperspectral remote sensing is gradually becoming recognized as an economical alternative to traditional destructive field sampling methods and laboratory testing as a means of determining the N status within wheat. Currently, hyperspectral vegetation indices (VIs) and linear nonparametric regression are the primary tools for monitoring the N status of wheat. Machine learning algorithms have been increasingly applied to model the nonlinear relationship between spectral data and wheat N status. This study is a comprehensive review of available N-related hyperspectral VIs and aims to inform the selection of VIs under field conditions. The combination of feature mining and machine learning algorithms is discussed as an application of hyperspectral imaging systems. We discuss the major challenges and future directions for evaluating and assessing wheat N status. Finally, we suggest that the underlying mechanism of protein formation in wheat grains as determined by using hyperspectral imaging systems needs to be further investigated. This overview provides theoretical and technical support to promote applications of hyperspectral imaging systems in wheat N status assessments; in addition, it can be applied to help monitor and evaluate food and nutrition security.

Random forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and (ADB) have been applied for developing pixel and point based models in Python and WEKA software environments respectively.

Based on the accuracy and performance level using area under curve (AUC) of Receiver operating curve, sensitivity, precision, F1 score, MCC, pixel based ensemble models are superior to point based modeling. The point-based models often have an inferior agreement with training and testing data. So, pixel based models could not be replaced with point based models.

Current LAI estimation methods at subfield scale are limited not only by the characteristics of the spatial data (pixel size and spectral information) but also by the empiricity of developed models, mostly based on vegetation indices, which do not necessarily scale spatiality (among different varieties or planting characteristics) or temporally (need for different LAI models for different phenological stages). Widely used machine learning (ML) algorithms and high-resolution small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) information provide an opportunity for spatial and temporal LAI estimation addressing the spatial and temporal limitations. In this study, considering both accuracy and efficiency, a point-cloud-based feature-extraction approach (Full Approach) and a raster-based feature-extraction approach (Fast Approach) using sUAS information were developed based on multiple growing seasons (2014–2019) to extract and generate vine-scale information for LAI estimation in commercial vineyards across California. Three known ML algorithms, Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), were considered, along with hybrid ML schemes based on those three algorithms, coupled with different feature-extraction approaches. Results showed that the hybrid ML technique using RF and RVM and the Fast Approach with 9 input variables, called RVM-RFFast model, performs better than others in a visual and statistical assessments of the generated LAI being also computationally efficient. Furthermore, using the generated LAI products in the quantification of energy balance using the two-source energy balance Priestley-Taylor version (TSEB-PT) model and EC tower data, the results indicated excellent estimation of net radiation (Rn) and latent heat flux (LE), good estimation of surface heat flux (G), and poor estimation of sensible heat flux (H). Additionally, TSEB-PT sensitivity analysis performed by regenerating LAI maps based on the generated LAI map (from − 15% of the original LAI map to + 15% with a 5% gap) showed that LAI uncertainty had a major impact on G, followed by evapotranspiration partitioning (T/ET), H, LE, and Rn.

Using growth-stage information to estimate winter wheat yields in a timely manner is essential for accurate crop management and rapid decision-making in sustainable agriculture, and to increase productivity while reducing environmental impact. UAV remote sensing is widely used in precision agriculture due to its flex-ibility and increased spatial and spectral resolution. Hyperspectral data are used to model crop traits because of their ability to provide continuous rich spectral information and higher spectral fidelity. In this study, hyperspectral image data of the winter wheat crop canopy at the flowering and grain-filling stages was acquired by a low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and machine learning was used to predict winter wheat yields. Specifically, a large number of spectral indices were extracted from the spectral data, and three feature selection methods, recursive feature elimination (RFE), Boruta feature selection, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), were used to filter high spectral indices in order to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Four major basic learner models, (1) support vector machine (SVM), (2) Gaussian process (GP), (3) linear ridge regression (LRR), and (4) random forest (RF), were also constructed, and an ensemble machine learning model was developed by combining the four base learner models. The results showed that the SVM yield prediction model, constructed on the basis of the preferred features, performed the best among the base learner models, with an R2 between 0.62 and 0.73. The accuracy of the proposed ensemble learner model was higher than that of each base learner model; moreover, the R2 (0.78) for the yield prediction model based on Boruta’s preferred characteristics was the highest at the grain-filling stage. © 2022 by the authors.

In recent years, deep learning (DL) methods have been considered in the context of genomic prediction. The DL methods are nonparametric models providing flexibility to adapt to complicated associations between data and output with the ability to adapt to very complex patterns. Main body: We review the applications of deep learning (DL) methods in genomic selection (GS) to obtain a meta-picture of GS performance and highlight how these tools can help solve challenging plant breeding problems. We also provide general guidance for the effective use of DL methods including the fundamentals of DL and the requirements for its appropriate use. We discuss the pros and cons of this technique compared to traditional genomic prediction approaches as well as the current trends in DL applications. Conclusions: The main requirement for using DL is the quality and sufficiently large training data. Although, based on current literature GS in plant and animal breeding we did not find clear superiority of DL in terms of prediction power compared to conventional genome based prediction models. Nevertheless, there are clear evidences that DL algorithms capture nonlinear patterns more efficiently than conventional genome based. Deep learning algorithms are able to integrate data from different sources as is usually needed in GS assisted breeding and it shows the ability for improving prediction accuracy for large plant breeding data. It is important to apply DL to large training-testing data sets. © 2021, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Genomic selection; Genomic trends; Plant breeding","algorithm; deep learning; plant breeding; prediction; review; animal; Bayes theorem; biological model; genetic selection; genome; genomics; phenotype; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Deep Learning; Genome; Genomics; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Selection, Genetic",Review,Scopus

This review considers technological aids assisting these estimates, in terms of: (i) improving sampling strategies by the number of units to be counted and their selection; (ii) machine vision for the direct measurement of fruit number and size on the canopy; (iii) aerial or satellite imagery for the acquisition of information on tree structural parameters and spectral indices, with the indirect assessment of fruit load; (iv) models extrapolating historical yield data with knowledge of tree management and climate parameters, and (v) technologies relevant to the estimation of harvest timing such as heat units and the proximal sensing of fruit maturity attributes. Machine vision is currently dominating research outputs on fruit load estimation, while the improvement of sampling strategies has potential for a widespread impact. Techniques based on tree parameters and modeling offer scalability, but tree crops are complicated (perennialism). The use of machine vision for flowering estimates, fruit sizing, external quality evaluation is also considered. The potential synergies between technologies are highlighted. © 2021 by the authors.

Both are related to surface soil moisture (SSM), which is susceptible to drought, and phenology plays an important role in these vegetation-moisture relationships. Based on a variety of gridded SIF, NDVI, and SSM datasets obtained from satellite sensors, we presented the detailed relationships of SSM with SIF and NDVI in different phenological stages. Results showed that SIF and NDVI were significantly correlated with SSM in different phenological stages, especially during the maturity and senescence stages. For different vegetation types, SIF was more sensitive than NDVI to SSM anomalies in grasslands and forests during the maturity stage and rainfed croplands during the senescence stage. These relationships were regulated by precipitation and mean temperature, and decreased precipitation had the most significant impact when accompanied by increased temperature during the maturity stage or decreased temperature during the senescence stage. Our findings shed light on the role that phenology has in the relationships of SSM with SIF and NDVI on a large scale, which can further improve the understanding of vegetation-moisture relationships. © 2021 The Author(s).","Phenology; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Surface soil moisture; Vegetation index","Chlorophyll; Fluorescence; Machinery; Soil moisture; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Increased temperature; Normalized difference vegetation index; Phenological stage; Photosynthetic characteristics; Photosynthetic machinery; Satellite sensors; Surface soil moisture; Vegetation; chlorophyll; NDVI; phenology; photosynthesis; rainfed agriculture; satellite sensor; senescence; soil moisture; solar radiation; vegetation index; China; Indicator indicator",Article,Scopus

This paper investigates the potential of applying FS and multivariate flood scaling properties [multiple linear regression (MLR)] as constraints in model calibration. Based on the assumption that the scaling property of flood exists in four study catchments in northern China, eight calibration scenarios are designed with adopting different combinations of traditional indicators and FS or MLR as objective functions. The performance of the proposed method is verified by employing a distributed hydrological model, namely, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The results indicate that reasonable performance could be obtained in FS with fewer requirements of observed streamflow data, exhibiting better simulation of flood peaks than the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient calibration scenario. The observed streamflow data or regional flood information are required in the MLR calibration scenario to identify the dominant catchment descriptors, and MLR achieves better performance on catchment interior points, especially for the events with uneven distribution of rainfall. On account of the improved performance on hydrographs and flood frequency curve at the watershed outlet, adopting the statistical indicators and flood scaling property simultaneously as model constraints is suggested. The proposed methodology enhances the physical connection of flood peak among subbasins and considers watershed actual conditions and climatic characteristics for each flood event, facilitating a new calibration approach for both gauged catchments and data-scarce catchments. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.","Flood events; Hydrologic models; Hydrology; Satellite observations; Streamflow; Watersheds","calibration; flooding; hydrological modeling; hydrology; regression analysis; satellite imagery; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; watershed",Article,Scopus

Since eddy covariance flux towers have a relatively small footprint and are distributed unevenly across the world, upscaling the observations is necessary to obtain global-scale estimates of biosphere-atmosphere exchange. Based on cross-consistency checks with atmospheric inversions, sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) and dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), here we provide a systematic assessment of the latest upscaling efforts for gross primary production (GPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the FLUXCOM initiative, where different machine learning methods, forcing data sets and sets of predictor variables were employed.</p> Spatial patterns of mean GPP are consistent across FLUXCOM and DGVM ensembles ( at 1 spatial resolution) while the majority of DGVMs show, for 70 of the land surface, values outside the FLUXCOM range. Global mean GPP magnitudes for 2008-2010 from FLUXCOM members vary within 106 and 130 PgC class with the largest uncertainty in the tropics. Seasonal variations in independent SIF estimates agree better with FLUXCOM GPP (mean global pixel-wise) than with GPP from DGVMs (mean global pixel-wise). Seasonal variations in FLUXCOM NEE show good consistency with atmospheric inversion-based net land carbon fluxes, particularly for temperate and boreal regions. Interannual variability of global NEE in FLUXCOM is underestimated compared to inversions and DGVMs. The FLUXCOM version which also uses meteorological inputs shows a strong co-variation in interannual patterns with inversions (for 2001-2010). Mean regional NEE from FLUXCOM shows larger uptake than inversion and DGVM-based estimates, particularly in the tropics with discrepancies of up to several hundred grammes of carbon per square metre per year. These discrepancies can only partly be reconciled by carbon loss pathways that are implicit in inversions but not captured by the flux tower measurements such as carbon emissions from fires and water bodies. We hypothesize that a combination of systematic biases in the underlying eddy covariance data, in particular in tall tropical forests, and a lack of site history effects on NEE in FLUXCOM are likely responsible for the too strong tropical carbon sink estimated by FLUXCOM. Furthermore, as FLUXCOM does not account for fertilization effects, carbon flux trends are not realistic. Overall, current FLUXCOM estimates of mean annual and seasonal cycles of GPP as well as seasonal NEE variations provide useful constraints of global carbon cycling, while interannual variability patterns from FLUXCOM are valuable but require cautious interpretation. Exploring the diversity of Earth observation data and of machine learning concepts along with improved quality and quantity of flux tower measurements will facilitate further improvements of the FLUXCOM approach overall. © 2020.

The driving mechanisms of drought operate on a wide range of spatial scales, from the movement of soil water on a hillslope to global atmospheric circulation. Additionally, drought impacts vary across spatial scales, from drought induced crop stress on a specific agricultural field to widespread continental water shortages. As a result, multiscalar drought monitoring and early warning systems are needed to utilize observational data sets obtained at different spatial scales and to communicate drought impacts to various levels of decision-makers in government and industry. However, scaling must be employed to translate information across scales, either to fix incongruencies in the spatial scale of input data sets or to modify the model output scale. These scaling techniques have several challenges and limitations that hinder drought accuracy and interpretability, such as the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) and increased model uncertainty. This paper reviews the role of spatial scale in drought monitoring and early warning systems, the associated challenges, and techniques to minimize their impact.

This research has developed deep learning hybrid model (i.e., CNN-LSTM) to factor in role of cloud effects integrating the merits of convolutional neural networks with long short-term memory networks to forecast near real-time (i.e., 5-min) PPFD in a sub-tropical region Queensland, Australia. The prescribed CLSTM model is trained with real-time sky images that depict stochastic cloud movements captured through a total sky imager (TSI-440) utilising advanced sky image segmentation to reveal cloud chromatic features into their statistical values, and to purposely factor in the cloud variation to optimise the CLSTM model. The model, with its competing algorithms (i.e., CNN, LSTM, deep neural network, extreme learning machine and multivariate adaptive regression spline), are trained with 17 distinct cloud cover inputs considering the chromaticity of red, blue, thin, and opaque cloud statistics, supplemented by solar zenith angle (SZA) to predict short-term PPFD. The models developed with cloud inputs yield accurate results, outperforming the SZA-based models while the best testing performance is recorded by the objective method (i.e., CLSTM) tested over a 7-day measurement period. Specifically, CLSTM yields a testing performance with correlation coefficient r = 0.92, root mean square error RMSE = 210.31 μ mol of photons m−2 s−1, mean absolute error MAE = 150.24 μ mol of photons m−2 s−1, including a relative error of RRMSE = 24.92% MAPE = 38.01%, and Nash Sutcliffe’s coefficient ENS = 0.85, and Legate and McCabe’s Index LM = 0.68 using cloud cover in addition to the SZA as an input. The study shows the importance of cloud inclusion in forecasting solar radiation and evaluating the risk with practical implications in monitoring solar energy, greenhouses and high-value agricultural operations affected by stochastic behaviour of clouds. Additional methodological refinements such as retraining the CLSTM model for hourly and seasonal time scales may aid in the promotion of agricultural crop farming and environmental risk evaluation applications such as predicting the solar UV index and direct normal solar irradiance for renewable energy monitoring systems. © 2022, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Photosynthetic photon flux density; Photosynthetic radiation; Risk evaluation; Solar radiation modelling; Stochastic cloud effects","Brain; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Electric power transmission networks; Errors; Eye movements; Forecasting; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Mean square error; Photons; Photovoltaic effects; Risk assessment; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Visualization; Cloud effects; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Photosynthetic photon flux densities; Photosynthetic radiation; Risk evaluation; Solar radiation model; Solar zenith angle; Stochastic cloud effect; Stochastics; Image segmentation; artificial neural network; cloud cover; forecasting method; photon flux density; prediction; risk assessment; solar radiation; stochasticity",Article,Scopus

Effective management requires data collection over large spatio-temporal scales, readily accessible and integrated information from monitoring, and tools to support decision-making. However, there are many roadblocks to achieving adequate and timely information on both the effectiveness, and long-term success of conservation efforts, including limited funding, inadequate sampling, and data processing bottlenecks. These factors can result in ineffective, or even detrimental, management decisions in already impacted ecosystems. An automated approach facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) provides conservation managers with a toolkit that can help alleviate a number of these issues by reducing the monitoring bottlenecks and long-term costs of monitoring. Automating the collection, transfer, and processing of data provides managers access to greater information, thereby facilitating timely and effective management. Incorporating automation and big data availability into a decision support system with a user-friendly interface also enables effective adaptive management. We summarise the current state of artificial intelligence and automation techniques used in marine science and use examples in other disciplines to identify existing and potentially transferable methods that can enable automated monitoring and improve predictive modelling capabilities to support decision making. We also discuss emerging technologies that are likely to be useful as research in computer science and associated technologies continues to develop and become more accessible. Our perspective highlights the potential of AI and big data analytics for supporting decision-making, but also points to important knowledge gaps in multiple areas of the automation processes. These current challenges should be prioritised in conservation research to move toward implementing AI and automation in conservation management for a more informed understanding of impacted ecosystems to result in successful outcomes for conservation managers. We conclude that the current research and emphasis on automated and AI assisted tools in several scientific disciplines may mean the future of monitoring and management in marine science is facilitated and improved by the implementation of automation.

However, in semi-arid regions, remotely sensed discrimination of tree species is difficult primarily due to the tree similarities, small and sparse canopy cover, but may also be due to overlapping woody canopies as well as seasonal leaf retention (deciduous versus evergreen) characteristics. Similar studies in different biomes have achieved low accuracies using coarse spatial resolution image data. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of multi-temporal, airborne hyperspectral imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) derived data for tree species classification in a semi-arid desert region. This study produces highly accurate classifications by combining multi-temporal fine spatial resolution hyperspectral and LiDAR data (~1 m) through a reproducible scripting and machine learning approach that can be applied to larger areas and similar datasets. Combining multi-temporal vegetation indices and canopy height models led to an overall accuracy of 95.28% and kappa of 94.17%. Five woody species were discriminated resulting in producer accuracies ranging from 86.12% to 98.38%. The influence of fusing spectral and structural information in a random forest classifier for tree identification is evident. Additionally, a multi-temporal dataset slightly increases classification accuracies over a single data collection.

These pollutants have detrimental effects on human health and ecological systems; thus, it is important to manage and monitor their presence in the environment. The modeling approach could be an effective way to understand and manage these pollutants. This study predicts the concentrations of micro-pollutants (MPs) using deep learning (DL) models, and the results are then compared with simulation results obtained from the soil water assessment tool (SWAT) model. The SWAT model showed an unacceptable performance owing to the resulting negative Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values for the simulations. This may be caused by the limitations of SWAT, which pertains to adopting simplified equations to simulate micro-pollutants. In addition, the ambiguous plan of pesticide application increased the model uncertainty, thereby deteriorating the model result. Here, we developed two different DL models: long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN). LSTM exhibited the highest model performance, with NSE values of 0.99 and 0.75 for the training and validation steps, respectively. In the multi-target MP model, the error decreased as the number of simulated pollutants increased.

With the growth of the global population, the demand for food is increasing, which needs more agriculture labor. However, the number of people willing to engage in agricultural work is decreasing, causing a severe shortage of agricultural labor. Therefore, it is necessary to study the mode of agricultural production without labor force participation. With the rapid development of the Internet of Things, Big Data, artificial intelligence, robotics and fifth-generation (5G) communication technology, robots can replace humans in agricultural operations, thus enabling the establishment of unmanned farms in the near future. In this review, we have defined unmanned farms, introduced the framework of unmanned farms, analyzed the current state of the technology and how these technologies can be used in unmanned farms, and finally discuss all the technical challenges. We believe that this review will provide guidance for the development of unmanned farms and provide ideas for further investigation of these farms. © 2021 by the authors.

The recent pandemic exposes the shortcomings of traditional healthcare system, i.e., hospitals and clinics alone are not capable to cope with this situation. One of the major technology that aids contemporary healthcare solutions is the smart and connected wearables. The advancement in Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled these wearables to collect data on an unprecedented scale. These wearables gather context-oriented information related to our physical, behavioural and psychological health. The big data generated by wearables and other healthcare devices of IoT is a challenging task to manage that can negatively affect the inference process at the decision centres. Applying big data analytics for mining information, extracting knowledge and making predictions/inferences has recently attracted significant attention. Machine learning is another area of research that has successfully been applied to solve various networking problems such as routing, traffic engineering, resource allocation, and security. Recently, we have seen a surge in the application of ML-based techniques for the improvement of various IoT applications. Although, big data analytics and machine learning are extensively researched, there is a lack of study that exclusively focus on the evolution of ML-based techniques for big data analysis in the IoT healthcare sector. In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive review on the application of machine learning techniques for big data analysis in the healthcare sector. Furthermore, strength and weaknesses of existing techniques along with various research challenges are highlighted.

However, these are complex, highly coupled long-term processes that are difficult to observe or explore through empirical science alone. Models are required that capture the main anthropogenic disturbances, whilst operating across regions and long timescales, simulating both natural and agricultural environments, and shifts among these. Many biogeochemical models neglect agriculture or interactions between carbon and nutrient cycles, which is surprising given the scale of intervention in nitrogen and phosphorus cycles introduced by agriculture. This gap is addressed here, using a plant-soil model that simulates integrated soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus (CNP) cycling across natural, semi-natural and agricultural environments. The model is rigorously tested both spatially and temporally using data from long-term agricultural experiments across temperate environments. The model proved capable of reproducing the magnitude of and trends in soil nutrient stocks, and yield responses to nutrient addition. The model has potential to simulate anthropogenic effects on biogeochemical cycles across northern Europe, for long timescales (centuries) without site-specific calibration, using easily accessible input data. The results demonstrate that weatherable P from parent material has a considerable effect on modern pools of soil C and N, despite significant perturbation of nutrient cycling from agricultural practices, highlighting the need to integrate both geological and agricultural processes to understand effects of land-use change on food security, C storage and nutrient sustainability. The results suggest that an important process or source of P is currently missing in our understanding of agricultural biogeochemical cycles. The model could not explain how yields were sustained in plots with low P fertiliser addition. We suggest that plant access to organic P is a key uncertainty warranting further research, particularly given sustainability concerns surrounding rock sources of P fertiliser. © 2020 The Authors","Agriculture; Land-use change; Modelling; Plant-soil biogeochemistry; Sustainability","Agriculture; Carbon; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Fertilizers; Food storage; Food supply; Forestry; Land use; Models; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Plants (botany); Soils; Sustainable development; Agricultural environments; Agricultural practices; Anthropogenic disturbance; Biogeochemical cycling; Land-use change; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Site specific calibration; Soil biogeochemistry; Biogeochemistry; carbon; nitrogen; phosphorus; agricultural practice; biogeochemical cycle; biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; land use change; nitrogen cycle; phosphorus cycle; source apportionment; sustainability; agriculture; Article; biogeochemical cycling; carbon cycling; environmental parameters; environmental sustainability; food security; geographic distribution; land use; mathematical model; nitrogen cycling; nitrogen deposition; nutrient cycle; phosphorus cycling; priority journal; soil fertilization; Europe",Article,Scopus

In terms of the extraction of ecological factors, vegetation extraction is relatively advanced in contrast to the extraction of animal and microbial data. For the monitoring of environmental conditions of mining areas, sophisticated methods are available to identify pollution levels of vegetation and to accurately monitor soil quality. However, the methods for water and air pollution monitoring in mining areas still need to be improved.

The present review takes stock of the research work accrued under varied agro-pedological conditions, highlighting the response of biochar in a soil-plant-environment continuum. The properties of biochar depended hugely on the source of feedstock and pyrolysis conditions, with its uniqueness resting with high specific surface area and stable carbon source, pre-disposing to better soil health associated crop responses. However, the current biochar recommendations for different crops are high, unless evaluated in combination with fertilizers or organic manures to address both short-term and long-term benefits through soil carbon mediated nutrient supply chain for sustainable crop performance.

Recently, machine learning (ML) models have received increasing attention for GESM due to their vast capabilities. In this context, this paper sought to review the modeling procedure of GESM using ML models, including the required datasets and model development and validation. The results showed that elevation, slope, plan curvature, rainfall and land use/cover were the most important factors for GESM. It is also concluded that although ML models predict the locations of zones prone to gullying reasonably well, performance ranking of such methods is difficult because they yield different results based on the quality of the training dataset, the structure of the models, and the performance indicators. Among the ML techniques, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) are the most widely used models for GESM, which show promising results. Overall, to improve the prediction performance of ML models, the use of data-mining techniques to improve the quality of the dataset and of an ensemble estimation approach is recommended. Furthermore, evaluation of ML models for the prediction of other types of gully erosion, such as rill–interill and ephemeral gully should be the subject of more studies in the future. The employment of a combination of topographic indices and ML models is recommended for the accurate extraction of gully trajectories that are the main input of some process-based models. © 2022 by the authors.","gully erosion susceptibility mapping (GESM); machine learning; random forest; support vector machine",,Review,Scopus

This review paper is intended to provide water resources scientists and hydrologists in particular with a simple technical overview, transdisciplinary progress update, and a source of inspiration about the relevance of DL to water. The review reveals that various physical and geoscientific disciplines have utilized DL to address data challenges, improve efficiency, and gain scientific insights. DL is especially suited for information extraction from image-like data and sequential data. Techniques and experiences presented in other disciplines are of high relevance to water research. Meanwhile, less noticed is that DL may also serve as a scientific exploratory tool. A new area termed AI neuroscience, where scientists interpret the decision process of deep networks and derive insights, has been born. This budding subdiscipline has demonstrated methods including correlation-based analysis, inversion of network-extracted features, reduced-order approximations by interpretable models, and attribution of network decisions to inputs. Moreover, DL can also use data to condition neurons that mimic problem-specific fundamental organizing units, thus revealing emergent behaviors of these units.

In order to meet a variety of demands, suitable cultivars and innovative breeding methods need to be developed. Breeding methods have changed over time following the advance of genetics. With the advent of new sequencing technology in the early 21st century, predictive breeding, such as genomic selection (GS), emerged when large-scale genomic information became available. GS shows good predictive ability for the selection of individuals with traits of interest even for quantitative traits by using various types of the whole genome-scanning markers, breaking away from the limitations of marker-assisted selection (MAS). In the current review, we briefly describe the history of breeding techniques, each breeding method, various statistical models applied to GS and methods to increase the GS efficiency. Consequently, we intend to propose and define the term digital breeding through this review article. Digital breeding is to develop a predictive breeding methods such as GS at a higher level, aiming to minimize human intervention by automatically proceeding breeding design, propagating breeding populations, and to make selections in consideration of various environments, climates, and topography during the breeding process.

Although SIF contains more physiological information than NIRvP, NIRvP can have higher data quality and spatio-temporal resolution. Therefore, the two variables can be considered complementary for GPP monitoring. Here, we propose a simple framework to combine SIF and NIRvP data from different data sources to generate an enhanced SIF product (eSIF). The original SIF data comes from the TROPOMI instrument onboard the Sentinel-5P mission, whereas NIRvP data are derived from MODIS spectral reflectance and ERA5 reanalysis data. The resulting eSIF product has a spatial resolution of 0.05° and a temporal resolution of 8 days, as well as a higher signal-to-noise ratio and a lower angular dependency than the original TROPOMI SIF data. Our results demonstrate that eSIF has similar spatial patterns to the original SIF but is more spatially continuous and less noisy. Comparisons with the FLUXCOM global GPP product show that eSIF has a more universal relationship with GPP than NIRvP for different grass/crop plant functional types (the coefficients of variation are 18.9% for slopes of GPP to eSIF and 27.3% for slopes of GPP to NIRvP), but NIRvP outperforms eSIF for tracking GPP for forest PFTs exclude BoENF. Moreover, eSIF is able to better track the seasonal variations in GPP related to environmental stresses. This study highlights that our methodology based on the combination of SIF and NIRvP is a promising approach for better monitoring of GPP. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Gross primary productivity (GPP); Multi-source data combination; Near-infrared radiation reflected by vegetation (NIRvP); Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF)","Chlorophyll; Fluorescence; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Signal to noise ratio; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Data combination; Gross primary productivity; Multi-source data combination; Multisource data; Near-infrared radiation reflected by vegetation (NIRvP); Near-infrared radiations; Simple approach; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Vegetation; canopy; data quality; fluorescence; MODIS; primary production",Article,Scopus

U.S. soybean yields, which comprise 32 % of the total soybeans planted in the world, continue to experience unprecedented grain loss due to the soybean cyst nematode (SCN) plant pathogen. SCN remains one of the primary disruptive pests despite the existence of advanced management techniques such as crop rotation and SCN-resistant varieties. SCN detection is a key step in managing this disease; however, early detection is challenging because soybeans do not show any above ground symptoms unless they are significantly damaged. Direct soil sampling remains the most common method for SCN detection, however, this method has several problems. For example, the threshold damage methods—adopted by most of the laboratories to make recommendations—is not reliable as it does not consider soil pH, N, P, and K values and relies solely on the egg count instead of assessment of the root infection. To overcome the challenges of manual soil sampling methods, deep learning and hyperspectral imaging are important current topics in precision agriculture for plant disease detection and have been proposed as cost-effective and efficient detection methods that can work at scale. We have reviewed more than 150 research papers focusing on soybean cyst nematodes with an emphasis on deep learning techniques for detection and management. First: we describe soybean vegetation and reproduction stages, SCN life cycles, and factors influencing this disease. Second: we highlight the impact of SCN on soybean yield loss and the challenges associated with its detection. Third: we describe direct sampling methods in which the soil samples are procured and analyzed to evaluate SCN egg counts. Fourth: we highlight the advantages and limitations of these direct methods, then review computer vision- and remote sensing-based detection methods: data collection using ground, aerial, and satellite approaches followed by a review of machine learning methods for image analysis-based soybean cyst nematode detection. We highlight the evaluation approaches and the advantages of overall detection workflow in high-performance and big data environments. Lastly, we discuss various management approaches, such as crop rotation, fertilization, SCN resistant varieties such as PI 88788, and SCN’s increasing resistance to these strategies. We review machine learning approaches for soybean crop yield forecasting as well as the influence of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers on SCN infestation reduction.

The rapid growth in food production through specialized operations such as monoculture cropping systems has aligned to satisfy increases in demand for food and fiber. However, its adverse impacts on natural resources pose huge challenges for the sustainability of food production. The situation is direr for developing countries or rural regions of the world due to the limited resources available to farming communities in these regions. To avoid production agriculture being at the proverbial crossroads we suggest an alternate approach. One that involves the sustainable use of natural resources without adverse environmental impacts by relying less on production inputs whether it be agrochemicals or machineries. We examined the extent to which regenerative agriculture, permaculture, and smart technology have evolved in response to sustainable agricultural production, agricultural decision support system, and overall global food security. Collectively, regenerative agriculture and permaculture are semi-closed holistic systems approach designed to reduce or eliminate dependence on external inputs (e.g., chemicals) which restores and maintains natural systems (e.g., soil quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem services). We suggest that fully embracing modern regenerative agriculture as well as integrated permaculture will improve soil health, ecosystem biodiversity, land and resource conservation, agricultural sustainability, and food security. Identifying and implementing practices towards regenerative agriculture, integrated permaculture, digital agriculture, and sustainable agricultural management utilizing modern agricultural technologies infused with data science (artificial intelligence [AI] or machine learning [ML]) is critical. © 2021 The Authors.

Especially, growing status observation and smart oil palm plantation management enabled by such accurate detections would improve plantation planning, oil palm yield, and reduce manpower and consumption of fertilizer. Although existing studies have already reached a high accuracy in oil palm tree detection, rare attention has been paid to automated observation of each single oil palm tree's growing status. Nowadays, with its high spatial resolution and low cost, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has become a promising tool for monitoring the growing status of individual oil palms. However, the accuracy is still a challenging issue because of the extreme imbalance and high similarity between different classes. In this paper, we propose a Multi-class Oil PAlm Detection approach (MOPAD) to reap both accurate detection of oil palm trees and accurate monitoring of their growing status. Based on Faster RCNN, MOPAD combines a Refined Pyramid Feature (RPF) module and a hybrid class-balanced loss module to achieve satisfying observation of the growing status for individual oil palms. The former takes advantage of multi-level features to distinguish similar classes and detect small oil palms, and the latter effectively resolves the problem of extremely imbalanced samples. Moreover, we elaborately analyze the distribution of different kinds of oil palms, and propose a practical workflow for detecting oil palm vacancy. We evaluate MOPAD using three large-scale UAV images photographed in two sites in Indonesia (denoted by Site 1 and Site 2), containing 363,877 oil palms of five categories: healthy palms, dead palms, mismanaged palms, smallish palms and yellowish palms. Our proposed MOPAD achieves an F1-score of 87.91% (Site 1) and 99.04% (Site 2) for overall oil palm tree detection, and outperforms other state-of-the-art object detection methods by a remarkable margin of 10.37–17.09% and 8.14%-21.32% with respect to the average F1-score for multi-class oil palm detection in Site 1 and Site 2, respectively. Our method demonstrates excellent potential for individual oil palm tree detection and observation of growing status from UAV images, leading to more precise and efficient management of oil palm plantations. © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The increasing availability of soil data that can be efficiently acquired remotely and proximally, and freely available open-source algorithms, have led to an accelerated adoption of ML techniques to analyse soil data. Given the large number of publications, it is an impossible task to manually review all papers on the application of ML in soil science without narrowing down a narrative of ML application in a specific research question. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the application of ML techniques in soil science aided by a ML algorithm (latent Dirichlet allocation) to find patterns in a large collection of text corpora. The objective is to gain insight into publications of ML applications in soil science and to discuss the research gaps in this topic. We found that (a) there is an increasing usage of ML methods in soil sciences, mostly concentrated in developed countries, (b) the reviewed publications can be grouped into 12 topics, namely remote sensing, soil organic carbon, water, contamination, methods (ensembles), erosion and parent material, methods (NN, neural networks, SVM, support vector machines), spectroscopy, modelling (classes), crops, physical, and modelling (continuous), and (c) advanced ML methods usually perform better than simpler approaches thanks to their capability to capture non-linear relationships. From these findings, we found research gaps, in particular, about the precautions that should be taken (parsimony) to avoid overfitting, and that the interpretability of the ML models is an important aspect to consider when applying advanced ML methods in order to improve our knowledge and understanding of soil. We foresee that a large number of studies will focus on the latter topic. © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

Quantifying these benefits is challenging in agroforestry systems, largely due to landscape complexity and the diversity of management approaches. Digital tools designed for agroforestry typically focus on timber and crop production, and not the broader range of benefits usually considered in assessments of ecosystem services and natural capital. The objectives of this review were to identify and evaluate digital tools that quantify natural capital benefits across eight themes applicable to agroforestry systems: timber production and carbon sequestration, agricultural production, microclimate, air quality, water management, biodiversity, pollination, and amenity. We identified and evaluated 63 tools, 9 of which were assessed in further detail using Australia as a case study. No single tool was best suited to quantify benefits across each theme, suggesting that multiple tools or models could be combined to address capability gaps. We find that model complexity, incorporation of spatial processes, accessibility, regional applicability, development speed and interoperability present significant challenges for the tools that were evaluated. We recommend that these challenges be considered as opportunities to develop new, and build upon existing, tools to enhance decision support in agroforestry systems. © 2022 by the authors.","agroforestry; decision support tools; ecosystem services; natural capital benefits; nature-based solutions",,Review,Scopus

Each of these three domains requires dedicated sensor technology currently in place for ground and airborne applications and either have satellite concepts under development (e.g., HySPIRI/SBG (Surface Biology and Geology), Sentinel-8, HiTeSEM in the TIR) or are subject to satellite missions recently launched or scheduled within the next years (i.e., EnMAP and PRISMA (PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa, launched on March 2019) in the VNIR/SWIR, Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) in the SIF). Identification of plant water stress or drought is of utmost importance to guarantee global water and food supply. Therefore, knowledge of crop water status over large farmland areas bears large potential for optimizing agricultural water use. As plant responses to water stress are numerous and complex, their physiological consequences affect the electromagnetic signal in different spectral domains. This review paper summarizes the importance of water stress-related applications and the plant responses to water stress, followed by a concise review of water-stress detection through remote sensing, focusing on TIR without neglecting the comparison to other spectral domains (i.e., VNIR/SWIR and SIF) and multi-sensor approaches. Current and planned sensors at ground, airborne, and satellite level for the TIR as well as a selection of commonly used indices and approaches for water-stress detection using the main multi-/hyperspectral remote sensing imaging techniques are reviewed. Several important challenges are discussed that occur when using spectral emissivity, temperature-based indices, and physically-based approaches for water-stress detection in the TIR spectral domain. Furthermore, challenges with data processing and the perspectives for future satellite missions in the TIR are critically examined. In conclusion, information from multi-/hyperspectral TIR together with those from VNIR/SWIR and SIF sensors within a multi-sensor approach can provide profound insights to actual plant (water) status and the rationale of physiological and biochemical changes. Synergistic sensor use will open new avenues for scientists to study plant functioning and the response to environmental stress in a wide range of ecosystems. © 2019 by the authors.","Crop stress; Drought; Emissivity; Evapotranspiration (ET) modeling; Remote sensing; Temperature; Thermal infrared (TIR); Water stress; Water use","Crops; Data handling; Drought; Fluorescence; Food supply; Forestry; Imaging techniques; Infrared radiation; Physiological models; Physiology; Plants (botany); Satellites; Stresses; Temperature; Water supply; Emissivity; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Shortwave Infrared Reflectance; State-of-the-art techniques; Thermal infrared; Thermal infrared remote sensing; Water stress; Water use; Remote sensing",Review,Scopus

Thus, the objective of this mapping study was to collate and assess studies published in journals and conference proceedings between 1999 and 2021, which applied machine learning algorithms to dairy farming‐related problems to identify trends in the geographical origins of data, as well as the algorithms, features and evaluation metrics and methods used. This mapping study was carried out in line with PRISMA guidelines, with six pre‐defined research questions (RQ) and a broad and unbiased search strategy that explored five databases. In total, 129 publications passed the pre‐defined selection criteria, from which relevant data required to answer each RQ were extracted and analyzed. This study found that Europe (43% of studies) produced the largest number of publications (RQ1), while the largest number of articles were published in the Computers and Electronics in Agriculture journal (21%) (RQ2). The largest number of studies ad-dressed problems related to the physiology and health of dairy cows (32%) (RQ3), while the most frequently employed feature data were derived from sensors (48%) (RQ4). The largest number of studies employed tree‐based algorithms (54%) (RQ5), while RMSE (56%) (regression) and accuracy (77%) (classification) were the most frequently employed metrics used, and hold‐out cross‐validation (39%) was the most frequently employed evaluation method (RQ6). Since 2018, there has been more than a sevenfold increase in the number of studies that focused on the physiology and health of dairy cows, compared to almost a threefold increase in the overall number of publications, suggesting an increased focus on this subdomain. In addition, a fivefold increase in the number of publications that employed neural network algorithms was identified since 2018, in comparison to a threefold increase in the use of both tree‐based algorithms and statistical regression algorithms, suggesting an increasing utilization of neural network‐based algorithms. © 2021 by the authors.

Continuous satellite-based monitoring of this key plant trait would help to understand individual crop N use efficiency and thus would enable site-specific N management. Since hyperspectral imaging sensors could provide detailed measurements of spectral signatures corresponding to the optical activity of chemical constituents, they have a theoretical advantage over multi-spectral sensing for the detection of crop N. The current study aims to provide a state-of-the-art overview of crop N retrieval methods from hyperspectral data in the agricultural sector and in the context of future satellite imaging spectroscopy missions. Over 400 studies were reviewed for this purpose, identifying those estimating mass-based N (N concentration, N%) and area-based N (N content, Narea) using hyperspectral remote sensing data. Retrieval methods of the 125 studies selected in this review can be grouped into: (1) parametric regression methods, (2) linear nonparametric regression methods or chemometrics, (3) nonlinear nonparametric regression methods or machine learning regression algorithms, (4) physically-based or radiative transfer models (RTM), (5) use of alternative data sources (sun-induced fluorescence, SIF) and (6) hybrid or combined techniques. Whereas in the last decades methods for estimation of Narea and N% from hyperspectral data have been mainly based on simple parametric regression algorithms, such as narrowband vegetation indices, there is an increasing trend of using machine learning, RTM and hybrid techniques. Within plants, N is invested in proteins and chlorophylls stored in the leaf cells, with the proteins being the major nitrogen-containing biochemical constituent. However, in most studies, the relationship between N and chlorophyll content was used to estimate crop N, focusing on the visible-near infrared (VNIR) spectral domains, and thus neglecting protein-related N and reallocation of nitrogen to non-photosynthetic compartments. Therefore, we recommend exploiting the estimation of nitrogen via the proxy of proteins using hyperspectral data and in particular the short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral domain. We further strongly encourage a standardization of nitrogen terminology, distinguishing between N% and Narea. Moreover, the exploitation of physically-based approaches is highly recommended combined with machine learning regression algorithms, which represents an interesting perspective for future research in view of new spaceborne imaging spectroscopy sensors. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Biochemical traits; Hybrid techniques, machine learning; Hyperspectral; Radiative transfer modelling","Chemical detection; Chlorophyll; Crops; Information retrieval; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Nitrogen; Parameter estimation; Proteins; Radiative transfer; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Transfer learning; Biochemical traits; Hybrid techniques; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral imaging sensors; Hyperspectral remote sensing data; Non-parametric regression; Parametric regression methods; Radiative transfer modelling; Hyperspectral imaging; chlorophyll; machine learning; nitrogen; radiative transfer; regression analysis; remote sensing; satellite data; spectral analysis; standardization",Review,Scopus

However, plant performance or phenotype (P) is determined by the combined effects of genotype (G), envirotype (E), and genotype by environment interaction (GEI). Phenotypes can be predicted more precisely by training a model using data collected from multiple sources, including spatiotemporal omics (genomics, phenomics, and enviromics across time and space). Integration of 3D information profiles (G-P-E), each with multidimensionality, provides predictive breeding with both tremendous opportunities and great challenges. Here, we first review innovative technologies for predictive breeding. We then evaluate multidimensional information profiles that can be integrated with a predictive breeding strategy, particularly envirotypic data, which have largely been neglected in data collection and are nearly untouched in model construction. We propose a smart breeding scheme, integrated genomic-enviromic prediction (iGEP), as an extension of genomic prediction, using integrated multiomics information, big data technology, and artificial intelligence (mainly focused on machine and deep learning). We discuss how to implement iGEP, including spatiotemporal models, environmental indices, factorial and spatiotemporal structure of plant breeding data, and cross-species prediction. A strategy is then proposed for prediction-based crop redesign at both the macro (individual, population, and species) and micro (gene, metabolism, and network) scales. Finally, we provide perspectives on translating smart breeding into genetic gain through integrative breeding platforms and open-source breeding initiatives. We call for coordinated efforts in smart breeding through iGEP, institutional partnerships, and innovative technological support. © 2022 The Author","artificial intelligence; big data; crop design; genomic selection; integrated genomic-enviromic selection; machine and deep learning; smart breeding; spatiotemporal omics","artificial intelligence; genetic selection; genome; genomics; genotype; phenotype; plant breeding; procedures; Artificial Intelligence; Big Data; Genome; Genomics; Genotype; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Selection, Genetic",Review,Scopus

Insufficient or excessive application of N fertilizers can limit crop yield and quality, especially as excessive N fertilizers can damage the environment and proper fertilizer application is essential for agricultural production. Efficient monitoring of crop N content is the basis of precise fertilizer management, and therefore to increase crop yields and improve crop quality. Remote sensing has gradually replaced traditional destructive methods such as field surveys and laboratory testing for crop N diagnosis. With the rapid advancement of remote sensing, a review on crop N monitoring is badly in need of better summary and discussion. The purpose of this study was to identify current research trends and key issues related to N monitoring. It begins with a comprehensive statistical analysis of the literature on remote sensing monitoring of N in rice and wheat over the past 20 years. The study then elucidates the physiological mechanisms and spectral response characteristics of remote sensing monitoring of canopy N. The following section summarizes the techniques and methods applied in remote sensing monitoring of canopy N from three aspects: remote sensing platforms for N monitoring; correlation between remotely sensed data and N status; and the retrieval methods of N status. The influential factors of N retrieval were then discussed with detailed classification. However, there remain challenges and problems that need to be addressed in the future studies, including the fusion of multisource data from different platforms, and the uncertainty of canopy N inversion in the presence of background factors. The newly developed hybrid model integrates the flexibility of machine learning with the mechanism of physical models. It could be problem solving, which has the advantages of processing multi-source data and reducing the interference of confounding factors. It could be the future development direction of crop N inversion with both high precision and universality. © 2022 by the authors.","nitrogen remote sensing; quantitative retrieval; research prospect; rice and wheat","Data handling; Monitoring; Nitrogen fertilizers; Physiological models; Remote sensing; Crop quality; Crop yield; Multisource data; N fertilizers; Nitrogen remote sensing; Quantitative retrieval; Remote sensing monitoring; Remote-sensing; Research prospect; Rice and wheat; Crops",Review,Scopus

This path is already being taken by the recent and fast-developing research in computational fields, however, some issues related to computationally expensive processes in the integration of multi-source sensing data remain. Recent studies focused on Earth observation and characterization are enhanced by the proliferation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and sensors able to capture massive datasets with a high spatial resolution. In this scope, many approaches have been presented for 3D modeling, remote sensing, image processing and mapping, and multi-source data fusion. This survey aims to present a summary of previous work according to the most relevant contributions for the reconstruction and analysis of 3D models of real scenarios using multispectral, thermal and hyperspectral imagery. Surveyed applications are focused on agriculture and forestry since these fields concentrate most applications and are widely studied. Many challenges are currently being overcome by recent methods based on the reconstruction of multi-sensorial 3D scenarios. In parallel, the processing of large image datasets has recently been accelerated by General-Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) approaches that are also summarized in this work. Finally, as a conclusion, some open issues and future research directions are presented. © 2022 The Author(s)","3D Modeling; Data Fusion; Image Mapping; Survey","image analysis; image processing; mapping; remote sensing; survey; three-dimensional modeling",Review,Scopus

High-throughput plant phenotyping is challenging owing to the spatio-temporal dynamics of traits. Proximal and remote sensing (PRS) techniques are increasingly used for plant phenotyping because of their advantages in multi-dimensional data acquisition and analysis. Substantial progress of PRS applications in PP has been observed over the last two decades and is analyzed here from an interdisciplinary perspective based on 2972 publications. This progress covers most aspects of PRS application in PP, including patterns of global spatial distribution and temporal dynamics, specific PRS technologies, phenotypic research fields, working environments, species, and traits. Subsequently, we demonstrate how to link PRS to multi-omics studies, including how to achieve multi-dimensional PRS data acquisition and processing, how to systematically integrate all kinds of phenotypic information and derive phenotypic knowledge with biological significance, and how to link PP to multi-omics association analysis. Finally, we identify three future perspectives for PRS-based PP: (1) strengthening the spatial and temporal consistency of PRS data, (2) exploring novel phenotypic traits, and (3) facilitating multi-omics communication. © 2022 The Author(s)","breeding; multi-omics; phenotypic traits; phenotyping; plant phenomics; precision cultivation; remote sensing","crop; phenotype; plant breeding; remote sensing; Crops, Agricultural; Phenomics; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Remote Sensing Technology",Review,Scopus

More and more resource studies are emerging providing 1000 and more genotypes and millions of SNPs for one species covering a hitherto inaccessible intraspecific genetic variation. The larger the databases are growing, the better statistical approaches for genomic selection will be available. However, there are clear limitations on the statistical but also on the biological part. Intraspecific genetic variation is able to explain a high proportion of the phenotypes, but a large part of phenotypic plasticity also stems from environmentally driven transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, post-translational, epigenetic and metabolic regulation. Moreover, regulation of the same gene can have different phenotypic outputs in different environments. Consequently, to explain and understand environment-dependent phenotypic plasticity based on the available genotype variation we have to integrate the analysis of further molecular levels reflecting the complete information flow from the gene to metabolism to phenotype. Interestingly, metabolomics platforms are already more cost-effective than NGS platforms and are decisive for the prediction of nutritional value or stress resistance. Here, we propose three fundamental pillars for future breeding strategies in the framework of Green Systems Biology: (i) combining genome selection with environment-dependent PANOMICS analysis and deep learning to improve prediction accuracy for marker-dependent trait performance; (ii) PANOMICS resolution at subtissue, cellular and subcellular level provides information about fundamental functions of selected markers; (iii) combining PANOMICS with genome editing and speed breeding tools to accelerate and enhance large-scale functional validation of trait-specific precision breeding. © 2020 The Authors.

Unlike other site-specific applications, SSS was not adopted sufficiently by farmers due to some technological and practical challenges that need to be overcome. Success of site-specific application strongly depends on the accuracy of measurement of key parameters in the system, modeling and delineation of management zone maps, accurate recommendations and finally the right choice of variable rate (VR) technologies and their integrations. The current study reviews available principles and technologies for both map-based and senor-based SSS. It covers the background of crop and soil quality indicators (SQI), various soil and crop sensor technologies and recommendation approaches of map-based and sensor-based SSS applications. It also discusses the potential of socio-economic benefits of SSS against uniform seeding. The current review proposes prospective future technology synthesis for implementation of SSS in practice. A multi-sensor data fusion system, integrating proper sensor combinations, is suggested as an essential approach for putting SSS into practice. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Multi-sensor and data fusion; Seed-rate-index model; Site-specific seeding; Socio-economic benefits; Soil and crop quality",,Book Chapter,Scopus

Wireless communication protocols constitute a critical part of smart agriculture systems because the fields, in general, cover a large area requiring system components to be placed at distant locations. There are various communication protocols with different features that can be utilized in smart agriculture applications. When designing a smart agriculture system, it is required to carefully consider the features of possible protocols to make a suitable and optimal selection. Therefore, this review paper aims to underline the specifications of the wireless communication protocols that are widely used in smart agriculture applications. Furthermore, application-specific requirements, which may be useful during the design stage of the smart agriculture systems, are highlighted. To accomplish these aims, this paper compares the technical properties and investigates the practical applications of five different wireless communication protocols that are commonly used in IoT applications: ZigBee, Wi-Fi, Sigfox, NB-IoT, and LoRaWAN. In particular, the inconsistencies in the technical properties of these protocols reported in different resources have been highlighted and the reason for this situation has been discussed. Considering the features offered by the protocols and the requirements of smart agriculture applications, the appropriateness of a particular protocol to a particular smart agriculture application is examined. In addition, issues about cost, communication quality, and hardware of the five protocols have been mentioned. The trending technologies with high potential for the future applications of smart agriculture have been introduced. In this context, the relation of the technologies like aerial systems, cellular communication, and big data analytics with wireless have been specified. Finally, the leading protocol and the smart agriculture application area have been highlighted through observing the year-based distribution of the recent publications. It has been shown that usage of LoRaWAN protocol has become more widespread in recent years. © 2022","Internet of things; LoRaWAN; NB-IoT; Sigfox; Smart agriculture; Wireless communication","Agriculture; Antennas; Data Analytics; Energy resources; Mobile telecommunication systems; Wi-Fi; Agriculture applications; Agriculture systems; Future trends; LoRaWAN; NB-IoT; Sigfox; Smart agricultures; Technical properties; Wireless communication protocols; Wireless communications; Internet of things",Short Survey,Scopus

Each of these two categories has advantageous and shortcomings. This chapter discusses the potential of different sensing technologies to characterize within-field variability of soils and crops, by providing high sampling resolution data necessary for site-specific management of farm input resources (e.g., fertilizers, water for irrigation, seeds and pesticides).
