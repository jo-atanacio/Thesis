Meanwhile, smart farming technology enables the farmers to achieve maximum crop yield by extracting essential parameters of crop growth. This systematic literature review highlights the existing research gaps in a particular area of deep learning methodologies and guides us in analyzing the impact of vegetation indices and environmental factors on crop yield. To achieve the aims of this study, prior studies from 2012 to 2022 from various databases are collected and analyzed. The study focuses on the advantages of using deep learning in crop yield prediction, the suitable remote sensing technology based on the data acquisition requirements, and the various features that influence crop yield prediction. This study finds that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are the most widely used deep learning approaches for crop yield prediction. The commonly used remote sensing technology is satellite remote sensing technology—in particular, the use of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Findings show that vegetation indices are the most used feature for crop yield prediction. However, it is also observed that the most used features in the literature do not always work for all the approaches. The main challenges of using deep learning approaches and remote sensing for crop yield prediction are how to improve the working model for better accuracy, the practical implication of the model for providing accurate information about crop yield to agriculturalists, growers, and policymakers, and the issue with the black box property. © 2022 by the authors.

Accurate Crop Yield Prediction (CYP) necessitates the basic understanding of the functional relativity among yields and the collaborative factor. Disclosing such connection requires both wide-ranging datasets and an efficient model. The CYP is important to accomplish irrigation scheduling and assessing labor necessities for reaping and storing. Predicting yield using various kinds of irrigation is effective for optimizing resources, but CYP is a difficult process owing to the existence of distinct factors. Recently, Deep Learning (DL) approaches offer solutions to complicated data like weather parameters, maturity groups, genotype, etc. In this aspect, this paper presents an Automated Crop Yield Prediction utilizing Chaotic Political Optimizer with Deep Learning (ACYP-CPODL) model. The proposed ACYP-CPODL technique involves different processes namely pre-processing, prediction and parameter optimization. In addition, the hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) technique is designed for the prediction process. Moreover, the hyperparameter tuning of the CNN-LSTM approach is performed by the CPO algorithm. The proposed ACYP-CPODL technique has produced an effective result with an MSE of 0.031 and R2 Score of 0.936, whereas the BLSTM model has produced a near-optimal results. As a result, the proposed ACYP-CPODL method has proven to be an effective tool for predicting the crop yields.

It is crucial in making decisions at global, regional, and field levels. Numerous factors such as genotype, environment, and their interactions decide a mosaic trait such as crop yield prediction. Faultless yield prediction demands elementary understanding of the relationship between yield and the associated factors. Comprehensive datasets and powerful algorithms are required to reveal the connection between the associated factors. Machine learning is an indispensable tool for crop yield prediction, which helps in making decisions with regard to the type of crops to be grown during the season and what to be done during the growing season of crops. An accurate crop prediction model helps farmers in deciding the financial investment and forecast the returns on the investment. The proposed solution aims to create a heaped model consisting of linear models. In order to achieve the solution, data from the period of 1995-2010 were collected, coming from official varietal experiments carried out in India. The solution consists of a random forest regressor, decision tree regressor, KNN regressor and XGB regressor.

Remote sensing data captured using various satellites provide reliable phenological information for a crop through surface reflectance bands. Other important factors, affecting crop yield include meteorological and soil. The data which we have used for crop yield prediction is multimodal. It consists of spatiotemporal meteorological (numeric) and surface reflectance bands (satellite image), and temporally static soil (satellite image) data. We effectively utilize this multimodal data to develop the proposed multimodal deep learning model, CropYieldNet. The objective of the paper is to accurately predict crop yield using high resolution data obtained from recently launched satellites such as Landsat8 and Sentinel-2. We used contrastive learning in a supervised setting and data augmentation techniques to overcome the limited historical data available for training deep learning models.We introduce a depth-level selection module for effectively modelling the depth-variant information of soil data. We have also modified our model to perform in-season (early) crop yield prediction which is as accurate as end-season prediction. We evaluate our model for two crops, corn and soybean, on counties in US and districts in India using data from MODIS, Landsat8, and Sentinel-2 satellites.

In this paper, towards the goal of better crop yield prediction, leveraging recent graph signal processing (GSP) tools to exploit spatial correlation among neighboring counties, we denoise relevant features via graph spectral filtering that are inputs to a deep learning prediction model. Specifically, we first construct a combinatorial graph with edge weights that encode county-to-county similarities in soil and location features via metric learning. We then denoise features via a maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation with a graph Laplacian regularizer (GLR). We focus on the challenge to estimate the crucial weight parameter µ, trading off the fidelity term and GLR, that is a function of noise variance in an unsupervised manner. We first estimate noise variance directly from noise-corrupted graph signals using a graph clique detection (GCD) procedure that discovers locally constant regions. We then compute an optimal µ minimizing an approximate mean square error function via bias-variance analysis. Experimental results from collected USDA data show that using denoised features as input, performance of a crop yield prediction model can be improved noticeably. © 2022 European Signal Processing Conference, EUSIPCO.

Crop yield protection is the science and practice of handling plant diseases, weeds, and other pests. Accurate information regarding the crop yield history is essential for making decisions regarding agricultural risk management. Many research studies have been undertaken for identifying crop productivity using various data mining techniques. However, the prediction accuracy of crop yields was not improved with minimum time consumption. To overcome the issues, a novel Quantile Regressive Empirical correlative Functioned Deep FeedForward Multilayer Perceptron Classification (QRECF-DFFMPC) Method is proposed for crop yield prediction. QRECF-DFFMPC Method comprises three layers such as input and output layer with one or more hidden layers. The input layer of deep neural learning receives several features and data from the dataset and then sent it to the hidden layer 1. In that layer, Empirical Orthogonal Function is used to select the relevant features with the help of orthogonal basis functions. After that, Quantile regression is used in the hidden layer 2 to analyze the features and produce the regression value for every data point. Then, the regression value of data points is sent to the output layer for improving the prediction accuracy and reducing the time complexity. Experimental evaluation is carried out on factors such as prediction accuracy, precision, and prediction time for several data points and the number of features. The result shows that the proposed technique enhanced the prediction accuracy and precision by 6% and 9% and reduces the prediction time by 32%, as compared to existing works. © 2022","Crop yield prediction; Deep feedforward multi-layer perceptron; Empirical orthogonal function; Quantile regression; Sigmoid activation function","Crops; Data mining; Decision making; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Multilayers; Orthogonal functions; Regression analysis; Risk management; Crop yield; Crop yield prediction; Deep feedforward multi-layer perceptron; Empirical Orthogonal Function; Feed forward; Multilayers perceptrons; Prediction accuracy; Quantile regression; Sigmoid activation function; Yield prediction; Multilayer neural networks",Article,Scopus

Deep Learning (DL) models are recently well-known for predicting crop yields. Multi-parametric Deep Neural Network (MDNN) is a DL model employed to estimate the crop yield concerning multiple parameters such as climate and soil. A Growing-Degree Day (GDD) has been used to determine the impact of climate change on crop yield. The determined values along with the climate and soil parameters have been learned by the DNN to estimate the yield quality. The MDNN performs well with the huge volume of data and it is not suitable for the medium scale of data. The learning ability of MDNN is improved in this paper by proposing a Multi-parametric Multiple Kernel DNN (MMKDNN) to provide better crop yield prediction for medium-scale data. The effectiveness of the model built in the last hidden layer is solely determined by the intermediate representations of the input. The intermediate representation of the input in a neural network is combined through multiple kernel learning. The MMKDNN with increasing complexity representations is preserved in this way, but the output calculation, i.e. crop yield prediction, is free to use all of the network's knowledge. For five different types of crops, the experiments are conducted to assess the efficiency of the MMKDNN. © 2022","Crop yield prediction; DNN; GDD; Multi-parametric multiple kernel DNN; Multiple kernel learning","Climate change; Climate models; Crops; Forecasting; Learning systems; Crop yield; Crop yield prediction; DNN; Growing degree-days; Learning models; Medium-scale; Multi-parametric multiple kernel DNN; Multiple Kernel Learning; Multiple kernels; Yield prediction; Deep neural networks",Article,Scopus

Furthermore, when using nonlinear ML, redundant VCI/TCI data present additional challenges that adversely affect the models’ output.

One of the vital tasks is the crop yield prediction at its early stage; because it forms one of the most challenging tasks in precision agriculture as it demands a deep understanding of the growth pattern with the highly nonlinear parameters. Environmental parameters like rainfall, temperature, humidity, and management practices like fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation are very dynamic in approach and vary from field to field. In the proposed work, the data were collected from paddy fields of 28 districts in wide spectrum of Tamilnadu over a period of 18 years. The Statistical model Multi Linear Regression was used as a benchmark for crop yield prediction, which yielded an accuracy of 82% owing to its wide ranging input data. Therefore, machine learning models are developed to obtain improved accuracy, namely Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Support Vector Machine, and General Regression Neural Networks with the given data set.

Earth observation provides a unique source of information to monitor crops from a diversity of spectral ranges. However, the integrated use of these data and their values in crop yield prediction is still understudied. Here we proposed the combination of environmental data (climate, soil, geography, and topography) with multiple satellite data (optical-based vegetation indices, solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), land surface temperature (LST), and microwave vegetation optical depth (VOD)) into the framework to estimate crop yield for maize, rice, and soybean in northeast China, and their unique value and relative influence on yield prediction was assessed. Two linear regression methods, three machine learning (ML) methods, and one ML ensemble model were adopted to build yield prediction models. Results showed that the individual ML methods outperformed the linear regression methods, the ML ensemble model further improved the single ML models. Moreover, models with more inputs achieved better performance, the combination of satellite data with environmental data, which explained 72%, 69%, and 57% of maize, rice, and soybean yield variability, respectively, demonstrated higher yield prediction performance than individual inputs. While satellite data contributed to crop yield prediction mainly at the early-peak of the growing season, climate data offered extra information mainly at the peak-late season. We also found that the combined use of EVI, LST and SIF has improved the model accuracy compared to the benchmark EVI model. However, the optical-based vegetation indices shared similar information and did not provide much extra information beyond EVI. The within-season yield forecasting showed that crop yields can be satisfactorily forecasted at two to three months prior to harvest. Geography, topography, VOD, EVI, soil hydraulic and nutrient parameters are more important for crop yield prediction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Crop yield; Environmental data; Machine learning; Multi-source satellite data; Yield prediction","Crops; Food supply; Forecasting; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Satellites; Vegetation; Crop yield; Environmental data; Multi-source satellite data; Multi-Sources; Northeast China; Optical-; Satellite data; Solar-induced fluorescences; Vegetation index; Yield prediction; Topography; crop yield; machine learning; optical depth; prediction; satellite data; surface temperature; vegetation index; article; China; climate; fluorescence; forecasting; growing season; harvest; linear regression analysis; machine learning; maize; microwave radiation; nonhuman; nutrient; optical depth; plant yield; prediction; rice; soil; soybean; topography; vegetation; agriculture; crop; season; China; Agriculture; Climate; Crops, Agricultural; Seasons; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

While the impacts of these updates on modeled hydrology are well studied, impacts on predicted water quality and crop yield are unresolved. In this study, we evaluated data assimilation effects for a range of predictions in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). We used satellite surface soil moisture data products from the Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission to update SWAT soil moisture for two U.S. experimental watersheds. We addressed possible limitations to the vertical transfer of surface soil moisture updates to deeper layers in the model by additionally testing a modified soil percolation approach that relies on relative saturation rather than the original thresholding behavior of SWAT. Results at both watersheds demonstrated that data assimilation greatly impacted water quality and crop yield predictions. Modifying the soil percolation algorithm, however, did not improve assimilation results. Assimilation increased median soil moisture (+2% to +6 %) which in turn increased total streamflow (+0.43 to +1.70 m3/s daily). Critically, streamflow alone was not a sufficient predictor for the assimilation changes to water quality predictions as flow component contributions and seasonality differed between sites. A varied response in annual water quality predictions to soil moisture updates was identified (+1.70 to +123 kg/ha total nitrogen; −0.11 to −0.57 kg/ha total phosphorous; +8.1 to +50.0 kg/ha sediment) that was dependent upon the timing of the updates, site characteristics, and change to specific transport and transformation processes. Crop yield predictions were similarly impacted by data assimilation from changes to both water and nutrient availability that varied by crop type. The overall strong and diverse response of water quality and crop yield predictions to soil moisture updates provides evidence that assimilation can impact a range of model predictions. Efforts to improve soil moisture simulations, therefore, have potential for meaningful improvements in targeted, non-hydrologic predictions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Data assimilation; Ecohydrologic modeling; Remote sensing; SMAP; Soil moisture; SWAT","Crops; Forecasting; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Soil testing; Solvents; Stream flow; Water quality; Watersheds; Active/passive; Crop yield; Data assimilation; Ecohydrologic models; Moisture data; Quality yield; Remote-sensing; Soil and Water assessment tools; Soil moisture active/passive; Yield prediction; SWAT; crop yield; data assimilation; remote sensing; soil and water assessment tool; soil moisture; soil water; streamflow; water quality; watershed",Article,Scopus

Factors impacting CY improvement include rising population, water shortage, fertilizer use, climate change and unprecedented insect attacks. To resolve these issues, a smart agriculture technique is proposed in this work. Internet of Things (IoT) sensor devices are used to collect data from farms, following which the fuzzy association rule-based classification technique classifies the data into two, valuable and nonvaluable. An improved artificial neural network (IANN) algorithm is applied to identify and analyze the factors involved in monitoring CY's. Thereafter, all valuable data pertaining to the type of seed, fertilizer and crop cost is stored in blocks to secure data and communication between members of the farming community. Finally, an edge computing device is used to store the blocks and transfer information. The valuable data collected is classified using the fuzzy association rule and analyzed using the IANN technique, both of which facilitate a comparison with the historical data so as to enable better decision making in terms of seed and fertilizer selection. Similarly, crop price is predicted through a comparison of present and historical yields. To overcome breaches in security, a blockchain technique is employed in this work to secure communication between farmers, investors and merchants. The investor dispatches instructions on the selection of the seed and fertilizer, as well as the crop cost, through the blockchain to the farmer and the merchant. Such secure communication bypasses third-party involvement and inconsistencies in the data. When compared to the traditional method, the proposed technique offers better accuracy and profits, right from seed selection to trading. The proposed IANN technique produced a higher yield than the traditional method with a profit of 51%, 35% and 20% for rice, bananas and flowers, respectively. Similarly, the IANN technique provides 99.15% prediction accuracy in terms of a profit analysis. The blockchain and edge computing-based transactions improve security and reduce transactional latency.

Interactions among different genetic, environmental, and management factors and uncertainty in input values are making crop yield prediction complex. Building upon a previous work in which we coupled crop modeling with machine learning (ML) models to predict maize yields for three US Corn Belt states, here, we expand the concept to the entire US Corn Belt (12 states). More specifically, we built five new ML models and their ensemble models, considering the scenarios with and without crop modeling variables. Additional input values in our models are soil, weather, management, and historical yield data. A unique aspect of our work is the spatial analysis to investigate causes for low or high model prediction errors. Our results indicated that the prediction accuracy increases by coupling crop modeling with machine learning. The ensemble model overperformed the individual ML models, having a relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of about 9% for the test years (2018, 2019, and 2020), which is comparable to previous studies. In addition, analysis of the sources of error revealed that counties and crop reporting districts with low cropland ratios have high RRMSE. Furthermore, we found that soil input data and extreme weather events were responsible for high errors in some regions. The proposed models can be deployed for large-scale prediction at the county level and, contingent upon data availability, can be utilized for field level prediction.

Accurately predicting crop yields is crucial for addressing these challenges. However, this prediction task is exceptionally complicated since crop yields depend on numerous factors such as weather, land surface, and soil quality, as well as their interactions. In recent years, machine learning models have been successfully applied in this domain. However, these models either restrict their tasks to a relatively small region, or only study over a single or few years, which makes them hard to generalize spatially and temporally. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based recurrent neural network for crop yield prediction, to incorporate both geographical and temporal knowledge in the model, and further boost predictive power. Our method is trained, validated, and tested on over 2000 counties from 41 states in the US mainland, covering years from 1981 to 2019. As far as we know, this is the first machine learning method that embeds geographical knowledge in crop yield prediction and predicts crop yields at the county level nationwide. We also laid a solid foundation by comparing our model on a nationwide scale with other well-known baseline methods, including linear models, tree-based models, and deep learning methods. Experiments show that our proposed method consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on various metrics, validating the effectiveness of geospatial and temporal information.

Crop yield prediction (CYP) is a hot research topic since it depends upon several parameters such as environment, rainfall, soil, water, seasonal crop, etc. Machine learning (ML) models are commonly employed for the extraction of important crop features to predict yield. The ML models act as a decision support tool for CYP, which enables to decide on what type of crops can grow and at what season. With this motivation, this paper focuses on the design of kernel extreme learning machine-based crop yield prediction (KELM-CYP) model. The goal of the KELM-CYP technique is to predict the crop yield based on different parameters such as state name, season crop, area, and rainfall. The proposed KELM-CYP model initially performs data preprocessing in two levels namely data merging and data normalization. Besides, KELM is a kind of machine learning (ML) based model commonly used for regression and classification processes. KELM is an extended version of extreme learning machine (ELM) by the use of kernel transformation process that allows having improved generalization performance owing to the kernel conversion from the input to kernel space. In order to showcase the enhanced predictive outcome of the KELM-CYP model, a wide range of simulations takes place on benchmark datasets from Kaggle repository. The experimental results pointed out the better performance of the KELM-CYP model in terms of different measures. © 2022 IEEE","Agriculture; Crop yield; Kernel extreme learning machine; Machine learning; Prediction model; Rainfall; Regression process","Decision support systems; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Machine learning; Rain; Crop yield; Hot research topics; Kernel extreme learning machine; Learning machines; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Prediction modelling; Regression process; Yield prediction; Yield prediction models; Crops",Conference Paper,Scopus

According to the survey of the past few years, over 70% of India's Gross domestic product (GDP) depends on the agriculture field. Most of the farmers are not educated in India and do not know which crop yield gives better production according to the agriculture land and environmental condition. In addition, agriculture requires a timely guideline that will enable crop yield predictions, allowing for the development of efficient agricultural yield-boosting measures. By analyzing the enormous amounts of data and interpreting the results, Machine Learning (ML) approaches provide a comprehensive understanding of the procedure. Therefore, this paper proposes a modal, named as Ensemble Expert System for Crop Yield Prediction-I (EESCYP-I) to explore the crop data to predict the crop name effectively. The proposed model executes the missing value treatment using mean data imputation technique as the crop dataset contains missing values. Classification is done using Extra Tree (ET) ensemble learning technique as Extra Tree is the best among Ensemble Learning (EL) techniques with 10-fold cross-validation due to highly excellent tree pruning and regularization which prevents the model from overfitting. EESCYP-I uses three different model training approaches: holdout, 5-fold cross-validation, and 10-fold cross-validation, to train and validate the model. Some researchers implement the EL techniques using holdout training approach (70-30%) without treating missing values. From the experimental results, it is observed that EESCYP-I with 10-fold cross-validation produces better performance than others training approaches. The performance improvement of EESCYP-I with missing value treatment and model training is observed, which is promising and significant. © 2022 IEEE.","Crop Prediction; Ensemble Learning; Extra Tree; Machine Learning; Missing Value Treatment; Random Forest","Adaptive boosting; Expert systems; Forecasting; Learning systems; Machine learning; Crop prediction; Crop yield; Ensemble learning; Extra-trees; Learning techniques; Machine-learning; Missing value treatment; Missing values; Random forests; Yield prediction; Crops",Conference Paper,Scopus

Therefore, predicting crop yield before its cultivation can help farmers and the agriculture departments in deciding which crop is better to grow and take appropriate marketing and storage measures. Predicting crop yield is one of the applications in the field of machine learning (ML). Many models have been recommended and certified to date. Crop yield prediction necessitates the use of a few datasets because it is dependent on a variety of parameters such as climate, soil, location, area, season, and so on. This methodology focuses on predicting crop yield based on available data using different Regression models like Linear Regression (LR), Lasso Regression (LASSO), Decision Tree Regression (DT), and Random Forest (RF) Regression and evaluate which model is best for the prediction of crop yield. The inspiration for this project is that this will help farmers to predict and see the yield of their crop before they cultivate it and make the right decisions and also develop new ideas in the field of crop yield forecasting and for further research.

This is so because extreme weather conditions induced by climate change are detrimental to most crops and affect the expected quantity of agricultural production. Although there is no way to fully mitigate these natural phenomena, it could be much better if there is information known earlier about the future so that farmers can plan accordingly. Early information sharing about expected crop production may support food insecurity risk reduction. In this regard, this work employs data mining techniques to predict future crop (i.e., Irish potatoes and Maize) harvests using weather and yields historical data for Musanze, a district in Rwanda. The study applies machine learning techniques to predict crop harvests based on weather data and communicate the information about production trends. Weather data and crop yields for Irish potatoes and maize were gathered from various sources. The collected data were analyzed through Random Forest, Polynomial Regression, and Support Vector Regressor. Rainfall and temperature were used as predictors. The models were trained and tested. The results indicate that Random Forest is the best model with root mean square error of 510.8 and 129.9 for potato and maize, respectively, whereas R2 was 0.875 and 0.817 for the same crops datasets. The optimum weather conditions for the optimal crop yield were identified for each crop. The results suggests that Random Forest is recommended model for early crop yield prediction.

All these image types can be processed in order to determine crop growth, crop diseases and finally crop yield. Different algorithms have been proposed over the years which determine one or more of these parameters using a series of image segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, classification and post-processing steps. Each of these steps requires a specialized set of algorithms to be employed in order to design an effective crop-image processing system. Due to the wide variety of algorithms present in the given field of work, selection of the most optimum algorithm set for a given application is often ambiguous. For instance, if an application is trying to process satellite imagery, then identification of best image-fusion methods for effective classification requires a lot of research, and thus increases delay for designing the system. In order to reduce this ambiguity, this paper reviews these algorithm sets which identify the best techniques in terms of statistical parameters for a given application. Accuracy and error rate have been compared between different algorithms in order to give a clear idea about the performance of these algorithms. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Classification; Crop; Disease; Growth; Machine learning; Prediction; Yield",,Conference Paper,Scopus

This system uses a machine learning algorithm trained on historical field data combined with spectral information extracted from satellite images. To this end, we used 5 years of historical data for a Moroccan orchard composed of 50 parcels. These data are related to climate, amount of water used for irrigation, fertilization products by dose, phytosanitary treatment dose, parcel size, and root-stock type on each parcel. Additionally, two very popular indices, the normalized difference vegetation index and normalized difference water index were extracted from Sentinel 2 and Landsat satellite images to improve prediction scores. We managed to build a total dataset composed of 250 rows, representing the 50 parcels over a period of 5 years labeled with the yield of each parcel. Several machine learning algorithms were tested with the necessary parameter optimization, while the orthonormal automatic pursuit algorithm gave good prediction scores of 0.2489 (MAE: Mean Absolute Error) and 0.0843 (MSE: Mean Squared Error). Finally, the approach followed in this study shows excellent potential for fruit yield prediction.

Drones are used in examining crops and exploiting data to determine what requires greater attention. This research study focuses on how deep learning (DL) has been used with drone technology to create solutions for detecting crop fields within a certain regions of interest (ROI). Extracting images from a drone and analysing them with a DL system to identify crop fields and yields for less-developed nations are solution to a prevalent challenge that land use–land cover (LULC) encounters. The limitations of drone spot-checking in the context of agricultural fields and the constraints of utilizing DL to detect yields. Also, a novel method is offered for detecting and tracking crop fields using a single camera on our UAV. The estimated background movements using a perspective transformation model given a sequence of video frames and then locate distinct locations in the background removed picture to detect moving objects. The optical flow matching is used to determine the spatiotemporal features of each moving item and then categorize our targets, which have considerably different motions than the backdrop. Kalman filter tracking has used to ensure that our detections are consistent across time. The hybrid crop field detection model is to evaluate on real uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) recordings. And the findings suggest that hybrid crop field detection successfully detects and tracks crop fields through tiny UAV’s with low computational resources. A crop field module, which aids in reconstruction quality evaluation by cropping specific ROIs from the whole field, and a reversing module, which projects ROIs-Vellore to relative raw pictures, are included in the proposed method. The results exhibit faster identification of cropping and reversing modules, impacting ROI height selection and reverse extraction of ROI location from raw pictures. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences & Polish Academy of Sciences.","Crop field; Crop yield monitoring; Region of interest (ROI); U-Net; Uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Crops; Deep learning; Image segmentation; Land use; Object detection; Quality control; Crop fields; Crop yield; Crop yield monitoring; Region of interest; Region-of-interest; Regions of interest; U-net; Uncrewed aerial vehicle; Uncrewed aerial vehicles; Yield monitoring; Drones; agricultural land; crop yield; machine learning; monitoring; prediction; satellite data; unmanned vehicle",Article,Scopus

In contrast to conventional regression-based yield prediction methods, a very broad range of possible input features and their combinations are exhaustively tested for maximum explanatory power. Weather variables such as temperature, precipitation, and sunshine duration are aggregated over different seasonal time periods preceding the harvest to 45 potential input features per original variable. In a first step, this large set of features is reduced to those aggregates very probably holding explanatory power for observed yields. The second, computationally demanding step evaluates predictions for all districts with all of their possible combinations. Step three selects those combinations of weather features that showed the highest predictive power across districts. Finally, the district-specific best performing regressions among these are used for actual prediction, and the results are spatially aggregated. To evaluate the new approach, ABSOLUT v1.2 is applied to predict the yields of silage maize, winter wheat, and other major crops in Germany based on two decades of data from about 300 districts. It turned out to be absolutely crucial to not only make out-of-sample predictions (solely based on data excluding the target year to predict) but to also consequently separate training and testing years in the process of feature selection. Otherwise, the prediction accuracy would be over-estimated by far. The question arises whether performances claimed for other statistical modelling examples are often upward-biased through input variable selection disregarding the out-of-sample principle. © 2022, The Author(s).","Crop yield modelling; Machine learning; Multiple linear regression; Statistical inference; Weather-based yield prediction","crop; season; statistical model; weather; wheat; Crops, Agricultural; Linear Models; Seasons; Triticum; Weather",Article,Scopus

It plays an essential role in decision making at global, regional, and field levels. Soil, meteorological, environmental, and crop parameters are used to predict crop yield. A wide variety of decision support models are used to extract significant crop features for prediction. In precision agriculture, monitoring (sensing technologies), management information systems, variable rate technologies, and responses to inter- and intravariability in cropping systems are all important. The benefits of precision agriculture involve increasing crop yield and crop quality, while reducing the environmental impact. Simulations of crop yield help to understand the cumulative effects of water and nutrient deficiencies, pests, diseases, and other field conditions during the growing season. Farm and in situ observations (Internet of Things databases from sensors) together with existing databases provide the opportunity to both predict yields using “simpler” statistical methods or decision support systems that are already used as an extension, and also enable the potential use of artificial intelligence. In contrast, big data databases created using precision management tools and data collection capabilities are able to handle many parameters indefinitely in time and space, i.e., they can be used for the analysis of meteorology, technology, and soils, including characterizing different plant species. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; big data; crop models; data fusion; IoT; yield forecasting; yield influencing variables",,Editorial,Scopus

This study’s objective was to compare techniques to quantify the relationship between soil and topographic characteristics for predicting crop yield using high-resolution data and analytical techniques. The study was conducted on a multiple field dataset located in Southwestern Ontario, Canada, where few studies have assessed the impact of applications for precision agriculture and machine learning (ML) to the soil property-yield relationship in this region. The dataset included 145,500 observations of corn and soybean yield, topographic and soil nutrient characteristics. The attributes considered for this study included pH, soil organic matter (OM) content, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil test phosphorus, zinc (Zn), potassium (K), elevation and topographic wetness index. Multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural networks, decision trees and random forests were compared to identify methods able to relate soil properties and crop yields on a subfield scale (2 m). Random forests were the most successful at predicting yield with an R2 value of 0.85 for corn and 0.94 for soybeans. MLR was the least successful with an R2 of 0.40 for corn and 0.45 for soybeans. Cross-validation experiments showed that random forest models in most cases could predict low- and high-yield areas from fields excluded from training datasets, but this was not possible in all cases. Techniques tested the models and identified significant soil and topographic attributes when predicting yield, though the identification was subject to some uncertainty. These results suggest that ML techniques might be used to predict high yield areas of fields without existing yield maps, if those fields have similar relationships of soil properties to yield. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Phosphorus; Regression; Spatial cross-validation; Spatial data mining; Variable importance; Yield","cation exchange capacity; crop yield; data mining; data set; machine learning; model validation; potassium; precision agriculture; regression analysis; soil nutrient; soil organic matter; soybean; statistical analysis; training; Ontario [Canada]",Article,Scopus

This calls for open and timely intelligence on crop production on an agroclimatically meaningful territorial scale. We propose an operationally suitable method for large-scale in-season crop yield estimations from a satellite image time series (SITS) for statistical production. As an object-based method, it is spatially scalable from parcel to regional scale, making it useful for prediction tasks in which the reference data are available only at a coarser level, such as counties. We show that deep learning-based temporal convolutional network (TCN) outperforms the classical machine learning method random forests and produces more accurate results overall than published national crop forecasts. Our novel contribution is to show that mean-aggregated regional predictions with histogram-based features calculated from farm-level observations perform better than other tested approaches. In addition, TCN is robust to the presence of cloudy pixels, suggesting TCN can learn cloud masking from the data. The temporal compositing of information do not improve prediction performance. This indicates that with end-to-end learning less preprocessing in SITS tasks seems viable. © 2022 by the authors.","agriculture; crop production statistics; machine learning; object-based; remote sensing; time series; yield forecasts","Convolution; Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Deep learning; Food supply; Forecasting; Time series; Convolutional networks; Crop production; Crop production statistic; Crop yield; Machine-learning; Object based; Objects-based; Remote-sensing; Times series; Yield forecast; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

However, it is still challenging to identify the most critical features from a dataset. Although either feature selection (FS) or feature extraction (FX) techniques have been employed, no research compares their performances and, more importantly, the benefits of combining both methods. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework that uses non-feature reduction (All-F) as a baseline to investigate the performance of FS, FX, and a combination of both (FSX). The case study employs the vegetation condition index (VCI)/temperature condition index (TCI) to develop 21 rice yield forecasting models for eight sub-regions in Vietnam based on ML methods, namely linear, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (Tree), artificial neural network (ANN), and Ensemble. The results reveal that FSX takes full advantage of the FS and FX, leading FSX-based models to perform the best in 18 out of 21 models, while 2 (1) for FS-based (FX-based) models. These FXS-, FS-, and FX-based models improve All-F-based models at an average level of 21% and up to 60% in terms of RMSE. Furthermore, 21 of the best models are developed based on Ensemble (13 models), Tree (6 models), linear (1 model), and ANN (1 model). These findings highlight the significant role of FS, FX, and specially FSX coupled with a wide range of ML algorithms (especially Ensemble) for enhancing the accuracy of predicting crop yield. © 2022 by the authors.","crop yield; feature extraction; feature selection; machine learning; TCI; VCI","Crops; Decision trees; Extraction; Forecasting; Learning systems; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Condition index; Crop yield; Features extraction; Features selection; Forecasting models; Machine-learning; Performance; Temperature condition index; Temperature conditions; Vegetation condition indices; Feature Selection",Article,Scopus

To improve the winter wheat yield prediction accuracy at the regional scale, we developed a data assimilation scheme that assimilated the MODIS leaf area index (LAI) into the WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) model. The meteorological data of the WOFOST model include current weather data, 15-day THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) forecast dataset and weather forecast data generated by TIGGE forecast and historical meteorological data (1979–2008) using the vectorial angle method. The WOFOST model was calibrated within 10 subregions of Hebei province based on field measured winter wheat growth data from each corresponding agrometeorological station to account for the spatial variability of crop and soil parameters to some extent, and the Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filtered MODIS LAI was then assimilated into the WOFOST model for regional winter wheat yield forecasting. We constructed a four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVar) cost function to account for the observations and model errors from Feb. 10th to Apr. 30th, and the Shuffled Complex Evolution-University of Arizona (SCE-UA) algorithm was used to minimize the cost function by reinitializing three WOFOST parameters. The winter wheat yield forecasting date was started from Apr. 30th, and the results showed that assimilating MODIS LAI into the WOFOST model substantially improved the accuracy of regional wheat yield predictions (R = 0.60, CCC = 0.53, RMSE = 619.73 kg/ha) compared with the unassimilated results (R = 0.35, CCC = 0.24, RMSE = 857.32 kg/ha), and the relative error (RE) between the averaged predicted yield and official statistics for most cities decreased after data assimilation. This demonstrated that assimilating MODIS LAI can optimize the simulation of LAI in the WOFOST model, thereby further reduce the uncertainty of yield forecasting.

As a result, farmers rely on accurate weather forecasts to run their businesses. Agriculture is interwoven with other industries, including the sugar industry, which relies on sugarcane farmers. They may be able to better organise their logistics by employing machine learning or artificial intelligence to estimate agricultural production. As a result, both AI and connected IoT devices have a lot of potential in agriculture. When estimating agricultural yields, there are various elements to consider. Weather trends, satellite images, soil quality, and the potential of an infestation are all investigated in this location. When all of these criteria are taken into account, a complete picture of when crops should be planted emerges. In the event that unanticipated problems develop, there are also 'what-if' scenarios and backup plans in place. Climate change can affect agricultural production in a variety of ways, including changes in average temperatures, precipitation amounts, heat waves, CO2 levels in the air, and ozone levels at ground level. Climate change has a wide range of affects from country to country. Lower-elevation countries are more prone to have difficulties producing crops. Equipment capable of accurately predicting the evolution of weather patterns is required Weather forecasts based on statistics look at previous data to see if there are any patterns between seasons. As a result, the winter data can be used to forecast summer temperatures. Winter temperatures will almost probably alter if summer temperatures change. In the published literature, researchers have detailed their confirmed solutions to various problems. If prior concepts are used without first receiving a qualified review, future researchers will not get the desired results. If the researchers don't first undertake a thorough investigation of the most recent indications of performance, it's likely that they won't be able to find evidence of future growth in the direction of excellence.

This study aims to develop a crop yield forecasting model at large spatial scales using meteorological variables closely related to crop growth. The influence of climate patterns on agricultural productivity can be spatially inhomogeneous due to local soil and environmental conditions. We propose a Bayesian spatially varying functional model (BSVFM) to predict county-level corn yield for five Midwestern states, based on annual precipitation and daily maximum and minimum temperature trajectories modeled as multivariate functional predictors. The proposed model accommodates spatial correlation and measurement errors of functional predictors, and respects the spatially heterogeneous relationship between the response and associated predictors by allowing the functional coefficients to vary over space. The model also incorporates a Bayesian variable selection device to further expand its capacity to accommodate spatial heterogeneity. The proposed method is demonstrated to outperform other highly competitive methods in corn yield prediction, owing to the flexibility of allowing spatial heterogeneity with spatially varying coefficients in our model.

The model consists of two branches for robust feature learning: one for sequential data (remote sensing and weather series data) and the other for statical data (soil properties). The extracted features by both branches were aggregated through an adaptive fusion model to forecast the final wheat yield. We trained and tested the model by using official county-level statistics of historical winter wheat yields. The model achieved an average R2 of 0.79 and a root-mean-square error of 650.21 kg/ha, superior to the compared methods and outperforming traditional machine-learning methods. The dual-stream deep-learning neural network model provided decent in-season yield prediction, with an error of about 13% compared to official statistics about two months before harvest. By effectively extracting and aggregating features from multi-source datasets, the new approach provides a practical approach to predicting winter wheat yields at the county scale over large spatial regions. © 2022 by the authors.","crop yield prediction; deep learning; remote sensing; soil data; weather data; winter wheat","Crops; Deep learning; Error statistics; Food supply; Large dataset; Learning systems; Mean square error; Remote sensing; Soils; Weather forecasting; Crop yield; Crop yield prediction; Deep learning; Learning neural networks; Neural network model; Remote-sensing; Soil data; Weather data; Winter wheat; Yield prediction; Neural network models",Article,Scopus

While typical AI research expects experimental datasets and consumes a lot of time, this research investigates how such a system can deliver the required capabilities. There are three key factors, price, cost and yields of crops to be analyzed, in order to make it simple but meaningful to farmers. We found that artificial neural network with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest (RF) models could effectively predict yield, cost, and price of crops. Adjusting parameters such as learning rate and the number of hidden nodes affect the accuracy of crop yield predictions. Smaller data sets required fewer hidden layers in model optimization. MLP models consistently produced more accurate yield predictions than RF models. MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) is used to measure both RF and MLP. It is found that MLP models produce accurate predictions. Similarly, RF is used to provide suggestions when time constraints are tight.

Timely, accurate, and reliable rice yield prediction in India is crucial for global food security and health issues. Deep learning models have achieved excellent performances in predicting crop yield. However, the interpretation of deep learning models is still rare. In this study, we proposed a transformer-based model, Informer, to predict rice yield across the Indian Indo-Gangetic Plains by integrating time-series satellite data, environmental variables, and rice yield records from 2001 to 2016. The results showed that Informer had better performance (R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 0.41 t/ha) than four other machine learning and deep learning models for end-of-season prediction. For within-season prediction, the Informer model could achieve stable performances (R2 ≈ 0.78) after late September, which indicated that the optimal prediction could be achieved 2 months before rice maturity. In addition, we interpreted the prediction models by evaluating the input feature importance and analyzing hidden features. The evaluation of feature importance indicated that NIRV was the most critical factor, while intervals 6 (mid-August) and 12 (mid-November) were the key periods for rice yield prediction. The hidden feature analysis demonstrated that the attention-based long short-term memory (AtLSTM) model accumulated the information of each growth period, while the Informer model focused on the information around intervals 5 to 6 (August) and 11 to 12 (November).

While yield prediction with remote sensing has been a research aim for years, it is only recently that observations with the suited spatial and temporal resolutions have become accessible to improve crop yield predictions. Here we developed a yield prediction framework that integrates daily high-resolution (3 m) CubeSat imagery into the APSIM crop model. The approach trains a regression model that correlates simulated yield to simulated leaf area index (LAI) from APSIM. That relationship is then employed to determine the optimum date at which the regression best predicts yield from the LAI. Additionally, our approach can forecast crop yield by utilizing a particle filter to assimilate CubeSat-based LAI in the model APSIM to generate yield maps at 3 m several weeks before the optimum regression date. Our method was evaluated for a rainfed site located in the US Corn belt, using a collection of spatially varying yield data. The proposed approach does not need in situ data to rain the regression, with outcomes reporting that even with a single assimilation step, accurate yield predictions were provided up to 21 days before the optimum regression date. The spatial variability of crop yield was reproduced fairly well, with a good correlation against in situ measurements (R2 Combining double low line 0.73 and RMSE Combining double low line 1.69), demonstrating that high-resolution yield predictions early in the season have great potential to meet and improve upon digital agricultural goals. © Authors 2022","APSIM; Crop modeling; Crop yield prediction; CubeSat; LAI; Particle filter","Crops; Cultivation; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; APSIM; Crop modeling; Crop yield; Crop yield prediction; Cubesat; Field crops; High resolution; Leaf Area Index; Particle filter; Yield prediction; Monte Carlo methods",Conference Paper,Scopus

Crop yield prediction is an essential issue in agriculture. Crop yield analysis can be done by using machine learning techniques. Any person in the agriculture field will expect the yield that he is about to get. The things that need to consider for crop yield prediction include analyzing various parameters like pH value to determine soil fertility, location, etc. The number of nutrients is phosphorous (P), nitrogen (N), etc. The soil type, nutrients present in the soil, rainfall, soil composition, and all these things are considered, and all the data mentioned is analyzed. The data is trained by using suitable techniques and creating a model by using machine learning. The proposed system has the best accuracy in crop yield prediction, which shows precise results. The system provides suitable recommendations for the end user about the fertilizers that are fit for good crop yield depending upon the soil’s climate and parameters. This benefits the farmer by increasing and support vector machine (SVM). The support vector machine is a supervised machine learning technique that is used to analyze the data and predict the crop yield in our system. XGBoost algorithm is a machine learning method that refers to “extreme Gradient Boosting.” It tunes the data and gives accurate, efficient, and scalable results.

Previously, several machine learning methods have been applied to predict crop yield using different types of variables. In this study, we propose using the Geographically Weighted Random Forest Regression (GWRFR) approach to improve crop yield prediction at the county level in the US Corn Belt. We trained the GWRFR and five other popular machine learning algorithms (Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression (DTR), and Random Forest Regression (RFR)) with the following different sets of features: (1) full length features; (2) vegetation indices; (3) gross primary production (GPP); (4) climate data; and (5) soil data. We compared the results of the GWRFR with those of the other five models. The results show that the GWRFR with full length features (R2 = 0.90 and RMSE = 0.764 MT/ha) outperforms other machine learning algorithms. For individual categories of features such as GPP, vegetation indices, climate, and soil features, the GWRFR also outperforms other models. The Moran’s I value of the residuals generated by GWRFR is smaller than that of other models, which shows that GWRFR can better address the spatial non-stationarity issue. The proposed method in this article can also be potentially used to improve yield prediction for other types of crops in other regions. © 2022 by the authors.

However, yield estimates in Ethiopia are based on time-consuming surveys. We used Sentinel-2, spectroradiometeric, and ground-truthing data to estimate the grain yield (GY) of two major crops, teff, and finger millet, in Ethiopia's Aba Gerima catchment in 2020 and 2021. At the flowering stage, we performed supervised classification on October Sentinel-2 images and spectral reflectance measurement. We used regression models to identify and predict crop yields, as evaluated by the coefficient of determination (adjusted R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) provided the best fit to the data among the vegetation indices used to predict teff and finger millet GY. Soil bund construction increased the majority of vegetation indices and GY of both crops. We discovered a strong correlation between GY and the satellite EVI and NDVI. However, NDVI and EVI had the greatest influence on teff GY (adjusted R2 = 0.83; RMSE = 0.14 ton/ha), while NDVI had the greatest influence on finger millet GY (adjusted R2 = 0.85; RMSE = 0.24 ton/ha). Teff GY ranged from 0.64 to 2.16 ton/ha for bunded plots and 0.60 to 1.85 ton/ha for non-bunded plots using Sentinel-2 data. Besides, finger millet GY ranged from 1.92 to 2.57 ton/ha for bunded plots and 1.81 to 2.38 ton/ha for non-bunded plots using spectroradiometric data. Our findings show that Sentinel-2- and spectroradiometeric-based monitoring can help farmers manage teff and finger millet to achieve higher yields, more sustainable food production, and better environmental quality in the area. The study's findings revealed a link between VIs and soil management practices in soil ecological systems.

Remotely sensed products, such as the spectral vegetation index (VI), are widely used in estimation of crop yields. The integration of remotely sensed data into machine learning methods will have the potential to develop a real-time management system specific to the area of interest. The main aim of the study was to determine the eggplant yield in field conditions, based on VIs obtained from a handheld spectroradiometer, using five different machine learning methods (artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVR), k nearest neighbor (kNN), random forests (RF), and Adaptive boosting (AB)), and compare the performances of the methods. The data used in the study were obtained in field experiments focusing on determining the most suitable irrigation program for eggplant production in a semi-humid climate region in northern Turkey during 2015, 2016 and 2017 growing seasons. Irrigation treatments consisted of a total of five applications, which were full water application (I1:100 %) and different deficit ration of full water application (I2:I1x 75 %, I3: I1x50%, I4:I1x25% and I5: rainfed based). Input variables used in yield estimation models were determined by correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA). The inputs in the models were different combinations of 10 different VIs, the number of days after planting (DAP) and water application coefficients. In addition, an alternative approach was proposed, in which PCA components were used as input for yield estimation. All machine learning models using PCA-based inputs were estimated with higher accuracy than other input combinations. The best results were obtained with the ANN model based on PCA-based inputs; therefore, this model was chosen for eggplant yield estimation (coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.973, mean absolute error (MAE) = 274.816 kg ha−1, root mean square error (RMSE) = 352.787 kg ha−1 and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0.951). The lowest accuracy for yield estimation was recorded in RF model. The prediction accuracy of the models using a single VI as input was low. Green index (GI) and green vegetation index (GVI) had the highest impact on eggplant yield, and eggplant yield was estimated with higher accuracy with these indices, which are sensitive to chlorophyll absorption.

The primary objective of this study was to reduce reliance on satellite images and improve early prediction of sugarcane yield at row level by using high-resolution multispectral Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery. To our knowledge, no previous study has evaluated the performance of multispectral UAV-derived vegetation indices in sugarcane crops at the crop row level. In this study, we used UAV mapping on 48 rows of sugarcane at three main growth stages (early, middle, and mature) over three growing seasons. A secondary objective was to predict future sugarcane yields at the earliest possible stage of growth. The results showed that the optimal growth stage for all 23 VIs varied, but the middle stage, from mid-March to early May, was the most prevalent. Further detailed analysis in the middle stage revealed that March was the best month for predicting future sugarcane yields when compared to April and May. This result is approximately a month earlier than previous studies in the same region. Following two stages of feature selection, such as Pearson correlation analysis and stepwise feature selection, a novel cross-validation methodology based on a generalized linear model trained and tested the yield prediction models on various combinations of the VIs. This novel methodology improves model accuracy by avoiding overfitting and over complexity caused by interdependent VIs, and then validates the model generality using previously unseen data. The best performance was achieved by combining the Normalized Difference RedEdge (NDRE) and the Green–Red Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GRNDVI) at March.

While the remote sensing of within-field insights has been a research goal for many years, it is only recently that observations with the required spatio-temporal resolutions, together with efficient assimilation methods to integrate these into modeling frameworks, have become available to advance yield prediction efforts. Here we explore a yield prediction approach that combines daily high-resolution CubeSat imagery with the APSIM crop model. The approach employs APSIM to train a linear regression that relates simulated yield to simulated leaf area index (LAI). That relationship is then used to identify the optimal regression date at which the LAI provides the best prediction of yield: in this case, approximately 14 weeks prior to harvest. Instead of applying the regression on satellite imagery that is coincident, or closest to, the regression date, our method implements a particle filter that integrates CubeSat-based LAI into APSIM to provide end-of-season high-resolution (3 m) yield maps weeks before the optimal regression date. The approach is demonstrated on a rainfed maize field located in Nebraska, USA, where suitable collections of both imagery and in-situ data were available for assessment. The procedure does not require in-field data to calibrate the regression model, with results showing that even with a single assimilation step, it is possible to provide yield estimates with good accuracy up to 21 days before the optimal regression date. Yield spatial variability was reproduced reasonably well, with a strong correlation to independently collected measurements (R2 = 0.73 and rRMSE = 12%). When the field averaged yield was compared, our approach reduced yield prediction error from 1 Mg/ha (control case based on a calibrated APSIM model), to 0.5 Mg/ha (using satellite imagery alone), and then to 0.2 Mg/ha (results with assimilation up to three weeks prior to the optimal regression date). Such a capacity to provide spatially explicit yield predictions early in the season has considerable potential to enhance digital agricultural goals and improve end-of-season yield predictions. © 2021 The Author(s)","APSIM; Crop modeling; Crop yield prediction; CubeSat; Data assimilation; LAI","crop yield; leaf area index; maize; prediction; satellite imagery; yield response; Nebraska; United States",Article,Scopus

Three combination of predictors (climate data, vegetation data or a combination of both) are used to compare the respective contribution of statistical methods and inputs in the predictive skill. Our results showed that the combination of climate and vegetation with the machine learning methods gives the best performance. The best prediction skill is obtained for peanut yield likely due to its high sensitivity to interannual climate variability.

Many agricultural crops in India have been impacted by climate change. As a country's population grows, its reliance on agriculture grows, and the country's economic process suffers as a result. In this situation, crop yields have a significant impact on the country's economic progress. There were insufficient food grains to feed the populace. Despite the existence of numerous methodologies or procedures for estimating agricultural production, their accuracy is not up to par. According to the literature review, there are no acceptable remedies or technologies to address the aforementioned condition. This method represented a push toward over-mechanization of agriculture. Agriculturists were encouraged and supported to engage in technology-based farming. This initiative attempts to assist farmers in forecasting future harvests and properly managing their costs by taking into account variables such as temperature, rainfall, and land acreage. To forecast the crop output of a certain agriculture region depending on the quantity of rainfall, the proposed method employs machine learning techniques and multilayer Perceptron.

There are so many methods existing in the literature to facilitate an effective prediction in agricultural applications. Hence, this survey analyzes the existing research concentrating on prediction problems associated with IoT agricultural applications, bringing into light various shortcomings of existing methodologies for prediction problems associated with IoT-agricultural applications. Here, analysis of various methods is facilitated based on several factors, such as performance metrics, year of publication and journals, achievements of the techniques in numerical evaluations, and so on. On the other hand, an analysis of the methods concerningthe merits and demerits of the methods are presented. Lastly, the paper discusses potential future research directions and challenges in achieving better prediction accuracy in s mart agricultural applications. © 2022 IEEE.","Agriculture; crop yield prediction; deep learning; IoT; Machine learning; plant disease prediction","Agricultural technology; Crops; Deep learning; Internet of things; Learning systems; Numerical methods; Sensor nodes; Crop plants; Crop yield; Crop yield prediction; Deep learning; Large-scale network; Machine-learning; Plant disease; Plant disease prediction; Prediction problem; Yield prediction; Forecasting",Conference Paper,Scopus

Advanced development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) based systems redesigned “smart agriculture”. This emergence in innovative farming systems gradually increases crop yields, reduces irrigation wastages and making it more profitable. Machine learning (ML) methods achieve the requirement of scaling the learning performance of the model. This paper introduces a hybrid ML model with IoT for yield prediction. This work involves three phases: pre-processing, feature selection (FS) and classification. Initially, the dataset is pre-processed and FS is done on the basis of Correlation based FS (CBFS) and the Variance Inflation Factor algorithm (VIF). Finally, a two-tier ML model for an IoT based smart agriculture system is proposed. In the first tier, the Adaptive k-Nearest Centroid Neighbour Classifier (aKNCN) model is proposed to estimate the soil quality and to classify the soil samples into different classes based on the input soil properties. In the second tier, the crop yield is predicted using the Extreme Learning Machine algorithm (ELM). In the optimized strategy, the weights are updated using a modified Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (mBOA) to improve the performance accuracy of ELM with minimum error values. PYTHON is the implementation tool for evaluating the proposed system. Soil dataset is utilized for performance evaluation of the proposed prediction model. Various metrics such as accuracy, RMSE, R2, MSE, MedAE, MAE, MSLE, MAPE and Explained Variance Score (EVS) are considered for the performance evaluation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Agriculture; Classification; Crop yield prediction; IoT; Machine learning; Sensors","Crops; Forecasting; Internet of things; Nearest neighbor search; Soils; Agriculture systems; Classification prediction; Crop yield; Crop yield prediction; Features selection; Machine algorithm; Machine learning models; Performances evaluation; Smart agricultures; Yield prediction; Machine learning",Article,Scopus

In this study, we propose a methodology for the early prediction of rice yield at pixel scale combining a crop model and a deep learning model for different agricultural systems throughout South and North Korea. Initially, satellite-integrated crop models were applied to obtain a pixel-scale reference rice yield. Then, the pixel-scale reference rice yields were used as target labels in the deep learning model to leverage the advantages of crop models. Models of five different deep learning network architectures were employed to help determine the hybrid structure of long-short term memory (LSTM) and one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) layers by predicting the optimal model about two months ahead of harvest time. The suggested model showed good performance [R2 = 0.859, Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency = 0.858, root mean squared error = 0.605 Mg ha−1], with specific spatial patterns of rice yields for South and North Korea. Analysis of the relative importance of the input variables showed the water-related index and maximum temperature in North Korea and the vegetation indices and geographic variables in South Korea to be crucial for predicting rice yields.

Adverse weather drastically reduces the mustard yield. Weather variables affect the crop differently during different stages of development. Weather influence on crop yield depends not only on the magnitude of weather variables but also on weather distribution pattern over the crop growing period. Hence, developing models using weather variables for accurate and timely crop yield prediction is foremost important for crop management and planning decisions regarding storage, import, export, etc. Machine learning plays a significant role as it has a decision support tool for crop yield prediction. The models for mustard yield prediction was developed using long-term weather data during the crop growing period along with mustard yield data. Techniques used for developing the model were variable selection using stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) and artificial neural network (SMLR-ANN), variable selection using SMLR and support vector machine (SMLR-SVM), variable selection using SMLR and random forest (SMLR-RF), variable extraction using principal component analysis (PCA) and ANN (PCA-ANN), variable extraction using PCA and SVM (PCA-SVM), and variable extraction using PCA and RF (PCA-RF). Optimal combinations of the developed models were done for improving the accuracy of mustard yield prediction. Results showed that, on the basis of model accuracy parameters nRMSE, RMSE, and RPD, the PCA-SVM model performed best among all the six models developed for mustard yield prediction of study areas.

One of the most popular deep learning methods, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), yield better performances for classification problems than other general machine learning techniques. It is necessarily to verify the effectiveness of CNN for crop yield prediction. To do this, UAV-based multispectral imagery was acquired in four growth stages, including the heading, milk, dough, and ripening stages of winter wheat. The effects of growth stage on yield prediction accuracy were assessed. Furthermore, the effects of the combination of different growth stages on accuracy were assessed using multi-temporal CNN model. The prediction accuracies of CNN models were compared with linear regression models based on a typical vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2), as a conventional regression algorithm. The CNN model of the heading stage showed the lowest RMSE (0.94 t ha−1) among the four growth stages and outperformed the best linear regression model (RMSE of 1.00 t ha−1). The prediction accuracies of the multi-temporal CNN, and multiple linear regression models based on EVI2 were less than that of the CNN model of the heading stage. These results suggested that the CNN had the potential to improve the accuracy of yield prediction, and the heading stage was suitable data acquisition time for winter wheat in this study. In addition, the combination of growth stage may not improve the accuracy.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide a fast and convenient approach to crop yield prediction, but most existing crop yield models have rarely been tested across different years, cultivars and sensors. This has limited the ability of these yield models to be transferred to other years or regions or to be potentially used with data from other sensors. In this study, UAV-based multispectral imagery was used to predict rice grain yield at the booting and filling stages from four field experiments, involving three years, two rice cultivars, and two UAV sensors. Reflectance and texture features were extracted from the UAV imagery, and vegetation indices (VIs) and normalized difference texture indices (NDTIs) were computed. The models were independently validated to test the stability and transferability across years, rice cultivars, and sensors. The results showed that the red edge normalized difference texture index (RENDTI) was superior to other texture indices and vegetation indices for model regression with grain yield in most cases. However, the green normalized difference texture index (GNDTI) achieved the highest prediction accuracy in model validation across rice cultivars and sensors. The yield prediction model of Japonica rice achieved stronger transferability to Indica rice with root mean square error (RMSE), bias, and relative RMSE (RRMSE) of 1.16 t/ha, 0.08, and 11.04%, respectively. Model transferability was improved significantly between different sensors after band correction with a decrease of 15.05–59.99% in RRMSE. Random forest (RF) was found to be a good solution to improve the model transferability across different years and cultivars and obtained the highest prediction accuracy with RMSE, bias, and RRMSE of 0.94 t/ha, −0.21, and 9.37%, respectively.

Crop recommendation for a specific region is a tedious process as it can be affected by various variables such as soil type and climatic parameters. At the same time, crop yield prediction was based on several features like area, irrigation type, temperature, etc. The recent advancements of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models pave the way to design effective crop recommendation and crop prediction models. In this view, this paper presents a novel Multimodal Machine Learning Based Crop Recommendation and Yield Prediction (MMML-CRYP) technique.

Here we develop crop yield prediction models, based on a large volume of historical crop data, as well as climate and pollution records in China since 1980. A long-term surface ozone concentration data set is developed from a machine-learning model and various observations. An assessment of four climate and pollution factors reveals the critical role of particulate and ozone pollution in regulating interannual variations of crop yields in China. During 2010–2018, we find that the particulate pollution mitigation outweighs the negative impacts of concurrent climate change, resulting in 0.5%–1.9% net yield increases nationwide, despite of the ozone increases in the North China Plain. Looking to the future, the impacts of climate change, particularly from surface temperature increase, will dominate over pollution factors and profoundly reduce future maize and rice yields by 0.6 to 2.8% 10 yr−1 by 2050.

Wheat is one of the most wildly cultivated crops. Intelligent wheat ear monitoring is essential for crop management and crop yield prediction. Although a variety of methods are utilized to detect or count wheat ears, there are still some challenges both from the data acquisition process and the wheat itself. In this study, a computer vision methodology based on YOLOv4 to detect wheat ears is proposed. A large receptive field allows viewing objects globally and increases the connections between the image points and the final activation. Specifically, in order to enhance the receptive field, additional Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) blocks are added to YOLOv4 at the feature fusion section to extract multi-scale features. Pictures of wheat ears taken at different growth stages from two different datasets are used to train the model. The performance of the proposed methodology was evaluated using various metrics. The Average Precision (AP) was 95.16% and 97.96% for the two datasets, respectively. By fitting the detected wheat ear numbers and true wheat ear numbers, the R2 value was 0.973.

The standard WMA models the linguistic information using type-1 (T1) fuzzy sets (FSs), which have a reduced capability to model the semantics of linguistic information. Therefore, we propose a novel Enhanced WMA, which models the linguistic information using the type-2 (T2) FSs. Further, our Enhanced T2 FS-based WMA can be modified to reflect the use of interval type-2 (IT2) FSs, for modelling linguistic uncertainty. IT2 FSs are suitable when better uncertainty handling capabilities are required compared to T1 FSs, however, at a computational cost lesser than the T2 FSs. Performance of Enhanced WMA is demonstrated through a real-world crop-yield prediction problem in smart agriculture and an additional exemplar application on users’ satisfaction ratings. Further, we have compared our approach with the performance obtained from the T1 FS-based WMA and the original estimations given in the original data. We found that our Enhanced WMA provides more precise estimates than the other two with 95% confidence level.

Increasing local production is important to reduce our dependence on imported food and provide a buffer in case of supply disruptions such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. To increase food security, it is important to optimize agricultural yields, despite the high costs associated with factors such as supplemental feeding, pest control measures, or operating costs.

Here, the trends caused by the influence of technological improvements were considered. Regression models for the wheat and barley crop yield predictions have been developed.

Mapping of crop area is challenging in smallholder farming like India, where crop parcels are smaller than two hectares. With an extension of artificial intelligence, an artificial neural network has ability to learn the spectral feature of multispectral satellite images and map them to a land cover class. However, mixed pixel is a challenging problem in pixel wise classification of coarse resolution satellite images. The linear mixture model is successfully utilized to unmix the signals of a mixed classes. The success of linear mixture model is depending on the selection of endmembers of a mixed class. Therefore, this paper presents an adaptive approach for automatic selection of endmembers of a mixed pixel in linear mixture model using spectral and spatial information. The proposed approach is capable of extracting the fraction area cover of each class by using a constrained least-squares error solution. The GPS field surveys, and drone images are employed to create reference data for the accuracy assessment of proposed algorithm. The experimentation results indicate that the solution of the proposed approach outperformed recent baseline methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy of pixelwise estimated area and overall estimated area of various land cover classes. © 2013 IEEE.","area estimation; artificial neural network; linear mixture model; mixed pixels; precision agriculture monitoring; Smallholder farming","Agricultural robots; Drones; Farms; Food supply; Neural networks; Pixels; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Satellites; Agriculture monitoring; Area estimation; Land cover; Linear mixture models; Mixed pixel; Mixture modeling; Precision Agriculture; Precision agriculture monitoring; Smallholder farming; Spatial informations; Crops",Article,Scopus

With the advancement in the sub-domain of machine learning i.e., deep learning, multiple problems are minutely solved in agricultural sector. This paper focuses on recommending 22 types of crops with the aid of correlation analysis, distribution analysis, ensembling, and majority voting. A three-tiered framework is proposed in order to implement the crop recommendation problem. It includes data preprocessing, classification, and performance evaluation modules. The feature analysis is done through correlation plots and density distribution followed by classification using ensembling techniques. Finally, performance evaluation is performed using majority voting technique. This article further uses ensembling with base learners i.e., decision trees, random forest, Naïve Bayes, and support vector machines using majority voting. Further, majority voting is used to decide the final performance metrics. The practical visualization of the correlation plot, density-histogram distribution plots, confusion matrices, and performance plot are presented. The accuracy achieved post implementation is 99.54 by using Naïve Bayes classifier. The majority voting ensembler has not shown much accuracy i.e., 98.52.

From the perspective of remote sensing and modelling, field parcels are challenging as objects of interest due to highly varying shape and size but relatively uniform pixel content and texture. To model such areas we need representations that can be reliably estimated already for small parcels and that are invariant to the size of the parcel. We propose representing the parcels using density estimates of remote imaging pixels and provide a computational pipeline that combines the representation with arbitrary supervised learning algorithms, while allowing easy integration of multiple imaging sources. We demonstrate the method in the task of the automatic monitoring of autumn tillage method and vegetation cover of Finnish crop fields, based on the integrated analysis of intensity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarity bands of the Sentinel-1 satellite and spectral indices calculated from Sentinel-2 multispectral image data. We use a collection of 127,757 field parcels monitored in April 2018 and annotated to six tillage method and vegetation cover classes, reaching 70% classification accuracy for test parcels when using both SAR and multispectral data.

Most of the variation in yield is attributed to environmental factors such as climate conditions, soil type and cultivation practices. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and random forest regression (RFR) are machine learning tools that are used unambiguously for crop yield prediction. There is limited research regarding the application of these mathematical models for the prediction of rapeseed yield and quality. A four-year study (2015–2018) was carried out in the Republic of Serbia with 40 winter rapeseed genotypes. The field trial was designed as a randomized complete block design in three replications. ANN, based on the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno iterative algorithm, and RFR models were used for prediction of seed yield, oil and protein yield, oil and protein content, and 1000 seed weight, based on the year of production and genotype. The best production year for rapeseed cultivation was 2016, when the highest seed and oil yield were achieved, 2994 kg/ha and 1402 kg/ha, respectively. The RFR model showed better prediction capabilities compared to the ANN model (the r2 values for prediction of output variables were 0.944, 0.935, 0.912, 0.886, 0.936 and 0.900, for oil and protein content, seed yield, 1000 seed weight, oil and protein yield, respectively). © 2021 by the authors.

Combining high-performance computing with innovative technologies of big data processing, machine learning (ML) advances data-intensive science and provides an important supporting frame for crop yield prediction. This paper evaluated the performance of five ML algorithms, including linear regression (LR), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), ensemble learning (EL), and Gaussian process regression (GPR), for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield and dry matter prediction using data collected from previous studies conducted within the last twenty years in the North China Plain (NCP). In addition, winter wheat yield and dry matter were explored using the best algorithm, while polynomial functions were proposed that could describe the relationship of water and nitrogen application with winter wheat yield and dry matter. Results confirmed that the GPR model outperformed all other models for predicting the yield (R2 = 0.87) and dry matter (R2 = 0.86) of winter wheat. The prediction errors of the GPR model for maximum yield and dry matter of winter wheat were 5.8 % and 1.1 %, respectively.

Wheat, maize, and rice are major crops contributing to global food security. The impact of climate change on crop yield with different models and techniques has been projected; this article reviewed the worldwide impact of climate change on future wheat, rice, and maize production. Wheat and maize crop yields may increase due to climate change in colder regions and may decrease in the countries near the equator. The increase in carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere may help wheat and maize crops regarding increased carbon intake in colder regions. The rice crop yield may decrease in almost all major rice-producing countries due to water scarcity, which can be amplified due to climate change. The impact of climate change on crop yield prediction involves uncertainties due to different crop models, global circulation models, and bias correction techniques. It is recommended to use multiple climatic models and more than one bias correction technique for better climatic projections. Adaptation measures could help to reduce the adverse impacts of future climate on agriculture. Shifting the planting calendar, irrigation and nutrient management, improving crop varieties, and expanding the agricultural areas are suggested as the most effective adaptation actions in response to climate change.

Weeds are accountable for 45% of the agriculture sector’s crop losses, which primarily occur because of competition with crops. Accurate and rapid weed detection in agricultural fields was a difficult task because of the presence of a wide range of weed species at various densities and growth phases. Presently, several smart agriculture tasks, such as weed detection, plant disease detection, species identification, water and soil conservation, and crop yield prediction, can be realized by using technology. In this article, we propose a Modified Barnacles Mating Optimization with Deep Learning based weed detection (MBMODL-WD) technique. The MBMODL-WD technique aims to automatically identify the weeds in the agricultural field. Primarily, the presented MBMODL-WD technique uses the Gabor filtering (GF) technique for the noise removal process. For automated weed detection, the presented MBMODL-WD technique uses the DenseNet-121 model as feature extraction with the MBMO algorithm as hyperparameter optimization. The design of the MBMO algorithm involves the integration of self-population-based initialization with the standard BMO algorithm. At last, the Elman Neural Network (ENN) method was applied for the weed classification process. To demonstrate the enhanced performance of the MBMODL-WD approach, a series of simulation analyses were performed. A comprehensive set of simulations highlighted the enhanced performance of the presented MBMODL-WD methodology over other DL models with a maximum accuracy of 98.99%. © 2022 by the authors.","computer vision; crop productivity; deep learning; smart agriculture; weed management",,Article,Scopus

Remote sensing is an efficient technique for measuring growing season crop canopies and providing information on the spatial variability of crop yields. In this study, ten vegetation indices (VIs) derived from time series PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 images were used to investigate the potential to estimate corn grain yield with different regression methods. A field-scale spatial crop yield prediction model was developed and used to produce yield maps depicting spatial variability in the field. Results from this study clearly showed that high-resolution PlanetScope satellite data could be used to detect the corn yield variability at field level, which could explain 15% more variability than Sentinel-2A data at the same spatial resolution of 10 m. Comparison of the model performance and variable importance measure between models illustrated satisfactory results for assessing corn productivity with VIs. The green chlorophyll vegetation index (GCVI) values consistently produced the highest correlations with corn yield, accounting for 72% of the observed spatial variation in corn yield. More reliable quantitative yield estimation could be made using a multi-linear stepwise regression (MSR) method with multiple VIs. Good agreement between observed and predicted yield was achieved with the coefficient of determination value being 0.81 at 86 days after seeding. The results would help farmers and decision-makers generate predicted yield maps, identify crop yield variability, and make further crop management practices timely. © 2022 by the authors.","corn yield; multi-linear stepwise regression; PlanetScope; random forest regression; Sentinel-2; vegetation index",,Article,Scopus

With wheat being a primary and staple food crop in the Indian community, ensuring the country’s food security is crucial. In this paper, we study the prediction of wheat yield for India overall and the top wheat-producing states with a comparison. To accomplish this, we use Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) after extracting the main features by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) considering the parameters such as area under cultivation and production for the years 1962–2018. The performance is evaluated by error analyses such as RMSE, MAE, and R2 . The best-fitted MARS model is chosen using cross-validation and user-defined parameter optimization. We find that the MARS model is well suited to India as a whole and other top wheat-producing states. A comparative result is obtained on yield prediction between India overall and other states, wherein the state of Rajasthan has a better model than other major wheat-producing states.

In this context, appropriate prediction of crop yield helps in agricultural production planning. Given the inability of the traditional linear models to provide satisfactory prediction performance, there is a need to develop a crop yield prediction model that is simple in complexity, accurate in prediction, and less time-consuming during training and validation phases. Keeping these objectives in view, the present paper focuses on building an adaptive, low complexity, and accurate nonlinear model for the prediction of crop yield. A time series dataset for the period 1991–2012 of Karnataka, a southwestern state of India, is used for yield prediction. An empirical nonlinear relation between crop yield and the four independent attributes has been obtained from the proposed ANN model. The independent attributes employed are total rainfall, the cumulative distribution of temperature, the proportion of irrigated land, and the average amount of fertilizer used. It is demonstrated that the developed model exhibits better prediction accuracy, less root mean square error in the range of 0.07–0.14, less mean square error in the range of 0.01–0.04, and mean absolute error in the range of 0.07–0.15 compared to its corresponding linear regression model. It is recommended that the proposed ANN model can also be applied to predict other agricultural products of the same or other geographical regions of the globe. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Functional link artificial neural network; Karnataka; Panel regression; Yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

We simulated backscattered radiation from cranberry canopies using plane-wave illumination with frequency content from 300 to 2400 MHz. The computational canopy domains allowed for variable soil moisture and cranberry yield in terms of cranberry mass per 1 ft2 of canopy surface area. We collected experimental field data with a prototype open-ended waveguide sensor operating between 600 and 1300 MHz. We measured experimental microwave signals by placing our sensor directly on top of cranberry-crop bed canopies in central Wisconsin and recording reflection coefficients across the operating band. We implemented a machine learning approach to map the microwave reflection coefficients to yield. The mapping procedure involves dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis, supervised learning with linear discriminant analysis, and error-correcting output codes. The idealized computational results demonstrate the feasibility of discriminating three cranberry volume fractions that are representative of central Wisconsin field conditions, at frequencies below 2 GHz. Performance evaluations of the machine learning algorithm applied to the measured field data indicated that, in 81% of test cases, the predicted crop yield had less than 8% error. Most importantly, the average yield prediction error was less than 1.3%. These pilot study results provide strong evidence that machine learning enables accurate cranberry yield estimation when trained with in situ (field) microwave backscattered signals. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Agricultural sensing; cranberry yield estimation; machine learning; microwave sensing","Crops; Dimensionality reduction; Discriminant analysis; Electromagnetic wave backscattering; Errors; Learning systems; Microwave sensors; Microwaves; Reflection; Soil moisture; Turing machines; Waveguides; Backscattered radiation; Computational results; Error correcting output code; Linear discriminant analysis; Machine learning approaches; Open ended waveguides; Plane wave illumination; Variable soil moistures; Learning algorithms; crop yield; detection method; estimation method; field margin; field method; remote sensing; simulation; testing method; Vaccinium macrocarpon",Article,Scopus

The main expected expressions of climate change in Morocco include reduced rainfall, increased temperatures and intensification of extreme risks such as drought, heat waves, frost, floods, etc. Therefore, the development of methods for modeling and early prediction of crop yields in the Gharb plain, located in northwestern Morocco, is essential. Machine learning is a tool that can help make key decisions regarding crop yield prediction. The effects of climate change on the spread of autumn rainfed cereals (durum wheat, soft wheat and, barley), an important agro-food source in the Gharb plain, were assessed in this study. A multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN) and, random forest (RF) model based on the integration of drought indices derived from satellite imagery and reanalysis meteorological data. Model accuracies were calculated and compared. Correlation values suggested that yield decreases with decreasing crop and soil moisture in early spring and with higher thermal conditions near harvest. In general, all drought indices showed the best effect during the stages when yield is most photo-synthetically dynamic (spring), in contrast to the early stages of the vegetative cycle (autumn and winter). The strength of the statistical relationships found by the MLR, ANN, and RF methods were quite similar, with some improvements found by RF. A large number of true positives (hits) of yield loss occurrence with hit rate (HR) values above 90% was obtained. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cereal yield; Drought indices; Gharb plain; Machine learning; Modeling; Morocco",,Article,Scopus

Machine learning algorithms are capable of learning linear and nonlinear patterns in complex agro-meteorological data. However, the application of machine learning methods for predictive analysis is lacking in the oil palm industry. This work evaluated a supervised machine learning approach to develop an explainable and reusable oil palm yield prediction workflow. The input data included 12 weather and three soil moisture parameters along with 420 months of actual yield records of the study site. Multisource data and conventional machine learning techniques were coupled with an automated model selection process. The performance of two top regression models, namely Extra Tree and AdaBoost was evaluated using six statistical evaluation metrics. The prediction was followed by data preprocessing and feature selection. Selected regression models were compared with Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, and other non-tree algorithms to prove the R2 driven performance superiority of tree-based ensemble models. In addition, the learning process of the models was examined using model-based feature importance, learning curve, validation curve, residual analysis, and prediction error. Results indicated that rainfall frequency, root-zone soil moisture, and temperature could make a significant impact on oil palm yield. Most influential features that contributed to the prediction process are rainfall, cloud amount, number of rain days, wind speed, and root zone soil wetness. It is concluded that the means of machine learning have great potential for the application to predict oil palm yield using weather and soil moisture data. © 2022 by the authors.

However, LULCC detection and modelling is a complex, data-driven process in the remote sensing field due to the processing of massive historical and current data, real-time interaction of scenario data, and spatial environmental data. In this paper, we review principles and methods of LULCC modelling, using machine learning and beyond, such as traditional cellular automata (CA). Then, we examine the characteristics, capabilities, limitations, and perspectives of machine learning. Machine learning has not yet been dramatic in modelling LULCC, such as urbanization prediction and crop yield prediction because competition and transition between land cover types are dynamic at a local scale under varying natural drivers and human activities. Upcoming challenges of machine learning in modelling LULCC remain in the detection and prediction of LULC evolutionary processes if considering their applicability and feasibility, such as the spatio-temporal transition mechanisms to describe occurrence, transition, spreading, and spatial patterns of changes, availability of training data of all the change drivers, particularly sequence data, and identification and inclusion of local ecological, hydrological, and social-economic drivers in addressing the spectral feature change. This review points out the need for multidisciplinary research beyond image processing and pattern recognition of machine learning in accelerating and advancing studies of LULCC modelling. Despite this, we believe that machine learning has strong potentials to incorporate new exploratory variables in modelling LULCC through expanding remote sensing big data and advancing transient algorithms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial neural network; Cellular automata; Deep learning; LULC; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Self-organizing map","Agriculture; Cellular automata; Deep learning; Forecasting; Image processing; Land use; Natural resources management; Pattern recognition; Remote sensing; Self organizing maps; Agricultural production management; Cellular automatons; Current status; Deep learning; Environmental assessment; Environmental model; Land cover change modelling; Land use and land cover change; LULC; Remote-sensing; Conformal mapping; agricultural management; agricultural production; algorithm; artificial neural network; cellular automaton; computer simulation; crop yield; environmental assessment; environmental modeling; image processing; land cover; land use change; machine learning; natural resource; numerical model; remote sensing; resource management; urbanization; artificial neural network; big data; cellular automaton; competition; deep learning; feasibility study; harvest; human; human experiment; image processing; interdisciplinary research; land use; machine learning; pattern recognition; prediction; remote sensing; review; urbanization; agriculture; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; hydrology; machine learning; procedures; urbanization; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Hydrology; Machine Learning; Urbanization",Review,Scopus

Thus, researchers have focused on developing models for estimating soil quality based on artificial intelligence techniques for the processing of multidimensional data from agro-industrial systems, which provide useful information for farmers about soil management and crop conditions. However, a model for the application of these new technologies in medium and low-scale agricultural systems has not been identified. Therefore, a review of recent studies of crop yield prediction based on the estimation of chemical, physical, and biological soil quality indicators (SQI), which incorporate different machine learning (ML) techniques to process data from remote sensing (RS) systems, is presented. The advantages and disadvantages are also analyzed for: SQI estimates at regional and local scale, spectral bands used for analysis of plowed soils (bare soils) of cultivation plots, selection of minimun data set (MDS), use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite platforms, data pre-processing, and selection of ML algorithms for processing biological systems databases (agro-industrial systems). Finally, we present a model to help estimate soil quality in agricultural systems at a local scale, based on ML to process RS data, in the model the inputs to the ML unit come from four different class data sets (RS, SQI, environmental data and crop management data). Crop management uses the production of the ML unit to adjust agricultural management practices and therefore improve crop yield. © 2021","Agricultural systems; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Soil quality indicators","Antennas; Bioinformatics; Crops; Cultivation; Data handling; Indicators (chemical); Information management; Productivity; Remote sensing; Soils; Sustainable development; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Agricultural system; Crop managements; Crop yield; Data set; Industrial systems; Local scale; Remote sensing techniques; Remote-sensing; Soil quality indicators; Soils qualities; Machine learning; agricultural management; agricultural soil; artificial intelligence; crop yield; cultivation; intensive agriculture; machine learning; physicochemical property; remote sensing; soil management; soil quality",Review,Scopus

This zone includes the districts such as Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Trichy and Cuddalore. These districts account for about 53% of production of paddy in the state. Increasing the production of paddy in Cauvery Delta Zone would satisfy the requirement of rice in the state on the whole. This will also have a substantial influence on both the farmer's and the nation's economy. Forecasting the production of crops beforehand could assist the farmers in improving their productivity. This necessitates the design of a precise crop yield prediction model. Crop production in agriculture is primarily determined by a variety of factors that falls under three categories: technological (agricultural techniques, managerial decisions, etc.), biological (diseases, insects, pests, etc.), and environmental (climate change, etc.). Among these factors environmental factors pose a great challenge to the decision makers in developing a precise prediction model. Hence, it is proposed to develop a suitable yield prediction model to predict the yield of paddy in Cauvery delta region considering the environmental factors along with the supplied nutrients. The proposed prediction model makes use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm which is a popular deep learning algorithm, to forecast the yield of paddy.

The information on soil moisture content is required for irrigation scheduling, crop yield prediction, studies on weather and climate change, monitoring and forecasting extreme weather events like floods and drought, and estimation of runoff and soil erosion. The accurate and timely estimation and forecasting of soil moisture are necessary for these applications. Machine learning (ML) algorithms, like artificial neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees, random forest, and so on, are widely used for soil moisture assessment due to their ability to model nonlinear and complex relationships between variables. These algorithms are used to develop pedotransfer functions that can predict soil hydraulic properties, like available water capacity, hydraulic conductivity, soil water retention curve, and more. These algorithms are also used for the retrieval of soil moisture through remote sensing. By providing meteorological, vegetation, topographic, and historical input data about soil moisture variation, these ML algorithms can accurately forecast soil moisture after a few days. This information can be used for scheduling irrigation in the automated smart irrigation system. These algorithms are also extensively used for downscaling coarse resolution satellite-derived soil moisture products to finer spatial resolutions so that these products can be applied at the regional or watershed level. ML algorithms are contributing significantly to the progress of soil moisture research.

In this context, weather-based crop yield prediction will enable farmers, decision-makers, and administrators in dealing with hardships. The current study examines the application of the stepwise linear regression method, supervised machine learning algorithms (support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF)), shrinkage regression approaches (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) or elastic net (ENET)), and artificial neural network (ANN) model for pigeon pea yield prediction using long-term weather data. Among the approaches, ANN resulted in a higher coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.88–0.99), model efficiency (0.88–1.00) with subsequent lower normalised root mean square error (nRMSE) during calibration (1.13–12.55%), and validation (0.33–21.20%) over others. The temperature alone or its interaction with other weather parameters was identified as the most influencing variables in the study area. The Pearson correlation coefficients were also determined for the observed and predicted yield. Those values also showed ANN as the best model with correlation values ranging from 0.939 to 0.999 followed by RF (0.955–0.982) and LASSO (0.880–0.982).

As systems and data processing become more diversified, security issues arise. Security and privacy concerns are impeding the growth of the Internet of Things. This article establishes a framework for detecting and classifying intrusions into IoT networks used in agriculture. Security and privacy are major concerns not only in agriculture-related IoT networks but in all applications of the Internet of Things as well. In this framework, the NSL KDD data set is used as an input data set. In the preprocessing of the NSL-KDD data set, first all symbolic features are converted to numeric features. Feature extraction is performed using principal component analysis. Then, machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine, linear regression, and random forest are used to classify preprocessed data set. Performance comparisons of machine learning algorithms are evaluated on the basis of accuracy, precision, and recall parameters. © 2022 Abhishek Raghuvanshi et al.",,"Classification (of information); Crops; Decision trees; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Principal component analysis; Support vector machines; Water supply; Crop yield; Data set; Human supervision; Intrusion-Detection; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Risk mitigation; Security and privacy; Water use; Yield prediction; Irrigation",Article,Scopus

Although solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is more sensitive than traditional remotely sensed vegetation indices to photosynthetic capacity, the performance of SIF in wheat yield prediction should be further explored. In this study, five satellite variables (i.e., Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) SIF at 0.5° spatial resolution, global spatially contiguous SIF (CSIF) at 0.05° resolution, and three vegetation indices at 1 km resolution) from 2007 to 2018 were used to predict wheat yield using two linear regression methods (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO) and ridge regression (RIDGE)), three machine learning methods (support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)), and one deep learning method (long short-term memory (LSTM)) to predict wheat yield across the Indo-Gangetic Plains. The results showed that machine learning and deep learning methods outperformed the two linear regression methods in predicting wheat yield, while the LSTM did not perform better than SVR. The prediction using the high-resolution SIF product had better performance than that using the coarse-resolution SIF product among all years. Moreover, the high-resolution SIF had better performance than the three vegetation indices in yield prediction in 2010, which indicated that the SIF data had great superiority in predicting wheat yield under extreme weather events. Our findings highlight that developing high-quality SIF products in the future has the potential to improve crop yield predictions, and our method can predict wheat yield simply and effectively in cropping areas with limited data. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Deep learning; Machine learning; Prediction; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Wheat yield","Adaptive boosting; Chlorophyll; Decision trees; Fluorescence; Food supply; Long short-term memory; Random forests; Vegetation; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Deep learning; Learning methods; Linear regression methods; Performance; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Support vector regressions; Vegetation index; Wheat yield; Yield prediction; Forecasting; chlorophyll; crop yield; fluorescence; GOME; machine learning; prediction; wheat",Article,Scopus

Lodging also impedes intercultural management and harvest operations. Currently, no approaches known exist to non-invasively assess sugarcane lodging. This study is therefore focused on expedited and autonomous sugarcane lodging detection using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques. A total 1600 digital red-green-blue (RGB) images of lodged and non-lodged sugarcane were acquired for two cultivars and two years (2020, and 2021) of growing seasons. These images were augmented to obtain a total of 6400 images. Based on tested proportions for minimum model overfittings, 80 % of the 6400 images were used for training, 10 % for validation, and remaining 10 % for testing of seven state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) models; ResNet50, GoogLeNet, DarkNet53, Inception V3, Xception, AlexNet, and MobileNetV2. When validated, amongst all, ResNet50 demonstrated the highest lodging prediction accuracy of 98.5 %, followed by GoogLeNet (98.0 %), DarkNet53 (97.6 %), InceptionV3 (97.6 %), Xception (97.1 %), AlexNet (96.5 %), and MobileNetV2 (93.6 %) and respective model precisions of 98.6 %, 98.6 %, 97.5 %, 97.2 %, 96.9 %, 96.1 %, and 93.1 %.

Traditional yield prediction method based on secondary traits is time-consuming, costly, and destructive. It is urgent to develop innovative methods to improve selection efficiency and accelerate genetic gains in the breeding cycle. Results: Crop yield prediction using remote sensing has gained popularity in recent years. This paper proposed a novel ensemble feature selection (EFS) method to improve yield prediction from hyperspectral data. For this, 207 wheat cultivars and breeding lines were grown under full and limited irrigation treatments respectively, and their canopy hyperspectral reflectance was measured at the flowering, early grain filling (EGF), mid grain filling (MGF), and late grain filling (LGF) stages. Then, 115 vegetation indices were extracted from the hyperspectral reflectance and combined with four feature selection methods, i.e., mean decrease impurity (MDI), Boruta, FeaLect, and RReliefF to train deep neural network (DNN) models for yield prediction. Next, a learning framework was developed by combining the predicted values of the selected and the full features using multiple linear regression (MLR). The results show that the selected features contributed to higher yield prediction accuracy than the full features, and the MDI method performed well across growth stages, with a mean R2 ranging from 0.634 to 0.666 (mean RMSE = 0.926–0.967 t ha−1). Also, the proposed EFS method outperformed all the individual feature selection methods across growth stages, with a mean R2 ranging from 0.648 to 0.679 (mean RMSE = 0.911–0.950 t ha−1). Conclusions: The proposed EFS method can improve grain yield prediction from hyperspectral data and can be used to assist wheat breeders in earlier decision-making. © 2022, The Author(s).","Deep neural network; Feature selection; Hyperspectral; Vegetation index; Wheat yield",,Article,Scopus

To tackle this problem, this research has designed two-phase universal machine learning (ML) model to predict wheat yield (Wpred), utilizing 27 agricultural counties’ data within the Agro-ecological zone. The universal model, online sequential extreme learning machines coupled with ant colony optimization (ACO-OSELM) is developed, by incorporating the significant annual yield data lagged at (t − 1) as the model’s predictor to generate future yield at 6 test stations. In the first phase, ACO is adopted to search for suitable, statistically relevant data stations for model training, and the corresponding test station by virtue of a feature selection strategy. An annual wheat yield time-series input dataset is constructed utilizing data from each selected training station (1981–2013) and applied against 6 test stations (with each case modelled with 26 station data as the input) to evaluate the hybrid ACO-OSELM model. The partial autocorrelation function is implemented to deduce statistically significant lagged data, and OSELM is applied to generate Wpred. The two-phase hybrid ACO-OSELM model is tested within the 6 agricultural districts (represented as stations) of Punjab province, Pakistan and the results are benchmarked with extreme learning machine (ELM) and random forest (RF) integrated with ACO (i.e., hybrid ACO-ELM and hybrid ACO-RF models, respectively). The performance of the ACO-OSELM model was proven to be good in comparison to ACO-ELM and ACO-RF models. The hybrid ACO-OSELM model revealed its potential to be implemented as a decision-making system for crop yield prediction in areas where a significant association with the historical agricultural crop is well-established. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"ant colony optimization; article; autocorrelation; decision making; feature selection; harvest; machine learning; nonhuman; Pakistan; prediction; random forest; time series analysis; wheat; algorithm; crop; education; machine learning; Algorithms; Crops, Agricultural; Education, Distance; Machine Learning; Triticum",Article,Scopus

The methodologies used so far for crop yield forecast with remotely sensed data were focused upon vegetation indices generated from optical data. The prediction of crop yield in an accurate manner by developing robust machine learning models based on soil health parameters is crucial since it helps keep a track of soil health as well as its impact on overall yield. This study aims to utilize remotely sensed Microwave satellite data from Sentinel-1 and optical data from Sentinel-2, and field data to estimate three important soil health parameters- Soil Moisture, Soil Salinity, and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC). The study has been carried out in the Rupnagar district of Punjab in India. The estimated soil health parameters, SAR backscatter, and optical remote sensing satellite data parameters were utilized to estimate wheat crop yield. The soil health based DLMLP model performed best in crop yield estimation and gave R2 values of 0.723 and 0.684 in the training and testing phases, respectively, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.98 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value of 1.24 for the 2019–20 season. The DLMLP test R2 was 42.2% more than the Ordinary Least Squares Regressor (OLS), while the MAE and RMSE were 37.97% and 38.61% less than the OLS regressor for wheat crop yield estimation. The soil health-based DLMLP model gave satisfactory yield estimation accuracy in the absence of validation of soil health parameter values for the preceding years-2015–16 till 2018–19 wheat seasons. This study's novel feature is that it estimates soil health parameters for the early stages of wheat crop growth when soil lies mostly exposed and utilises them for crop yield prediction. © 2022 The Author(s)","Crop yield forecast; Deep Learning Multi-Layer Perceptron (DLMLP); Machine learning; SAR backscatter; Soil health parameters","backscatter; crop production; crop yield; estimation method; machine learning; remote sensing; soil property; synthetic aperture radar; India; Punjab [India]",Article,Scopus

The integrated use of climate and remote sensing data for predicting yield at regional and national scales has been previously investigated in various parts of the world. However, such attempts for national scale yield prediction, particularly in different planting zones in China have been rarely reported. For this purpose, this study explored the potential of nine climate variables, three remote sensing-derived metrics, and three machine learning methods (random forest, support vector machine, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) for predicting wheat yield based on data acquired during 2002–2010 from 1582 counties across China's three wheat planting zones. Our results illustrated large spatial divergences for yield prediction. The best performance (R2 = 0.79 and R2 = 0.66) was achieved for the northern winter wheat and northern spring wheat planting zones, respectively. Water-related climatic variables outperformed temperature-related variables, with the best individual predictive performance (R2 = 0.67). Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence had better performance (R2 = 0.60) for predicting the crop yield than NDVI and EVI. Climate data across the whole growing season has provided additional information for yield prediction as compared to remote sensing data. The additional contribution for yield prediction in winter wheat planting zones benefiting from climate data decreased from sowing to maturity, which was the opposite in remote sensing data. Typically, the support vector machine outperformed other models and the prediction in winter wheat planting zones performed better than the spring wheat planting zone. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating climate and remote sensing data for accurate county-level yield prediction in China. These kinds of simple and scalable machine learning methods could be targeted for further work by agricultural researchers and advisors. © 2022","Artificial intelligence; Climate data; Large scale; Remote sensing; Wheat yield prediction","artificial intelligence; crop yield; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; wheat; yield response; China",Review,Scopus

This study used leaf reflectance from a spectroradiometer to model grain yield (GY) and aboveground biomass yield (ABY) of maize (Zea mays L.) at Aba Gerima catchment, Ethiopia. A FieldSpec IV (350–2,500 nm wavelengths) spectroradiometer was used to estimate the spectral reflectance of crop leaves during the grain-filling phase. The spectral vegetation indices, such as enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference VI (NDVI), green NDVI (GNDVI), soil adjusted VI, red NDVI, and simple ratio were deduced from the spectral reflectance. We used regression analyses to identify and predict GY and ABY at the catchment level. The coefficient of determination (R2), the root mean square error (RMSE), and relative importance (RI) were used for evaluating model performance. The findings revealed that the best-fitting curve was obtained between GY and NDVI (R2 = 0.70; RMSE = 0.065; P &lt; 0.0001; RI = 0.19), followed by EVI (R2 = 0.65; RMSE = 0.024; RI = 0.61; P &lt; 0.0001). While the best-fitting curve was obtained between ABY and GNDVI (R2 = 0.71; RI = 0.24; P &lt; 0.0001), followed by NDVI (R2 = 0.77; RI = 0.17; P &lt; 0.0001). The highest GY (7.18 ton/ha) and ABY (18.71 ton/ha) of maize were recorded at a soil bunded plot on a gentle slope. Combined spectral indices were also employed to predict GY with R2 (0.83) and RMSE (0.24) and ABY with R2 (0.78) and RMSE (0.12). Thus, the maize’s GY and ABY can be predicted with acceptable accuracy using spectral reflectance indices derived from spectroradiometer in an area like the Aba Gerima catchment.

In this research, remote sensing driven semi-empirical light use efficiency (LUE) model and a process-based crop simulation model (CSM) approach were attempted to predict cotton yield in the five districts of Maharashtra state, India. Time-series satellite data from different earth observation (EO) missions were retrieved from 2011 to 2017. Satellite-based measurements of fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) data were directly incorporated into the LUE model. The LUE model approach used observed minimum (0.07) and maximum (0.12) lint harvest index (HI) values to predict the cotton yield. On the other hand, the CSM model was parameterized with observed field management, soil, weather, and cultivar data for crop yield prediction. The inter-evaluation of models has revealed that the LUE model with HI value 0.07 (HI0.07) performed better when compared to the LUE model with HI value 0.12 (HI0.12) and CSM model. LUE model HI0.07 had shown better accuracy in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) of 154 kg ha−1 and correlation coefficient value of (R2 = 0.46) when compared with LUE model HI0.12 (RMSE 310 kg ha−1 and R2 = 0.41) and CSM model (RMSE 235 kg ha−1 and R2 = 0.38).

We calculated the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and 2-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) time series, which were adjusted using greenup dates derived from the Land Cover Dynamics product MCD12Q2. Based on the adjusted VI (NDVI, EVI2) time series, the VI change rate (dVI) time series was calculated, which represents crop growth rate. The first step was to cluster the adjusted VI and dVI time series, called ‘greenup groups’, according to corresponding greenup dates with a five-day interval. Then in different greenup groups, we constructed empirical univariate models with VI having the maximum correlation with crop yield, and multivariate models with VI and dVI, which were also used to construct the generalized model. After clustering, the days with maximum VI correlation gradually decreased as greenup days increasing, and the univariate VI model and multivariate VI and dVI model performances in different groups improved. The generalized models with specific VI and dVI variables in each group predicted yields of corn and soybean with R2 values mainly ranging from 0.55 to 0.75 and 0.55 to 0.70, while RMSE mainly ranging from 1000 to 1500 kg/ha and 300 to 400 kg/ha for both NDVI and EVI2 from 2008 to 2018 with leave-one-year-out cross-validation for all groups.

However, weather ensembles containing the unknown future weather conditions occurring after prediction dates are essential for such predictions using crop models. Two strategies were established for selecting analogue weather years as the target growing season based on a five-year maize experiment conducted at eight sites in the Loess Plateau of China. The first strategy tried weather data from different lengths of years ahead the planting year. The second strategy used the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm to select analogue weather according to different combinations of weather variables with daily or accumulative values. The results showed that satisfactory predictions could be obtained after maize tasseling (about 50 d prior to maturity). The mean absolute relative error (ARE) and coefficient of variation (CV) of the daily yield predictions after tasseling were 6.6% and 5.7%, respectively, in 2010 at the Yulin site. In the leading-year strategy, the most reliable predictions were obtained by the weather data from the 10 years ahead of planting, with an overall average ARE of 11.7%. In the k-NN strategy, the most reliable predictions were obtained by using the analogue weather selected with only accumulative precipitation, with an overall average ARE of 11.5%. Additionally, both of the two optimal strategies improved the original predictions in most cases. However, the k-NN strategy was more likely to generate worse predictions in the early part of the growing season. Generally, it was more convenient to use the weather data of 10 leading years before the planting year to represent the unknown weather data after the prediction dates. This strategy provided reliable prediction accuracy without complex programming and requirement for long-term weather records. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Maize; The Loess Plateau; Weather analogue; Within-season; Yield prediction","accuracy assessment; algorithm; crop yield; error analysis; growing season; maize; nearest neighbor analysis; optimization; precipitation (climatology); prediction; rainfed agriculture; real time; spatial distribution; China; Loess Plateau; Shaanxi; Yulin",Article,Scopus

Considering the efforts to establish a framework towards quantifying the crop yield prediction at regional scales are limited, we investigated the utility of combining crop model with the regional weather prediction model to forecast winter wheat yields over space. The exercise was performed for various lead-times in the regions of Punjab and Haryana for the years 2008–2009. A numerical weather prediction (NWP) model was used to generate micro-meteorological variables at different lead times (1-week, 2-weeks, 3-weeks and 5-weeks) ahead of crop harvest and used within the CERES-Wheat crop simulation model gridded framework at a spatial resolution of 10 km. Various scenarios of the yield forecasts were verified with district-wide reported yield values. Average deviations of −12 to 3% from the actual district-wise wheat yields were observed across the lead times. The 3-weeks-ahead yield forecasts yielded a maximum agreement index of 0.86 with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 327.75 kg/ha and a relative deviation of −5.35%. The critical crop growth stages were found to be highly sensitive to the errors in the weather forecast, and thus made a huge impact on the predicted crop yields. The 5-weeks-ahead weather forecasts generated anomalous meteorological data during flowering and grain-filling crop growth stages, and thus had the highest negative impact on the simulated yields.

Process-based and semi-empirical crop models are the main approaches to modeling the temporal changes in crop parameters. However, the former requires too many input parameters and the latter has the problem of poor portability. In this study, new semi-empirical geometric and physical parameters of the maize canopy model (GPMCM) crop model adapted to northeast China were proposed based on a time-series field datasets collected from 11 sites in the Nong’an and Changling Counties of Jilin Province, China, during DOY (day of year) 163 to DOY 278 in 2021. The allocation characteristics of and correlations between each maize canopy parameter were investigated for the whole growing season using the 22 algorithms of crop parameters, and the following conclusions were obtained. (1) The high correlation coefficient (mean = 0.79) of LAI with other canopy parameters indicated that it was a good indicator for predicting other parameters. (2) Better performance was achieved by the regression method based on the two-stage simulation. The root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of geometric parameters including maize height, stem long radius, and short radius were 12.91 cm, 0.74 mm, and 0.73 mm, respectively, and the of the physical parameters including the FAGB, AGB, VWC, and RWC of the stems and leaves, ranged from 0.05 kg/m2 to 4.24 kg/m2 (2.0% to 12.9% for mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)). (3) The extension of the field-scale GPMCM to the 500 m MODIS-scale still provided a good accuracy (: 11% to 18.5%) and confirmed the feasibility of the large-scale application of the GPMCM. The proposed CPMCM can predict the temporal dynamics of maize geometric and physical parameters, and it is helpful to establish the forward and re-verse models of remote sensing and improve the inversion accuracy of crop parameters. © 2022 by the authors.

The results of earlier techniques of data collecting and analysis for yield forecasts were typically delayed, expensive, time-consuming, site-specific, and riddled with errors and uncertainties. This study is a novel approach to using high-resolution satellite data in conjunction with environmental and topographic data to predict wheat yield variability at the farm scale using machine learning. In this research, winter wheat yield prediction was based on 36 indicators in machine learning using correlation and different regression models. Winter wheat yield was predicted using linear regression (LR), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) regression models with scikit-learn in machine learning. More than 10,000 data points from 45 farms were trained and validated in Fergana valley, Central Asia. Results indicate that at 10 m resolution using Sentinel-2 and other secondary data such as topographic, soil, environmental, and filed data can generate an accurate wheat yield prediction map. The accuracy of all regressions is lowest for LR (R2:95, RMSE: 2.31), highest for RF (R2:98, RMSE: 1.40), and intermediate for DT regression (R2:97, RMSE: 1.85). Results also indicate that prediction in the early stage of the crop is less accurate in comparison to harvesting time as LR (R2:85, RMSE: 2.66), DT (R2:95, RMSE: 2.06), RF (R2:97, RMSE: 1.54) have different R2 and RMSE values. Appling the RF model, the winter wheat prediction is 3.29 to 4.30 t/ha therefore the total wheat production is approximately 100 t in the study area. Thus this study will demonstrate the capability of high-resolution satellite imagery and secondary data for highly accurate real-time crop yield prediction at the field scale, which can be used to assist precision agriculture and will provide a point of reference for crop area extraction, mapping, monitoring, and sustainable development with food security. © 2022 The Authors","Food security; Machine learning; Phenology; Precision agriculture; Regression; Sentinel-2; Spectral-indices; Yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly popular in recent years for agricultural remote sensing applications such as crop yield forecasting and precision agriculture (PA). The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a low-cost UAV-based remote sensing technology for Bambara groundnut yield prediction. A multirotor UAV equipped with a near-infrared sensitive consumer-grade digital camera was used to collect image data during the 2018 growing season (April to August). Flight missions were carried out six times during critical phenological stages of the life-cycle of the monitored crop. Yield was recorded at harvest. Four vegetation indices (VIs) namely normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), and simple ratio (SR) generated from the Red-Green-Near Infrared bands were calculated using the georeferenced orthomosaic UAV images. Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient (r) and Bland–Altman testing showed a significant agreement between remotely and proximally sensed VIs. Significant and positive correlations were found between the four VIs and yield, with the strongest relationship observed between SR and yield at podfilling stage (r = 0.81, P &lt; 0.01). Multi-temporal accumulative VIs improved yield prediction significantly with the best index being ∑SR and the best interval being from podfilling to maturity (r = 0.88, P &lt; 0.01). The accumulated ∑SR from podfilling to maturity resulted in higher prediction accuracy with a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0.71, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.20 and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 14.2% than SR spectral index at a single stage (R 2 = 0.68, RMSE = 0.24, MAPE = 15.1%).

Crop models (CMs) are powerful tools for predicting yield and water use, but they still have some limitations and uncertainties; therefore, combining them with machine learning algorithms (MLs) could improve predictions and reduce uncertainty. To that end, the DSSAT-CERES-maize model was calibrated in one location and validated in others across Egypt with varying agro-climatic zones. Following that, the dynamic model (CERES-Maize) was used for long-term simulation (1990–2020) of maize grain yield (GY) and evapotranspiration (ET) under a wide range of management and environmental factors. Detailed outputs from three growing seasons of field experiments in Egypt, as well as CERES-maize outputs, were used to train and test six machine learning algorithms (linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, and XGBoost), resulting in more than 1.5 million simulated yield and evapotranspiration scenarios. Seven warming years (i.e., 1991, 1998, 2002, 2005, 2010, 2013, and 2020) were chosen from a 31-year dataset to test MLs, while the remaining 23 years were used to train the models. The Ensemble model (super learner) and XGBoost outperform other models in predicting GY and ET for maize, as evidenced by R2 values greater than 0.82 and RRMSE less than 9%. The broad range of management practices, when averaged across all locations and 31 years of simulation, not only reduced the hazard impact of environmental factors but also increased GY and reduced ET. Moving beyond prediction and interpreting the outputs from Lasso and XGBoost, and using global and local SHAP values, we found that the most important features for predicting GY and ET are maximum temperatures, minimum temperature, available water content, soil organic carbon, irrigation, cultivars, soil texture, solar radiation, and planting date. Determining the most important features is critical for assisting farmers and agronomists in prioritizing such features over other factors in order to increase yield and resource efficiency values. The combination of CMs and ML algorithms is a powerful tool for predicting yield and water use in arid regions, which are particularly vulnerable to climate change and water scarcity. © 2022 by the authors.","DSSAT models; feature importance; hyperparameters tuning; lasso regression; random forest; super learner; water use; XGBoost","Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Environmental management; Evapotranspiration; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Organic carbon; Plants (botany); Soils; Statistical tests; Textures; DSSAT model; Feature importance; Hyper-parameter; Hyperparameter tuning; Lasso regressions; Machine learning algorithms; Random forests; Super learner; Water use; Xgboost; Forecasting; arid environment; climate change; crop yield; environmental factor; evapotranspiration; maize; soil nutrient; yield response; Egypt",Article,Scopus

Due to rapid progress in remote sensing technology, fine spatial resolution (FSR) remotely sensed imagery now offers great opportunities for mapping crop types in great detail. However, within-class variance can hamper attempts to discriminate crop classes at fine resolutions. Multi-temporal FSR remotely sensed imagery provides a means of increasing crop classification from FSR imagery, although current methods do not exploit the available information fully. In this research, a novel Temporal Sequence Object-based Convolutional Neural Network (TS-OCNN) was proposed to classify agricultural crop type from FSR image time-series. An object-based CNN (OCNN) model was adopted in the TS-OCNN to classify images at the object level (i.e., segmented objects or crop parcels), thus, maintaining the precise boundary information of crop parcels. The combination of image time-series was first utilized as the input to the OCNN model to produce an ‘original’ or baseline classification. Then the single-date images were fed automatically into the deep learning model scene-by-scene in order of image acquisition date to increase successively the crop classification accuracy. By doing so, the joint information in the FSR multi-temporal observations and the unique individual information from the single-date images were exploited comprehensively for crop classification. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was investigated using multitemporal SAR and optical imagery, respectively, over two heterogeneous agricultural areas. The experimental results demonstrated that the newly proposed TS-OCNN approach consistently increased crop classification accuracy, and achieved the greatest accuracies (82.68% and 87.40%) in comparison with state-of-the-art benchmark methods, including the object-based CNN (OCNN) (81.63% and 85.88%), object-based image analysis (OBIA) (78.21% and 84.83%), and standard pixel-wise CNN (79.18% and 82.90%). The proposed approach is the first known attempt to explore simultaneously the joint information from image time-series with the unique information from single-date images for crop classification using a deep learning framework. The TS-OCNN, therefore, represents a new approach for agricultural landscape classification from multi-temporal FSR imagery. Besides, it is readily generalizable to other landscapes (e.g., forest landscapes), with a wide application prospect. © 2022 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

Multitemporal satellite observations allow analyzing vegetation seasonal dynamics over large areas by using vegetation indices or by deriving biophysical variables. The Nile Delta represents about half of all agricultural lands of Egypt. In this region, intensifying farming systems are predominant and multi-cropping rotations schemes are increasing, requiring a high temporal and spatial resolution monitoring for capturing successive crop growth cycles. This study presents a workflow for cropland phenology characterization and mapping based on time series of green Leaf Area Index (LAI) generated from NASA’s Harmonized Landsat 8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) surface reflectance dataset from 2016 to 2019. LAI time series were processed for each satellite dataset, which were used separately and combined to identify seasonal dynamics for a selection of crop types (wheat, clover, maize and rice). For the combination of L8 with S2 LAI products, we proposed two time series smoothing and fitting methods: (1) the Savitzky–Golay (SG) filter and (2) the Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR) fitting function. Single-sensor and L8-S2 combined LAI time series were used for the calculation of key crop Land Surface Phenology (LSP) metrics (start of season, end of season, length of season), whereby the detection of cropland growing seasons was based on two established threshold methods, i.e., a seasonal or a relative amplitude value. Overall, the developed phenology extraction scheme enabled identifying up to two successive crop cycles within a year, with a superior performance observed for the seasonal than for the relative threshold method, in terms of consistency and cropland season detection capability. Differences between the time series collections were analyzed by comparing the phenology metrics per crop type and year. Results suggest that L8-S2 combined LAI data streams with GPR led to a more precise detection of the start and end of growing seasons for most crop types, reaching an overall detection of 74% over the total planted crops versus 69% with S2 and 63% with L8 alone. Finally, the phenology mapping allowed us to evaluate the spatial and temporal evolution of the croplands over the agroecosystem in the Nile Delta. © 2022 by the authors.

Climate change is expected to have an adverse impact particularly on crop production. Previous studies have shown large discrepancies in the magnitude and sometimes in the direction of the impact on crop production. We assessed the impact of climate change on growth and yield of maize and wheat in Ethiopia using a multi-crop model ensemble. The multi-model ensemble (n = 48) was set up using the agroecosystem modelling framework Expert-N. The framework is modular which facilitates combining different submodels for plant growth and soil processes. The multi-model ensemble was driven by climate change projections representing the mid of the century (2021-2050) from ten contrasting climate models downscaled to finer resolution. The contributions of different sources of uncertainty in crop yield prediction were quantified. The sensitivity of crop yield to elevated CO2, increased temperature, changes in precipitations and N fertilizer were also assessed. Our results indicate that grain yields were very sensitive to changes in [CO2], temperature and N fertilizer amounts where the responses were higher for wheat than maize. The response to change in precipitation was weak, which we attribute to the high water holding capacity of the soils due to high organic carbon contents at the study sites. This may provide the sufficient buffering capacity for extended time periods with low amounts of precipitation. Under the changing climate, wheat productivity will be a major challenge with a 36 to 40% reduction in grain yield by 2050 while the impact on maize was modest. A major part of the uncertainty in the projected impact could be attributed to differences in the crop growth models. A considerable fraction of the uncertainty could also be traced back to different soil water dynamics modeling approaches in the model ensemble, which is often ignored. Uncertainties varied among the studied crop species and cultivars as well. The study highlights significant impacts of climate change on wheat yield in Ethiopia whereby differences in crop growth models causes the large part of the uncertainties. © 2022 Rettie et al.

Most models are described by dis-crete dynamic systems in general state-space representation with important domain-specific characteristics: First, plant model parameters have usually clear functional meanings and may be of genetic origins, thus necessitating a precise estimation. Second, critical growth variables, specifically biomass production and dynamic allocation to organs, are hidden variables not acces-sible to measure. Finally, the difficulty to assess the local plant environment may imply the introduction of process noises in models. Therefore, a precise understanding of the system’s behavior requires the joint estimation of functional parameters, hidden states, and noise parameters. In this paper we describe how a full Bayesian method of estimation can accurately estimate all these key model variables using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) tech-niques. In the presence of both process and observation noises, it requires to use adequate particle MCMC (PMCMC) algorithms to efficiently sample the hidden states which, consequently, allows for a precise estimation of all noise parameters involved. Thanks to the Bayesian framework, appropriate choices of prior distributions for the noise parameters have enabled analytical pos-terior distributions and only simple updates are required. Furthermore, this estimation strategy can be easily generalized and adapted to different types of plant growth models, such as organ-scale or compartmental, provided that they are formulated as hidden Markov models. Our estimation method im-proves on those classically used in plant growth modeling in several aspects: First, by building upon a general probabilistic framework the estimation results allow proper statistical analyses. It is useful in prediction, no only for uncertainty and risk analysis (e.g., for crop yield prediction) but also to an-alyze the results of experimental trials, for example, to compare genotypes in breeding. Moreover, the care taken in the estimation of hidden variables opens new perspectives in the understanding of inner growth processes, no-tably the balance and interaction between biomass production and allocation (referred to as source-sink dynamics). Applications of this estimation proce-dure are demonstrated on the GreenLab model for Arabidopsis thaliana and the Log-Normal Allocation and Senescence (LNAS) model for sugar beet, on both synthetic and real data. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2022.","Bayesian inference; hidden Markov model; particle MCMC; plant growth",,Article,Scopus

However, the popularly used model inversion method inevitably presents an ill-posed problem, which leads to unstable and inaccurate retrieval results. An agricultural parcel is a relatively homogeneous object due to uniform agricultural practices and similar environmental conditions. Crops inside a parcel generally present the same growth stage and similar growth status. In this study, a new method was proposed by adopting spatiotemporal constraints at the parcel level in the model inversion process for LAI retrieval. Firstly, phenology information of parcels was utilized to constrain the LAI ranges based on the established prior knowledge, which described the temporal variation of LAI during the life cycle of crop. Subsequently, spatial constraint was adopted in the model inversion through a proposed novel cost function, which assumed the spatial autocorrelation of parameters inside a parcel according to the first law of geography. Sugarcane was taken as an example to evaluate the proposed method. The method was applied to Sentinel-2 data and validated using ground-measured LAI data. The retrieved model parameters exhibited smoother spatial patterns and lower intra-parcel spatial variations through the proposed parcel-level inversion method, compared to the conventional pixel-level inversion method. Evaluations of LAI retrieval accuracy showed that the parcel-level inversion method yielded more accurate results (root mean square error (RMSE): 0.34 m2/m2; relative root mean square error (RRMSE): 20.89%), compared to the pixel-level inversion method (RMSE: 0.56 m2/m2; RRMSE: 34.53%). The spatiotemporal constraint strategy presented the ability to prevent severe overestimation and underestimation. Among the validation data set, the accuracy of the severely overestimated samples of the pixel-level method (RMSE: 0.93 m2/m2) was improved via the new method (RMSE: 0.43 m2/m2); the accuracy of the severely underestimated samples of the pixel-level method (RMSE: 0.66 m2/m2) was improved via the new method (RMSE: 0.26 m2/m2). Finally, the proposed method was applied to obtain sugarcane LAI mapping. The study demonstrates that the proposed parcel-level spatiotemporal constraint strategy improves the accuracy of LAI retrieval, has the capability of producing a highly reliable crop LAI mapping, and shows good potential for agricultural applications at regional scales. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Leaf area index; Parcel level; Radiative transfer model; Regularization; Spatiotemporal constraints; Sugarcane","Cost functions; Crops; Life cycle; Mapping; Mean square error; Pixels; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Crop leaves; Inversion methods; Leaf Area Index; Parcel level; Pixel level; Radiative transfer modelling; Regularisation; Root mean square errors; Spatio-temporal constraints; Sugarcane; Radiative transfer; leaf area index; mapping; spatiotemporal analysis; sugar cane",Article,Scopus

However, unpredictable changes in climatic conditions have affected the cultivation of crops. There is a declining interest for individuals to remain in this field since farmers are not encouraged to use technology for processes. This happens primarily because there is a lack of involvement of information technology in the farming sector. This obstacle can be overcome by applying several techniques of programming to help farmers estimate the yield of their produce and motivate them to remain in this field. Crop yield prediction includes anticipating yield of the crop from available historical information like climatic, acreage parameters and soil parameters. Machine learning is one technique that can be used to predict the crop yield. Using parameters that are associated with the environment, agriculture and farming, machine learning models can predict the crop yield with good accuracy. The research previously done in this sector has proven to be instrumental in forming the basis of this model. The findings have shown that parameters such as nutrient levels, acreage and historical data have a greater impact on the overall yield in addition to the climatic conditions of the place being observed. In this work, a model has been proposed which helps cultivators predict the yield of the crop even before cultivating directly onto the agricultural lands. The yield prediction based on location, acreage and fertilizer data for several regions in the United States has been experimented using various algorithms. The parameters tested and the features used introduce a unique insight into the relationship between nitrogen, phosphorous and potash (N-P-K) used (acreage covered and quantity) and the lint yield of cotton. A point to note here is that the model has taken into account the historical observations (1975–2017) in order to recommend fertilizers. This has been made possible using the multi-variate regression algorithm. Additionally, the yield prediction results have shown that the gradient boosting regressor proved to be the best performer, returning a standalone accuracy score of 90.73% and 80.72% on being validated using the fivefold cross validation method. The proposed model aims to design, develop and implement the training model by using different input data. The machine will be able to learn the features and extract the crop yield from the data by using data mining and data science techniques. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Crop yield; Data mining; Gradient boosting regressor; Machine learning",,Book Chapter,Scopus

However, most of the current research on seeding rate decisions is based on delineating farmland management zones, which cannot be applied to sensor-based VRS. In most studies, traditional linear regression was used to establish the relationship among soil indicators, seeding rate, and yield, which did not consider the impact of weather and management factors on yield. Given the above problems, in this study, corn yield prediction model based on gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm was established by combining soil organic matter (SOM) data, weather data and management data, and was compared with the model built by random forest (RF) algorithm. Innovative seeding rate decision rules were developed by using the GBDT corn yield prediction model to simulate corn yield responses to a series of SOM contents and seeding rates. The result showed that the GBDT model (R2cv = 0.799) was better than the RF model (R2cv = 0.749). The simulation results of the GBDT model indicated that the yield showed a parabolic form with the increase of seeding rate under the same SOM, the yield increased first and then decreased with the increase of SOM under the same seeding rate, there was an agronomic optimum seeding rate (AOSR) under each SOM and the AOSR increased in a stepped shape with the increase of SOM. The following decision rules were obtained by summarizing the simulation results: when 10 g/kg ≤ SOM ≤ 12 g/kg, seeding rate = 84,900 seeds/ha; when 12 g/kg &lt; SOM ≤ 13 g/kg, 84,900 seeds/ha &lt; seeding rate ≤ 90,600 seeds/ha; when 13 g/kg &lt; SOM ≤ 14 g/kg, 90,600 seeds/ha &lt; seeding rate ≤ 92,110 seeds/ha; when 14 g/kg &lt; SOM ≤ 20 g/kg, 92,110 seeds/ha &lt; seeding rate ≤ 93,000 seeds/ha; when 20 g/kg &lt; SOM ≤ 26 g/kg, 93,000 seeds/ha &lt; seeding rate ≤ 93,880 seeds/ha. The crop yield prediction model is established through a machine-learning algorithm to create a controllable environment for exploring the change of yield with soil attributes and seeding rate, which is a promising method to study sensor-based variable-rate seeding decisions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Corn grain yield; Machine learning; Seeding rate decision; Soil organic matter; Variable-rate seeding","Adaptive boosting; Agricultural machinery; Biogeochemistry; Crops; Decision trees; Forecasting; Grain (agricultural product); Organic compounds; Random forests; Soils; Corn grain yield; Corn yields; Decision-tree model; Gradient boosting; Seeding rate; Seeding rate decision; Soil organic matters; Variable rate; Variable-rate seeding; Yield prediction models; Machine learning; agricultural land; algorithm; crop yield; machine learning; maize; resource use; seeding; soil fertility; soil organic matter",Article,Scopus

As the subsurface drainage construction has been advocated more in recent years to provide timely soil drainage and improve farming mechanization level for modern agricultural development, this study aims to examine the effect of subsurface drainage on waterlogging control and the subsequent effect on winter wheat production, the field hydrology model - DRAINMOD was used in combination with the crop growth model- AquaCrop to predict the effect of subsurface drainage system layout on winter wheat yield in the study area. The more accurate predictions of water table depth by DRAINMOD model was used to improve calculations of crop uptake from shallow groundwater in drained fields, which is currently simplified in the AquaCrop model. Both models were tested based on field observations of soil, weather, water table depth and winter wheat production in the Dongtai experimental station of the Jiangsu Academy of Water Conservancy Sciences in China. The model testing results showed that DRAINMOD accurately predicted groundwater depth in the study area, and the winter wheat yields predicted by AquaCrop was close to the measured values. Because winter wheat growth relied on groundwater uptake from the shallow water table in the study area, the accurate groundwater depth input to AquaCrop model is critical to crop yield predictions. After verification of both models, DRAINMOD was used to predict the daily water table depth over a long term period, considering the great variations in the water table depth over the different hydrological years. Different rainfall frequencies of 10%, 15%, 50%, and 85% during the wheat growing season were selected to predict drainage needs for building high standard farmland in the study area. The predicted groundwater depth under different subsurface drainage conditions were fed into the AquaCrop model for yield prediction. DRAINMOD simulation results showed that crop water stress (as expressed by <30 cm depth to water table in 3 days) increased with the drain spacing but decreased with the drain depth during the wheat growing season; subsurface drainage layout of 1.2 m deep and 20 m spacing, or 1.5 m deep and 30 m spacing may achieve water stress free in 85% years. The AquaCrop predicted wheat yield was generally higher in the dry and average years owing to the less water stress, the predicted crop yields varied over years, and the effect of subsurface drainage on yield increase was more obvious in the wet years. With shallower depth of subsurface drainage pipes (80-100 cm), DRAINMOD predicted groundwater depth was generally maintained at a high level, rainfall recharge rapidly raised the groundwater level and crop yields were affected by the waterlogging stress in 20% years. The wet stress in the wheat growing season can be reduced significantly with the increase of buried depth of subsurface drainage pipes, the predicted waterlogging stress occurred in less than 15% years when the drain depth was at 1.5 m and the drain spacing was less than 50 m; when drain spacing was reduced to less or equal to 20 m, the waterlogging stress on the crop yield can be reduced to in 2% years. In conclusion, the subsurface drainage layout of 1.5 m depth and 20 m spacing can achieve the ideal wheat production goal in 85% years in the study area based on simulation results with DRAINMOD and AquaCrop. Findings from this research may provide technical support for subsurface drainage system construction to improve agricultural production in the coastal reclamation area in eastern China and the similar regions. © 2022, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

In India, our state Tamilnadu is also contributes to the national agricultural products such as paddy, maize, sugarcane, turmeric, etc. The most wanted and the important crop grown in Tamilnadu is Paddy. Cauvery Delta Zone in Tamilnadu is the major contributor in the production of paddy. This Zone covers the districts such as Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagappattinam, Pudukottai, Cuddalore, Ariyalur, Karur and Tiruchirappalli. Most of the people in these districts are dependent on the cultivation and the yield of paddy. Increasing the yield of the paddy crop in these districts is expected to have a significant impact on the economy of both the farmers and the nation on a whole. This increase in crop yield will promote sustainable agriculture which will result in attaining a sustainable development of our nation. Performing a precise prediction about the crop yield could help the farmers take necessary steps to improve their yield in future and get economical benefits out of it. Among the various prediction models that have been developed in the literature, there are only a limited number of models that exists to forecast the yield of paddy. Hence, a Deep Learning based yield prediction model has been proposed to forecast the yield of paddy in the Cauvery Delta zone which is the major contributor of the production of these crops.

They were not always able to predict the crop and its yield solely on that idea alone. Second, seed firms frequently monitor how well new plant varieties would grow in certain settings. Third, predicting agricultural production is critical for solving emerging food security concerns, especially in the face of global climate change. Accurate production forecasts not only assist farmers in making informed economic and management decisions but they also aid in the prevention of famine. This results in farming systems’ efficiency and productivity gains, as well as reduced risk from environmental factors. Design/methodology/approach: This research paper proposes a machine learning technique for effective autonomous crop and yield prediction, which makes use of solution encoding to create solutions randomly, and then for every generated solution, fitness is evaluated to meet highest accuracy. Major focus of the proposed work is to optimize the weight parameter in the input data. The algorithm continues until the optimal agent or optimal weight is selected, which contributes to maximum accuracy in automated crop prediction. Findings: Performance of the proposed work is compared with different existing algorithms, such as Random Forest, support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed method support vector neural network (SVNN) with gravitational search agent (GSA) is analysed based on different performance metrics, such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, CPU memory usage and training time, and maximum performance is determined. Research limitations/implications: Rather than real-time data collected by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, this research focuses solely on historical data; the proposed work does not impose IoT-based smart farming, which enhances the overall agriculture system by monitoring the field in real time. The present study only predicts the sort of crop to sow not crop production. Originality/value: The paper proposes a novel optimization algorithm, which is based on the law of gravity and mass interactions. The search agents in the proposed algorithm are a cluster of weights that interact with one another using Newtonian gravity and motion principles.

Agriculture provides the primary source of food, income, livelihood and employment to the majority of rural populations in India. Many crops are destroyed every year due to a lack of technical knowledge and unpredictable weather patterns such as temperature, rainfall, and other atmospheric parameters, which play a massive role in deciding the crop yield and profit. Therefore, choosing the right crop to grow and enhancing crop yield is an essential aspect of improving real-life farming scenarios. One of the motives is to collect and integrate the agricultural data from specific regions that may be used to analyse the optimal crop and estimate the crop yield. This script is novel by using simple crop, soil and weather parameters like crop, the area under cultivation, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium content of the soil, season, average rainfall and temperature of a district in Karnataka, India. The user can predict the most suitable crop and its estimated yield for a chosen year. This model uses primary classification, techniques like the random forest, k-NN, logistic regression, decision tree, XGBoost, SVM and gradient boosting classifier for determining the most suitable crop and regression algorithms like Linear Regression, k-NN, DBSCAN, Random Forest and ANN algorithm to estimate the yield of the most optimal crop identified earlier. The algorithm that has the least mean error is chosen for prediction and estimation and thus gives better results than the particular machine learning algorithm domain. There is a web interface for ease of use for end-users. Therefore, this project assists the farmers in choosing the suitable crop that can be grown in a particular region during a specific season or specific period and estimate its yield and predict if the recommended crop is profitable.

Soil quality is changing drastically, affecting the agricultural crop yield. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms are effectively helping to predict the crop based on the soil quality of the land. Data on temperature, humidity, rainfall, soil moisture, and pH are needed to train the machine-learning models. This work has been carried out using the following machine learning models: Decision Tree classifier, K-Neighbor classifier, and Random Forest classifier models. The accuracy of the Random Forest classifier is 93.11 percent, which is higher than the accuracy of the Decision Tree classifier (90.96 percent) and the accuracy of the K-Neighbors classifier (87.63 percent). Along with accuracy, the following performance metrics, such as precision, F1 score, recall, mean absolute error, and log loss, are taken into account. Web-based software has been developed to forecast the crop prediction of farmland based on soil conditions. The real-time data on the soil quality is gathered using the IoT devices from the farm, and the data is saved in the cloud. The data is fed to the machine learning model to predict the crop that would be most suited for cultivation on the farm. Since this is a real-time strategy, farmers can predict the crop with greater accuracy, resulting in higher yields. © 2022 IEEE.","crop prediction; internet of things; performance metrics; Random forest classifier; soil analysis; thingspeak","Agricultural technology; Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Deep learning; Economics; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Population statistics; Soil moisture; Crop prediction; Decision tree classifiers; K-neighbors; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Performance metrices; Random forest classifier; Soil analysis; Soils qualities; Thingspeak; Forecasting",Conference Paper,Scopus

Reason for agricultural downward growth depends on so many parameters. The rainfall is one of the main parameters which affects the crop yield. Because of this, the farmers are also facing the loss. If they know this information in prior, the farmers can plan accordingly the type of crop suited for the particular season and it helps the farmer to get good profit out of it. Machine learning scientific and statistical methods are used for predicting the rain fall and crop yield. Kharif and Rabi are two seasons taken for analysis. The regressor predicting models are constructed to predict the seasonal rainfall and crop yield. This study primarily focuses on seasonal crop production prediction, which is dependent on rainfall. The different types of machine learning regression method are used to achieve better results. The performance of comparison models is evaluated using different metrics.

Modern agriculture is a constantly growing approach for agricultural advances and farming techniques. It becomes challenging for the farmers to satisfy our planet's evolving requirements and the expectations of merchants, customers, etc. Some of the challenges the farmers face are-(i) Dealing with climatic changes because of soil erosion and industry emissions (ii) Nutrient deficiency in the soil, caused by a shortage of crucial minerals such as potassium, nitrogen, and phosphorus can result in reduced crop growth. (iii) Farmers make a mistake by cultivating the same crops year after year without experimenting with different varieties. They add fertilizers randomly without understanding the inferior quality or quantity. The paper aims to discover the best model for crop prediction, which can help farmers decide the type of crop to grow based on the climatic conditions and nutrients present in the soil.

Predicting ear emergence of rice plants is known to be crucial for practicing good harvesting quality, and has long been dependent upon old farmers who acquire skills of intuitive prediction based on their long term experiences. Facing with aging farmers, data driven approach for the prediction have been pursued. Nevertheless, they are not necessarily sufficient in terms of practical use. One of the issue is to adopt weather forecast as the feature so that the predictive performance is varied by the accuracy of the forecast. The other issue is that the performance is varied by region and the regional characteristics have not been used as the features for the prediction. With this background, we propose a feature engineering to quantify hidden regional characteristics as the feature for the prediction. Further the feature is engineered based only on observational data without any forecast.

Using the most recent developments in automation, artificial intelligence, and networking, farmers are better able to keep an eye on every step of the process and apply exact treatments selected by machines with superhuman accuracy. With an expanding global population comes a rise in the need for both employment and food. The farmers' traditional practices fell short of meeting these demands. New automated methods were consequently proposed. These innovative techniques satisfied the world's food needs while also creating jobs for billions of people. For effective farm management, a variety of techniques are utilized, including IoT, cloud computing, AI, machine learning, deep learning, big data, etc. Deep learning is one of these, and it is a developing field of study for crop yield forecasting. Engineers, data scientists, and farmers are still developing methods to optimize the amount of human labor needed in agriculture. As key information sources improve, smart farming transforms into a learning system that grows smarter every day. Artificial neural network principles are used in a machine learning method known as deep learning. The depth of deep learning networks, which also allows them to detect latent structures in unlabeled, unstructured data, is what sets them apart from neural networks. Compared to ML techniques, deep learning networks that automatically extract features without human involvement have a considerable advantage.

A key challenge faced by small and marginal farmers is to determine which crops to grow to maximize their utililty. With a wrong choice of crops, farmers could end up with sub-optimal yields and low, and possibly even loss of revenue. This work seeks to design and develop ACRE (Agricultural Crop Recommendation Engine), a tool that provides a scientific method to choose a crop or a portfolio of crops, to maximize the utility to the farmer. ACRE uses available data such as soil characteristics, weather conditions, and historical yield data, and uses state-of-the-art machine learning/deep learning models to compute an estimated utility to the farmer. The main idea of ACRE is to generate several recommendations of portfolios of crops, with a ranking of portfolios based on the Sharpe ratio, a popular risk metric in financial investments. We use publicly available data from agmarknet portal in India to perform several thought experiments with ACRE.

After a thorough literature survey, we understood there are several ways of predicting the disease and yield prediction. We have developed two new and robust classifiers, one which processes images to predict the crop's diseases, and the second one uses the weather data to predict the same. Both classifiers use deep-learning technique Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) augmented with six neighborhood cellular automata to predict the crop disease and yield.

However, such techniques are rarely used in Sri Lankan agricultural industry. The success of agriculture depends heavily on the selection of the right crop. Choosing the right crop depends primarily on predicting future yields. Machine learning methods can be used very successfully to make future predictions about crop yields. Crop prediction mainly depends on the soil, geography, and climate of the growing location. Hence historical data with agricultural facts such as temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall are used to predict yield as parameters in the machine learning function. Sri Lanka uses a traditional approach to distribute fertilizers among farmers. Not having an organized way to distribute fertilizers to the needed areas leads to many abnormalities along the way. As a result, the country is facing economic losses and resource wastage. Having an optimized distribution network is the key to overcoming those abnormalities. This research assesses the efficiency of the fertilizer distribution system and consists of time-series predictions on fertilizer usage to gain future value.

Estimating jute yield is required for this. Jute has been cultivated for many years, and prehistoric methods were used to calculate productivity. Bangladesh used to have a sizable market for this fiber; in 1947-1948, it held an 80% share of the export market, but by 1975-1976 it fell to only 25%. To address this problem, we gathered jute data for 15 years, from 2007 to 2021, and to forecast jute yield, we used machine learning-based classification and regression techniques. In this paper, various machine learning methods have been compared. A model is first built using the input parameters, and the estimated jute yield is then obtained. The decision tree regressor performs better than other algorithms with an average prediction accuracy of 96%, whereas other machine learning algorithms gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and regressor have average prediction accuracy of around 92%,40%, and 42% respectively.

Agriculture employs over half of Bangladesh's people, and crops occupy more than 70% of the country's territory. More than 12 percent of revenue comes from the agriculture sector. But our lands are limited, and our population is growing day by day. That's it is required to increase the demand for crops continuously. So, it is a huge challenge to increase crop production. But our farmers face different types of problems during cultivation. They cannot justify which crop should be cultivated. Because of this, they did not get the expected yield. Machine learning plays a vital role in agricultural prediction. Crop prediction is a complex process. A massive amount of data is needed, like temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, dew etc. In this system, different types of machine learning algorithms are applied and which algorithm gives better accuracy has been determined. Random Forest is found to give the best accuracy and so it is applied to the dataset. Weather data is collected from NASA Power Access Viewer and crop data from different sources. Then 80% data for training and 20% for testing are applied to this dataset. 91% accuracy has been attained from the Random Forest algorithm, which will help the farmer to decide which crop should be cultivated.

We first increased the dimension of each data set by adding more features, and then we augmented the size of the data by merging the two data sets. To assess the effectiveness of data-augmentation approaches, we conducted three sets of experiments based on three data sets: the primary data sets, data sets with additional features and the augmented data sets obtained by merging, using five regression models (Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, Extreme Learning Machine, Artificial Neural Network, Deep Neural Network). To evaluate the models, we used cross-validation; the results showed an overall increase in performance with the augmented data.

In this work, we use high-resolution aerial imagery and output from high-precision harvesters to predict in-field harvest values for corn-raising farms in the US Midwest.

In data mining, data segregation is an important step in extracting useful information. Dividing strategies such as decision tree, neural network, SVM, Naive Bayes, and KNN which makes this task difficult due to a problem such as random selection of key parameters. Here we propose a crop prediction system using a decision tree and compare the results of the proposed system with the different class dividers.

Crop prediction methodology is used to predict the correct yield by sensing different soil parameters and atmospheric-related parameters. Parameters such as soil type, pH, and temperature. For that purpose, we used a cutting tree. Agricultural researchers around the world emphasize the need for an effective way to predict and improve crop growth.

It has an influence not only on the economics of the country but also on global food grain statistics. Food security is a major challenge due to the rapidly increasing global people as well as the reducing trend in yields of crops. Obtaining sustainable crop production is always a problem for agriculturists. Due to ever-changing climatic circumstances, achieving optimal agricultural output has always been a problem for farmers. Land types, resource availability, and fluctuating climate patterns are the main causes of agricultural production uncertainty. Thus, researchers are developing tools that can predict crop production correctly and effectively in advance, allowing farmers worldwide to act accordingly in strategies to respond to obstacles. Agronomic strategies used by farmers at various phases of crop production and meteorological elements have a significant impact on crop production output [5]. The supply of nutrients directly impacts crops and the production of crops. Crops require a variety of nutrients, which are branched into two groups based on their requirements: macroeconomic nutrients and essential micronutrients. Phosphorous (P), Nitrogen (N), Calcium (Ca), Zinc (Zn), Potassium (K), Boron (B), Iron (Fe),Magnesium (Mg), Sulphur (S), and other nutrients are among them. Many micronutrients in the crops regulate biochemical processes, give resistance to diseases, and ultimately degrade crop quality. As a result, regulated nutrient management is critical for increasing crop production and achieving the essential rise in output. Furthermore, minerals have an important function in soil fertility, making it more productive for crop development. The following review article is going to address the most current facts regarding nutrients along with their usage in agricultural production for crop development. © 2022 IEEE.","Crop Yield; Machine learning; Precise Agriculture; Soil Nutrients; Supervised Learning","Cultivation; Food supply; Learning systems; Machine learning; Nutrients; Precision agriculture; Trace elements; Agricultural productions; Agriculture productions; Crop development; Crop production; Crop yield; Machine-learning; Precise agriculture; Precision Agriculture; Precision machines; Soil nutrients; Crops",Conference Paper,Scopus

With the wider adoption of precision agriculture - an agriculture management strategy that involves gathering, processing and analyzing temporal, spatial and individual data - in both developed and developing countries, there is an increasing opportunity to harness accumulating, shareable, big data using artificial intelligence (AI) methods, collected from weather stations, field sensor networks, Internet-of-Things devices, unmanned aerial vehicles, and Earth observational satellites. This requires smart algorithms tailored to agricultural data types, integrated into digital solutions that are viable, flexible, and scalable for wide deployment for a wide variety of agricultural users and decision-makers. We discuss a novel AI approach that addresses the real-world problem of developing a viable solution for reliably, timely, and cost-effectively forecasting crop status across large agricultural regions using Earth observational information in near-real-time. Our approach is based on extracting time-conditioned topological features which characterize complex spatio-temporal dependencies between crop production regions and integrating such topological signatures into Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).

Precise prediction of crop yield focuses primarily on agriculture research that has a significant effect on making decisions such as import-export, pricing, and distribution of specific crops. There is a severe need to utilize advanced technologies in order to improve yield quality and creation, anticipate crop yields, and study crop diseases/infections. The most prevalent issue among farmers is that they do not select the appropriate crop based on their soil needs. As a result, they see a significant decrease in production. In this paper, we presented a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based crop classification system for precision agriculture selection to solve the farmers' dilemma. DRL-based advanced agriculture techniques eliminate bad options and boost production in the crop recommendation system.

Various factors affect the productivity and profitability of crops, and farmers often have limited know-how regarding the suitability of new crops and varieties to soil and weather conditions, the requirement of fertilizers and other inputs, and cultivation practices. Their knowledge about market conditions is also lacking in such cases. In addition, even among conventional crops, hundreds of varieties with different characteristics are now available to farmers. In order to make informed decisions regarding crop and variety selection, a large amount of information must be processed. This information is often highly technical and is unavailable in regional languages. With an ever-expanding number of crops, varieties and processes, as well as rapidly changing climatic and market conditions, knowledge transfer through established agricultural extension services has become inadequate. The growth in mobile phone usage over recent years can promote the use of mobile applications for this purpose. Such an application can process agricultural information to help farmers make informed decisions regarding crop selection and help them achieve greater productivity and profitability. This paper discusses the frameworks used to develop Krishi Mitr (Farmer Friend), a mobile application that can enable farmers to select crops that are best suited to their soil and weather while factoring in the costs of inputs and labor, sustainability, pests and diseases, as well as market conditions. The variables that are included in arriving at the selection, the crop-selection algorithm, and the deployment of the Krishi Mitr mobile application has been detailed in this paper. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Crop selection; Farmers; India; Mobile application; Optimization algorithm",,Conference Paper,Scopus

Because of the rapid expansion in human population, the ""Green Revolution"" introduced high yield variety (HYV) seeds, which increased crop productivity but degraded crop and soil quality. This is due to the use of excessive amounts of chemical fertilizers in HYV seeds, as well as the irrigation system utilized to grow these seeds. This stunts the growth of the crops, resulting in financial and productivity losses. Because of field surveys, traditional ways to crop production prediction will take longer, and contemporary agriculture will face certain obstacles. As a result, a comprehensive review of various crop key factors such as climatic factors, soil nutrients, production factors, and environmental factors is conducted using a variety of machine learning approaches such as Support Vector Machine, bayes classifier, decision tree, random forest, linear regression and Extreme Learning Machines. The accuracy measures such as root mean square error, coefficient of determination and mean absolute error are used for comparing the performance of the system.

In this paper, a hybrid learner ‘RaNN’ is proposed that combines the feature sampling and majority voting technique of Random Forest in-combination with the multilayer Feedforward Neural Network to predict the crop yield. Research has also ascertained the essential features responsible for accurate yield prediction. The proposed model works for rice yield prediction, one of the chief grains of India. The region chosen for the work is Punjab, which is among the largest producer states of India for rice. The dataset consists of 15 attributes comprising the weather and agriculture data collected from the Indian Meteorological Department Pune, and Punjab Environment Information System (ENVIS) Center, Government of India. The study has also made a comparative assessment of ‘RaNN’ with machine learning methods like Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Boosting Regression, Support Vector Machine Regression, Ensemble Learner, and Artificial Neural Network.

The prediction models developed calculate the fruit fresh weight based on the D leaf fresh weight (DLFW) and stem diameter (SD), measured at the time of floral induction. ANFIS were developed using the genfisOptions function of the Neuro Fuzzy Designer toolbox of the Matlab program (Mathworks®- Neuro Fuzzy Designer, R2018a), considering DLFW and SD as the entry parameters, single and combined. The yield prediction error was calculated using the root mean square error (RMSE). The RMSE found for all ANFIS developed were lower than that predicted by linear or quadratic regression models. The lowest RMSE was obtained when the parameters DLFW and SD were combined for the development of the ANFIS.

Inorder to identify the level and variety of fungal or viral disease manual examination have to be made. However, this is time-consuming, costly, and lacks the knowledge to recognize the disease at the proper time. This leads the farmers to apply preventive strategies to non-infected cassava plants and affects the yields.

A precise prediction of blueberry harvest losses is necessary to mitigate such losses. The performance of three machine learning (ML) algorithms was assessed to predict the wild blueberry harvest losses on the ground. The data from four commercial fields in Atlantic Canada (including Tracadie, Frank Webb, Small Scott, and Cooper fields) were utilized to achieve the goal. Wild blueberry losses (fruit loss on ground, leaf losses, blower losses) and yield were measured manually from randomly selected plots during mechanical harvesting. The plant height of wild blueberry, field slope, and fruit zone readings were collected from each of the plots. For the purpose of predicting ground loss as a function of fruit zone, plant height, fruit production, slope, leaf loss, and blower damage, three ML models i.e., support vector regression (SVR), linear regression (LR), and random forest (RF)—were used. Statistical parameters i.e., mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2), were used to assess the prediction accuracy of the models. The results of the correlation matrices showed that the blueberry yield and losses (leaf loss, blower loss) had medium to strong correlations accessed based on the correlation coefficient (r) range 0.37–0.79. The LR model showed the foremost predictions of ground loss as compared to all the other models analyzed. Tracadie, Frank Webb, Small Scott, and Cooper had R2 values of 0.87, 0.91, 0.91, and 0.73, respectively. Support vector regression performed comparatively better at all the fields i.e., R2 = 0.93 (Frank Webb field), R2 = 0.88 (Tracadie), and R2 = 0.79 (Cooper) except Small Scott field with R2 = 0.07. When comparing the actual and anticipated ground loss, the SVR performed best (R2 = 0.79–0.93) as compared to the other two algorithms i.e., LR (R2 = 0.73 to 0.92), and RF (R2 = 0.53 to 0.89) for the three fields. The outcomes revealed that these ML algorithms can be useful in predicting ground losses during wild blueberry harvesting in the selected fields. © 2022 by the authors.","harvesting losses; machine learning algorithms; wild blueberries",,Article,Scopus

One of these challenges is the growing quantity of food demand, which is highly vital for regional trade, food security, and meeting the nutritious requirements of the population. A timely prediction with accuracy about crop yield could be valuable for greater food production and maintainability of sustainable agricultural growth. This paper presents a predictive model of wheat production using machine learning. The northern areas of Pakistan which grow wheat are selected as a case study due to their importance in the country's agricultural sector. We collected data of five years and selected the best attribute subset related to crop production. We applied twelve (12) algorithms by dividing data samples into three sets. Experimental results helped to shortlist three algorithms for the final analysis i.e. Sequential Minimal Optimization Regression (SMOreg), Multilayer Processing (MLP) and Gaussian Process (GP). The Root Mean Square (RMSE) and Percentage Absolute Difference (PAD) metrics were used to validate the results. The SMOreg obtained the lowest PAD (0.0093) and RMSE (0.5552) values. MLP was a little closer with second-lowest PAD (0.0116) and RMSE (0.737) value. The performance of GP was found lowest due to higher PAD (0.2203) and RMSE (17.7423) values.

Accurate foresights of natural circumstances a year in advance can have a considerable impact on management decisions regarding crop selection, rotational location in crop rotations, agrotechnical methods employed, and long-term land use planning. One of the most important aspects of precision farming is sustainability. The novelty of this study is to evidence the effective of the temperature, pesticides, and rainfall environment parameters in the influence sustainable agriculture and economic efficiency at the farm level in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, predicting the future values of main crop yield in Saudi Arabia. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to estimate the impact of environment factors and agrotechnical parameters on agricultural crop yields and to anticipate yields is examined in this study. Using artificial neural networks (ANNs), a highly effective multilayer perceptron (MLP) model was built to accurately predict the crop yield, temperature, insecticides, and rainfall based on environmental data. The dataset is collected from different Saudi Arabia regions from 1994 to 2016, including the temperature, insecticides, rainfall, and crop yields for potatoes, rice, sorghum, and wheat. For this study, we relied on five different statistical evaluation metrics: the mean square error (MSE), the root-mean-square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), Pearson's correlation coefficient (R%), and the determination coefficient (R2). Analyses of datasets for crop yields, temperature, and insecticides led to the development of the MLP models. The datasets are randomly divided into separate samples, 70% for training and 30% for testing. The best-performing MLP model is characterized by values of (R = 100%) and (R2 = 96:33) for predicting insecticides in the testing process. The temperature, insecticides, and rainfall were examined with different crop yields to confirm the effectiveness of these parameters for increasing product crop yields in Saudi Arabia; we found that these items had highest relationships. The average values are RD98:20%, 96.50, and 99.14% with for the temperature, insecticides, and rainfall, respectively. Based on these findings, it appeared that each of the parameter categories that are considered (temperature, pesticides, and rainfall) had a similar contribution to the accuracy of anticipated yield projection. © Copyright 2022 Al-Adhaileh and Aldhyani","Artificial intelligence; Crop yield; Food security; Prediction model","Correlation methods; Crop rotation; Errors; Food supply; Forecasting; Insecticides; Land use; Mean square error; Multilayer neural networks; Sustainable development; Agricultural productions; Critical issues; Crop yield; Food security; Management decisions; Multilayers perceptrons; Prediction modelling; Production optimization; Root mean square errors; Saudi Arabia; Rain",Article,Scopus

Healthy and fruitful crops are of immense importance for a government to fulfill the food requirements of its inhabitants. Because of land diversities, weather conditions, geographical locations, defensive measures against diseases, and natural disasters, monitoring crops with human intervention becomes quite challenging. Conventional crop classification and yield estimation methods are ineffective under unfavorable circumstances. This research exploits modern precision agriculture tools for enhanced remote crop yield estimation, and types classification by proposing a fuzzy hybrid ensembled classification and estimation method using remote sensory data. The architecture enhances the pooled images with fuzzy neighborhood spatial filtering, scaling, flipping, shearing, and zooming. The study identifies the optimal weights of the strongest candidate classifiers for the ensembled classification method adopting the bagging strategy. We augmented the imagery datasets to achieve an unbiased classification between different crop types, including jute, maize, rice, sugarcane, and wheat. Further, we considered flaxseed, lentils, rice, sugarcane, and wheat for yield estimation on publicly available datasets provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the Word Bank DataBank. The ensemble method outperformed the individual classification methods for crop type classification on an average of 13% and 24% compared to the highest gradient boosting and lowest decision tree methods, respectively. Similarly, we observed that the gradient boosting predictor outperformed the multivariate regressor, random forest, and decision tree regressor, with a comparatively lower mean square error value on yield years 2017 to 2021. Further, the proposed architecture supports embedded devices, where remote devices can adopt a lightweight classification algorithm, such as MobilenetV2. This can significantly reduce the processing time and overhead of a large set of pooled images. © 2023 by the authors.","data analysis; data augmentation; deep learning; feature extraction; precision agriculture; sensory images",,Article,Scopus

Agriculture contributes major part towards India's GDP. There is a need to increase crop productivity. The production of a particular farm depends upon soil characteristics, environmental characteristics, but major part goes to crop selection to get a better yield. Farmers sometimes lack the knowledge to choose the best crop for their land using conventional and non-scientific methods. Incorrect crop selection can lead to loss. This work focuses on figuring out the best crop to cultivate in order to get optimum yield based on the site-specific parameters. Our proposed model takes the data of soil characteristics, environmental characteristics of a farm and the appropriate crop recommendations are given to the farmer based on the parameter values. Crop Recommendation is done through an Ensemble model using KNN, Random Forest, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Logistic regression, SVM as base learners. To increase overall performance, the ensemble model employed in this work includes decisions from various base learners. The Majority Voting mechanism is used for combining these base learners.

Under the pressure of feeding a growing population, accurate and timely estimation of corn yield before the harvest is of great importance to supply chain management and regional food security. Recently, machine learning (ML) in conjunction with satellite remote sensing has been used for developing corn yield prediction models. Despite the success, a major bottleneck of training a reliable supervised ML model is the need for representative ground truth labels (e.g., yield records), which may be limited or even not available due to financial and manpower reasons. Also, due to domain shift, an ML model trained with labeled data from a label-rich region (i.e., source domain) could experience a significant performance decrease when directly applied to the region of interest (i.e., target domain). To address this issue, we proposed a Bayesian domain adversarial neural network (BDANN) for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on county-level corn yield prediction. By applying adversarial learning and Bayesian inference, BDANN was trained to reduce domain shift and accurately predict corn yield by extracting domain-invariant and task-informative features from both source and target domains. Moreover, the results also demonstrated that the BDANN model generalized well on small training sets. Experiments in two ecoregions in the U.S. corn belt have shown the effectiveness of the proposed BDANN and its superiority over other state-of-the-art methods. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Adversarial learning; Bayesian inference; corn yield prediction; domain adaptation; remote sensing","Bayesian networks; Crops; Food supply; Forecasting; Image segmentation; Inference engines; Neural networks; Supervised learning; Adversarial learning; Bayes method; Bayesian inference; Biological system modeling; Corn yield prediction; Corn yields; Domain adaptation; Features extraction; Neural-networks; Predictive models; Remote-sensing; Yield prediction; Remote sensing; artificial neural network; Bayesian analysis; crop yield; ecoregion; remote sensing; supply chain management; United States",Article,Scopus

A crop variety yield prediction system based on variety yield data compensation (CVYPS-VYDC) is described in this paper. This novel system is used to predict the yield of designated crop varieties using the large amount of breeding data stored in the Golden Seed Breeding Cloud Platform and meteorological data from the National Meteorological Science Data Center. The prediction system was devised to (a) forecast the yield of designated crop varieties in the target ecological regions, (b) calculate the effects of different environmental factors on the yield of different crop varieties, (c) identify the key growth periods affecting crop yield, and (d) promote crop varieties according to a comprehensive analysis of the promoted variety yield, preferences for different meteorological factors, and climatic characteristics of the target ecological regions. In addition to meteorological factors, soil factors affect crop yield. However, large-scale measurements of soil composition require a large number of sensors and considerable human resources. By using the yield data compensation method, the yield data of predicted varieties across different regions were expanded and corrected, which reduces the yield prediction error caused by soil differences among regions to some extent. In addition, the coefficient of determination (R2) between actual and predicted yield was improved to 0.82. In addition to predicting the yield of 90 maize varieties in the Huang-Huai-Hai area of China, the preferences of different maize varieties for different environmental factors were analyzed at the same time. CVYPS-VYDC identified the key environmental factors greatly impacting the maize yield, and the proportion by which different factors affected the yield prediction of different maize varieties was determined.

Farmers can use sensor nodes in the field to understand their crops on a microscopic size, which saves resources and decreases environmental impact. Stem borers, bollworms, thrips, and other pests destroy crops. For instance, Stem borer is an attack that causes plant leaves to wilt, the base of the plant to exhibit holes, and the color of the plant to shift from green to orange-yellow. If the stem borer spreads to other crops, the plant's growth tips, or the youngest leaves, will be killed. These types of issues are identified in this paper employing sensor nodes. Using the WSN, the affected area of the crop is first determined. The remaining parts of the field will be protected from attacks by detecting the malicious part. Second, the discovered afflicted sections of the crop are analyzed by using the Machine Learning (ML) algorithm in order to prove that the crop has been attacked by some disease. Finally, both the outcomes are examined to determine the disease spread. This research provides On-Off attack mitigation for wireless sensor networks' trust systems, which assists in the prevention of various crop diseases and attacks.

By calculating advanced production methods and the rational valuation of different factors, we can accurately capture the variety of growth characteristics and the expected yield. This paper obtained 32 feature variables related to melons, including phenological features, shape features, and color features. The Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) network and the Grid Search (GS) hyperparameter seeking method was applied to calculate the degree of importance of all melon fruits' characteristics and construct prediction models for three expected harvest indexes of melon yield, sugar content, and endocarp hardness. To facilitate growers to carry out prediction and estimation in the field without destroying the melon fruits. The reduced feature variables were selected as inputs. The GBDT model was used to provide a significant advantage in prediction compared to both Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) methods. In addition, to verify the feasibility of using only reduced feature variables as input for the evaluation work, this study also compares the predictive effects of the model when all feature variables and only reduced feature variables are used. The GBDT prediction model proposed in this paper predicted melon yield, sugar content, and hardness using reduced features as input, and the model R2 could reach more than 90%.

The accurate prediction of wheat yield is a hard process that requires information such as location and climatic conditions. In this paper, the accurate prediction of wheat yield is facilitated by integrating both the current and past data of the soil, and climate, along with the spatial features obtained from satellite images. Initially, the normalization of data is carried out to balance the values of different ranges. Then the measurement of current readings of soil characteristics such as soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, and precipitations along with the climatic conditions is performed. These measurements along with the previous historical measurements were considered in order to perform an effective prediction of wheat yield. The multi-kernel-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) is implemented for this purpose. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated in terms of performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F score.

Climate rating was calculated from meteorological data by Food and Agriculture Organization framework. Saffron observed yield obtained from saffron field data. The results showed that coarse fragment, gypsum, electrical conductivity, organic carbon, cation exchange capacity, pH, calcium carbonate equivalent and climate rating have the highest correlation with saffron yield. The range of saffron estimated yield was between 1937–4124 and 1843–4025 kg per hectare for combination model and fuzzy model, respectively.

Especially for the cultivation of industrial tomato, harvest is conducted when the total soluble solids, a major quality characteristic, are as high as possible. Advancements in technology have made Decision Support Systems simpler and more applicable in an everyday basis. Data Analysis, combined with Machine Learning algorithms are considered the future of sustainable agriculture, allowing farmers to be advised about the best possible decisions for their cultivation. Farmers need to adopt this kind of technology in order to be able to know when the quality of tomatoes is at its peak, in order to gather their product from the field. The implementation of a Decision Support System to predict the total soluble solids was conducted, based on data from previous years, including quality data (pH, Bostwick, L, a/b, Mean Weight, °Brix), the type of hybrid used, weather data and soil data from the fields.

Temperature, rainfall amount, and reference evapotranspiration are major climatic factors affecting maize yield. They are not only interdependent but also have significantly changed due to climate change, which causes nonlinearity and nonstationarity in weather data. Hence, there exists a need for a stochastic process for predicting maize yield with higher precision. To solve the problem, this paper constructs a joint stochastic process that acquires joints effects of the three weather processes from joint a probability density function (pdf) constructed using copulas that maintain interdependence. Stochastic analyses are applied on the pdf and process to account for nonlinearity and nonstationarity, and also establish a corresponding stochastic differential equation (SDE) for maize yield. The trivariate stochastic process predicts maize yield with R2=0.8389 and MAPE=4.31% under a deep learning framework. Its aggregated values predict maize yield with R2 up to 0.9765 and MAPE=1.94% under common machine learning algorithms. Comparatively, the R2 is 0.8829% and MAPE=4.18%, under the maize yield SDE. Thus, the joint stochastic process can be used to predict maize yield with higher precision. © 2022 Patrick Chidzalo et al.",,"Climate change; Deep learning; Differential equations; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Probability density function; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Crop loss; High-precision; Maize yield; Non-stationarities; Reference evapotranspiration; Stochastic differential equations; Stochastic weather models; Sub-Saharan; Trivariate; Yield prediction; Random processes",Article,Scopus

Therefore, this article provides a comprehensive survey of the existing smart farming models for precision agriculture. The survey focused on machine learning approaches such as supervised, unsupervised, deep learning and ensemble techniques employed in smart farming. In addition, smart farming innovations for predicting key agrarian practices such as soil, crop yield, and fertilizer including weather and irrigation models were reviewed. Thus, poor performance of some models is observed and attributed to the dataset used, negligence of pre-processing and feature extraction stages by some researchers. Consequently, the survey projected a machine learning procedure that if duly followed would prevent such limitations in smart farming models.

Food security is important for decision-makers. The agriculture industry can more accurately supply human demand for food if the crop yield is predicted accurately. Tomato is one of the most important crops so that 160 million tonnes of tomatoes are produced annually around the world. In this study, tomato yield based on data of 40 cities of Iran country including annual average temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), effective rainfall (R), wind speed (WS), and Evapotranspiration (EV) for the period of 1968–2018 was predicted using a new Bayesian model averaging (BMA). The paper's main innovation is the use of the new BMA so that it allows the modellers to quantify the uncertainty of model parameters and inputs simultaneously. For this aim, first, the multiple Adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface system (ANFIS) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) were used for predicting crop yield. To train the ANFIS and MLP model, a new algorithm, namely, multi verse optimization algorithm (MOA) was used. Also, the ability of MOA was benchmarked against the particle swarm optimization (PSO), and firefly algorithm (FFA). In the next level, the new BMA used the outputs of the ANFIS-MOA, MLP-MOA, ANFIS, FFA, MLP-FFA, ANFIS-PSO, MLP-PSO, ANFIS, and MLP for predicting tomato yield in an ensemble framework. The five- input combination of RH, T, and R, WS, and EV gave the best result. The mean absolute error (MAE) of the BMA in the testing level was 20.12 (Ton/ha) while it was 24.12, 24.45, 24.67, 25.12, 29.12, 30.12, 31.12, and 33.45 for the ANFIS-MOA, MLP-MOA, ANFIS-FFA, MLP-FFA, ANFIS-PSO, MLP-PSO, ANFIS, and MLP models. Regarding the results of uncertainty analysis, the uncertainty of BMA was lower than those of the ANFIS-MOA, MLP-MOA, ANFIS-FFA, MLP-FFA, ANFIS-PSO, MLP-PSO, ANFIS, and MLP models while the MLP model provided the highest uncertainty. The results of this study indicated that BMA using multiple MLP and ANFIS model was useful for predicting tomato yield. © 2022 THE AUTHORS","Agriculture; ANFIS; Climate parameters; Crop yield; MLP","Bayesian networks; Climate models; Crops; Decision making; Food supply; Forecasting; Fruits; Fuzzy inference; Uncertainty analysis; Wind; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface system; Bayesian model averaging; Climate parameters; Crop yield; Firefly algorithms; Fuzzy interface systems; Multilayers perceptrons; Optimization algorithms; System layer; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",Article,Scopus

Since there is a tendency towards increased weather extremes in the future, understanding weather-related yield factors becomes increasingly important not only for yield prediction, but also for the design of insurance products. Although insurance products mitigate financial losses for farmers, they suffer from considerable basis risk, i.e., a discrepancy between losses and the indemnity payment. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to explore the potential of machine learning for estimating the relationship between crop yield and weather conditions at the farm level and to use it as a tool for reducing basis risk in index insurance applications. METHODS: An artificial neural network was set up and calibrated to a rich set of farm-level yield data in Germany, covering the period from 2003 to 2018. A nonlinear regression model, which uses rainfall, temperature, and soil moisture as explanatory variables for yield deviations, served as a benchmark. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The empirical application revealed that compared with traditional estimation approaches, the gain in forecasting precision by using machine learning techniques was substantial. Moreover, the use of regionalized models and disaggregated high-resolution weather data improved the performance of artificial neural networks. A considerable part of yield variability at the farm level, however, could not be captured by statistical methods which solely use “big weather data”. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings have important implications for the design of weather-index based insurance because they document that a rather high level of basis risk remains if insurance products are based on an estimation of the weather-yield relationship. © 2021 The Authors","Basis risk; Index insurance; Machine learning; Weather risk; Yield prediction","artificial diet; artificial nest; artificial neural network; crop production; crop yield; exploration; machine learning; soil moisture; spatiotemporal analysis; Germany",Article,Scopus

Climate is a major factor that affects production of vegetables and other crops there by having direct impact on pricing. Among the main challenges faced by farmers is accurate prediction of vegetable prices. Farmers therefore need to acquire a better and advanced knowledgeable model to assist them in taking proper decisions when budgeting on how much to spend on planting so that it's proportional to the expected prices of the produce, in prediction of the climatic change effects on vegetable prices, a call for variables and parameters that show the response of vegetable prices, production, consumption and storage with weather conditions is necessary. The most common approach is using the statistical models that are trained using historical yield data with simplified weather measurements, for example average temperature in the growing season, humidly and rainfall. However, such approaches do not take into consideration the weather effects on entire vegetable lifecycle inclusive of the prices for yields necessitating the need for this study. This paper presents a study on Fuzzy based vegetable price prediction considering various changes in climatic parameters including humidity, rainfall and temperature. This system model was developed based on a 4- year vegetable price data and climatic data of the same period for Kisumu (Kenya). The results show that this model can indeed be used by farmers to predict prices and hence assist them to make informed vegetable farming and investment decisions. © 2022 The Authors.

The results justified that the NSI model increased WUE by 1.90 kg/m3 and 3.13 kg/m3, and yield by 8.57% and 14.30% compared to TSFI and BI methods, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed SO-ANFIS has achieved the performance of 0.989 and 0.988 in terms of R2 criterion in estimating WUE and yield of NSI irrigation method, respectively. The results confirmed that the SO-ANFIS outperformed the counterpart methods in terms of performance measures. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"agriculture; apple; article; climate; fuzzy system; machine learning; nonhuman; orchard; plant water use; season; agriculture; algorithm; fuzzy logic; machine learning; water; Agriculture; Algorithms; Fuzzy Logic; Machine Learning; Water",Article,Scopus

The traditional rice almanac used astronomical and climate factors to estimate yield response. However, this research integrated meteorological, agro-chemical, and soil physiographic factors for yield response prediction. Besides, the impact of those factors on the production of three major rice ecotypes has also been studied in this research. Moreover, this study found a different set of those factors with respect to the yield response of different rice ecotypes. Machine learning algorithms named Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) have been used for predicting the yield response. The SVR shows better results than XGBoost for predicting the yield of the Aus rice ecotype, whereas XGBoost performs better for forecasting the yield of the Aman and Boro rice ecotypes. The result shows that the root mean squared error (RMSE) of three different ecotypes are in between 9.38% and 24.37% and that of R-squared values are between 89.74% and 99.13% on two different machine learning algorithms.

This study analyzes the performance of machine learning and deep learning methods for winter wheat yield prediction using an extensive dataset of weather, soil, and crop phenology variables in 271 counties across Germany from 1999 to 2019. We proposed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which uses a 1-dimensional convolution operation to capture the time dependencies of environmental variables. We used eight supervised machine learning models as baselines and evaluated their predictive performance using RMSE, MAE, and correlation coefficient metrics to benchmark the yield prediction results. Our findings suggested that nonlinear models such as the proposed CNN, Deep Neural Network (DNN), and XGBoost were more effective in understanding the relationship between the crop yield and input data compared to the linear models. Our proposed CNN model outperformed all other baseline models used for winter wheat yield prediction (7 to 14% lower RMSE, 3 to 15% lower MAE, and 4 to 50% higher correlation coefficient than the best performing baseline across test data). We aggregated soil moisture and meteorological features at the weekly resolution to address the seasonality of the data. We also moved beyond prediction and interpreted the outputs of our proposed CNN model using SHAP and force plots which provided key insights in explaining the yield prediction results (importance of variables by time). We found DUL, wind speed at week ten, and radiation amount at week seven as the most critical features in winter wheat yield prediction. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"machine learning; season; soil; wheat; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Seasons; Soil; Triticum",Article,Scopus

Even more informative, challenging though, than predicting a single number is predicting a distribution regarding an agricultural yield (random) variable such as fruit weight. Cumulative distribution functions are often elusive in practice, moreover they could be nonstationary. Nevertheless, estimates of cumulative distribution functions can be induced from data samples at a sampling time. This work interprets an aforementioned estimate as a cumulative possibility distribution, which is represented by an Intervals’ Number (IN) based on the resolution identity theorem of fuzzy set theory. The orientation of this work is toward real-world applications. Optimizable parametric difference equations, defined in the metric cone of lattice-ordered INs, are proposed toward predicting an IN from past INs. Computational experiments are carried out on data collected from vineyards in northern Greece. Preliminary application results demonstrate, comparatively, the capacity of the proposed method.

The sugarcane yield data were acquired from sugarcane fields around the Godavari Bio-refineries Limited (GBL) factory in Karnataka, India, during the 2017-2018 sugarcane growing season. A dataset detailing agronomic information and VIs was prepared for yield prediction. The study area comprises seven sugarcane growing talukas. The second-degree polynomial regression was used for predicting the sugarcane yield as it had the best fit for the distribution of variables. The green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) recorded the highest R2, i.e., 0.71 during November month with a coefficient of variance of 0.83, with all other indices characterized by R2 values ranging from 0.42(modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index) to 0.69 (normalized difference red edge), suggesting the GNDVI's potential for sugarcane yield prediction. Comparing the actual yield with the predicted yield, the RF prediction and second-degree polynomial regression model exhibited accuracies of 90.42% and 88%, respectively.

Still, agriculture is not profitable as many farmers take the worse step as they cannot survive from the burden of loans. So, one such place where there is yet large scope to develop is agriculture. In comparison with other countries, India has the highest production rate in agriculture. However, still, most agricultural fields are underdeveloped due to the lack of deployment of ecosystem control technologies. Agriculture when combined with technology can bring the finest results. Crop yield depends on multiple climatic conditions such as air temperature, soil temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. In general, farmers depend on self-monitoring and experience for harvesting fields. Scarcity of water is a main issue in today’s life. This scarcity is affecting people worldwide. So water is also a vital component of crop yield, here we are considering rainfall instead direct water. Predicting the crop selection/yield in advance of its harvest would help the policymakers and farmers for taking appropriate measures for farming, marketing, and storage. Thus, in this paper we propose a crop selection using machine learning technique as support vector machine (SVM) and polynomial regression. This model will help the farmers to know the yield of their crop before cultivating the agricultural field and thus help them to make the appropriate decisions. It attempts to solve the issue by building a prototype of an interactive prediction system. Accurate yield prediction is required to be done after understanding the functional relationship between yield and these parameters because along with all advances in the machines and technologies used in farming, useful and accurate information about different matters also plays a significant role in it. In this paper, we have simulated SVM and polynomial regression technique to predict which crop can yield better profit.

The difficulty of creating a yield forecast system is in the correct choice of predictors that have the greatest impact on yield. To build the model, moisture in the 100 cm layer of the soil, the content of nitrogen, phosphorus, humus, and soil acidity in the soil were used as input parameters. The amount of precipitation over 4 months, the average air temperature for the same period, as well as the presence of diseases, pests, and weeds were also taken into consideration. Data on 13 districts of the North Kazakhstan region in the period from 2008 to 2017 were used. The output parameter was the yield of spring wheat over the same time period. The relative importance of input variables in relation to the output variable was used to determine the weight values of input variables. An artificial neural network of error backpropagation was used as a method. The advantage of this method is that the quality of the forecast increases with a large amount of training data, as well as the ability to model nonlinear relationships between different data sources. After training the artificial neural network and obtaining predictive data, good results were achieved for predicting wheat yields (p = 0.52, mean absolute error in percentage (MAPE) = 12.02 %, root mean square error (RMSE) = 3.368). Thus, it is assumed that the developed model for forecasting wheat yields based on data can be easily adapted for other crops and places and will allow the adoption of the right strategies to ensure food security © 2022.

In this work, we propose a novel generative modeling technique for plant growth prediction based on conditional generative adversarial networks. We formulate plant growth as an image-to-image translation task and predict the appearance of a plant growth stage as a function of its previous stage. We take into account that plant growth is inherently multi-modal, depending on numerous and highly variable environmental factors, and thus a single input belongs to a distribution of potential outputs. We encode the ambiguity in an interpretable and low-dimensional latent vector space representing the various factors of variation that are influencing plant growth. We use a novel encoder-based data fusion technique and combine information contained in remote sensing imagery of different cropping systems with data containing the factors of variation to adequately model plant growth. This offers several advantages over existing methods: (1) we show that we can model a distribution of potential appearances and simultaneously outperform existing methods in providing more realistic predictions, (2) the complexity of plant growth is more adequately captured, as various factors influencing plant growth can be included, (3) predictions are controllable by being conditioned by an interpretable latent vector representing the factors of variation along with an input image of a previous growth stage. © 2022 IEEE.",,"Data fusion; Decision making; Farms; Forecasting; Generative adversarial networks; Remote sensing; Decisions makings; Generative model; Image generations; Latent vectors; Modelling techniques; Multimodal images; Plant development; Plant growth; Plant growth modeling; Precision-farming; Vector spaces",Conference Paper,Scopus

Corn planting and harvest scheduling is challenging because corn hybrids have different planting windows, and, subsequently, inaccurate planting and harvest scheduling can result in inconsistent and unpredictable weekly harvest quantities and logistical and productivity issues. In the 2021 Syngenta Crop Challenge, participants were given several large datasets including recorded historical daily growing degree units (GDU) of two sites and provided with planting windows, required GDUs, and harvest quantities of corn hybrids planted in these two sites, and were asked to schedule planting and harvesting dates of corn hybrids under two storage capacity cases so that facilities are not over capacity in harvesting weeks and have consistent weekly harvest quantities. The research problem includes determining the planting and harvest scheduling of corn hybrids under two storage capacity cases: (1) given the maximum storage capacity, and (2) without maximum storage capacity to determine the lowest storage capacity for each site. To help improve corn planting and harvest scheduling, we propose two mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models and a heuristic algorithm to solve this problem for both storage capacity cases. Daily GDUs are required for planting and harvest scheduling, but they are unknown at the beginning of the growing season. As such, we use recurrent neural networks to predict the weekly GDUs of 70 weeks and consider this as the predicted GDU scenario to solve this problem. In addition, we solve this problem considering all given 10 historical GDU scenarios from 2010 to 2019 together for both storage capacity cases to include historical GDUs directly to our model rather than using predicted GDUs. Our extensive computational experiments and results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, which can provide optimal planting and harvest scheduling considering deterministic GDU scenario and uncertainties in historical GDU scenarios for both storage capacity cases to provide consistent weekly harvest quantities that are below the maximum capacity. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"adult; article; computer heuristics; crop production; growing season; human; price; productivity; recurrent neural network; system analysis; uncertainty; crop production; maize; uncertainty; Crop Production; Humans; Uncertainty; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Multiple linear regression (MLR) is the benchmark method commonly using to identify suitable factors for crop improvement. It doesn’t work always due to stringent assumption (Multicollinearity, Linearity) behind the MLR model. Here we tried to develop an efficient model for the selection of major traits that contribute to seed yield in soybean by comparing different models. Methods: Field experiment was conducted using 98 soybean core population through augmented design. 18 morphometric traits obtain from soybean core population were considered under the study as regressors. Multiple linear regression (MLR), principle component regression (PCR), regression tree and Random Forest models were compared to select traits based on prediction accuracy. Result: All the models identified the number of pods per plant (NPP) has the most influencing variable to the soybean yield. However random forest has a much higher prediction power (RMSE=4.59, MAPE=0.18) compared to other models under study. The results of random forest revealed that the number of pods per plant, number of branches per plant and other associated characters like plant height at harvest as highly influencing traits for seed yield in soybean.

Because the yield per unit area, planting area of crops, and effective precipitation in the region are uncertain, it is not easy to plan the amount of irrigation water for crops. In order to improve the applicability of the uncertainty programming model, a hybrid LSTM-CPP-FPP-IPP model (long short-term memory, chance-constrained programming, fuzzy possibility programming, interval parameter programming) was developed to plan the irrigation water allocation of irrigation system under uncertainty. The LSTM (long short-term memory) model was used to predict crop yield per unit area, and CPP-FPP-IPP programming (chance-constrained programming, fuzzy possibility programming, interval parameter programming) was used to plan the crop area and the effective precipitation under uncertainty. The hybrid model was used for the crop production profit of winter wheat and summer corn in five cities in the North China Plain. The average absolute error between the model prediction value and the actual value of the yield per unit area of winter wheat and summer maize in four cities in 2020 was controlled within the range of 14.02 to 696.66 kg/hectare. It shows that the model can more accurately predict the yield per unit area of crops. The planning model for the benefit of irrigation water allocation generated three scenarios of rainfall level and four planting intentions, and compared the planned scenarios with the actual production benefits of the two crops in 2020. In a dry year, the possibility of planting areas for winter wheat and summer corn is optimized. Compared with the traditional deterministic planning method, the model takes into account the uncertain parameters, which helps decision makers seek better solutions under uncertain conditions. © 2022 by the authors.

Several studies have been conducted to forecast agricultural yields using machine learning algorithms (MLA), but few studies have used ensemble machine learning algorithms (EMLA). In the current study, we use a dataset generated by a computer simulation program, and meteorological data obtained over 30 years from Maine, United States (USA). The primary goal of this research is to increase the forecast accuracy of the best characteristics for overcoming hunger challenges. We adopted stacking regression (SR) and cascading regression (CR) with a novel combination of MLA based on the wild blueberry dataset. We used features that indicated the best regulation for wild blueberry agroecosystems. Four feature engineering selection techniques are applied, namely variance inflation factor (VIF), sequential forward feature selection (SFFS), sequential backward elimination feature selection (SBEFS), and extreme gradient boosting based on feature importance (XFI). We applied Bayesian optimization on popular MLA to obtain the best hyperparameters to achieve accurate wild blueberry yield prediction. The SR used a two-layer structure: level-0 containing light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), gradient boost regression (GBR) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and level-1 providing the output prediction using a Ridge. The CR topology is the same MLA used in SR, but in a series form that takes the new prediction as a feeder to each MLA and removes the previous prediction in each stage. We assessed the CR, and SR with outcomes according to the root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2). In the results, the proposed SR showed the best performance with R2 of 0.984 and RMSE of 179.898 compared with another study that reported R2 of 0.938 and RMSE of 343.026 on the seven features selected by XFI.

Accurate wheat yield prediction is critical to satisfying local consumption and increasing exports regionally and globally to meet human food security. This paper incorporates remote satellite-based information in a wheat-growing region in South Australia to estimate the yield by integrating the kernel ridge regression (KRR) method coupled with complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and the grey wolf optimisation (GWO). The hybrid model, ‘GWO-CEEMDAN-KRR,’ employing an initial pool of 23 different satellite-based predictors, is seen to outperform all the benchmark models and all the feature selection (ant colony, atom search, and particle swarm optimisation) methods that are implemented using a set of carefully screened satellite variables and a feature decomposition or CEEMDAN approach. A suite of statistical metrics and infographics comparing the pre-dicted and measured yield shows a model prediction error that can be reduced by ~20% by employing the proposed GWO-CEEMDAN-KRR model. With the metrics verifying the accuracy of simulations, we also show that it is possible to optimise the wheat yield to achieve agricultural profits by quantifying and including the effects of satellite variables on potential yield. With further improvements in the proposed methodology, the GWO-CEEMDAN-KRR model can be adopted in agricultural yield simulation that requires remote sensing data to establish the relationships between crop health, yield, and other productivity features to support precision agriculture. © 2022 by the authors.

However, to save energy, water and nutrients, additional parameters related to crop performance and physiology will have to be considered. In addition, detecting crop stress before it is clearly visible by naked eye is an advantage that could aid in microclimate control. In this study, a Machine Learning (ML) model which takes into account microclimate and crop physiological data to detect different types of crop stress was developed and tested. For this purpose, a multi-sensor platform was used to record tomato plant physiological characteristics under different fertigation and air temperature conditions. The innovation of the current model lies in the integration of photosynthesis rate (Ps) values estimated by means of remote sensing using a photochemical reflectance index (PRI). Through this process, the time-series Ps data were combined with crop leaf temperature and microclimate data by means of the ML model. Two different algorithms were evaluated: Gradient Boosting (GB) and MultiLayer perceptron (MLP). Two runs with different structures took place for each algorithm. In RUN 1, there were more feature inputs than the outputs to build a model with high predictive accuracy. However, in order to simplify the process and develop a user-friendly approach, a second, different run was carried out. Thus, in RUN 2, the inputs were fewer than the outputs, and that is why the performance of the model in this case was lower than in the case of RUN 1. Particularly, MLP showed 91% and 83% accuracy in the training sample, and 89% and 82% in testing sample, for RUNs 1 and 2, respectively. GB showed 100% accuracy in the training sample for both runs, and 91% and 83% in testing sample in RUN 1 and RUN 2, respectively. To improve the accuracy of RUN 2, a larger database is required. Both models, however, could easily be incorporated into existing greenhouse climate monitoring and control systems, replacing human experience in detecting greenhouse crop stress conditions. © 2022 by the authors.","gradient boosting; microclimate; multilayer perceptron; photosynthesis rate; soft sensor",,Article,Scopus

This study investigated lettuce yield (fresh weight) prediction using four machine learning (ML) models, namely, support vector regressor (SVR), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), random forest (RF), and deep neural network (DNN). It was cultivated in three hydroponics systems (i.e., suspended nutrient film technique system, pyramidal aeroponic system, and tower aeroponic system), which interacted with three different magnetic unit strengths under a controlled greenhouse environment during the growing season in 2018 and 2019. Three scenarios consisting of the combinations of input variables (i.e., leaf number, water consumption, dry weight, stem length, and stem diameter) were assessed. The XGB model with scenario 3 (all input variables) yielded the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 8.88 g followed by SVR with the same scenario that achieved 9.55 g, and the highest result was by RF with scenario 1 (i.e., leaf number and water consumption) that achieved 12.89 g. All model scenarios having Scatter Index (SI) (i.e., RMSE divided by the average values of the observed yield) values less than 0.1 were classified as excellent in predicting fresh lettuce yield. Based on all of the performance statistics, the two best models were SVR with scenario 3 and DNN with scenario 2 (i.e., leaf number, water consumption, and dry weight). However, DNN with scenario 2 requiring less input variables is preferred. The potential of the DNN model to predict fresh lettuce yield is promising, and it can be applied on a large scale as a rapid tool for decision-makers to manage crop yield.

Farmers don’t have the complete knowledge of soil essentials such as minerals, moisture, and other factors required. So, they often grow inappropriate crops on certain agricultural land, which leads a farmer to suffer financially and mentally due to the economic loss caused by it. Our main objective in this research work is to address this issue by building a recommendation system that uses machine learning and image processing techniques. By using our model, the farmers can predict the accurate farm for the agricultural land to be grown and detect the pests that may affect it. We have applied the KNN classification algorithm, XGBoost classification algorithm, random forest classification algorithm, and artificial neural network classification algorithm in this paper and found that the XGBoost classification algorithm outperforms the other algorithms. Along with producing a recommendation for best crop selection using these classification algorithms, we have also introduced a collaborative convolution neural network model, with the help of which farmers can put the image of a crop and based on that our model can predict whether it is infected or not.

The rapid and accurate estimation of winter wheat yields over large areas is an important prerequisite for food security policy formulation and implementation. In most county-level yield estimation processes, multiple input data are used for yield prediction as much as possible, however, in some regions, data are more difficult to obtain, so we used the single-leaf area index (LAI) as input data for the model for yield prediction. In this study, the effects of different time steps as well as the LAI time series on the estimation results were analyzed for the properties of long short-term memory (LSTM), and multiple machine learning methods were compared with yield estimation models constructed by the LSTM networks. The results show that the accuracy of the yield estimation results using LSTM did not show an increasing trend with the increasing step size and data volume, while the yield estimation results of the LSTM were generally better than those of conventional machine learning methods, with the best R2 and RMSE results of 0.87 and 522.3 kg/ha, respectively, in the comparison between predicted and actual yields. Although the use of LAI as a single input factor may cause yield uncertainty in some extreme years, it is a reliable and promising method for improving the yield estimation, which has important implications for crop yield forecasting, agricultural disaster monitoring, food trade policy, and food security early warning. © 2022 by the authors.","deep learning; LAI; LSTM; winter wheat; yield estimation",,Article,Scopus

The findings of the study described in this paper are predicated on the assumption that the method of machine learning results in an improvement in the accuracy of the prediction of soil chemical characteristics. The correlations that were discovered as a result of this research are essential for comprehending the comprehensive approach to predicting the soil attributes using ML/DL models. A number of findings from previous study have been reported and analysed. A state of the art machine learning algorithm, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest are implemented and compared. Additionally, the innovative Deep Learning Hybrid CNN-RF and VGG-RNN Model for Categorization of Soil Properties is also implemented along with CNN. An investigation into the significance of the selected category for nutritional categorization revealed that a multi-component technique provided the most accurate predictions. Both the CNN-RF and VGG-RNN models that were proposed were successful in classifying the soil with average accuracies of 95.8% and 97.9%, respectively, in the test procedures. A study was carried out in which the CNN-RF model, the VGG-RNN model, and five other machine learning and deep learning models were compared. The suggested VGG-RNN model achieved superior accuracy of classification and real-time durability, respectively. © 2022 The authors.","feature extraction; Machine Learning; segmentation; Soil Classification; Soil Nutrients",,Article,Scopus

Forecasting the fresh produce yield is achieved using state of the art deep learning (DL) models. Those models are trained and built using data retrieved from Santa Barbara region in California using an ensemble of Attention Deep Feedforward Neural Network with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Deep Feedforward Neural Network with embedded GRU units. The ensemble takes as input the soil moisture and temperature parameters as well as vegetation indices (VIs) calculated from images retrieved from multiple satellites. The effect of adding the VIs as input parameters on the forecasting performance of the deep learning model is assessed and the most effective VIs are selected. In addition, interpolation techniques are used to estimate the missing VIs due to the low frequency of capturing the images by the satellites. A comparative analysis is conducted to choose the most effective technique, which is found to be Cubic Spline interpolation. One VI, which is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), proves to be the most effective index in forecasting the yield.

The sustainability of every economy is based on agriculture. It has a major influence on financial growth and fundamental transformation in the long run. Artificial intelligence will usher in a revolution in agricultural operations in the future. This revolution has protected crops from being negatively affected by a variety of factors such as climate change, soil porosity, and water availability. Crop monitoring, soil management, and insect identification, to name a few examples, are all conceivable uses of artificial intelligence in agriculture. The primary purpose of artificial intelligence is to close the knowledge gap that exists between inventors and farmers. Detecting disease and monitoring plant health are two of the most difficult challenges in sustainable farming. As a result, image processing technology must be used to detect plant sickness at an early stage. Photographic capture, preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and sickness categorization are all part of the procedure. In reality, computer image processing was used long before human eyes were able to detect the signs and symptoms of the disease. Taking into account the climatic conditions in various parts of the world. Climate change directly affects crop output. Several soil and atmospheric characteristics are detected to anticipate the optimal crop. Sedimentation is measured by soil parameters such as pH and moisture.

Each treatment had three replicates of area 8 m × 8 m, separated from each other by 2 m for manoeuvring of the tractor. Manual planting of okra at distance, 1 m × 0.8 m was used. Manual weeding was done 3 weeks after planting and every 2 weeks interval till harvesting. Soil samples were collected before and after planting operation to carry out physio-chemical properties in the laboratory. Data on growth parameters and yield of okra were collected and analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics 21. Among the analysis were, correlation, regression and ANOVA. Results obtained showed negative correlation between growth parameters, okra yield and soil bulk density. While soil porosity had positive correlation with growth parameters and okra yield. okra yield was higher in conventional and conservative tillage than in zero tillage. Finite modelled equation with coefficient of linearity (R2=0.934) on the yield of okra using different tillage systems was generated during regression analysis, revealing predicted output closely equal to the observed yield.

Microbial protein derived from microorganisms offers potential solutions. Notably, some microbial strains e.g. Fusarium venenatum could efficiently convert carbon sources from food-safe agricultural lignocellulosic ‘waste’ (e.g. food crop residues such as wheat straw) to microbial protein. Our study is underpinned by data-driven approach and presents a modelling framework and analyses to predict spatially-explicit yields of staple crop lignocellulosic residues in response to spatial variation and climate change and highlight their potential for microbial protein production. Five food crops residues have been modelled including barley, wheat, maize, sorghum and rice straws worldwide (around 227 countries) to show future potential for microbial protein production. This study predicts crop residue yields using the data set collection and data pre-processing of crop residues and other environmental factors like temperature. Then, global autocorrelation is used to identify crop residues’ worldwide distribution patterns, and local autocorrelation is used to identify hot and cold spots. Feature selection and four models including ordinary least squares (OLS), multilayer perceptron (MLP), lasso regression and spatial error model are applied in prediction. With the updated independent factor ‘future temperature’ obtained from the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, the selected model is used to predict crop residues in 2030, 2040 and visualizations are created to show the projection outcomes.

However, prediction of accurate estimates is still an open challenge due to geographical diversity, crop diversity & crop area. Recently non-destructive approach has gained attention due to its robustness and provides easy availability of data from heterogeneous resources compared to its counterpart; destructive approach which is computational, resource intensive and hence less utilized. This paper conducts a detailed study on utilization of non-destructive approach to estimate yield taking into account, input feature, and methodology. We consider five major observations namely, data acquisition, pre-processing techniques, features, methodology, and result. Moreover, we summarize analysis of each observation, extract most prominent technique, the adopted methods, and finally recommends integration of different models that can be explored to improve accuracy. © 2022 SCPE","Counting; Crop yield estimation; Deep learning; Machine learning; Regression; Segmentation; Vegetation indices","Crops; Deep learning; Learning systems; Counting; Crop yield; Crop yield estimation; Deep learning; Machine-learning; Non destructive; Regression; Segmentation; Vegetation index; Yield estimation; Data acquisition",Article,Scopus

Predicting wheat yield is a real challenge for better agriculture and food security management. Modeling wheat yield is complex and challenging, so robust tools are needed. The main aim of this study is to predict wheat yield using an advanced ensemble model. A multilayer perceptron model (MLP) was combined with optimization algorithms to determine MLP parameters as the first step in the study. Several optimization algorithms were used as optimizers, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Honey Badger Algorithms (HBA), Sine–Cosine Algorithms (SCA), and Shark Algorithms (SA). Meteorological data were inserted into models. Next, the outputs of optimized MLP models were incorporated into an inclusive multiple MLP model (IMM). A new hybrid gamma test was used to determine the most appropriate input combination. A hybrid gamma test was created by coupling the HBA with GT. This paper introduces a robust IMM model, develops an MLP model using optimization algorithms, develops a new hybrid gamma test, uses Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) to analyze uncertainty, and presents a spatial map of wheat yield prediction. Based on the Gamma Test analysis, mean air temperature (Ta), wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH), evapotranspiration (ET), and precipitation (P) were the most important input parameters for reliable and accurate winter wheat yield predictions. At the testing level, the IMM model decreased the mean absolute error (MAE) of the MLP-HBA, MLP-SCA, MLP-SA, MLP-PSO, and MLP models by 47%, 52%, 55%, 58%, and 61%, respectively. In the study, the uncertainty of models based on input data was significantly lower than that of the model parameters. In addition, the GLUE analysis revealed that the wheat yield predictions were more stable and confident by considering the ensemble IMM technique. The pattern of root mean square error (RMSE) maps demonstrated that higher error produces in the northeast of Urmia Lake. The developed framework provides insight into rainfed yield responses to weather conditions and is simple and inexpensive. Accurate and reliable wheat yield prediction is essential for agricultural monitoring and food policy analysis. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Gamma test; GLUE analysis; Meta-heuristic optimization algorithms; Prediction reliability; Spatial distribution","algorithm; spatial analysis; uncertainty; wheat; Algorithms; Neural Networks, Computer; Spatial Analysis; Triticum; Uncertainty",Article,Scopus

As agriculture affects long chain of supply management from crop production till its delivery to end user, it can be seen as field witch is going to produce high number of jobs. As India’s economy is hugely depend upon the field of agriculture there is need to includes technology due to which it should be able to increase its 15.40% share of total crop production at the global level. Therefore, the need for an hour is to optimize the output per unit drop of water. Therefore, in today’s sense, great emphasis is put on enhancing irrigation practices in order to increase crop production and preserve productivity levels. Use of advanced fertilizer irrigation system is going to strengthen root of the current agricultural system. The reduction in water usage due to the drip irrigation system varies from 30 to 70% for the surface irrigation method and the productivity benefit ranges from 20 to 80% for the various crops. Fertigation is a process of delivering water soluble fertilizer at the time of irrigation. Use of the fertigation process is going to significantly reduce the work load of the farmers and will save huge amount of time. Fertigation enables the placement of NPK nutrients directly into the plant root zone at the necessary dose during critical times. It is possible to increase crop yield capacity by three times more with the same amount of water by incorporating drip fertigation. Application all the above techniques will help in the process of quality and the production enhancement of the yield. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Crop yield; Fertigation; Learning technologies; NPK",,Conference Paper,Scopus

Agriculture employs the majority of the people. Because India's financial system is so reliant on agriculture, there is a pressing need to boost agricultural output generally. Soil is the most important natural resource in agriculture. The most important requirement is good soil quality. The pH of the soil is crucial in this regard. The acidity of the soil is measured by its pH. The total yield is influenced by the pH level. Nitrogen, Potassium, and Phosphorus all influence pH of soil. Farmers can then begin cultivating crops as a result of this. pH sensors are commonly used to determine the pH of soil. However, because they increase the cost of manufacture, they are not always practicable. To address this problem, the proposed method determines the pH value while simultaneously recommending a crop. The crop recommendation method takes into account factors such as soil pH, season, and temperature. © 2022 IEEE.","Nitrogen-N; pH level and Soil prediction; Phosphorus-K; Potassium-P","Crops; Machine learning; pH; Phosphorus; Potassium; Soils; India's financial systems; Machine-learning; Nitrogen-N; Ph level; Ph level and soil prediction; Phosphorus-K; Potassium-P; Pressung; Primary sources; Soil minerals; Nitrogen",Conference Paper,Scopus

The evolution of modern agriculture led to an increase in the use of modern agricultural inputs, which has led to a sustainable growth in crop production. Based on their previous experiences, agricultural input suppliers stock a lot of products in their stores as they wait for right seasons. Unfortunately, due to the lack of precise knowledge about seasonal changes, their products overstay and some get tainted, contaminated, and expired leading to losses caused by dumping because of low sales made; hence, the closure of some of the businesses. In this fourth industrial revolution, which is smart agriculture based, agricultural input suppliers need the help of artificial intelligence to facilitate decision-making that can make their businesses more profitable and sustainable. In this research, we help suppliers predict the current season based on farmers’ agricultural input orders in a given time period in order to make right inputs’ stocking decisions. The method in this paper successfully models and analyzes various machine learning classifiers that illustrate features which facilitate supplier’s decision before new inputs are stocked, which avoids losses hence leading to sustainable supplier business growth and development.

Therefore, most planters are having difficulty with the decision-making process since they are not using high-level technologies and are relying on conventional approaches.

Rapeseed and mustard (R&amp;M) is the predominant oilseed crop in Assam and is very much sensitive to climatic factors compared to other crops grown during rabi season. In the context of recent climate variability observed in the Brahmaputra valley, development of efficient yield forecasting models for R&amp;M based on weather parameters would certainly help the policy makers in formulating appropriate policies and decision-making. The present study was undertaken to develop R&amp;M pre-harvest yield forecast models at F1 (flowering), F2 (siliqua formation) and F3 (siliqua development &amp; maturity) stages for 15 districts of Assam using stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques by analysing the yield and weather data for 27 years and to investigate the impact of weather factors in determining the yield of R&amp;M. The results were enumerated based on coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and normalized root mean square error (RMSEn) values. ANN models were found to have greater R2 values over SMLR at all the three stages of forecast except in 2–3 districts.

Many techniques exist for farming, but precision agriculture (PAg) is one technique that has gained popularity and has become a valuable tool for agriculture. Nowadays, farmers find it difficult to get expert advice regarding crops on time. As a solution, image processing techniques (IPTs) embedded PAg applications are developed to support farmers for the benefit of agriculture. In recent years, IPT has contributed a lot to provide a significant solution in PAg. This systematic review provides an understanding on preprocessing and feature extraction in PAg applications along with limitations.

To predict yield and sustainably manage the use of natural resources such as soil and water, we modelled the effect of soil properties by classification and regression tree, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines and developed a new hybrid model of support vector machines and the firefly meta-heuristic algorithm. We sampled soils from 124 pistachio orchards in Iran and analyzed them for a range of parameters. Available phosphorus and potassium, exchangeable sodium percentage, soil salinity, gypsum, calcium carbonate and gravel were selected as predictors in the subsequent model based on correlation coefficients, sensitivity analysis and ANOVA hypothesis testing. For modeling, the optimized values for the Kernel function parameters in the hybrid model of ζ, ε and γ were 8.76, 0.001 and 0.99, respectively, while the ideal numerical combinations for p and k parameters in the k-nearest neighbors model were 0.3 and 5, respectively. We checked the difference between the models using paired t-tests which showed that improvements were significant. According to the results, k-nearest neighbors, classification and regression tree and support vector machines algorithms could explain 83, 84 and 88% of the variation of pistachio yield, respectively, but improved to 94% in the hybrid model because it was more able to efficiently capture non-linear relationships. Soil available phosphorus was the most important determinant of pistachio yield, with soil salinity, exchangeable sodium percentage, potassium, gypsum, calcium carbonate and gravel ranked in order of decreasing importance. These outputs can help planners and farmers to better manage soil properties to increase pistachio yield and sustainable production. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","C&RT; Firefly algorithm; k-NN; Pistachio yield; Soil properties; SVM","alternative agriculture; arid environment; calcium carbonate; crop production; crop yield; soil property; Iran",Article,Scopus

These can advance mathematical crop modelling methodologies that can integrate these schemes into a process-based crop model capable of reproducing or simulating crop growth. In this study, an innovative hybrid approach for estimating the leaf area index (LAI) of paddy rice using climate data was developed using ML and DNN regression methodologies. First, we investigated suitable ML regressors to explore the LAI estimation of rice based on the relationship between the LAI and three climate factors in two administrative rice-growing regions of South Korea. We found that of the 10 ML regressors explored, the random forest regressor was the most effective LAI estimator, and it even outperformed the DNN regressor, with model efficiencies of 0.88 in Cheorwon and 0.82 in Paju. In addition, we demonstrated that it would be feasible to simulate the LAI using climate factors based on the integration of the ML and DNN regressors in a process-based crop model.

In this study, a novel long short-term memory network (LSTM) model was developed to estimate wheat yield in Henan Province of China by combining field-measured yields, the time series of leaf area index (LAI) and yields simulated from CERES-Wheat model, and the LAI retrieved from Sentinel-2 imagery. The LSTM model was pretrained using the simulated LAI and yields at the agro-meteorological stations, and was retrained by the Sentinel-2 LAI and measured yields, hereafter referred to as retrained LSTM model. The yield estimation accuracy of the retrained LSTM model was compared with that of the LSTM model trained by the simulations alone (hereafter referred to as CGM-trained LSTM model) and that of the LSTM model trained by the Sentinel-2 LAI and measured yields alone (hereafter referred to as RS-trained LSTM model). The results showed that, at both the site and county levels, the retrained LSTM model provided improved accuracies compared with the CGM-trained and RS-trained LSTM models. It was because the accurate estimates of wheat yield at field scales were extended to regional scales through a combination of the advantages of both the crop growth models and satellite imagery.

Today, the rapidly growing field of machine learning (ML) offers a wide range of advanced statistical tools that are increasingly being used for more accurate estimates of this relationship. This study compares LR to a popular ML technique called boosted regression trees (BRTs). We find that BRTs provide a significantly better prediction accuracy compared to various LR specifications, including those fitting quadratic and piece-wise linear functions. BRTs are also able to identify break points where the relationship between climate and yield undergoes significant shifts (for example, increasing yields with precipitation followed by a plateauing of the relationship beyond a certain point). Tests we performed with synthetically simulated climate and crop yield data showed that BRTs can automatically account for not only spatial variation in climate-yield relationships, but also interactions between different variables that affect crop yields. We then used both statistical techniques to estimate the influence of historical climate change on rice, wheat, and pearl millet in India. BRTs predicted a considerably smaller negative impact compared to LR. This may be an artifact of BRTs conflating time and climate variables, signaling a potential weakness of models with excessively flexible functional forms for inferring climate impacts on agriculture. Our findings thus suggest caution while interpreting the results from single-model analyses, especially in regions with highly varied climate and agricultural practices. © 2023 The Author(s).

The historical statistical information may not be helpful in the prediction of agriculture yield. Therefore, in this research, a novel HS image processing technique has been implemented using remote sensing technology to achieve an efficient and accurate prediction of crop yield. Primarily, the preprocessing technique called 2D-adaptive anisotropic diffusion filter is implemented to eradicate the speckle noise from HS images and then enhanced by applying a new edge preservation-contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization technique. Afterward, the fast fuzzy C means algorithm has been incorporated in the proposed method to cluster the agriculture crop's gradient intensity pixels from HS images. Finally, the optimum features are learned and then fed into the adaptive logistic regression classifier to classify the different agricultural crops.

The aim of this study is to develop an effective model for predicting crop yields in advance that is accessible and easy to use by the farmer or farm manager from a web-based application. In this case, an olive orchard in the Andalusia region of southern Spain was used. The model was estimated using spatio-temporal training data, such as yield data from eight consecutive years, and more than twenty meteorological parameters data, automatically charged from public web services, belonging to a weather station located near the sample farm.

It is critical to complete this activity with high precision at the regional and national levels to facilitate speedy decision-making. Tea is a big cash crop that contributes significantly to economic development, with a market of USD 200 billion in 2020 that is expected to reach over USD 318 billion by 2025. As a developing country, Bangladesh can be a greater part of this industry and increase its exports through its tea yield and production with favorable climatic features and land quality. Regrettably, the tea yield in Bangladesh has not increased significantly since 2008 like many other countries, despite having suitable climatic and land conditions, which is why quantifying the yield is imperative. This study developed a novel spatiotemporal hybrid DRS-RF model with a dragonfly optimization (DR) algorithm and support vector regression (S) as a feature selection approach. This study used satellite-derived hydro-meteorological variables between 1981 and 2020 from twenty stations across Bangladesh to address the spatiotemporal dependency of the predictor variables for the tea yield (Y). The results illustrated that the proposed DRS-RF hybrid model improved tea yield forecasting over other standalone machine learning approaches, with the least relative error value (11%). This study indicates that integrating the random forest model with the dragonfly algorithm and SVR-based feature selection improves prediction performance. This hybrid approach can help combat food risk and management for other countries. © 2022 by the authors.

While it creates employment opportunities and offers food security for the entire nation, the lack of infrastructure and resources might be limiting its potential to thrive further. One of the aspects addressed in this paper is low yield production. With the aid of a sensor-based irrigation model, data is collected and analyzed in the cloud to enable real-time monitoring. It is then integrated with an Android application for displaying results in an user-friendly interface. Through the application, farmers can control the farm manually, or with a timer in minutes. The Machine Learning model predicts the suitable crops, in accordance with varying weather parameters. The application has a classified portal for farmers and customers to buy/sell directly, eliminating any involvement of mediators. One of the novelties in this research includes monitoring/controlling farm equipment and predicting field crops from a locally installed LCD display and keypad present in farmer's respective homes. The proposed work aims to create an energy-efficient, user-friendly framework for the agricultural workforce, yielding better crop production, improving farmers' living standards, and contributing effectively to the nation's economic growth.

Agricultural systems that rely on monsoon rainfall are especially vulnerable to changes in climate variability. This paper uses machine learning to deepen understanding of how monsoon variability impacts agricultural productivity. We demonstrate that random forest modelling is effective in representing rice production variability in response to monsoon weather variability. Our random forest modelling found monsoon weather predictors explain similar levels of detrended anomaly variation in both rice yield (33%) and area harvested (35%). The role of weather in explaining harvested rice area highlights that production area changes are an important pathway through which weather extremes impact agricultural productivity, which may exacerbate losses that occur through changes in per-area yields. We find that downwelling shortwave radiation flux is the most important weather variable in explaining variation in yield anomalies, with proportion of area under irrigation being the most important predictor overall. Machine learning modelling is capable of representing crop-climate variability in monsoonal agriculture and reveals additional information compared to traditional parametric models. For example, non-linear yield and area responses of irrigation, monsoon onset and season length all match biophysical expectations. Overall, we find that random forest modelling can reveal complex non-linearities and interactions between climate and rice production variability. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"agriculture; article; climate change; crop; expectation; India; machine learning; nonhuman; nonlinear system; plant yield; productivity; random forest; rice; season; weather",Article,Scopus

Mapping and monitoring agricultural dynamics and production in real-time at high spatial resolution are essential for ensuring food security and shaping policy interventions. However, an accurate yield estimation might be challenging in some arid and semi-arid regions since input datasets are generally scarce, and access is restricted due to security challenges. This work examines how well Sentinel-2 satellite sensor-derived data, topographic and climatic variables, can be used as covariates to accurately model and predict wheat crop yield at the farm level using statistical models in low data settings of arid and semi-arid regions, using Sulaimani governorate in Iraq as an example. We developed a covariate selection procedure that assessed the correlations between the covariates and their relationships with wheat crop yield. Potential non-linear relationships were investigated in the latter case using regression splines. In the absence of substantial non-linear relationships between the covariates and crop yield, and residual spatial autocorrelation, we fitted a Bayesian multiple linear regression model to model and predict crop yield at 10 m resolution. Out of the covariates tested, our results showed significant relationships between crop yield and mean cumulative NDVI during the growing season, mean elevation, mean end of the season, mean maximum temperature and mean the start of the season at the farm level. For in-sample prediction, we estimated an R2 value of 51 % for the model, whereas for out-of-sample prediction, this was 41 %, both of which indicate reasonable predictive performance. The calculated root-mean-square error for out-of-sample prediction was 69.80, which is less than the standard deviation of 89.23 for crop yield, further showing that the model performed well by reducing prediction variability. Besides crop yield estimates, the model produced uncertainty metrics at 10 m resolution. Overall, this study showed that Sentinel-2 data can be valuable for upscaling field measurement of crop yield in arid and semi-arid regions. In addition, the environmental covariates can strengthen the model predictive power. The method may be applicable in other areas with similar environments, particularly in conflict zones, to increase the availability of agricultural statistics. © 2023 The Authors",,"Arid regions; Crops; Farms; Food supply; Linear regression; Mean square error; Uncertainty analysis; Agricultural productivity; Arid and semi-arid regions; Covariates; Crop yield; Environmental variables; Farming system; Food insecurity; Non-linear relationships; Semi arid; Socio-economics; Forecasting; agricultural production; arid environment; crop yield; data set; food security; semiarid region; Sentinel; smallholder; wheat; Iraq",Article,Scopus

Because the process-based and statistical approaches to simulating crop yields are different in nature, a comparison between them is needed. This study investigates the accuracy of crop yield simulations in the historical period as well as future projections using two modelling approaches: 1) a process-based approach employing the Soil and Water Assessment Tool+ (SWAT+) model, and 2) a statistical approach employing a data-driven model, Feed Forward Back Propagation Neural Network (FFBPNN) over a medium-sized catchment in north-western Poland. The application of two potential evapotranspiration methods (Penman-Monteith and Hargreaves) in SWAT+ permitted calibration (2004–2011) and validation (2012–2019) of runoff and yields of winter wheat and spring barley. Different combinations of climatic parameters with a drought index based on Joint Deficit Index were applied to simulate and project rainfed crop yields (winter wheat, barley, potato, rye, rapeseed, sugar beets, cereals, maize for grain, maize for green forage, pulses) with FFBPNN. The results reveal that adding the new drought index helped increase the FFBPNN performance. This approach showed that future yields of the studied crops would slightly increase under RCP8.5 by 2060. Winter wheat and spring barley projections from SWAT+ showed very small changes using both the Penman-Monteith and Hargreaves method. Policy-wise, the results should be of interest to climate change adaptation practitioners and food security experts. Future studies should aim at more thorough investigation of the role of the downscaling technique and extreme events, as well as the effect of elevated CO2 on future crop yields. © 2022 The Authors","Artificial Neural Network; Baltic Sea basin; Global warming; Machine learning; Oder River basin","Backpropagation; Catchments; Crops; Drought; Feedforward neural networks; Food supply; Global warming; Sugar beets; Baltic sea basins; Crop yield; Machine-learning; Oder river; Oder river basin; Process-based approach; Rainfed crop; River basins; Soil and Water assessment tools; Statistical approach; SWAT; adaptation; artificial neural network; barley; comparative study; crop yield; global warming; rainfed agriculture; simulation; statistical analysis; wheat; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Oder Basin; Poland [Central Europe]",Article,Scopus

Accurate and timely estimation of maize yield is of great significance to crop management and food security. Commonly applied vegetation indexes (VIs) are mainly used in crop yield estimation as they can reflect the greenness of vegetation. However, the environmental pressures of crop growth and development are difficult to monitor and evaluate. Indexes for water content, pigment content, nutrient elements and biomass have been developed to indirectly explain the influencing factors of yield, with extant studies mainly assessing VIs, climate and water content factors. Only a few studies have attempted to systematically evaluate the sensitivity of these indexes. The sensitivity of the spectral indexes, combined indexes and climate factors and the effect of temporal aggregation data need to be evaluated. Thus, this study proposes a novel yield evaluation method for integrating multiple spectral indexes and temporal aggregation data. In particular, spectral indexes were calculated by integrating publicly available data (remote sensing images and climate data) from the Google Earth Engine platform, and county-level maize yields in China from 2015 to 2019 were estimated using a random forest model. Results showed that the normalized moisture difference index (NMDI) is the index most sensitive to yield estimation. Furthermore, the potential of adopting the combined indexes, especially NMDI_NDNI, was verified. Compared with the whole-growth period data and the eight-day time series, the vegetative growth period and the reproductive growth period data were more sensitive to yield estimation. The maize yield in China can be estimated by integrating multiple spectral indexes into the indexes for the vegetative and reproductive growth periods. The obtained R2 of maize yield estimation reached 0.8. This study can provide feature knowledge and references for index assessments for yield estimation research. © 2023 by the authors.","combined index; maize yield; multiple spectral indexes; temporal aggregation; yield estimation","Climate models; Crops; Data integration; Earth (planet); Food supply; Forestry; Remote sensing; %moisture; Combined indices; Growth period; Maize yield; Multiple spectral index; Reproductive growth; Spectral indices; Temporal aggregation; Vegetation index; Yield estimation; Vegetation",Article,Scopus

Therefore, it is essential to provide appropriate solutions to increase water productivity (WP). As an element of research, this study presents a hybrid machine learning approach and investigates its potential for estimating date palm crop yield and WP under different levels of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI). The amount of applied water in the SDI system was compared at three levels of 125% (T1), 100% (T2), and 75% (T3) of water requirement. The proposed ACVO-ANFIS approach is composed of an anti-coronavirus optimization algorithm (ACVO) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Since the effect of irrigation factors, climate, and crop characteristics are not equal in estimating the WP and yield, the importance of these factors should be measured in the estimation phase. To fulfill this aim, ACVO-ANFIS employed eight different feature combination models based on irrigation factors, climate, and crop characteristics. The proposed approach was evaluated on a benchmark dataset that contains information about the groves of Behbahan agricultural research station located in southeast Khuzestan, Iran. The results explained that the treatment T3 advanced data palm crop yield by 3.91 and 1.31%, and WP by 35.50 and 20.40 kg/m3, corresponding to T1 and T2 treatments, respectively. The amount of applied water in treatment T3 was 7528.80 m3/ha, which suggests a decrease of 5019.20 and 2509.6 m3/ha of applied water compared to the T1 and T2 treatments. The modeling results of the ACVO-ANFIS approach using a model with factors of crop variety, irrigation (75% water requirement of SDI system), and effective rainfall achieved RMSE = 0.005, δ = 0.603, and AICC = 183.25.

The goal of this work is to develop state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms for image-based crop evaluation and weather-related risk assessment to support real-time decision-making for growers. We develop a cranberry bog monitoring system that maps cranberry density and also predicts short-term cranberry internal temperatures. We have two important algorithm contributions. First, we develop a method for cranberry instance segmentation that provides the number of sun-exposed cranberries (not covered by the crop canopy) that are at risk of overheating. The algorithm is based on a novel weakly supervised framework using inexpensive point-click annotations, avoiding time-consuming annotations of fully-supervised methods. The second algorithmic contribution is an in-field joint solar irradiation and berry temperature prediction in an end-to-end differentiable network. The combined system enables over-heating risk assessment to inform irrigation decisions. To support these algorithms, we employ drone-based crop imaging and ground-based sky imaging systems to obtain a large-scale dataset at multiple time points. Through extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate high accuracy in cranberry segmentation, irradiance prediction and internal berry temperature prediction. This work is a pioneering step in using computer vision and machine learning for rapid, short-term decision-making that can assist growers in irrigation decisions in response to complex time-sensitive risk factors.

Despite the clarity of influential factors and deriving forces, estimation of the volumetric irrigation demand using biophysical models is prohibitively difficult. Data-driven models have proven their ability to predict geophysical and hydrological phenomena with only a handful of influential input variables; however, the lack of reliable input data in most agricultural regions of the world hinders the effectiveness of these approaches. Attempting to estimate the irrigation water demand, we first analyze the correlation of potential influencing variables with irrigation water. We develop machine learning models to predict California’s annual, county-level irrigation water demand based on the statistical analysis findings over an 18-year time span. Input variables are different combinations of deriving meteorological forces, geographical characteristics, cropped area, and crop category. After testing various regression machine learning approaches, the result shows that Gaussian process regression produces the best results. Our findings suggest that irrigated cropped area, air temperature, and vapor pressure deficit are the most significant variables in predicting irrigation water demand. This research also shows that Gaussian process regression can predict irrigation water demand with high accuracy (R2 higher than 0.97 and RMSE as low as 0.06 km3) with different input variable combinations. An accurate estimation of irrigation water use of various crop categories and areas can assist decision-making processes and improve water management strategies. The proposed model can help water policy makers evaluate climatological and agricultural scenarios and hence be used as a decision support tool for agricultural water management at a regional scale. © 2022 by the authors.

Crop yield forecasts can help decision makers to formulate policies on maintaining national food reserves, sustaining food supply chains and attaining national food security. Inter field crop yield heterogeneity arising from varied field management and agricultural practices necessitates this forecasting to be done at field-level. Such field level information can aid farmers to identify gaps in water and farm management practices and take corrective actions, if needed. So far, no scalable tools are available to predict crop yields at field level that leverage the availability of open-access high-resolution RS data. This research implements an operational framework to predict field level crop biomass by evaluating different regression algorithms to develop data driven models, leveraging historical and near real time open-access high resolution optical satellite data from Sentinel-2, radar data from Sentinel-1 and evapotranspiration (ETa) and Net Primary Production (NPP) data from Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) Water Productivity through Open-access Remotely sensed data (WaPOR) platform. NPP is used as a proxy for biomass production/yield. Five of the most commonly used regression algorithms were tested to build a data-driven model for sugarcane NPP prediction in Wonji-Shoa sugarcane estate, located in the Awash Basin, Ethiopia. The models tested were the Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR), Stepwise Multivariate Linear Regression (SMLR), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest Regression (RFR). The results revealed that for seasonal sugarcane NPP predictions, the linear regression models (MLR and SMLR) yielded more accurate predictions than the non-linear machine learning models (BRT, SVR and RFR) tested. The highest accuracy was achieved for MLR models for which estimates with 89% accuracy could be made 4 months prior to the harvest and with accuracies of 79% up to 200 days (approx. 6.5 months) before the harvest. The non-linear machine learning models, however, could not provide reliable estimates of sugarcane NPP (accuracies < 61%). Cumulative vegetation indices (VIs) were found to have higher predictive power than standard VIs for predicting future sugarcane NPP. Cumulative Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was found to be the variable with the highest predictive power, followed by VH polarized Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data and WaPOR ETa. The study shows the usefulness of high-resolution RS information to predict seasonal NPP at field level. The methods presented here can be translated into an automated framework towards an operational system. © 2022","Crop biomass prediction; Cumulated vegetation indices; Data driven models; Food security; Operational framework; Regression algorithms; Remote sensing","algorithm; biomass; crop production; data set; food security; regression analysis; remote sensing; vegetation dynamics",Article,Scopus

Based on the regression analysis, the estimation of the production based on the MSAVI2 and NDVI indices was possible under the conditions of R2=0.998, P&lt;0.05 for plot B/A75, R2=0.999, P&lt;0.05 for plot B/A80, R2=0.997, P=0.0577 for plot B/ A82 and respectively, R2=0.999, P&lt;0.05 for plot B/A84. From the calculation of the RMSEP index, for the estimated productions, the values were obtained: RMSEP=80.8162 for YB/A75, RMSEP=50.1633 for YB/A80, RMSEP=192.3947 for YB/and respectively RMSEP=112.2899 for Y . The value of RMSEP=50.1633 for Y confirms that for the plot B/ A82 B/A84 B/A80 A80 the production estimate was made with the highest precision. © 2022, University of Zagreb - Faculty of Agriculture.

Predicting yields on a large scale in a timely and accurate manner by considering these factors is essential for preventing climate risk and ensuring food security, particularly in the light of climate change and the escalation of extreme climatic events. In this study, integrating multi-source data (i.e. satellite-derived vegetation indices (VIs), satellite-derived climatic variables (i.e. land surface temperature (LST) and rainfall precipitation, weather station and field-surveys), we built one multiple linear regression (MLR), three machine learning (XGBoost, support vector regression, and random forest) and one deep learning (deep neural network) models to predict oil palm yield at block-level within the oil palm plantation. Moreover, time-series moving average and backward elimination feature selection technique were implemented at the pre-processing stage. The yield prediction models were developed and tested using MLR, XGBoost, support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF) and deep neural network (DNN) algorithms. Their model performances were then compared using evaluation metrics and generated the final spatial prediction map based on the best performance. DNN achieved the best model performances for both selected (R2 = 0.91; RMSE = 2.92 t ha− 1; MAE = 2.56 t ha− 1 and MAPE = 0.09 t ha− 1) and full predictors (R2 = 0.76; RMSE of 3.03 t ha− 1; MAE of 2.88 t ha− 1; MAPE of 0.10 t ha− 1). In addition, advanced ensemble machine learning (ML) techniques such as XGBoost may be utilised as a supplementary for oil palm yield prediction at the block level. Among them, MLR recorded the lowest performance. By using backward elimination to identify the most significant predictors, the performance of all models was improved by 5–26% for R2, and that decreased by 3–31% for RMSE, 7–34% for MAE, and 1–15% for MAPE. After backward elimination, the DNN achieved the highest prediction accuracy among the other models, with a 14% increase in R-squared, a 11% decrease in RMSE, a 32% decrease in MAE and a 1% decrease in MAPE. Our study successfully developed efficient and accurate yield prediction models for timely predicting oil palm yield over a large area by integrating data from multiple sources. These would be useful for plantation management estimating oil palm yields to speed up the decision-making process for sustainable production. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Deep learning; Machine learning; Multi-source data; Oil palm yields","crop yield; extreme event; food security; machine learning; oil industry",Article,Scopus

The introduction of novel technologies into agricultural practices will be of great assistance to farmers. The soil's pH and moisture content play a crucial part in the monitoring of soil fertility, irrigation level, and plant growth. Sometimes farmers were unsuccessful in selecting the appropriate crops to grow based on the conditions of the soil, the planting season, and the geographic location. Soil fertility is an important aspect in agriculture to determine the soil's quality. Soil nutrients are depleted after each harvest and must be replenished. The Irrigation system needs to control flood levels and adapt to paddy development. Water is necessary for the preparation of the ground, the planting of the crop, and crop upkeep throughout the growing-to-harvest cycle. The occurrence of paddy plant diseases and the presence of pests are two key factors that influence the production and quality of rice. One of the industry's biggest problems is the lack of a reliable method for determining paddy field soil nutrient levels, identifying the suitable crop, knowing the level of irrigation, and identifying the pest. This leads to farmers taking their own lives, leaving the agricultural industry, and moving to urban areas in search of work. This research has proposed a system to assist farmers in crop selection, fertilizer recommendation, irrigation, and pest detection by taking into account all of the relevant factors such as soil nutrient level, soil fertility, moisture level, PH, Temperature, and pest images. A mobile application and an intelligent method that is adapted to the requirements of the crop in each field can provide the farmer with information about the suitable crop, fertility of the soil, suitable fertilizer, irrigation level, and identified pest which will increase crop yield. © 2022 IEEE.","Deep learning; Fertilizer recommendation; Internet of things(IoT); Irrigation system; Machine learning; Pest detection; Soil monitoring","Agricultural technology; Deep learning; Engineering research; Fertilizers; Image processing; Internet of things; Irrigation; Learning systems; Moisture; Moisture determination; Nutrients; Soils; Students; Deep learning; Fertilizer recommendation; Images processing; Irrigation level; Irrigation systems; Machine-learning; Pest detection; Soil fertility; Soil monitoring; Soil nutrient levels; Crops",Conference Paper,Scopus

This is because the hostile environment, more adverse climatic conditions, lower yields and lack of space have always favoured crops in flat locations. However, this has led to a more or less marked abandonment of the mountains by the local population. The BROTWEG project was born with the aim of reversing this trend by developing and providing the technologies for sustainable and mechanized cereal cultivation even in the high mountains. This in particular following a short supply chain system: (a) cultivation of cereals in small/medium plots by creating new technologies for mechanised seeding-avoiding the erosion-prone tillage-and harvesting on steep slopes up to 80%, (b) post-harvest operations (drying and milling) carried out directly within the farm, (c) bread-making. In this scenario, monitoring the crops, as well as the field yield, becomes very important and necessary to promptly respond to any issue and thus ensuring a successful harvest. In this work an attempt is made to estimate the field yield by means of spectrographic surveys, conducted with a UAV. The idea is to discern between crops and weeds by evaluating some vegetation indices: when the grain reaches the maturity its viability is very low, whereas that of the weed remains medium/high. Therefore, a low vitality in an area means high productivity since all the analysed space is suppose to be covered by only grain. © 2022 IEEE.","BROTWEG project; Mountain Agriculture; Primary Production estimation; Vegetation Index","Antennas; Cultivation; Farms; Grain (agricultural product); Harvesting; Landforms; Seed; Supply chains; Tillage; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; BROTWEG project; Climatic conditions; Hostile environments; Local populations; Low-yield; Mountain agriculture; Primary production; Primary production estimation; Production prediction; Vegetation index; Crops",Conference Paper,Scopus

We collected meteorological data on the NASA-POWER platform and soybean yield on the SIDRA/IBGE base between 2008 and 2017. The ML models evaluated were random forest (RF), artificial neural networks, radial base support vector machines (SVM_RBF), linear model and polynomial regression. To assess the performance of the models, cross-validation was used, obtaining the value of precision by R2, accuracy by root mean square error (RMSE), and trend by the mean error of the estimate (EME). RESULTS: The results showed that the RF algorithm achieves the highest precision and accuracy, with R2 of 0.81, RMSE of 176.93 kg ha−1 and trend (EME) of 1.99 kg ha−1. On the other hand, the SVM_RBF algorithm showed the lowest performance, with R2 of 0.74, RMSE of 213.58 kg ha−1 and EME of −15.06 kg ha−1.

It also plays an important role in the Indian Economy, which is about 18% of India’s GDP. In current situation, agriculture in India is undergoing a structural change leading to a crisis situation.The only remedy to overcome this crisis is to do all that is possible to make agriculture profitable and attract farmers to continue in farming activities. Crop yeild prediction and crop selctions are major agricultural problems. As an effort toward agriculture, this research paper would help farmers in making appropriate decisions regarding crop production with the help of the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning (ML).This paper focuses on predicting appropriate crop based on climatic sensor data and yield of the crop based on the past data by using machine learning algorithms. The proposed systems will help farmers to reduce the wastage of water, fertilizer, and improve crop growth.

More than 785,000 workers are directly employed in this activity, which represents the 26% of all jobs in the agricultural sector. Colombian coffee growers estimate the production of cherry coffee with the main aim of planning the required activities, and resources (number of workers, required infrastructures), anticipating negotiations, estimating, price, and foreseeing losses of coffee production in a specific territory. These important processes can be affected by several factors that are not easy to predict (e.g., weather variability, diseases, or plagues.). In this paper, we propose a non-destructive time series model, based on weather and crop management information, that estimate coffee production allowing coffee growers to improve their management of agricultural activities such as flowering calendars, harvesting seasons, definition of irrigation methods, nutrition calendars, and programming the times of concentration of production to define the amount of personnel needed for harvesting. The combination of time series and machine learning algorithms based on regression trees (XGBOOST, TR and RF) provides very positive results for the test dataset collected in real conditions for more than a year.

Remote sensing (RS) and crop models are effective means to predict cotton yield in the field. The satellite vegetation indices (VIs) can describe crop yield variations over large areas but can’t take the exact environmental impact into consideration. Climate variables (CVs), the result of the influence of spatial heterogeneity in large regions, can provide environmental information for better estimation of cotton yield. In this study, the most important VIs and CVs for estimating county-level cotton yield across Xinjiang Province were screened out. We found that the VIs of canopy structure and chlorophyll contents, and the CVs of moisture, were the most significant factors for cotton growth. For yield estimation, we utilized four approaches: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO), support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR) and long short-term memory (LSTM). Due to its ability to capture temporal features over the long term, LSTM performed best, with an R2 of 0.76, root mean square error (RMSE) of 150 kg/ha and relative RMSE (rRMSE) of 8.67%; moreover, an additional 10% of the variance could be explained by adding CVs to the VIs. For the within-season yield estimation using LSTM, predictions made 2 months before harvest were the most accurate (R2 = 0.65, RMSE = 220 kg/ha, rRMSE = 15.97%). Our study demonstrated the feasibility of yield estimation and early prediction at the county level over large cotton cultivation areas by integrating satellite and environmental data.

As such, it is crucial to accurately estimate within-season yield in order to provide critical information for farm management and decision making. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to assess the most appropriate method, indices, and growth stage for predicting the groundnut yield in smallholder agricultural systems in northern Malawi. We have estimated the yield of groundnut in two smallholder farms using the observed yield and vegetation indices (VIs), which were derived from multitemporal PlanetScope satellite data. Simple linear, multiple linear (MLR), and random forest (RF) regressions were applied for the prediction. The leave-one-out cross-validation method was used to validate the models. The results showed that (i) of the modelling approaches, the RF model using the five most important variables (RF5) was the best approach for predicting the groundnut yield, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.96 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.29 kg/ha, followed by the MLR model (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 0.84 kg/ha); in addition, (ii) the best within-season stage to accurately predict groundnut yield is during the R5/beginning seed stage. The RF5 model was used to estimate the yield for four different farms. The estimated yields were compared with the total reported yields from the farms. The results revealed that the RF5 model generally accurately estimated the groundnut yields, with the margins of error ranging between 0.85% and 11%. The errors are within the post-harvest loss margins in Malawi. The results indicate that the observed yield and VIs, which were derived from open-source remote sensing data, can be applied to estimate yield in order to facilitate farming and food security planning. © 2022 by the authors.","food security; Malawi; PlanetScope; random forest regression; vegetation indices; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

Multi-source data for site-specific soils, climates, and remotely sensed vegetation indices are essential for yield prediction. Algorithms of data-model fusion for crop growth monitoring and yield prediction are complicated and need to be optimized to deal with model uncertainty. This study integrated multi-source environmental variables (e.g., satellite-based vegetation indices, climate data, and soil properties) into random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models for wheat yield prediction in China. The performance of both RF and SVM models was investigated using different types of vegetation indices associated with other predictors. Relative importance and partial dependence analyses were used to identify the main predictors and their relationships with wheat yield. We found that using remotely sensed vegetation indices improved our model precision, and that near-infrared reflectance of terrestrial vegetation (NIRv) was slightly better than normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in predicting yield. NIRv was better in detecting climate stress on crops, and could capture more information regarding crop growth and yield formation. Compared with the SVM model, the RF model with NIRv and other covariates had better performance in wheat yield prediction, with R2 and RMSE being 0.74 and 758 kg/ha respectively. We also found that NIRv from jointing to heading was the most important predictor in determining yield, followed by solar radiation (especially during tillering–heading), relative humidity (during planting–tillering), soil organic carbon, and wind speed (throughout the growing season). In addition, wheat yield exhibited threshold-like responses to most factors based on our RF model. These threshold values can help to better understand how different environmental factors limit wheat yield, which will provide useful information for climate-adaptive crop management. Our findings demonstrated the potential of using NIRv for yield prediction. This approach is broadly applicable to other regions globally using publicly available data. © 2022","NIRv; Random forest; Support vector machine; Vegetation indices; Wheat; Yield prediction","Climate models; Crops; Data fusion; Decision trees; Forecasting; Infrared devices; Organic carbon; Remote sensing; Soil surveys; Soils; Uncertainty analysis; Vegetation; Wind; Environmental factors; Multi-Sources; NIRv; Random forests; Support vector machine models; Support vectors machine; Vegetation index; Wheat; Wheat yield; Yield prediction; Support vector machines; crop yield; data set; machine learning; model; relative humidity; remote sensing; soil-vegetation interaction; solar radiation; wheat; China",Article,Scopus

For this purpose, wheat yield and water productivity (WP) by considering soil data, irrigation, fertilizer, climate, and crop characteristics and using a novel hybrid approach called hazelnut tree search algorithm (HTS) and extreme machine learning method (ELM) was examined under the drip (tape) irrigation. A dataset including 125 wheat yield data, irrigation and meteorological data of Mahabad plain located southeast of Lake Urmia, Iran, was used as input parameters for crop year 2020–2021. Eighty percentage of the data were used for training, and the remaining 20% for model testing. Nine different input scenarios were presented to estimate yield and WP. The efficiency of the proposed model was calculated with the statistical indices coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), normalized root-mean-square error, and efficiency criterion. Sensitivity analysis result showed that the parameters of irrigation, rainfall, soil moisture, and crop variety provide better results for modeling.

Constructing a spatiotemporal dataset requires multiple UAV image mosaics taken at different times. Because the weather or a UAV flight trajectory is subject to change when the images are taken, the mosaics are typically unaligned. This paper proposes a two-step approach, composed of global and local alignments, for spatiotemporal alignment of two wide-area UAV mosaics of high resolution. The first step, global alignment, finds a projection matrix that initially maps keypoints in the source mosaic onto matched counterparts in the target mosaic. The next step, local alignment, refines the result of the global alignment. The proposed method splits input mosaics into patches and applies individual transformations to each patch to enhance the remaining local misalignments at patch level. Such independent local alignments may result in new artifacts at patch boundaries. The proposed method uses a simple yet effective technique to suppress those artifacts without harming the benefit of the local alignment. Extensive experiments validate the proposed method by using several datasets for highland fields and plains in South Korea. Compared with a recent work, the proposed method improves the accuracy of alignment by up to 13.21% over the datasets. © 2023 by the authors.","image alignment; smart agriculture; spatiotemporal image; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)",,Article,Scopus

A DL or ML modelling scheme can effectively represent complicated algorithms. This study reports on an advanced fusion methodology for evaluating the leaf area index (LAI) of barley and wheat that employs remotely sensed information based on deep neural network (DNN) and ML regression approaches. We investigated the most appropriate ML regressors for exploring LAI estimations of barley and wheat through the relationships between the LAI values and four vegetation indices. After analysing ten ML regression models, we concluded that the gradient boost (GB) regressor most effectively estimated the LAI for both barley and wheat. Furthermore, the GB regressor outperformed the DNN regressor, with model efficiencies of 0.89 for barley and 0.45 for wheat. Additionally, we verified that it would be possible to simulate LAI using proximal and remote sensing data based on assimilating the DNN and ML regressors into a process-based mathematical crop model.

Combining Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), being sensitive to above ground biomass and soil moisture in all weather conditions, and optical data can improve the usability of RS data and provide a basis for pixel-based crop yield estimation (YE). In this study, an Upscaled Convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit model incorporated an attention mechanism (UpSc-AConvGRU model) was proposed to improve the estimation accuracy of the winter wheat growth parameter, Leaf Area Index (LAI). Gap filling the time series of optical data was done with backscatter coefficients, local incidence angles and polarimetric decomposition information from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. The time series LAI estimated by the UpSc-AConvGRU model and Vegetation Temperature Condition Index (VTCI) retrieved from Sentinel-3 optical imagery were then used as state variables of the SAFY-V model to estimate winter wheat yield. The results showed that the proposed UpSc-AConvGRU model incorporated the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) can effectively improve the accuracy of LAI estimation, with RMSEs ranging from 0.413 to 0.699 m2 m2 for LAI estimated within main growth stages (MGSs) of winter wheat.

Nutrient management involving rice has been a matter of interest for a long time owing to the unique production environment of rice. In this research, an artificial neural network-based prediction model was developed to understand the role of individual nutrients (N, P, K, Zn, and S) on different plant parameters (plant height, tiller number, dry matter production, leaf area index, grain yield, and straw yield) of rice. A feed-forward neural network with back-propagation training was developed using the neural network (nnet) toolbox available in Matlab. For the training of the model, data obtained from two consecutive crop seasons over two years (a total of four crops of rice) were used. Nutrients interact with each other, and the resulting effect is an outcome of such interaction; hence, understanding the role of individual nutrients under field conditions becomes difficult. In the present study, an attempt was made to understand the role of individual nutrients in achieving crop growth and yield using an artificial neural network-based prediction model. The model predicts that growth parameters such as plant height, tiller number, and leaf area index often achieve their maximum performance at below the maximum applied dose, while the maximum yield in most cases is achieved at 100% N, P, K, Zn, and S dose. In addition, the present study attempted to understand the impact of individual nutrients on both plant growth and yield in order to optimize nutrient recommendation and nutrient management, thereby minimizing environmental pollution and wastage of nutrients. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial neural network; crop performance; digital agriculture; plant nutrients; rice",,Article,Scopus

There are several sources of information suitable for assessing photosynthetic activity, including gas exchange and optical (reflectance and fluorescence) measurements. The advent of inexpensive optical sensors makes it possible to collect data locally (manually or using autonomous sea and land stations) and globally (using aircraft and satellite imaging).

Predicting this trend can be extremely beneficial to those who are directly or indirectly involved in this industry. Many scholars have begun data analysis of this model in recent years since location-based climate analysis and forecast of various entities based on weather data has become so significant. The various weather factors have a significant impact on the entire human system, including clothing, living, employment, agriculture, and so on. Agricultural trends in a given location are mostly determined by weather variables such as wind, temperature, humidity, precipitation, and so forth. We focus on the agricultural trend in a specific place in this research based on these variables, which we gathered from real-time data utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT). The proposed system predicts the agricultural trends by analyzing the real data with the help of the proposed model which is based on decision tree regression.

The duration of flower induction (DFI) for litchi plays determinative role for the success and the quality of flowering. It is hard to be reliably predicted because multiple factors including ages of trees, variety and dynamically environmental and climate variables have important impacts. Here we predicted the DFI for four litchi varieties using random forest (RF) implicit and stepwise regression (STR) explicit machine learning models. These models were trained and validated from the data consisting phenological phases from the mature of the last autumn shoots to the flower shedding, and the corresponding meteorological factors from 2009 to 2020. The DFI predictive models consider timescales from 1 h up to 10 days, and the determination coefficients from the 5-fold cross validation achieves 0.96 to 0.99. The high accuracy was maintained in the blind test, with the determination coefficients of 0.97–0.98 for the data in 2019 and 0.78–0.88 for 2020. The reliability is still sufficient to guide the cultivation of litchi although the dramatic climate change weaken the inherent multiple correlations for DFI. From these robust predictive models, we found ten important features that can be used to determine the DFI with consistent positive or negative contributions. They are the minimum cooling rate, the maturity time of the last autumn shoot, the maximum heating rate, the mean of minimum temperature, the mean of maximum temperature, the amount of heat accumulation at hot day with the minimum daily temperature above 22 °C, the maximum daily temperature below 26 °C, the minimum daily temperature below 6 °C, age, and the atmospheric relative humidity. © 2022","Chilling accumulation; Flower induction; Heat accumulation; Machine learning; Phenological phase; Prediction; Relative humidity","Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Forestry; Induction heating; Chilling accumulation; Daily temperatures; Determination coefficients; Flower induction; Heat accumulation; Litchi chinensis; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Phenological phase; Predictive models; Machine learning; accuracy assessment; bioaccumulation; climate change; cooling; high temperature; induced response; machine learning; model validation; prediction; relative humidity; shoot",Article,Scopus

Activation functions such as hard limit, triangular basis, hyperbolic tangent, sine-squared, and Gaussian radial basis are used to optimize the methodology. Based on the analysis performed, the nutrients are classified and the optimal soil conditions are proposed for different regions that are analyzed. Based on the study conducted, it is found that the soils in Tamil Nadu have normal electrical conductivity and are red in colour. They are found to be rich in potassium (35% of the samples), nitrogen (80% of the samples), and sulphur (75% of the sample) and sufficient or poor in magnesium, boron, zinc, and copper. © 2022 T.

In particular, crop prediction in agriculture is critical and is chiefly contingent upon soil and environment conditions, including rainfall, humidity, and temperature. In the past, farmers were able to decide on the crop to be cultivated, monitor its growth, and determine when it could be harvested. Today, however, rapid changes in environmental conditions have made it difficult for the farming community to continue to do so. Consequently, in recent years, machine learning techniques have taken over the task of prediction, and this work has used several of these to determine crop yield. To ensure that a given machine learning (ML) model works at a high level of precision, it is imperative to employ efficient feature selection methods to preprocess the raw data into an easily computable Machine Learning friendly dataset. To reduce redundancies and make the ML model more accurate, only data features that have a significant degree of relevance in determining the final output of the model must be employed. Thus, optimal feature selection arises to ensure that only the most relevant features are accepted as a part of the model. Conglomerating every single feature from raw data without checking for their role in the process of making the model will unnecessarily complicate our model. Furthermore, additional features which contribute little to the ML model will increase its time and space complexity and affect the accuracy of the model's output. The results depict that an ensemble technique offers better prediction accuracy than the existing classification technique. © 2013 IEEE.","Agriculture; classification; crop prediction; feature selection","Classification (of information); Cultivation; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Machine learning; Agricultural environments; Crop prediction; Environment conditions; Features selection; Humidity and temperatures; Machine learning models; Prediction-based; Security; Selection techniques; Soil conditions; Crops",Article,Scopus

Aims and methods: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of four machine learning algorithms to diagnose the state of soil compaction (NT and occasional tillage - OT). For these purposes, data from a field experiment conducted in a clayey Typic Hapludox with mechanical (chiselling and subsoiling) and chemical (gypsum and limestone) methods for mitigation of soil compaction were used. To diagnose the state of soil compaction, soil physical properties [soil bulk density, penetration resistance, macroporosity (MAC), microporosity (MIC), air capacity (AC), available water content, relative field capacity and total porosity (TP)] in addition to crop yield (Rel_Yield) were used as predictor variables for Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Key results: The most important variables for predicting the state of soil compaction were Rel_Yield and soil porosity (MAC, TP, MIC and AC). The machine learning algorithms had satisfactory performance in diagnosing which sites were compacted and which were not. The decision tree algorithms (CART and RF) performed better than ANN and SVM, reaching accuracy = 0.90, Kappa index = 0.76 and sensitivity = 0.83. Conclusions and implications: The machine learning algorithm approach proved to be an efficient tool in diagnosing soil compaction in continuous NT, improving decision-making concerning the use of OT. © 2022 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

An adaptable and robust method for estimating maize yield for the entire territory of China, however, is currently not available. The inherent trade-off between early estimates of yield and the accuracy of yield prediction also remains a confounding issue. To explore these challenges, we employ indicators such as GPP, ET, surface temperature (Ts), LAI, soil properties and maize phenological information with random forest regression (RFR) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) machine learning approaches to provide maize yield estimates within China. The aims were to: (1) evaluate the accuracy of maize yield prediction obtained from multimodal data analysis using machine-learning; (2) identify the optimal period for estimating yield; and (3) determine the spatial robustness and adaptability of the proposed method. The results can be summarized as: (1) RFR estimated maize yield more accurately than GBDT; (2) Ts was the best single indicator for estimating yield, while the combination of GPP, Ts, ET and LAI proved best when multi-indicators were used (R2 = 0.77 and rRMSE = 16.15% for the RFR); (3) the prediction accuracy was lower with earlier lead time but remained relatively high within at least 24 days before maturity (R2 &gt; 0.77 and rRMSE &lt;16.92%); and (4) combining machine-learning algorithms with multi-indicators demonstrated a capacity to cope with the spatial heterogeneity.

Agriculture holds a predominant position in the growth of any country's prosperity. However, there exists a major threat in the crop yield due to unpredictable and uncontrolled climatic changes, traditional farming methods, and poor irrigation services [10]. Machine learning is an arising research field in analysis of crop yield. Yield forecast is a very significant issue in agriculture. Machine learning methods are the better decision for this issue. Different Machine learning methods are utilized and assessed in agribusiness for assessing what's to come year's production of crop.

Accurate and rapid forecasting of winter wheat yield at the county level has been a high demand for the decision-making on the grain in precision agriculture. The current forecast of winter wheat yield is commonly used the crop models, meteorological statistics, or remote sensing data. It is very necessary to further improve the accuracy of yield forecasting on the winter wheat, particularly for the refine prediction at the county level. In this research, a forecast model of winter wheat yield was proposed at the county level to combine the Sentinel-2, MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) remote sensing data, and cultivated land distribution using the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the Back Propagation (BP) neural networks. A machine learning technology was also used to evaluate the forecast of winter wheat yield. Specifically, two modules were constructed for the planting area extraction and the yield forecast. Specifically, an improved CNN was selected to extract and identify the spectral features of winter wheat planting areas from the Sentinel-2 remote sensing data. An improved BP neural network was also used to forecast the yield of winter wheat for the subsequent residual block module. The geological features were calculated to compare the cultivated land distribution in the raw MODIS EVI remote sensing data in the yield forecast module after the identification of planting areas. The correlation between the specific information and the winter wheat yield data was verified to forecast the yield using the improved BP neural networks. Some indicators were calculated to evaluate the forecast performance and accuracy of the improved model, including the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2). The experiment results showed that a better performance was achieved for the county-level winter wheat yield forecast using CNN and BP neural networks in the validation set from Shandong Province, China (2014-2016), where the R2 value was above 0.87, while the MAEs and RMSEs were lower than 269.48 and 346.56 kg/hm2, respectively. There were 52.34% of counties in Shandong Province with a relative error between the forecast and the actual yield of less than 3%, whereas, 92.98% of counties with a relative error within 9%, indicating a less than 1.2% deviation between the simulation and experiment. In the validation set from Henan Province (2015-2019), the R2 value was above 0.96, while the MAEs and RMSEs were lower than 304.84 and 418.14 kg/hm2, respectively. There were 45.90% of counties in Henan Province with a relative error between the forecast and the actual yield of less than 3%, while 91.05% of counties with a relative error within 9%, indicating a less than 1.6% deviation between the simulation and experiment. In conclusion, the higher forecast accuracies were achieved in the verification sets of Shandong and Henan Province for the county-level winter wheat yield forecast using CNN and BP neural networks. The better performance of the model can be expected to deal with the random input data, indicating the excellent generalization and high robustness for the accurate and stable forecast of winter wheat yield. © 2022 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

From a public health perspective, food security is an essential social determinant for promoting healthy nutrition. Food security embraces four dimensions: physical availability of food, economic and physical access to food, food utilization, and the sustainability of the dimensions above. Integrally addressing the four dimensions is vital. Surprisingly most of the works focused on a single dimension of food security: the physical availability of food. Objective: The paper proposes a multi-dimensional dataset of open data and satellite images to characterize food security in the department of Cauca, Colombia. Methods: The food security dataset integrates multiple open data sources; therefore, the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining methodology was used to guide the construction of the dataset. It includes sources such as population and agricultural census, nutrition surveys, and satellite images. Results: An open multidimensional dataset for the Department of Cauca with 926 attributes and 9 rows (each row representing a Municipality) from multiple sources in Colombia, is configured. Then, machine learning models were used to characterize food security and nutrition in the Cauca Department. As a result, The Food security index calculated for Cauca using a linear regression model (Mean Absolute Error of 0.391) is 57.444 in a range between 0 and 100, with 100 the best score. Also, an approach for extracting four features (Agriculture, Habitation, Road, Water) of satellite images were tested with the ResNet50 model trained from scratch, having the best performance with a macro-accuracy, macro-precision, macro-recall, and macro-F1-score of 91.7, 86.2, 66.91, and 74.92%, respectively. Conclusion: It shows how the CRISP-DM methodology can be used to create an open public health data repository. Furthermore, this methodology could be generalized to other types of problems requiring the creation of a dataset. In addition, the use of satellite images presents an alternative for places where data collection is challenging. The model and methodology proposed based on open data become a low-cost and effective solution that could be used by decision-makers, especially in developing countries, to support food security planning.

The importance of characteristic variables was analyzed based on random forest algorithm. And a wheat yield prediction model was established by means of fusing multi-source spatio-temporal data. The results showed that enhanced vegetation index (EVI), solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and elevation was an important factor for remote sensing estimation of wheat yield, which was highly positively correlated with wheat yield. The importance of EVI, SIF and elevation to wheat yield exceeded 0.45, far greater than soil moisture, rainfall, maximum temperature, minimum temperature and other factors.

Nowadays, most of the researchers and scientists are found showing much attention in agricultural landscapes because the effectual land-cover (LC) mapping provides the correct information regarding the land uses and land cover. Crop classification is one of the essential issues in the agriculture field because it affects the government and private agencies economically. The number of methodologies exist to classify the crop images from the remotely sensed image, but the traditional methodologies do not perform well due to some factors, like blurring effect, noise, etc. We have proposed an Adaptive Fuzzy-Centred Denoising Filter (AFDF) and Extended Elman Neural Network (E2N2) to enhance visualization of crop image to crop classification in order to overcome traditional techniques RSI. The remote-sensing crop images have been considered in the proposed work, and the AFDF preprocesses the image to eradicate the noise. After that, the Jaccard Coefficient-based Shared Nearest Neighbour (JCSNN) segments the object as preprocessed images. The LTrP, DWT, GLCM, and shape features are extracted as the optimal features chosen by Enhanced Elephant Herding Optimization (E2HO). Lastly, the crop is classified using the E2N2 classifier. The high-resolution images were utilized for the experiments to validate the proposed work. At last, various techniques have been compared against the proposed system, and outcomes have shown significant enhancement in accuracy and reliability. The proposed system obtains 88.01% F-measure, 95.2% accuracy with lesser FPR values that are greater when analogized to all prevalent methods.

Rainfall, on the other hand, plays a significant role in agriculture-while an adequate amount of rainfall can be considered as a blessing, if the amount is inordinate or scant, it can ruin the entire hard work of the farmers. In this work, the rainfall dataset of the Vellore region, of Tamil Nadu, India, in the years 2021 and 2022 is forecasted using several machine learning algorithms. Feature engineering has been performed in this work in order to generate new features that remove all sorts of autocorrelation present in the data. On removal of autocorrelation, the data could be used for performing operations on the time-series data, which otherwise could only be performed on any other regular regression data. The work uses forecasting techniques like the AutoRegessive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and exponential smoothening, and then the time-series data is further worked on using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Later, regression techniques are used by manipulating the dataset. The work is benchmarked with several evaluation metrics on a test dataset, where XGBoost Regression technique outperformed the test. The uniqueness of this work is that it forecasts the daily rainfall for the year 2021 and 2022 in Vellore region.

Combining remotely sensed big data with deep learning for yield estimation has attracted extensive attention. However, it is still challenging to understand and quantify the time cumulative effects of crop growth over time for crop yield estimation. In this study, we combined the powerful feature extraction capability of the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the advantage of time series memory of the gated recurrent unit (GRU) network to develop a novel deep learning model called CNN-GRU for estimating county-level winter wheat yields in the Guanzhong Plain using three remotely sensed variables, vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI), leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR). The CNN-GRU model was able to extract features related to yield from the input variables and the accuracy of the proposed model (R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 462.56 kg/ha, MRE = 8.90 %) was higher than that of the GRU model (R2 = 0.62, RMSE = 479.79 kg/ha, MRE = 9.34 %), and the CNN-GRU model's reliability and robustness were confirmed by applying the leave-one-year-out cross-validation. Furthermore, we applied the proposed CNN-GRU model to simulate the wheat yields in the Plain pixel by pixel and examined the spatiotemporal patterns of the estimated yields. The distribution of yields presented the spatial characteristics of low yields in the east and high yields in the west, and the inter-annual variation characteristics of overall stability and steady increase. Additionally, we explored the possibility of timely prediction of winter wheat yield and the contribution of the multi-variables at different growth stages to yield estimation based on the ability of deep learning to reveal cumulative effects and non-linear relationships between influencing factors and yield. It was found that the information reflected by the multi-variables from late March to late April was important for yield estimation and the best prediction could be achieved approximately 20 days before the harvest of winter wheat. Our study demonstrated that combining CNN and GRU was an efficient and promising approach to improve yield estimation, offering great promise for global crop yield estimation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Convolutional neural network (CNN); Gated recurrent unit (GRU); Remotely sensed multi-variables; Vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI); Yield estimation","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Food supply; Learning systems; Pixels; Recurrent neural networks; Remote sensing; Time series; Vegetation; Convolutional neural network; Crop yield; Gated recurrent unit; Multi variables; Remotely sensed multi-variable; Vegetation temperature condition index; Wheat yield; Yield estimation; Crops; artificial neural network; crop yield; leaf area index; NDVI; photosynthetically active radiation; remote sensing; vegetation type; yield response; China; Guanzhong Plain; Shaanxi",Article,Scopus

The higher spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 compared to Landsat allows for satellite-based crop yield mapping even in relatively small scaled agricultural settings such as found in Switzerland and other central European regions. In this study, five years (2017–2021) of cereal crop yield data from a combine harvester were used to model crop yield within-field, on a spatial scale corresponding to the Sentinel-2 pixel level. Three established methods from literature using (i-ii) spectral indices and (iii) raw satellite reflectance as well as (iv) a recurrent neural network (RNN) were chosen for analysis. Although the RNN approach did not outperform the other methods, it was more efficient because of the comparatively simple end-to-end training of the model, resulting in much less time spent on data cleaning and feature extraction needed for spectral index time series analysis. The RNN was also able to discriminate cloudy data by itself, reaching similar performance levels as if using pre-processed, cloud-free data. Modelling was performed on individual years, all years combined and on unseen years using leave-one-year-out cross-validation. The models performed best when using data from all years (R2 up to 0.88, relative RMSE up to 10.49 %) and showed poor performance when predicting on unseen data years, especially for years with previously unknown weather patterns. This highlights the importance of yearly model calibration and the need for continuous data collection enabling long time series for future crop yield models. © 2023 The Authors","Cereals; Crop yield; Precision farming; Random forest; Recurrent neural network; Sentinel-2; Spectral indices; Time series analysis","artificial neural network; calibration; cereal; crop yield; Landsat; mapping method; pixel; policy making; precision agriculture; prediction; Sentinel; spatial resolution; spectral analysis; time series analysis; Switzerland",Article,Scopus

However, transferring this technology to farms is not easy. This study aimed to make a variable fertilization map in a commercial plot where there is no data from a yield monitor, combining machine learning techniques and farmer’s knowledge. In addition to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from Sentinel-2 and a digital elevation model (DEM), information captured by a yield monitor in 2019 was used to train and validate models. Among the 15 algorithms trained, the best result was obtained by the random forest (RF), with an RMSE of 496 and R2 of 0.90. Using the “leave one out” technique, the capacity to predict an entire plot was tested. Finally, the RF algorithm was tested on a 12-hectare wheat plot where no yield data were available. The novelty of this work lies in the collaborative work developed between farmers and researchers to implement the VRF technique in plots where precise yield data do not exist and in the “leave one out” validation. The collaboration between scientists and farmers resulted in a very positive exchange of information that allowed the farmer to change the fertilization strategy of the whole farm and the scientists to better understand how soil properties and plot history affect yield. © 2022 by the authors.","NDVI; nitrogen fertilization; on-farm experimentation; precision agriculture; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

Directorate of Economics and Statistics (DES) based district-wise wheat yield dataset was also used with satellite variables to develop the historical wheat yield model based on the multiple regression analysis. Spatially, higher, lower, and lower to moderate wheat yields are observed in the western and northwest parts, southern and southeast parts, and lower-middle to the lower right parts of the state respectively throughout the study years. Remarkably, the years 2017,2018, and 2019 witnessed higher yields, while 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2015 witnessed lower yield. The developed wheat yield models performed well, as R2 values were observed between 0.3 and 0.76 between the satellite-derived and DES-based district-wise mean yield. The mean absolute error was found to be considerable and ranged between 0.22 and 1.7 t/ha during the study years. The adopted methodology can be used across the different parts of the globe at the local to country scale for a quantitative crop yield depiction and mapping at the satellite pixel level.

Thus, the objectives of this study were: 1) to evaluate the influence of climatic elements on cotton yield in Brazil, 2) to predict cotton yield using machine learning algorithms based on climatic elements, 3) to calibrate and test machine learning models to forecast cotton yield based on climate data, and 4) to interpolate the estimated cotton yield of the most accurate model. The cotton yield forecast as a function of climatic elements was performed using machine learning algorithms with four parameters adjusted by ordinary least squares. The models show that cotton yield has a sigmoid trend due to the accumulation of P, PET, STO, and EXC during the cycle.

Salinity is one of the most harmful environmental stresses and severely reduces the yield of crops. In the present study, the effectiveness of multiple regression techniques, convolutional neural network (CNN), and artificial neural network (ANN) are investigated using regression results as input variables in the estimation of sunflower grain yield under normal and salinity conditions, separately. Then the most important parameters identified in two conditions (head diameter, plant height, and weight of five seeds) were used in the CNN model to predict grain yield for the time when we do not know the growth conditions of the plant. The fitted model had R2 = 0.914, MAPE = 4.95, MAE = 0.163, and RMSE = 1.699. The results showed that the CNN model provides the best estimation for sunflower grain yield compared to the ANN and multiple regression models. Sensitivity analysis showed that head diameter was the most effective trait on sunflower seed yield. Yield estimation with head diameter, identified as the most influential parameter, with the CNN model produced acceptable performance and accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); Grain yield; Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Networks; Multiple regression; Networks with Radial Basis Function (RBF); Neural network; Sunflower","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Multilayer neural networks; Oilseeds; Radial basis function networks; Regression analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Sunflower oil; Yield stress; Base function; Convolutional neural network; Grain yield; Multi layer perceptron networks; Multiple regressions; Network with radial base function; Neural-networks; Radial basis; Sunflower; Neural network models; artificial neural network; crop yield; herb; multiple regression; salinity",Article,Scopus

However, high-spatiotemporal-resolution rice yield datasets are limited over this large region. The lack of such products greatly hinders studies that are aimed at accurately assessing the impacts of climate change and simulating agricultural production. Based on annual rice maps in Asia, we incorporated multisource predictors into three machine learning (ML) models to generate a high-spatial-resolution (4 km) seasonal rice yield dataset (AsiaRiceYield4km) for the 1995-2015 period. Predictors were divided into four categories that considered the most comprehensive rice growth conditions, and the optimal ML model was determined based on an inverse probability weighting method. The results showed that AsiaRiceYield4km achieves good accuracy for seasonal rice yield estimation (single rice: R2 0.88, RMSE 920 kg ha-1; double rice: R2 0.91, RMSE 554 kg ha-1; and triple rice: R2 0.93, RMSE 588 kg ha-1). Compared with single rice from the Spatial Production Allocation Model (SPAM), the R2 of AsiaRiceYield4km was improved by 0.20, and the RMSE was reduced by 618 kg ha-1 on average. In particular, constant environmental conditions, including longitude, latitude, elevation and soil properties, contributed the most (∼45 %) to rice yield estimation. For different rice growth periods, we found that the predictors of the reproductive period had greater impacts on rice yield prediction than those of the vegetative period and the whole growing period. AsiaRiceYield4km is a novel long-term gridded rice yield dataset that can fill the unavailability of high-spatial-resolution seasonal yield products across major rice production areas and promote more relevant studies on agricultural sustainability worldwide.

The protein content of pea is characterized by a high lysine content and low allergenicity. This has made consumers appreciate peas increasingly in recent years, not only for their taste, but also for their nutritional value. An important element of pea cultivation is the ability to predict protein content, even before harvest. The aim of this research was to develop a linear and a non-linear model for predicting the percentage of protein content in pea seeds and to perform a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of these models. The analysis also focused on identifying the variables with the greatest impact on protein content. The research included the method of machine learning (artificial neural networks) and multiple linear regression (MLR). The input parameters of the models were weather, agronomic and phytophenological data from 2016–2020. The predictive properties of the models were verified using six ex-post forecast measures. The neural model (N1) outperformed the multiple regression (RS) model. The N1 model had an RMS error magnitude of 0.838, while the RS model obtained an average error value of 2.696. The MAPE error for the N1 and RS models was 2.721 and 8.852, respectively. The sensitivity analysis performed for the best neural network showed that the independent variables most influencing the protein content of pea seeds were the soil abundance of magnesium, potassium and phosphorus. The results presented in this work can be useful for the study of pea crop management. In addition, they can help preserve the country’s protein security. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial neural networks; multiple linear regression; pea; protein prediction; sensitivity analysis; weather conditions",,Article,Scopus

Here, multiple machine learning (ML) techniques are employed to predict sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) seed yields (SSY) using agro-morphological features. Various ML models were applied, coupled with the PCA (principal component analysis) method to compare them with the original ML models, in order to evaluate the prediction efficiency. The Gaussian process regression (GPR) and radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) models exhibited the most accurate SSY predictions, with determination coefficients, or R2 values, of 0.99 and 0.91, respectfully. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) obtained using the ML models ranged between 0 and 0.30 t/ha (metric tons/hectare) for the varied modeling process phases. The estimation of the sesame seed yield with the coupled PCA-ML models improved the performance accuracy. According to the k-fold process, we utilized the datasets with the lowest error rates to ensure the continued accuracy of the GPR and RBF models.

Therefore, the implementation of efficient nutrient management stratigies is important for food security and environmental safety. Amongst the essential plant nutrients, managing nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) based production systems is citically important to maximize profitable production with minimal negative environmental impacts. We investigated the effects of different fertilizer-N (viz. 0–240 kg N ha-1; N0-N240) and fertilizer-K (viz. 0–90 kg K ha-1; K0-K90) application rates on wheat productivity, nutrient (N and K) use efficiency viz. partial factor productivity (PFPN/K), agronomic efficiency (AEN/K), physiological efficiency (PEN/K), reciprocal internal use efficiency (RIUEN/K), and profitability in terms of benefit-cost (B-C) ratio, gross returns above fertilizer cost (GRAFC) and the returns on investment (ROI) on fertilizer application. These results revealed that wheat productivity, plant growth and yield attributes, nutrients uptake and use efficiency increased significantly (p&lt;0.05)with fertilizer-N application, although the interaction effect of N x K application was statistically non-significant (p&lt;0.05). Fertilizer-N application at 120 kg N ha-1 (N120) increased the number of effective tillers (8.7%), grain yield (17.3%), straw yield (15.1%), total N uptake (25.1%) and total K uptake (16.1%) than the N80. Fertilizer-N application significantly increased the SPAD reading by ~4.2–10.6% with fertilizer-N application (N80N240), compared with N0. The PFPN and PFPK increased significantly with fertilizer-N and K application in wheat. The AEN varied between 12.3 and 22.2 kg kg-1 with significantly higher value of 20.8 kg kg-1 in N120. Fertilizer-N application at higher rate (N160) significantly decreased the AEN by ~16.3% over N120. The N120treatment increased the AEK by ~52.6% than N80 treatment. Similarly the RIUEN varied between 10.6 and 25.6 kg Mg-1 grain yield, and increased significantly by ~80.2% with N120 as compared to N0 treatment. The RIUEK varied between 109 and 15.1 kg Mg-1 grain yield, and was significantly higher in N120 treatment. The significant increase in mean gross returns (MGRs) by ~17.3% and mean net returns (MNRs) by ~24.1% increased the B-C ratio by ~15.1% with N120 than the N80 treatment. Fertilizer-N application in N120 treatment increased the economic efficiency of wheat by ~24.1% and GRAFC by ~16.9%. Grain yield was significantly correlated with total N uptake (r = 0.932**, p&lt;0.01), K uptake (r = 0.851**), SPAD value (r = 0.945**), green seeker reading (r = 0.956**), and the RIUEN (r = 0.910**). The artificial neural networks (ANNs) showed highly satisfactory performance in training and simulation of testing data-set on wheat grain yield. The calculated mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) for wheat were 0.0087, 0.834 and 0.052, respectively. The well trained ANNs model was capable of producing consistency for the training and testing correlation (R2 = 0.994**, p&lt;0.01) between the predicted and actual values of wheat grain yield, which implies that ANN model succeeded in wheat grain yield prediction. © 2022 Sharma et al.

However, smoke plumes generated by wildfire scatter visible light incidents on the surface, thereby interrupting accurate monitoring of the area where wildfire occurs. Therefore, a technology to extract smoke in advance is required. Deep learning technology is expected to improve the accuracy of smoke extraction, but the lack of training datasets limits the application. However, for clouds, which have a similar property of scattering visible light, a large amount of training datasets has been accumulated. The purpose of this study is to develop a smoke extraction technique using deep learning, and the limits due to the lack of datasets were overcome by using a cloud dataset on transfer learning. To check the effectiveness of transfer learning, a small-scale smoke extraction training set was made, and the smoke extraction performance was compared before and after applying transfer learning using a public cloud dataset. As a result, not only the performance in the visible light wavelength band was enhanced but also in the near infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR). Through the results of this study, it is expected that the lack of datasets, which is a critical limit for using deep learning on smoke extraction, can be solved, and therefore, through the advancement of smoke extraction technology, it will be possible to present an advantage in monitoring wildfires. © 2022 Korean Society of Remote Sensing.

Therefore, the accurate classification of pod morphology is pivotal. Aiming at the problem that the morphology of soybean pods cannot be accurately classified, we proposed an automatic classification method based on machine vision and convolutional neural networks in this paper. Methods: First, we designed an image acquisition system to obtain soybean pod images. Then, a convolutional neural network model was designed to extract the deep features of soybean pods in the images. Finally, the deep feature training support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to classify soybean pods of different forms, and the traditional features are designed to compare the morphological classification of soybean pods.

This challenge is even more complex, particularly in the recent years where climate change is also continuously changing the weather patterns, against which, drainage systems are designed to cope with. Addressing these challenges using conventional agricultural drainage approaches may not be effective, as they do not provide a means of projecting future drainage system performance levels. Of importance is also to use drainage design approaches that consider inputs and experiences from water managers, planners, and designers with various levels of skills. In this regard, two issues need to be balanced when designing agricultural drainage systems; first, to ensure the design approach is user-friendly and inclusive of both middle and higher level decision makers, and, secondly, that the designed drainage system copes with future drainage needs.

Unpredicted and extreme rainfall events is a major concern in mitigation of natural disasters such as flood, drought, etc. which is a common phenomenon encountered in many locations across the world. In this context, periodical rainfall data is analyzed using various types of Holt-Winters method for the Tamil Nadu region, India. Historical monsoon data is analyzed from 2004 to 2018. Usually throughout the year (0-365), the northeast and southwest monsoon period will get a quantifiable amount of rainfall. Rainfall precipitation for Tamil Nadu range: 431-470.7 mm in northeast monsoon and 174-828.8 mm in the southwest monsoon. Rainfall precipitation events indicate seasonality behavior. So, the exponential smoothing method is implemented in demand forecasting of rainfall perception for the Tamil Nadu region. Various types of Holt-Winters methodologies were implemented in demand forecasting of rainfall data analysis. A comparative study has been made in this research and an effective model has been identified with minimum Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The results indicate Holt-Winter's Multiplicative method with optimized smoothing parameter (MHW OSP) gives better results (RMSE- 96.308%) than other techniques. This methodology can be implemented for demand forecasting of rainfall data in other parts of the world. Keywords.

Despite tremendous technological advancements, fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil) continue to be the world’s primary source of energy. Global energy scenarios indicate a change in coal consumption trends in the future, which in turn will have commercial, geopolitical, and environmental consequences. We investigated coal consumption up to 2030 using a new hybrid method of WOANFIS (whale optimization algorithm and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system). The WOANFIS method’s performance was assessed by the MSE (Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), STD (error standard deviation), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and coefficient of correlation (R2) among the real dataset and the WOANFIS result. For the prediction of global coal consumption, the proposed WOANFIS had the best MAE, RMSE, and correlation coefficient (R2) values, which were 0.00113, 0.0047, and 0.98, respectively. Lastly, future global coal consumption was predicted up to 2030 by WOANFIS. Following 150 years of coal dominance, the results demonstrate that WOANFIS is a suitable method for estimating worldwide coal consumption, which makes it possible to plan for the transition away from coal. © 2022 by the authors.

It is the most often eaten stable food and is in great demand in the market as the world's population continues to expand. Rice output should be boosted to fulfil the growing demand. As a result, the yield of plant crops diminishes, creating an environment conducive to the spread of infectious illnesses. To boost the production of agricultural fields, it is necessary to remove plant diseases from the environment. This study presents ways for recognising three types of rice plant diseases, as well as a healthy leaf, in rice plants. This includes image capture, image preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification of three rice plant illnesses, as well as classification of a healthy leaf, among other techniques. Following the K-means segmentation, the features are extracted utilising three criteria, which are colour, shape, and texture, to generate a final product. Colour, shape, and texture are the parameters used in the extraction of the features. It is proposed that a novel intensity-based technique is used to retrieve colour features from the infected section, whereas the form parameters of the infected section, such as the area and diameter, and the texture characteristics of the infected section are extracted using a grey-level co-occurrence matrix. The colour features are retrieved depending on the characteristics of the features. All three previous techniques were surpassed by the proposed fuzzy logic-based probabilistic neural network on a range of performance metrics, with the new network obtaining greater accuracy. Finally, the result is validated using the fivefold cross-validation method, with the final accuracy for the diseases such as bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, healthy leaf, and rice blast being 95.20 percent, 97.60 percent, 99.20 percent, and 98.40 percent, respectively, and 95.40 percent for the disease brown spot. © 2022 Anusha Preetham et al.",,"Color; Computer circuits; Crops; Diseases; Extraction; Fuzzy neural networks; Image segmentation; K-means clustering; Liquids; Textures; Brown spots; Color features; Food crops; Fractional differential; Fuzzy-Logic; Neural-networks; Plant disease; Probabilistics; Rice plants; Shape and textures; Fuzzy logic",Article,Scopus

Though right crop selection is the main boosting key to maximize crop yield by doing soil analysis and considering metrological factors, the lack of knowledge about soil fertility and crop selection is the main reason for low crop production. In the changed current climate, the farmers having primitive knowledge about conventional farming are facing challenges about making sagacious decisions on crop selection. The selection of the same crop in every seasonal cycle makes the low soil fertility. This study is aimed at making an efficient and accurate system using IoT devices and machine learning (ML) algorithms that can correctly select a crop for maximal yield. Such a system is reliable as compared to the old laboratory testing manual systems, which bear the chances of human errors. Correct selection of a crop is predominantly a priority in agricultural arena. As a contribution, we propose an ML-based model, Smart Crop Selection (SCS), which is based on data of metrological and soil factors. These factors include nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, CO2, pH, EC, temperature, humidity of soil, and rainfall. Existing IoT-based systems are not efficient as compared to our proposed model due to limited consideration of these factors. In the proposed model, real-time sensory data is sent to Firebase cloud for analysis. Its results are also visualized on the Android app. SCS ensembles the following five ML algorithms to increase performance and accuracy: Decision tree, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, and Gaussian Naïve Bayes. For rainfall prediction, a dataset containing historical data of the last fifteen years is acquired from Bahawalpur Agricultural Department. This dataset and an ML algorithm, Multiple Linear Regression leverages prediction of the rainfall in future, a much-desired information for the health of any crop. The Root Mean Square Error of the rain fall prediction model is 0.3%, which is quite promising.

Satellite imagery is an interesting big data source that has potential applications in agriculture. When applying satellite imagery for crop yield estimation, practitioners choose which resolution (i.e., grid size) of images to use. Processing higher resolution images requires greater computing resources compared to lower resolution images. Practitioners may choose to use lower resolution images, but there may be a loss in crop yield model estimation accuracy. The cost of computation has decreased significantly with the advent of cloud computing and open access computing portals such as Google Earth Engine. These technologies have made satellite image processing more economical. The objective of this research is to quantify the crop yield estimation accuracy improvement that could be achieved by using higher resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with a cropland mask. NDVI (a measure of crop greenness) data was collected for 48 U.S. states for four crops over 11 years. The crops investigated were corn, soybeans, spring wheat, and winter wheat. Each crop yield regression model estimation showed improved accuracy (R2) as the satellite NDVI resolution increased. Results suggest that using higher resolution satellite NDVI provides more accurate crop yield estimation compared to lower resolution satellite NDVI. This study is believed to be the most comprehensive study to date using NDVI to estimate crop yield, analyzing 48 states in the U.S. and four crops over 11 years using three resolution levels. © 2022","Big data; Crop insurance; Crop yield estimation; NDVI; Remote sensing",,Article,Scopus

In precision agriculture area, a widely-used method for measuring AGB is to develop regression relationships between AGB and agronomic traits extracted from multi-source remotely sensed images based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. However, such approach requires expert knowledges and causes the information loss of raw images. The objectives of this study are to (i) determine how multi-source images contribute to AGB estimation in single and whole growth stages; (ii) evaluate the robustness and adaptability of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) and other machine learning algorithms regarding AGB estimation. To establish multi-source image datasets, this study collected UAV red-green-blue (RGB), multispectral (MS) images and constructed the raster data for crop surface models (CSMs). Agronomic features were derived from the above-mentioned images and interpreted by the multiple linear regression, random forest, and support vector machine models. Then, a DCNN model was developed via an image-fusion architecture. Results show that the DCNN model provides the best estimation of maize AGB when a single type of image is considered, while the performance of DCNN degrades when sufficient agronomic features are used. Besides, the information of above three image datasets changes with various growth stages. The structure information derived from CSM images are more valuable than spectrum information derived from RGB and MS images in the vegetative stage, but less useful in the reproductive stage.

In this study, the linear regression method (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, LASSO) and BP neural network method (back propagation neural network, BPNN) were chosen for field yield prediction. The four variable types considered are climate, soil moisture, crop growth, and flag leaf photosynthesis. Crop-related data were collected in 12 winter wheat varieties that are widely grown in the North China Plain from 2018 to 2021. The same data set was used for both LASSO and BPNN models’ development and validation. The results show that models based on LASSO method had the determination coefficient (R2) from 0.23 to 0.78, and the root mean square error (RMSE) from 548 to 1023 kg ha−1, while they were 0.66–0.94 and 302–684 kg ha−1 in models based on the BPNN method. This showed that the BPNN method performed better in field wheat yield prediction than the LASSO method. For BPNN method, using only a single variable at the early grain-filling stage had the similar prediction accuracy to using single or comprehensive variables in multiple growth periods, indicating that the field wheat yield can be predicted earlier by BPNN method with fewer indicators. Last, an optimal field wheat prediction model was developed by the BPNN method using crop growth variables (dry matter and leaf area index) at the early grain-filling stage, with the R2 and RMSE of 0.93 and 288 kg ha−1 in the model development stage, respectively, and correspondingly 0.86 and 481 kg ha−1 in the model validation stage.

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing offers the possibility of predicting crop yields with its advantages of flexibility and high resolution. However, most of the existing remote sensing yield estimation studies focused solely on crops but did not fully consider the influence of soil on yield formation. As an integrated system, the status of crop and soil together determines the final yield. Compared to crop-only yield prediction, the approach that additionally considers soil background information will effectively improve the accuracy and reduce bias in the results. In this study, a novel method for segmenting crop and soil spectral images based on different vegetation coverage is first proposed, in which pixels of crop and soil can be accurately identified by determining the discriminant value Q. On the basis of extracting crop and soil waveband’s information by individual pixel, an innovative approach, projected non-negative matrix factorization based on good point set and matrix cross fusion (PNMF-MCF), was developed to effectively extract and fuse the yield-related features of crop and soil. The experimental results on winter wheat show that the proposed segmentation method can accurately distinguish crop and soil pixels under complex soil background of four different growth periods. Compared with the single reflectance of crop or soil and the simple combination of crop and soil reflectance, the fused yield features spectral matrix FP obtained with PNMF−MCF achieved the best performance in yield prediction at the flowering, flag leaf and pustulation stages, with R2 higher than 0.7 in these three stages. Especially at the flowering stage, the yield prediction model based on PNMF-MCF had the highest R2 with 0.8516 and the lowest RMSE with 0.0744 kg/m2. Correlation analysis with key biochemical parameters (nitrogen and carbon, pigments and biomass) of yield formation showed that the flowering stage was the most vigorous season for photosynthesis and the most critical stage for yield prediction.

This study aimed to develop an in-season wheat yield prediction model at field-scale by integrating proximal sensing and weather data. Nine multi-N rates field experiments were conducted at five sites involving different wheat cultivars from 2010 to 2020. Proximal sensing data were collected from a Crop Circle sensor at the stem elongation stage and weather data were collected from 30 days before planting to the flowering date. Eleven statistical and machine learning (ML) regression algorithms were adopted, along with two aggregation intervals (disaggregated or aggregated data) and two feature selection methods (based on Pearson Correlation Coefficient or Recursive Feature Elimination). The results revealed that the ensemble learning models (Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting) achieved the best overall performance (R2 = 0.74 ∼ 0.78, RMSE = 0.78 ∼ 0.85 t ha−1). Feature importance analysis showed that Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE), average temperature, minimum temperature, and relative humidity were the most contributory features, especially from the planting date to the stem elongation date (for weather features).

Farmer needs awareness about his soil and the methods to improve his soil to grow the healthy crops. We propose an approach which involves deep learning and some IoT features to help our farmers.

However, the visual sensor of the visual/inertial navigation odometer (VIO) system is easily affected by the environmental and lighting conditions, and the measurement data of the Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) have a drift problem caused by accumulated errors, which makes the VIO system transmit the robot rotation uncertainty inaccurately. Aiming at the defects of vision sensor and IMU in robot positioning, to effectively improve the accuracy and stability of rigid body pose estimation while eliminating system internalization errors, a matrix Lie group representation based Cubature Kalman filter (CKF) VIO framework is proposed in this paper. By utilizing the high-dimensional matrix Lie group, which is composed of IMU's position, orientation, velocity and spatial three-dimensional (3D) feature points, to represent the system state variables, the accurate estimation of the robot's pose is achieved under the CKF framework. This paper derives the motion model of the IMU and the camera observation, and describes the process of constructing the Cubature point of the exponential map when the state vector dimension is high, and also transfers the state uncertainty and observation update. Finally, pose estimation accuracy verification experiments are carried out. Results show that the proposed algorithm not only inherits the advantages of the invariant extended Kalman filter (In-EKF) in terms of convergence and consistency, but also avoids the complexity of matrix solution process, improving the accuracy of robot pose estimation effectively. © 2022 IEEE.","CKF; matrix lie group; robot state estimation; VIO","Lie groups; Robot vision; Uncertainty analysis; Cubature kalman filters; Inertial measurements units; Inertial navigations; Kalman-filtering; Matrix lie groups; Pose-estimation; Robot pose; Robot state estimation; Uncertainty; Visual/inertial navigation odometer; Extended Kalman filters",Conference Paper,Scopus

Crop growth and development are influenced by the weather. Therefore, models using weather variables can provide reliable predictions of crop yields. It can be tough to select the best crop production forecasting model. Therefore, in this study, five alternative models, viz., stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), an artificial neural network (ANN), the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), an elastic net (ELNET), and ridge regression, were compared in order to discover the best model for rice yield prediction. The outputs from individual models were used to build ensemble models using the generalized linear model (GLM), random forest (RF), cubist and ELNET methods. For the previous 21 years, historical rice yield statistics and meteorological data were collected for three districts under three separate agro-climatic zones of Chhattisgarh, viz., Raipur in the Chhattisgarh plains, Surguja in the northern hills, and Bastar in the southern plateau. The models were calibrated using 80% of these datasets, and the remaining 20% was used for the validation of models. The present study concluded that for rice crop yield forecasting, the performance of the ANN was good for the Raipur ((Formula presented.) = 1, (Formula presented.) = 1 and (Formula presented.) = 0.002, (Formula presented.) = 0.003) and Surguja ((Formula presented.) = 1, (Formula presented.) = 0.99 and (Formula presented.) = 0.004, (Formula presented.) = 0.214) districts as compared to the other models, whereas for Bastar, ELNET ((Formula presented.) = 90, (Formula presented.) = 0.48) and LASSO ((Formula presented.) = 93, (Formula presented.) = 0.568) performed better. The performance of the ensemble model was better compared to the individual models. For Raipur and Surguja, the performance of all the ensemble methods was comparable, whereas for Bastar, random forest (RF) performed better, with R2 = 0.85 and 0.81 for calibration and validation, respectively, as compared to the GLM, cubist, and ELNET approach. © 2023 by the authors.","ANN; ELNET; LASSO; ridge regression; SMLR; yield forecasting","artificial neural network; comparative study; crop yield; food safety; forecasting method; harvesting; regression analysis; rice; shrinkage; statistical analysis; Chhattisgarh; India",Article,Scopus

Growing research investigation to establish climate change, implications in the sectors are influencing the connection.

The major purpose is to illustrate the relationship between various climatic characteristics and maize production, as well as to predict forecasts using ARIMA and machine learning approaches. When compared to ARIMA, the proposed method performs better in forecasting maize yields. Consequently, the neural network provides the majority of the prospective talents for forecasting maize production. Seasonal growth is susceptible of forecasting crop yields with tolerable competencies, and efforts are essential to quantify the proposed methodology that forecasts overall crop yield in diverse neighbourhoods in Saudi Arabia’s regions. The proposed combined ARIMA-LSTM model requires less training, with parameter adjustment having less effect on data prediction without bias. To monitor progress, the model may be trained repeatedly using roll back. The correlations between estimated yield and measured yield at irrigation and rain-fed sites were analysed to further validate the robustness of the optimal ARIMA-LSTM method, and the results demonstrated that the proposed model can serve as an effective approach for different types of sampling sites and has better adaptability to inter-annual fluctuations in climate with findings indicating a dependable and viable method for enhancing yield estimates. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences & Polish Academy of Sciences.","Agriculture; Maize; Prediction; Saudi Arabia; Time series","Climate change; Climate models; Long short-term memory; Time series; Time series analysis; Weather forecasting; Crop yield; Extreme weather events; Human support; Leadtime; Machine-learning; Maize; Maize production; Maize yield; Saudi Arabia; Times series; Crops; crop production; crop yield; forecasting method; machine learning; maize; prediction; statistical analysis; Saudi Arabia",Article,Scopus

The crop damage, poor productivity, soil management, water management, weather forecasting, and insect-pest attacks are illustrations of such kinds of problems. The modern agriculture practices have been observed to be capable to address the aforementioned issues. The farmers can be trained to incorporate Information and Communication Technology (ICT) with modern farming practices.

Recent developments in interpretable machine learning techniques offer opportunities to use these methods in agronomic studies. Our objectives were two-fold: (1) to assess the performance of different machine learning methods to explain on-farm wheat yield variability in the Northwestern Indo-Gangetic Plains of India, and (2) to identify the most important drivers and interactions explaining wheat yield variability. A suite of fine-tuned machine learning models (ridge and lasso regression, classification and regression trees, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, gradient boosting, extreme gradient boosting, and random forest) were statistically compared using the R2, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The best performing model was again fine-tuned using a grid search approach for the bias-variance trade-off. Three post-hoc model agnostic techniques were used to interpret the best performing model: variable importance (a variable was considered “important” if shuffling its values increased or decreased the model error considerably), interaction strength (based on Friedman's H-statistic), and two-way interaction (i.e., how much of the total variability in wheat yield was explained by a particular two-way interaction). Model outputs were compared against empirical data to contextualize results and provide a blueprint for future analysis in other production systems. Tree-based and decision boundary-based methods outperformed regression-based methods in explaining wheat yield variability. Random forest was the best performing method in terms of goodness-of-fit and model precision and accuracy with RMSE, MAE, and R2 ranging between 367 and 470 kg ha−1, 276–345 kg ha−1, and 0.44–0.63, respectively. Random forest was then used for selection of important variables and interactions. The most important management variables explaining wheat yield variability were nitrogen application rate and crop residue management, whereas the average of monthly cumulative solar radiation during February and March (coinciding with reproductive phase of wheat) was the most important biophysical variable. The effect size of these variables on wheat yield ranged between 227 kg ha−1 for nitrogen application rate to 372 kg ha−1 for cumulative solar radiation during February and March. The effect of important interactions on wheat yield was detected in the data namely the interaction between crop residue management and disease management and, nitrogen application rate and seeding rate. For instance, farmers’ fields with moderate disease incidence yielded 750 kg ha−1 less when crop residues were removed than when crop residues were retained. Similarly, wheat yield response to residue retention was higher under low seed and N application rates. As an inductive research approach, the appropriate application of interpretable machine learning methods can be used to extract agronomically actionable information from large-scale farmer field data. © 2022 The Authors","Accumulated local effect plot; Big data; Interaction strength; Partial dependency plot; Quantile regression; Random forest; Variable importance","crop yield; disease incidence; machine learning; productivity; regression; India",Article,Scopus

Traditional methods typically use linear regression models with clear assumptions; such methods are unable to capture the complex relationships between genotypes and phenotypes. Non-linear models (e.g., deep neural networks) have been proposed as a superior alternative to linear models because they can capture complex non-additive effects. Here we introduce a deep learning (DL) method, deep neural network genomic prediction (DNNGP), for integration of multi-omics data in plants. We trained DNNGP on four datasets and compared its performance with methods built with five classic models: genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP); two methods based on a machine learning (ML) framework, light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and support vector regression (SVR); and two methods based on a DL framework, deep learning genomic selection (DeepGS) and deep learning genome-wide association study (DLGWAS). DNNGP is novel in five ways. First, it can be applied to a variety of omics data to predict phenotypes. Second, the multilayered hierarchical structure of DNNGP dynamically learns features from raw data, avoiding overfitting and improving the convergence rate using a batch normalization layer and early stopping and rectified linear activation (rectified linear unit) functions. Third, when small datasets were used, DNNGP produced results that are competitive with results from the other five methods, showing greater prediction accuracy than the other methods when large-scale breeding data were used. Fourth, the computation time required by DNNGP was comparable with that of commonly used methods, up to 10 times faster than DeepGS. Fifth, hyperparameters can easily be batch tuned on a local machine. Compared with GBLUP, LightGBM, SVR, DeepGS and DLGWAS, DNNGP is superior to these existing widely used genomic selection (GS) methods. Moreover, DNNGP can generate robust assessments from diverse datasets, including omics data, and quickly incorporate complex and large datasets into usable models, making it a promising and practical approach for straightforward integration into existing GS platforms. © 2022 The Author","deep learning; genomic selection; multi-omics data; prediction method","genome-wide association study; genomics; plant breeding; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Multiomics; Neural Networks, Computer; Plant Breeding",Article,Scopus

Here, spectral bands, topographic wetness index, and topographic position index were integrated to predict corn yield at the management zone using machine learning approaches (e.g., extremely randomized trees, gradient boosting machine, XGBoost algorithms, and stacked ensemble models). We tested four approaches: only spectral bands, spectral bands + topographic position index, spectral bands + topographic wetness index, and spectral bands + topographic position index + topographic wetness index. We also explored two approaches for model calibration: the whole-field approach and the site-specific model at the management zone level. The model’s performance was evaluated in terms of accuracy (mean absolute error) and tendency (estimated mean error). The results showed that it is possible to predict corn yield with reasonable accuracy using spectral crop information associated with the topographic wetness index and topographic position index during the flowering growth stage.

In this study, we evaluated the robustness of data-driven models for estimating soybean yields at 120 days after sow (DAS) in the main producing regions in Brazil; and evaluated the reliability of the “best” data-driven model as a tool for early prediction of soybean yields for an independent year. Our methodology explicitly describes a general approach for wrapping up publicly available databases and build data-driven models (multiple linear regression—MLR; random forests—RF; and support vector machines—SVM) to predict yields at large scales using gridded data of weather and soil information. We filtered out counties with missing or suspicious yield records, resulting on a crop yield database containing 3450 records (23 years × 150 “high-quality” counties). RF and SVM had similar results for calibration and validation steps, whereas MLR showed the poorest performance. Our analysis revealed a potential use of data-driven models for predict soybean yields at large scales in Brazil with around one month before harvest (i.e. 90 DAS). Using a well-trained RF model for predicting crop yield during a specific year at 90 DAS, the RMSE ranged from 303.9 to 1055.7 kg ha–1 representing a relative error (rRMSE) between 9.2 and 41.5%.

The weather plays a crucial role in crop growth and development. Therefore, models using weather variables can provide reliable forecasts for crop yield and choosing the right model for crop production forecasts can be difficult. Therefore in the present study, an attempt was made to find the best model for wheat yield forecast by using five different techniques viz. Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression (SMLR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Elastic Net (ELNET) and Ridge regression.

The models cannot map the raw data exactly with the prediction values, and the output relies on the quality of the input features used. To resolve these issues, the concept of Q-learning is hybridized with deep learning to enable exact mapping of the raw data with the prediction values.

Recent advancements in precision agriculture have highlighted the importance of innovative methods for crop yield gap estimation. Weather variations influencing oil palm yield emphasized the need for exploring underlying yield gap patterns for timely forecast and policymaking to minimize it. This work proposed a supervised machine learning approach for the prediction of the oil palm yield gap in Pahang state Malaysia under fluctuating environmental conditions. Multisource data and machine learning methods combined with domain knowledge were explored. The procedure was carried out by (1) exploratory data analysis, (2) data preprocessing, (3) feature selection, (4) model selection, (5) model training, (6) hyper parameter tuning, and (7) performance evaluation. Additionally, features interdependency and the correlations with yield gap were also examined. The performance of the random forest regression model was assessed using six evaluation metrics including mean squared error and coefficient of determination R2 as the key performance indicator. Results suggested that wind speed, maximum temperature, and surface pressure have a positive association while optimum rainfall, root zone soil moisture, and solar radiation are negatively correlated with the yield gap. The R2 of 0.933 for train and 0.798 for test data with low error values indicated good prediction accuracy. Moreover, statistical measures such as model-based feature importance, learning curve, k-fold, validation curve, error, and residual analysis helped to investigate the model's learning process.

Forecasts can support farmers in planning many daily decisions. These decisions may include crop irrigation, optimum time to fertilize, and what days are suitable for working in the field to increase productivity. The judicious decisions that farmers take will result in a profitable crop. For a successful harvest, the farmer has to be aware of the moisture, light, temperature, etc. Various elaborate weather information, which includes past records, present weather, and future forecasts are essential. Many timely decisions contribute to the cost of the crop. As an example, a farmer could save water and money by not irrigating when rain is forecast. It is also important for farmers to have knowledge about the optimum time to apply fertilizer, along with the application rate and type of fertilizer to use. Adverse weather at the time of application can wash away the field’s profits. The weather must be dry enough that the fertilizer does not get washed away, yet the field must be moist enough that the fertilizer moves down into the soil. There are also good days and bad days to work in the field, depending on the soil moisture and temperature. Accurate weather prediction can help farmers to decide when to work efficiently in their day-to-day crop management. Wind forecasts are also an important factor in applying pest control products. Crop-destroying pests can also be influenced by weather conditions. Guidance in this can help to determine when to apply pest control measures. Crop dusters that spray fungicidal or insecticidal chemicals on plants from above should only be used when wind conditions will not result in sprayed chemicals missing their targets. This chapter discusses parameters like humidity, temperature, moisture level of soil, etc., which are necessary for the favorable growth of a particular crop. The models and methods discussed include technologies like machine learning (ML), sensor networks related to wireless (WSN), and the Internet of Things (IoT) as solutions to the important challenges faced by agrarian systems. As discussed in this chapter, wireless sensor networks inculcate many types of sensors interrelated with Raspberry pi, in addition to technology interfaces such as the IoT which help to acquire data on a massive scale across the globe. The collected data related to various standards may be transported to the cloud platform and then it can be interpreted and final conclusions drawn in coordination with the climatic conditions. Then the data are further processed and utilized for prediction of weather with the help of ML and also with the help of application interfaces related to programming, and then the result can be appraised for the farmers and they are able to enhance their productivity by utilizing this information.

In this regard, various high efficient irrigation systems have received particular attention. This paper investigates drip (tape) irrigation (DTI). It estimates water productivity (WP), application efficiency (AE) and corn yield in the Miandoab region located in the southeast of Lake Urmia using swarm intelligence methods. The studies were performed in-field monitoring by using a hybrid approach based on an extreme machine learning method (ELM) and tree growth optimization algorithm (TGO) to estimate corn yield, WP, and AE criteria. TGO-ELM method was evaluated on a dataset including irrigation-fertilizer, climate, and soil characteristics of corn fields from 2020 to 2021. The DTI method was compared with the standard furrow irrigation (FI). The field monitoring results showed that the DTI increased corn yield, WP, and AE by 22.2%, 0.58 kg/m3, and 70%, respectively, compared to the FI method. The modeling results showed that model M9 gave a more optimistic estimate of the corn crop, WP and AE by applying the parameters of irrigation levels, rainfall, and soil moisture as model inputs. Also, TGO-ELM with optimal values ​​of R2 = 0.988, RMSE = 0.005, NSE = 0.981, and MAPE = 0.812 had a good performance compared to similar intelligent methods. The results confirmed that TGO-ELM can provide a more accurate estimation of corn yield compared to other similar methods. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Application efficiency; Drip (tape) irrigation; Extreme machine learning; Tree growth algorithm; Water productivity",,Article,Scopus

The objective of this study is to predict the regional sugarcane crop yield for the Uttar Pradesh (UP) province using analysis-ready moderate-resolution satellite images. The four machine learning regression algorithms, namely support vector regression (SVR), gradient boosting regression (GBR), eXtreme gradient boosting regression (XGB), and random forest regression (RF), were used to train and predict the district-wise sugarcane yield in UP. Standard MODIS data products such as leaf area index (LAI), fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), evapotranspiration (ET), potential evapotranspiration (PET), latent heat flux (LE), and gross primary product (GPP) were obtained for a period of eighteen years, and their monthly average was extracted and used as features in the model. The models were trained using eighty percent of the observations with the annual district-wise sugarcane yield as the response variable. Iterative feature selection was done based on correlation factor and feature importance to reduce the dimensionality of the data from around a hundred features to twenty-four. The R2 metric was used as the evaluation metric to choose the best predictive model. The study showed results with moderate accuracy and was used to estimate the sugarcane crop yield for the year 2019. The highest R2 of 0.66 and an RMSE value of 7.15 t/ha were obtained using the GBR algorithm by using seven variables and 24 features. The model was very closely followed by the XGB model with an R2 of 0.65 and an RMSE value of 7.20 t/ha. The FPAR-based features contributed the most to the model followed by the LAI and NDVI features. The simple methodology used in the study uses ready-to-use satellite products and has operationalization potential. The model can be improved by incorporating more satellite-derived parameters and an accurate crop mask to avoid spectral interference from other cropland. © 2022, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","FPAR; Gradient boosting; MODIS; Random forest; Regional; Sugarcane; XGBoost; Yield prediction","crop; evapotranspiration; latent heat flux; machine learning; photosynthetically active radiation; vegetation index; India; Uttar Pradesh",Article,Scopus

Coordination failures among the stakeholders in the agriculture sector result in the inability to provide accurate, timely, and actionable information. As a result, the agriculture sector faces several challenges, such as oversupply, undersupply and crop wastage. The existing digital agriculture eco-system can gather data produced by different stakeholders more frequently and accurately. However, the data collected from various stakeholders should be analyzed and forecasted to deliver the required knowledge to make more informed and appropriate decisions. This study was carried out to propose a ‘Closed-loop information flow model’ to provide forecasted demand and supply to create better coordination among stakeholders. Different prototypes were designed to deliver forecasted demand and supply information for major stakeholders in the agriculture sector. Initially, farmers, input suppliers, and logistic suppliers were selected in this study to expand to other stakeholders in the future. The prediction model was developed and evaluated according to stakeholder requirements by analyzing the actual and predicted data. The existing ‘Govi-Nena’ mobile-based farmer application was refined to provide supply and demand information for farmers. Separate web dashboards were designed to deliver the required information to other stakeholders such as input suppliers and logistic suppliers. Designed prototypes will be evaluated with the stakeholders for further improvements. The proposed Closed-loop information flow model for forecasted demand and supply will bridge the market information gap among stakeholders.

However, cost-effectively characterizing agronomically important phenotypic traits on a large scale remains a bottleneck. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based high-throughput phenotyping has recently become a prominent method, as it allows large numbers of plants to be analyzed in a time-series manner. In this experiment, 233 inbred lines from the maize (Zea mays L.) diversity panel were grown in the field under different nitrogen treatments. Unmanned aerial vehicle images were collected during different plant developmental stages throughout the growing season. A workflow for extracting plot-level images, filtering images to remove nonfoliage elements, and calculating canopy coverage and greenness ratings based on vegetation indices (VIs) was developed. After applying the workflow, about 100,000 plot-level image clips were obtained for 12 different time points. High correlations were detected between VIs and ground truth physiological and yield-related traits. The genome-wide association study was performed, resulting in n = 29 unique genomic regions associated with image extracted traits from two or more of the 12 total time points. A candidate gene Zm00001d031997, a maize homolog of the Arabidopsis HCF244 (high chlorophyll fluorescence 244), located underneath the leading single nucleotide polymorphisms of the canopy coverage associated signals were repeatedly detected under both nitrogen conditions.

Especially India is an extensive agricultural resource for the world's expansive economic growth. But in extensive data analysis, a problem for the recommendation of the seasonal crop is tedious because of improper feature analysis due to varying periods in weather conditions. So time variation-based big data analysis is essential for research improvement. To resolve this problem, we propose a Timestamp feature variation-based weather prediction using multi-perception neural classification (TFV-MPNC) for successive crop recommendation in big data analysis. Initially, the pre-processing was carried out to prepare the redundant noise dataset for fast prediction. Initially, the Preprocessing ensures the Contemporary Forecasting rate (CFR) for predicting the previous deficiency rate. Based on that Time stamp feature analysis (TSFA). The Dense region harvest rate (DRHR) was evaluated, and features were decision using Fuzzy intensive decision Function (FIDF), selected the scaled features and trained with multi-perception neural classification (MPNN).

Furthermore, trend analysis among weather parameters and crop yield was also carried out in this study using non-parametric Mann–Kendall test and Sen’s slope method. Significant negative correlation was observed between wheat yield and some of the weekly weather variables, viz., maximum temperature (48, 49, 50, 51, 52, and 4th SMW), and total rainfall (50, 51, and 1st SMW) while positive correlation was observed with morning relative humidity (49 and 3rd SMW).

Therefore, a residue feature analysis with empirical mode decomposition is proposed so as to enhance the spatial sequential pattern mining efficacy from the raster serial remote sensing images. At first, input images are being extracted by means of minima and maxima pattern by computing the mean of envelops and the intrinsic mode function components.

The analysis is based on seven main features, including grain length, width, weight, yellowness, broken, chalky, and/or damaged kernels for six different types of rice: IRRI-6, PK386, 1121 white and Selah, Super kernel basmati brown, and white rice. The system was tested in rice factories for 3 months and demonstrated 99% accuracy in determining the size, weight, color, and chalkiness of rice kernels. An accuracy of 98.8% was achieved for the classification of damaged and undamaged kernels, 98% for determining broken kernels, and 100% for paddy kernels. The results are significant because the developed system improves the local rice quality testing capacity through a faster, more accurate, and less expensive mechanism in comparison to previous research studies, which only evaluated four features of the singular rice type, rather than the seven features achieved in this study for six rice types. © 2022 by the authors.","computer vision; food quality assessment; machine learning; rapid testing; rice quality control",,Article,Scopus

It impairs the memory and thinking ability of a person. Its symptoms are not known at an early stage due to which a person is deprived of receiving medication at an early stage. Dementia, a general form of Alzheimer, is difficult to diagnose and hence a proper system for detection of Alzheimer is needed. Various studies have been done for accurate classification of patients with or without Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, accuracy of prediction is still a challenge depending on the type of data used for diagnosis. Timely identification of true positives and false negatives are critical to the diagnosis. This work focuses on extraction of optimal features using nature-inspired algorithms to enhance the accuracy of classification models. This work proposes two hybrid nature-inspired algorithms - particle swarm optimization with genetic algorithm (PSO_GA) and whale optimization algorithm with genetic algorithm, (WOA_GA) to improve prediction accuracy. The performance of proposed algorithms is evaluated with respect to various existing algorithms on the basis of accuracy and time taken. Experimental results depict that there is trade-off in time and accuracy. Results revealed that the best accuracy is achieved by PSO_GA while it takes higher time than WOA and WOA_GA. Overall WOA_GA gives better performance accuracy when compared to a majority of the compared algorithms using support vector machine (SVM) and AdaSVM classifiers. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","Alzheimer detection; feature selection; genetic algorithm; particle swarm optimization; Whale optimization","Biomimetics; Classification (of information); Diagnosis; Economic and social effects; Feature Selection; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neurodegenerative diseases; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machines; Alzheimer; Alzheimer detection; Features selection; Nature inspired algorithms; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Swarm optimization; Whale optimization; Genetic algorithms",Article,Scopus

In this paper, a regularized model predictive control (MPC) is proposed for an ARMAX process affected by outlier noise. The outlier noise is modeled as an auxiliary variable in the ARMAX model, and the MPC cost function is reconstructed to reduce the influence of outlier noise on multiple data items. The stability of the proposed method and the convergence of output/input and state are guaranteed. The degree to which regularization affects the system can be adjusted by an optional parameter. This paper provides some helpful insights on how to choose this optional parameter in the cost function.

When switching from manual to automation mode, image mapping must survey soil testing and plant vegetation development. The existing studies met several shortcomings in terms of higher cost remote sensing tools, higher execution time, higher computational complexity, and so on. To tackle these issues, we proposed a multispectral images feature extraction with vegetation indices for potato crops monitoring. This article discusses the many characteristics that are used to identify plants, such as plant count, plant height estimation, plant area evaluation, plant distance, crop vegetation growth detection, damaged area identification, and higher-lower vegetation. Calculating Crop growth days and minimizing leaf or root damage are provided by QGIS and Pix4Dmapper software. It measured all soil testing parameters as well as plant vegetative development. We provided a raster function for aggregation based on a low-resolution image for estimating plant area evaluation and parameters in a growing zone for higher cultivation plants. This research revealed 98% vegetation indices as well as plant characteristics. Various key parameters such as leaf area density, plants coordinates, plant height, the proportion of diffuse light for incident sunlight, and solar zenith angle are examined. The Quality Report of Vegetation Indices Value resulted in an accuracy of 96% when good or terrible weather conditions exist.

Moreover, domain experts only can understand the rationale of the recommender system where the analyzed data is stored in the cloud system. This research proposes a machine learning–based solution for an athletic dataset that automatically predicts the state of the individual with features like age, gender, calories, temperature, pressure, heart rate, pulse rate, sugar level, respiratory conditions, and state of the body. This research concentrates on modeling a framework for implementing the machine learning approaches with an optimization problem. Here, a novel extreme multi-gradient evolutionary computation (EMGEC) with improved grey wolf optimization (IGWO) is proposed to achieve exploration and exploitation during the selection of features. The dataset collected from the athletes during the marathon (running) is collected from online resources and the feature subsets are extracted from the dataset. The features of these data are analyzed and encoded before placing it over the cloud environment. The performance of the proposed machine learning approach is compared with other approaches and provides better prediction accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure respectively. The accuracy of the anticipated model is 83.13%, precision is 91.1%, and recall is 91.3% which is substantially higher than of other approaches. The proposed model shows a better trade-off in contrast to prevailing approaches like SVM, RF, k-NN, and logistic regression. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Exploration and exploitation; Extreme multi-gradient evolutionary computation; Improved grey wolf optimization; Optimization; Recommender system","Automation; Calculations; Economic and social effects; Evolutionary algorithms; Nearest neighbor search; Support vector machines; Athletic performance; Exploration and exploitation; Extreme multi-gradient evolutionary computation; Gray wolves; Improved gray wolf optimization; Machine learning approaches; Multi gradient; Optimisations; Performance optimizations; Recommender systems",Article,Scopus

Sustainable development requires a holistic perspective of several dimensions of human society and addressing them together. With the increasing proliferation of Big Data, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence, there is increasing interest in designing Policy Support Systems (PSS) for supporting policy formulation and decision-making. This paper formulates an architecture for a PSS, based on combining data from several sources. These datasets are subject to cleaning and semantic resolution and are then used as inputs to support the building of semantic models based on Bayesian Networks. A set of models built for different SDG sub-goals and indicators is used to create a “Policy Enunciator” in the form of data stories. Policy formulation is supported by modeling interventions and counter-factual reasoning on the models and assessing their impact on the data stories. Two kinds of impacts are observed: (a) downstream impacts that track expected outcomes from a given intervention, and (b) lateral impacts, that provide insights into possible side-effects of any given policy intervention. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bayesian network; Big data; Knowledge graph; Policy support system","Bayesian networks; Decision making; Information management; Knowledge graph; Planning; Semantics; Sustainable development; Bayesia n networks; Big-data machines; Holistic perspectives; Human society; Knowledge graphs; Policy formulation; Policy makers; Policy support; Policy support system; Support systems; Big data",Conference Paper,Scopus

Wheat, as one of the most important agricultural products, which is widely consumed all over the world, has a very important role in people's nutrition, particularly among Iranians, the diet of whom is highly dependent on bread. Product forecasting is critical for any country so that decisions about storage, import or export, etc. can be planned. In this paper, several univariate time series models and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model are used to forecast wheat production in Iran. Annual wheat production, total annual precipitation, total applied fertilizer, population, and wheat cultivated area data were used in the period between 1961-1962 to 2018-2019. With the minimum values of 1.45894, 1.00329, 1.0448, and 1.09742 obtained for RMSE, AIC, HQC, and SIBC criteria, respectively, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) (1,1,1) was selected as the best univariate model. In testing the ANN models, total annual precipitation, total applied fertilizer, population, and wheat cultivated, area as input variables, and wheat production, as output variable, were used. Among several NN models, the Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN) model with five hidden layers had the lowest MSE= 0.153 and was chosen in this study. Comparison between the ANN model and the ARIMA (1,1,1) model showed that RMSE= 0.391, MSE= 0.153, and MAPE= 0.4231 in the ANN model were much lower than that of the ARIMA (1,1,1) model.

However, only poor approximations of the productivity of wheat crops in China can be obtained using traditional linear regression models based on vegetation indices and observations of the yield. In this study, Sentinel-2 (multispectral data) and ZY-1 02D (hyperspectral data) were used together with 15709 gridded yield data (with a resolution of 5 m × 5 m) to predict the winter wheat yield. These estimates were based on four mainstream data-driven approaches: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The method that gave the best estimate of the winter wheat yield was determined, and the accuracy of the estimates based on multispectral and hyperspectral data were compared. The results showed that the LSTM model, for which the RMSE of the estimates was 0.201 t/ha, performed better than the RF (RMSE = 0.260 t/ha), GBDT (RMSE = 0.306 t/ha), and SVR (RMSE = 0.489 t/ha) methods. The estimates based on the ZY-1 02D hyperspectral data were more accurate than those based on the 30-m Sentinel-2 data: RMSE = 0.237 t/ha for the ZY-1 02D data, which is about a 5% improvement on the RSME of 0.307 t/ha for the 30-m Sentinel-2 data. However, the 10-m Sentinel-2 data performed even better, giving an RMSE of 0.219 t/ha. In addition, it was found that the greenness vegetation index SR (simple ratio index) outperformed the traditional vegetation indices. The results highlight the potential of the shortwave infrared bands to replace the visible and near-infrared bands for predicting crop yields Our study demonstrates the advantages of the deep learning method LSTM over machine learning methods in terms of its ability to make accurate estimates of the winter wheat yield.

Artificial intelligence provides a robust tool for integrating environmental, physiological, and management data and predicting crop yield. In this study, we used a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model in its default and hybrid learning modes to predict wheat yield. In its default mode, MLP was trained with the backpropagation algorithm, and in the hybrid mode, MLP was trained with the Water Striders Algorithm (WSA), Sine-Cosine Algorithm (SCA), and Genetic Algorithm (GA). We further considered two ensemble modeling approaches, including the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and Copula-based Bayesian Model Averaging (CBMA). The study area was classified into four homogenous wheat cultivation regions using the Fuzzy clustering approach, and for each region, the models were trained based on 30 years of fertilizer information, harvested yield, and climatic data. Our results showed that hybridizing MLP with an optimization algorithm provides more accurate yield predictions than its default mode. WSA required the lowest computational time, and its combination with MLP resulted in a more accurate yield prediction compared to other optimization algorithms. The accuracy of yield predictions was further improved when ensemble modeling was implemented. Accordingly, the CBMA approach generated the most accurate result with the lowest uncertainty range. The mean absolute error (MAE) of the CBMA was 0.026, 0.058, 0.088, 0.133, and 0.0201 lower than that of the BMA, MLP-WSA, MLP-SCA, MLP-GA, and MLP models.

Commonly, more fertilizers have been applied to improve grain yield. There is a need to optimize fertilizers, to reduce environmental pollution, and to increase agricultural production. Maize is the main crop in China, and its ample production is of vital importance to guarantee regional food security. In this study, the RGB and multispectral images, and maize grain yields were collected from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform. To confirm the optimal indices, RGB-based vegetation indices and textural indices, multispectral-based vegetation indices, and crop height were independently applied to build linear regression relationships with maize grain yields. A stepwise regression model (SRM) was applied to select optimal indices. Three machine learning methods including: backpropagation network (BP), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) and the SRM were separately applied for predicting maize grain yields based on optimal indices. RF achieved the highest accuracy with a coefficient of determination of 0.963 and root mean square error of 0.489 (g/hundred-grain weight).

To date, their confounding effects, as well as the associated uncertainties, are not well quantified at the global scale. Here, we disentangle the separate and confounding effects of temperature and precipitation on global maize yield under 25 climate scenarios. Instead of relying on a single type of crop model, as pursued in most previous impact assessments, we utilize machine learning, statistical and process-based crop models in a novel approach that allows for reasonable inter-method comparisons and uncertainty quantifications. Through controlling precipitation, an increase in warming of 1 °C could cause a global yield loss of 6.88%, 4.86% or 5.61% according to polynomial regression, long short-term memory (LSTM) and process-based crop models, respectively. With a 10% increase in precipitation, such negative temperature effects could be mitigated by 3.98%, 1.05% or 3.10%, respectively. When temperature is fixed at the baseline level, a 10% increase in precipitation alone could lead to a global yield growth of 0.23%, 1.43% or 3.09% according to polynomial regression, LSTM and process-based crop models, respectively. Further analysis demonstrates substantial uncertainties in impact assessment across crop models, which show a larger discrepancy in predicting temperature impacts than precipitation effects. Overall, global-scale assessment is more uncertain under drier conditions than under wet conditions, while a diverse uncertainty pattern is found for the top ten maize producing countries. This study highlights the important role of climate interactions in regulating yield response to changes in a specific climate factor and emphasizes the value of using both machine learning, statistical and process crop models in a consistent manner for a more realistic estimate of uncertainty than would be provided by a single type of model. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, it is difficult for LAI field measurements to collect a sufficient amount of sample data in mangrove wetlands. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposed an approach for expanding training samples and quantitatively evaluated the performance of estimating LAI for mangrove communities using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Transformer algorithms. This study also explored the effects of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Sentinel-2A multispectral, orbital hyper spectral (OHS), and GF-3 SAR images on LAI estimation of different mangrove communities. Finally, this paper evaluated the LAI estimation ability of mangrove communities using ensemble learning regression (ELR) and DLR algorithms. The results showed that: (1) the UAV images achieved the better LAI estimation of different mangrove communities (R2 = 0.5974–0.6186), and GF-3 SAR images were better for LAI estimation of Avicennia marina with high coverage (R2 = 0.567). The optimal spectral range for estimating LAI for mangroves in the optical images was between 650–680 nm. (2) The ELR model outperformed single base model, and produced the high-accuracy LAI estimation (R2 = 0.5266–0.713) for different mangrove communities. (3) The average accuracy (R2) of the ELR model was higher by 0.0019–0.149 than the DLR models, which demonstrated that the ELR model had a better capability (R2 = 0.5865–0.6416) in LAI estimation. The Transformer-based LAI estimation of A. marina (R2 = 0.6355) was better than the DNN model, while the DNN model produced higher accuracy for Kandelia candel (KC) (R2 = 0.5577).

The aim of this study was to identify the key meteorological factors affecting the harvest date (model M_HARV) and yield of the soybean variety Augusta (model M_YIELD) using a neural network sensitivity analysis. The dates of the start of flowering and maturity, the yield data, the average daily temperatures and precipitation were collected, and the Selyaninov hydrothermal coefficients were calculated during a fifteen-year study (2005–2020 growing seasons). During the experiment, highly variable weather conditions occurred, strongly modifying the course of phenological phases in soybean and the achieved seed yield of Augusta cultivar. The harvesting of mature soybean seeds took place between 131 and 156 days after sowing, while the harvested yield ranged from 0.6 t·ha−1 to 2.6 t·ha−1 . The sensitivity analysis of the MLP neural network made it possible to identify the factors which had the greatest impact on the tested dependent variables among all the analyzed factors. It was revealed that the variables assigned ranks 1 and 2 in the sensitivity analysis of the neural network forming the M_HARV model were total rainfall in the first decade of June and the first decade of August.

This study aims to demonstrate the capability of medium-resolution imagery in precision agriculture by developing an example of canola yield mapping using Sentinel-2 data in central Alberta. Two simple empirical models for mapping precision canola yield are tested: one using random forest regression and a second using functional linear regression. Both take as input freely-available Sentinel-2 time series images and use these to predict precision yield gathered by a yield monitor. The models were able to predict crop yield to within 12–16% accuracy of the reference yield. These results also demonstrate that a time series of medium-resolution multispectral imagery can capture small-scale variation in crop yields. The proposed methods can be applied to other areas or cropping systems to improve understanding of crop growth at both the field-level and regional-level. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Crop yield; Functional linear regression; Random forest regression; Time series images","accuracy assessment; canola; crop yield; cropping practice; mapping method; precision agriculture; regression analysis; satellite imagery; spectral resolution; time series analysis; Alberta; Canada",Article,Scopus

Agriculture is believed to have been developed at several times in several areas. With global population rapidly increasing, there is a need to increase crop production. Traditional methods used by farmers are not adequate enough to fulfill the requirement. Therefore, farmers are using pesticides and various other harmful products in order to increase their crop production. Agriculture automation is an emerging area and a new theme for every country for a better crop production. Machine learning can be a huge help with this automation needed in agri-technology in order to get more satisfied production without having any adverse effect on the environment or the human body. By making use of machine learning techniques in sensor data, various fields of agriculture are moving into real-time programs by artificial intelligence that are providing a valuable and effective means to farmers in order to take correct decisions and actions. In this chapter, there is a review of the techniques used especially for the wheat crop, including merits and demerits in yield prediction and disease detection in wheat crop. Wheat is the necessary crop product for human beings to live in this world. The chapter concludes by discussing enhancements that can be done in the current techniques in order to predict wheat yield and detect wheat diseases in very early stages. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The effects of quantitative trait locus (QTL), for traits typically at the single-organ level over a short time scale, were projected for their impact on crop growth during the whole growing season in the field. This approach can provide more markers for selection programmes for specific environments whilst also allowing for prioritization.

Recently, numerous researchers have utilized machine learning (ML) methods to predict crop yield, using observational climate variables and satellite data. Meanwhile, some studies also illustrated the potential of state-of-the-art dynamical atmospheric prediction in crop yield forecasting. However, the potential of coupling both methods has not been fully explored. Herein, we aimed to establish a skilled ML–dynamical hybrid model for crop yield forecasting (MHCF v1.0), which hybridizes ML and a global dynamical atmospheric prediction system, and applied it to northern China at the S2S time scale. In this study, we adopted three mainstream machining learning algorithms (XGBoost, RF, and SVR) and the multiple linear regression (MLR) model, and three major datasets, including satellite data from MOD13C1, observational climate data from CRU, and S2S atmospheric prediction data from IAP CAS, used to predict winter wheat yield from 2005 to 2014, at the grid level. We found that, among the four models examined in this work, XGBoost reached the highest skill with the S2S prediction as inputs, scoring R2 of 0.85 and RMSE of 0.78 t/ha 3–4 months, leading the winter wheat harvest. Moreover, the results demonstrated that crop yield forecasting with S2S dynamical predictions generally outperforms that with observational climate data. Our findings highlighted that the coupling of ML and S2S dynamical atmospheric prediction provided a useful tool for yield forecasting, which could guide agricultural practices, policy-making and agricultural insurance. © 2022 by the authors.

There are several spatial disaggregation methods to generate gridded yield maps, but these either use an oversimplified approach with only a couple of ancillary data or an overly complex approach with limited flexibility and scalability. This study developed a spatial disaggregation method using improved spatial weights generated from machine learning. When applied to Chinese maize yield, extreme gradient boosting (XGB) derived the best prediction results, with a cross-validation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.81 at the municipal level. The disaggregated yield at 1 km grids could explain 54% of the variance of the county-level statistical yield, which is superior to the existing gridded maize yield dataset in China. At the site level, the disaggregated yields also showed much better agreement with observations than the existing gridded maize yield dataset. This lightweight method is promising for generating spatially explicit crop yield datasets with finer resolution and higher accuracy, and for providing necessary information for maize production risk assessment in China under climate change. © 2022 by the authors.

Robust forecast devices are able to provide unbiased forecasts just after structural change but at the cost of higher variance in normal times. Therefore, there is a trade-off between bias and variance when we intend to forecast a variable under the possibility of structural breaks. In order to choose the best model for each case scenario, we propose a novel algorithm based on the Reinforcement Learning method. Our method is able to gather history performance from all the tested models and choose the one with best performance depending on the “state” of data as soon as the effects of this change are perceived. Hence, our method is able to adapt to the changes of the structural break very fast and change back to a model with less variance as soon as those effects vanish. We provide evidence based on an extensive and rigorous empirical test with Monte Carlo and real data forecasting exercises that this algorithm can improve forecast performance in a scenario of structural change without losing significant performance under normal times. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Economic forecasting; Machine learning; Model selection; Reinforcement learning; Structural breaks",,Article,Scopus

Hence, the evaluation of soil quality is very important for determining the amount of nutrients that the soil require for proper yield. In present decade, the application of deep learning models in many fields of research has created greater impact. The increasing soil data availability of soil data there is a greater demand for the remotely avail open source model, leads to the incorporation of deep learning method to predict the soil quality. With that concern, this paper proposes a novel model called Improved Soil Quality Prediction Model using Deep Learning (ISQP-DL). The work considers the chemical, physical and biological factors of soil in particular area to estimate the soil quality. Firstly, pH rating of soil samples has been collected from the soil testing laboratory from which the acidic range has been categorized through soil test and the same data has been taken as input to the Deep Neural Network Regression (DNNR) model. Secondly, soil nutrient data has been given as second input to the DNNR model. By utilizing this data set, the DNNR method is used to evaluate the fertility rate by which the soil quality has been estimated. For training and testing, the model uses Deep Neural Network Regression (DNNR), by utilizing the dataset. The results show that the proposed model is effective for SQP (Soil Quality Prediction Model) with efficient good fitting and generality is enhanced with input features with higher rate of classification accuracy.

For this purpose, the growing degree days (GDDs) method and the Zadoks scale were used to simulate the wheat growth period and to divide it into seven stages. Forty-seven climatic variables of the first six stages were used to perform factor analysis and develop the climate-yield model. Gene expression programming (GEP), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and multivariate linear regression (MLR) methods were applied to derive models. The results showed that 90.7% of the total variance of 47 variables can be explained by 10 factors. Eighty-two percent of yield variations were modeled by these factors.

For this purpose, a study aimed at comparing five levels of water requirement including well water (control) (T1), urban treated wastewater (T2), 50% well water combination and 50% urban treated wastewater (T3), alternating irrigation between well water and urban treated wastewater each watering (T4), and combination of 33% well water and 66% urban treated wastewater (T5) in a randomized complete block design with three replications on water use efficiency and cotton yield. The study was conducted in a selected farm located in Torbat-Heydarieh southeastern Iran during two cropping years (2013 and 2014). Then, a hybrid tree growth optimization algorithm (TGO) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were used to predict cotton yield from four independent variables: soil characteristics, well water irrigation, urban treated wastewater irrigation, and meteorological data. Experimental treatments significantly altered soil chemistry. Cottonseed weight, cotton yield, and the number of bolls increased during the second year of treatments. A Duncan’s test of the mean showed that T3 significantly outperformed the other treatments measured as cottonseed weight, cotton yield, number of bolls, and water use efficiency. Overall, treatments utilizing treated wastewater outperformed the control, irrigation with well water. Additionally, based on the modeling results irrigation with an equal ratio of the well and treated wastewater resulted in improving soil and cotton growth conditions and yield during the study. © 2022, The Author(s).","Irrigation; Tree growth algorithm; Water-use efficiency; Yield","Cotton; Forestry; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Irrigation; Meteorology; Soils; Trees (mathematics); Wastewater treatment; Cotton yield; Functional properties; Growth algorithms; Irrigated cotton; Treated wastewater; Tree growth; Tree growth algorithm; Water use efficiency; Well water; Yield; Efficiency; algorithm; cotton; irrigation; urban area; wastewater treatment; water use efficiency",Article,Scopus

The aggravating factor for the successful applications of precision and predictive agriculture is the lack of granulated historical data due to slow, year-round cycles of crops, as a prerequisite for further analysis and modeling. A methodology of plant growth observation with the rapid performance of experiments is presented in this paper. The proposed system enables the collection of data with respect to various climate conditions, which are artificially created and permuted in the encapsulated design, suitable for further correlation with plant development identifiers. The design is equipped with a large number of sensors and connected to the central database in a computer cloud, which enables the interconnection and coordination of multiple geographically distributed devices and related experiments in a remote, autonomous, and real-time manner. Over 40 sensors and up to 24 yearly harvests per device enable the yearly collection of approximately 750,000 correlated database entries, which it is possible to independently stack with higher numbers of devices.

Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) provides a promising way to directly measure plant productivity from space. However, satellite SIF observations are only available at a coarse spatial resolution, making it impossible to monitor how individual crop types or farms are doing. This poses a challenging coarsely-supervised regression (or downscaling) task; at training time, we only have SIF labels at a coarse resolution (3km), but we want to predict SIF at much finer spatial resolutions (e.g. 30m, a 100x increase). We also have additional fine-resolution input features, but the relationship between these features and SIF is unknown. To address this, we propose Coarsely-Supervised Smooth U-Net (CS-SUNet), a novel method for this coarse supervision setting. CS-SUNet combines the expressive power of deep convolutional networks with novel regularization methods based on prior knowledge (such as a smoothness loss) that are crucial for preventing overfitting. Experiments show that CS-SUNet resolves fine-grained variations in SIF more accurately than existing methods. © 2022 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

The optimal use of water through irrigation is important for the evolution of agriculture. Many progressive growers make irrigation decisions using crop evapotranspiration (ETc). With the advent of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), lightweight sensors, such as thermal camera, can be mounted on the UAVs to take high-resolution images. Compared with satellite imagery, the spatial resolution of the UAV images can be at the centimeter level. Thus, in this article, the authors proposed a reliable individual tree-level irrigation inference system using a small UAV platform and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). A field study was conducted at the USDA-ARS Research Center in Parlier, California to train and test CNN models using images of the pomegranate trees. The pomegranate field was randomly designed into 16 equal blocks to test two irrigation levels, the low irrigation volume (35% and 50% of ETc) and high irrigation volume (75% and 100% of ETc), measured by a weighing lysimeter in the field. Results showed that the trained CNN model could successfully classify the individual tree using the thermal UAV imagery into the targeted irrigation levels.

Temperature forecasting is critical for making decisions in a variety of activities. To attain high predicted accuracy, predictive models must be built using accurate historical data. Data obtained through multiple methods, on the other hand, is inherently unreliable, resulting in less reliable predictive models. Hence, the data must be carefully managed, particularly to remove data uncertainty. While traditional data processing systems are simple to employ, they lack standard approaches for dealing with data uncertainty. As a consequence, this research presents a method for predicting temperature using ARIMA, as well as fuzzy data preparation strategies for dealing with fuzzy data during the data pre-processing phase. Standard deviation approaches were used to build fuzzy triangles for managing fuzzy data. The proposed method for creating fuzzy numbers using standard deviations yields fewer prediction errors and increases model performance, according to the experimental results.

In agriculture, data processing, storage, and manipulation are crucial for boosting agricultural productivity. Nevertheless, the reliance of modern agriculture on information technologies has triggered a great concern regarding the exposure of agricultural processes to various threats that can cause unexpected interruptions. Business continuity deals with these types of threats. Data collection, storage, and processing which can be effectively implemented by modern business intelligence systems can undoubtedly help modern agricultural enterprises implement standard business continuity policies. The present chapter introduces a novel multidimensional approach for facilitating effective data-based business continuity management policies in agriculture. The approach relies on realistic business continuity data from two agrarian industries that are used for the design of two business intelligence multidimensional schemas which facilitate decisions based on descriptive data and for conducting data mining predictions. Examples of descriptive data-based decision-making processes are depicted using business process modeling notation tools and the predictive decisions are conducted via machine learning classifiers. In this way, agricultural business continuity experts in collaboration with agronomists, researchers, and farmers can be motivated to apply fully data-driven agricultural business continuity policies in specific agricultural companies. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agriculture; BPMN; Business continuity; Business intelligence; Data warehouse; Decision making; Machine learning; Multidimensional models",,Book Chapter,Scopus

In this work, three main challenges are identified to classify feelings in Indian language tweets and possible methods for tackling such issues. Firstly, it has been found that the informal nature of tweets is crucial for the classification of feelings. Based on the tweets, the mental illness of the person has been classified. Therefore, to categorize Indian language tweets, a combination of grammar rules based on adjectives and negations is proposed. Secondly, people often express their feelings with slang words, abbreviations, and mixed words. A technique called field tags is used to include nongrammatical arguments such as slang words and diverse words. Thirdly, if a tweet is more complex, the morphological richness of the Indian language results in a loss of performance. The grammar rules are embedded in N-gram techniques and machine learning methods. These methods are grouped into three approaches, which functionally predict Indian language tweets with syntactic words. © 2022 B.

Traditional vegetation indices (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI, enhanced vegetation index, EVI) reveal a significant lag in response to drought events, which may affect the accuracy of maize yield estimation, especially under drought conditions. Although solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is recognized to be more sensitive to water stress, the potential of SIF for maize yield prediction under drought conditions requires further investigation. To this end, this study takes a major corn production region (Hebei Province) in China as an example to predict maize yield under both normal and drought years. We have utilized three satellite data (SIF, NDVI, and EVI), meteorological data, and soil data from 2000 to 2019 to predict the summer maize yield at the county level, using a machine learning (ML) method (random forest, RF) and a deep learning (DL) method (long and short-term memory, LSTM). The results showed that the overall accuracy of the predicted yield reached 90% and that the ML method was slightly better than the DL method. In normal years, the three satellite data (SIF, NDVI, and EVI) can generally predict maize yield with comparable accuracy. Nonetheless, the performance using SIF (743.53 kg/ha) was better than EVI (791.88 kg/ha) and NDVI (814.48 kg/ha) in a recognized severe drought year (2002) over the study area, indicating that SIF has a certain superiority in predicting summer maize yield under drought conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",,"Chlorophyll; Crops; Fluorescence; Forecasting; Forestry; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Satellites; Vegetation; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Drought conditions; Food crops; Learning methods; Machine learning methods; Maize yield; Satellite data; Satellite vegetation; Summer maize; Vegetation index; Drought; chlorophyll; crop production; crop yield; drought; fluorescence; maize; NDVI; prediction; satellite altimetry; satellite data; summer; China; Hebei",Article,Scopus

However, the timing of the remote sensing field campaigns can profoundly impact the accuracy of yield predictions. Little is known on the effects of phenological phases on skills of high-frequency sensing observations used to predict maize yield. It is also unclear how much improvement can be gained using multi-temporal compared to mono-temporal data. We used a systematic scheme to address those gaps employing UAV multispectral observations at nine development stages of maize (from second-leaf to maturity). Next, the spectral and texture indices calculated from the mono-temporal and multi-temporal UAV images were fed into the Random Forest model for yield prediction. Our results indicated that multi-temporal UAV data could remarkably enhance the yield prediction accuracy compared with mono-temporal UAV data (R2 increased by 8.1% and RMSE decreased by 27.4%). For single temporal UAV observation, the fourteenth-leaf stage was the earliest suitable time and the milking stage was the optimal observing time to estimate grain yield. For multi-temporal UAV data, the combination of tasseling, silking, milking, and dough stages exhibited the highest yield prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 0.77 t·ha−1 ). Furthermore, we found that the Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), and dissimilarity of the near-infrared image at milking stage were the most promising feature variables for maize yield prediction. © 2022 by the authors.

The capability to generate accurate in-season yield predictions is important across all components of the agricultural value chain. The literature on wheat yield prediction has motivated the need for more novel works evaluating machine learning techniques such as random forests (RF) at multiple scales. This research applied a Random Forest Regression (RFR) technique to build regional and local-scale yield prediction models at the pixel level for three southeast Australian wheat-growing paddocks, each located in Victoria (VIC), New South Wales (NSW) and South Australia (SA) using 2018 yield maps from data supplied by collaborating farmers. Time-series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data derived from Planet’s high spatio-temporal resolution imagery, meteorological variables and yield data were used to train, test and validate the models at pixel level using Python libraries for (a) regional-scale three-paddock composite and (b) individual paddocks. The composite region-wide RF model prediction for the three paddocks performed well (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.18 t ha−1 ). RF models for individual paddocks in VIC (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.15 t ha−1 ) and NSW (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 0.07 t ha−1 ) performed well, but moderate performance was seen for SA (R2 = 0.45, RMSE = 0.25 t ha−1 ). Generally, high values were underpredicted and low values overpredicted.

Proximal sensing data were acquired from a Crop Circle sensor at key growth stages and meteorological data were aggregated from planting to the corresponding sensing date.

The productivity in terms of crop yield is reduced due to a direct correlation between phenology and climate change. The reproductive organs of a plant and other parameters that define good fertility of a species are all affected by the increasing temperatures during their vegetative and reproductive phases of growth and development.

Agricultural big data and artificial intelligence (AI) are key technologies for smart agriculture, bringing cost-effective solutions to the agricultural sector. Deep learning-based crop yield forecast has currently emerged as one of the key methods for guiding agricultural production. In this study, we proposed a Bayesian optimization-based long- and short-term memory model (BO-LSTM) to construct a multi-source data fusion-driven crop growth feature extraction algorithm for winter wheat yield prediction. The yield prediction performance of BO-LSTM, support vector machine (SVM), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) was then compared with multi-source data as input variables. The results showed that effective deep learning hyperparameter optimization is made possible by Bayesian optimization. The BO-LSTM (RMSE = 177.84 kg/ha, R2 = 0.82) model had the highest accuracy of yield prediction with the input combination of “GPP + Climate + LAI + VIs”. BO-LSTM and SVM (RMSE = 185.7 kg/ha, R2 = 0.80) methods outperformed linear regression Lasso (RMSE = 214.5 kg/ha, R2 = 0.76) for winter wheat yield estimation. There were also differences between machine learning and deep learning, BO-LSTM outperformed SVM. indicating that the BO-LSTM model was more effective at capturing data correlations. In order to further verify the robustness of the BO-LSTM method, we explored the performance estimation performance of BO-LSTM in different regions. The results demonstrated that the BO-LSTM model could obtain higher estimation accuracy in regions with concentrated distribution of winter wheat cultivation and less influence of human factors. The approach used in this study can be expected to forecast crop yields, both in regions with a deficit of data and globally; it can also simply and effectively forecast winter wheat yields in a timely way utilizing publicly available multi-source data. © 2022 by the authors.","BO-LSTM; deep learning; meteorological data; remote sensing; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

The objective of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for detecting and discriminating weeds growing in turfgrass based on their susceptibility to ACCase-inhibiting and synthetic auxin herbicides. Results: GoogLeNet, MobileNet-v3, ShuffleNet-v2, and VGGNet were trained to discriminate the vegetation into three categories based on the herbicide weed control spectrum: weeds susceptible to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides, weeds susceptible to synthetic auxin herbicides, and turfgrass without weed infestation (no herbicide). ShuffleNet-v2 and VGGNet showed high overall accuracy (≥ 0.999) and F1 scores (≥ 0.998) in the validation and testing datasets to detect and discriminate weeds susceptible to ACCase-inhibiting and synthetic auxin herbicides. The inference time of ShuffleNet-v2 was similar to MobileNet-v3, but noticeably faster than GoogLeNet and VGGNet. ShuffleNet-v2 was the most efficient and reliable model among the neural networks evaluated. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that the DCNNs trained based on the herbicide weed control spectrum could detect and discriminate weeds based on their susceptibility to selective herbicides, allowing the precision spraying of particular herbicides to susceptible weeds and thereby saving more herbicides.

Ensuring these models can represent cropping field heterogeneity and environmental impact is important, especially given the growing interest in using agroecosystem models to quantify ecosystem services from best management practices and land use change. We posited that augmenting process-based agroecosystem models with additional field-specific information such as topography, hydrologic processes, or independent indicators of yield could help limit simulation artifacts that obscure mechanisms driving observed variations. To test this, we augmented the agroecosystem model Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) with field-specific topography and satellite imagery in a simulation framework we call Foresite. We used Foresite to optimize APSIM yield predictions to match those created from a machine learning model built on remotely sensed indicators of hydrology and plant productivity. Using these improved subfield yield predictions to guide APSIM optimization, total N O 3 − N loss estimates increased by 39% in maize and 20% in soybeans when summed across all years. In addition, we found a disproportionate total amount of leaching in the lowest yielding field areas vs the highest yielding areas in maize (42% vs 15%) and a similar effect in soybeans (31% vs 20%). Overall, we found that augmenting process-based models with now-common subfield remotely sensed data significantly increased values of predicted nutrient loss from fields, indicating opportunities to improve field-scale agroecosystem simulations, particularly if used to calculate nutrient credits in ecosystem service markets. © 2022 The Author(s).

Rain-fed grain production in Australia is highly volatile and producers and industry are progressively confronted with projected uncertainties due to climate variability and change, input costs and market prices. Thus, having advance knowledge of the likely impact of the coming season's climate on crop yield and production is critical for decisions across the supply chain. Here we explore and analyse the lead time and skill of a wheat yield forecasting system using a biophysical crop yield simulation model connected to either a statistical ENSO-analogue climate forecasting system or a dynamic general circulation model (GCM) derived climate forecasting system. The comparative skill was investigated for 16 wheat producing districts (shires) of the broad Australian winter cropping region, each containing 9–35 irregularly-spaced simulation points associated with climate stations. Both the ENSO-analogue and GCM-derived systems produced reliable wheat yield forecasts with the GCM-based approach having general improved skill, and particularly during the early months of the season (March to May) before sowing. The shift in the forecast yield distributions relative to the climatology-based yield distribution were dependent on location and time in the season, with the GCM-derived forecast shifts more widespread and earlier in the season. Overall, the GCM-based climate/crop forecasting system showed a significant improvement in lead time (greater than two months before the normal planting time of wheat), across the Australian wheat belt. This result demonstrates an avenue for improved efficacy in future commodity forecasting frameworks via likely enhanced relevance and utility to industry associated with the use of GCM-derived approaches. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Forecast lead time; Forecast reliability; Forecast skill; Probabilistic forecast; Seasonal climate forecast; Wheat yield forecast","commodity; comparative study; crop yield; cropping practice; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; forecasting method; general circulation model; probability; reliability analysis; seasonal variation; wheat; Australia",Article,Scopus

EVI and LST provided extra and unique information in peak and early growth stages for corn yield, respectively, and the usefulness of including LAI was not readily apparent across the whole season, which was consistent with the field growing conditions affecting the ET of corn.

The explosion of collectible data has started a revolution in agriculture to the point where innovation must occur. To a commercial organization, the accurate and efficient collection of information is necessary to ensure that optimal decisions are made at key points of the breeding cycle. In particular, recent technology has enabled organizations to capture in-field images of crops to record color, shape, chemical properties, and disease susceptibility. However, this new challenge necessitates the need for advanced algorithms to accurately identify phenotypic traits. This work, advanced the current literature by developing an innovative deep learning algorithm, named DeepStand, for image-based counting of corn stands at early phenological stages. The proposed method adopts a truncated VGG-16 network to act as a feature extractor backbone.

Due to the substantial population growth, meeting people’s dietary needs has become a relevant concern. The transition to smart agriculture has become inevitable to achieve these food security goals. In recent years, deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), have been intensely researched and applied in various fields, including agriculture. This study analyzed the recent research articles on deep learning techniques in agriculture over the previous five years and discussed the most important contributions and the challenges that have been solved. Furthermore, we investigated the agriculture parameters being monitored by the internet of things and used them to feed the deep learning algorithm for analysis. Additionally, we compared different studies regarding focused agriculture area, problems solved, the dataset used, the deep learning model used, the framework used, data preprocessing and augmentation method, and results with accuracy.

The incorporation of dynamical climate models into these forecasting systems strengthen their predictive performance in many cases but may contribute inherent biases to the final yield estimates. Downscaling the native climate model output so that is suitable for crop simulation modelling can also present challenges in representing realistic conditions for plant growth from a climate model. This study evaluated the performance of an operational national wheat yield forecast system for the Australian wheatbelt using climatology and seasonal climate model-based input data, and introduces an alternative approach using a data fusion method. The crop forecasting system uses the APSIM wheat model to estimate water-limited potential yield. The climatology-based forecast tended to over predict national yield (high yield bias; 1.5 to 7% across forecast months), while the model-based method (using ACCESS-S1 dynamical model) tended to under predict yield (low yield bias; -5.9 to -0.5% across forecast months) and had a lower spread than climatology (10 to 50% lower across forecast months). The model-based forecast had skill in terms of accuracy and reliability during the second half of the season. The newly developed data fusion method used a weighting method calibrated for separate forecast locations (stations) to remove bias in the mean forecast yield and reduce ensemble spread. This resulted in improvements in the Australia-wide yield forecasts across all forecast start dates. This study provides a demonstration of how a data-driven approach can be applied to a crop forecast to improve accuracy and resolution of crop yield forecasts without the need for more computationally intensive downscaling approaches. © 2022","Data fusion; Forecast verification; Seasonal climate forecasts; Wheat yield; Yield forecasting","agroindustry; climate modeling; climatology; crop yield; downscaling; wheat; yield response; Australia",Article,Scopus

In Ethiopia, fertilizer application during the last four decades has led to significant yield gains, yet yield remains below its potential across much of the country. One of the main challenges responsible for low yield response to fertilizer application has been the use of 'blanket' recommendations, whereby no tailoring of fertilizer amount and frequency is done based on soil requirements. As a result, the amount of fertilizer applied ranges widely, and can be either sub- or supra-optimal. There is thus an increasing need for site-specific fertilizer recommendations which take into account site characteristics such as climate variables (temperature, rainfall, and solar radiation); soil factors (soil organic carbon, moisture, pH, texture, cation exchange capacity, and level of macro- and micronutrients); and topographic position indices. This article reports on a data-mining approach we developed on a large dataset of 6585 wheat (Triticum aestivum) field trials. The dataset includes detailed, site-specific biophysical variables to create nutrient response functions that can guide optimal site-specific fertilizer application. The approach used a machine-learning model (random forest) to capture the relationship between nutrients - nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K), and sulfur (S) - and wheat yield. The model explained about 83, 82, 47, and 69% of variances of yield for N, P, K, and S omission, respectively, with consistent performance across training and testing datasets. Expectedly, for N and P omission data, the most important explanatory variables are nutrient rate, followed by soil organic carbon and soil pH. For K and S, however, climatic variables played an important role alongside nutrient rates. The site-specific yield-fertilizer response curves derived from our model are highly variable from location to location, as they are affected by the climatic, soil, or topographic conditions of the site. Importantly, using principal component analysis, we showed that the shape of the fertilizer response curves is a result of the multiple environmental factors (including soil, topography, and climate) that are at play at a given site, rather than of a specific dominant one. The research output is expected to respond to the national policy demands for a sound method to identify the optimal fertilizer rate to increase economic returns of fertilizer investments and take fertilizer utilization research one step further. © The Author(s), 2022.

Such crop areas come from land cover maps or reported statistics, both of which can have errors and uncertainties. Sub-national or regional crop yield forecasting minimizes the propagation of these errors to some extent. In addition, regional forecasts provide added value and insights to stakeholders on regional differences within a country, which would otherwise compensate each other at national level. We propose a crop yield forecasting approach for multiple spatial levels based on regional crop yield forecasts from machine learning. Machine learning, with its data-driven approach, can leverage larger data sizes and capture nonlinear relationships between predictors and yield at regional level. We designed a generic machine learning workflow to demonstrate the benefits of regional crop yield forecasting in Europe. To evaluate the quality and usefulness of regional forecasts, we predicted crop yields for 35 case studies, including nine countries that are major producers of six crops (soft wheat, spring barley, sunflower, grain maize, sugar beets and potatoes). Machine learning models at regional level had lower normalized root mean squared errors (NRMSE) and uncertainty than a linear trend model, with Wilcoxon p-values of 3e-7 and 2e-7 for 60 days before harvest and end of season respectively. Similarly, regional machine learning forecasts aggregated to national level had lower NRMSEs than forecasts from an operational system in 18 out of 35 cases 60 days before harvest, with a Wilcoxon p-value of 0.95 indicating similar performance. Our models have room for improvement, especially during extreme years. Nevertheless, regional crop yield forecasts from machine learning and aggregated national forecasts provide a consistent forecasting method across spatial levels and insights from regional differences to support important policy decisions. © 2021 The Authors","Crop yield; Large-scale crop yield forecasting; Machine learning; Regional differences; Scalability","agricultural policy; crop production; crop yield; forecasting method; harvesting; land cover; machine learning; stakeholder; Europe; Helianthus; Hordeum; Solanum tuberosum",Article,Scopus

Further attribution analysis indicated that extreme heat stress was the major cause for yield loss, contributing to 72.5% of the yield loss, followed by anomalies of vapor pressure deficit (17.6%) and precipitation (10.8%). Our deep learning model was also able to estimate the accumulated impact of climatic factors on maize yield and identify that the silking phase was the most critical stage shaping the yield response to extreme climate stress in 2012.

Crop yield is driven by a complex interaction of spatial and temporal variables, which makes it challenging to define the exact cause of observed spatial yield variability explicitly. This makes it difficult to design efficient management strategies to address production constraints. There is a need for a more quantitative and systematic approach to identify and understand the causes of variation in crop yield in order to implement appropriate management responses. This study investigated the use of interpretive machine learning (IML) to address this need. The developed methodology was demonstrated on furrow-irrigated cotton fields totalling ∼2000 ha in the Condamine-Balonne River catchment, Australia. Digital soil maps of important soil constraints were created at 20 m spatial resolution using 70 soil cores extracted to 1.4 m depth and a combination of on-farm and off-farm spatial data layers. Specifically, the soil constraints represented were exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP – sodicity), pH (alkalinity), and electrical conductivity (ECe – salinity). Terrain infrastructure variable maps of closed depressions, distance down furrow, and cut and fill (from landforming practices) were also developed. Empirical models of cotton lint yield were created with gradient boosted decision trees (XGBoost) using the digital soil maps and terrain infrastructure data as predictor variables. The models could describe the spatial variation in yield well, with a median Lin's concordance correlation coefficient of 0.67 and root-mean-square error of 0.75b ha−1. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), an IML approach based on game theory, was then used to identify the contribution of each variable to the modelled yield across the study area. The variable most decreasing yield at each point was identified and mapped across the study area, and the spatial extent represented by each variable quantified. The SHAP values for each predictor variable were also extracted and mapped for a case study field, which demonstrated the magnitude of the impact of each variable on yield with spatial context in easily interpretable units (b ha−1). The presented methodology is promising for cost-benefit analysis of implementing remediation strategies, or where not economically feasible, altering management inputs according to a constrained yield potential. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Digital agriculture; Digital soil mapping; Precision agriculture; Soil constraints; Yield modelling","Alkalinity; Catchments; Cotton; Crops; E-learning; Game theory; Machine learning; Mean square error; Precision agriculture; Soil surveys; Soils; Crop yield; Digital agriculture; Digital soil mappings; Machine learning approaches; Precision Agriculture; Predictor variables; Shapley; Soil constraints; Soil maps; Yield models; Decision trees; agricultural management; cost-benefit analysis; cotton; crop yield; digital mapping; electrical conductivity; error analysis; forecasting method; identification method; machine learning; management practice; precision; soil depth; soil management; spatial resolution; spatial variation; Australia",Article,Scopus

Backpropagation (BP) neural networks have demonstrated remarkable ability in many prediction scenarios. However, directly utilizing BP neural networks in soil nutrient prediction may not yield promising results due to the random assignment of initial weights and thresholds and the tendency to fall into local extreme points. In this study, a BP neural network model optimized by an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) was proposed to predict soil nutrient time series with high accuracy. First, the crossover and mutation operations of the genetic algorithm (GA) were improved. Next, the IGA was used to optimize the BP model. The symmetric nature of the model lies in its feedforward and feedback connections, i.e., the same weights must be used for the forward and backward passes. An empirical evaluation was performed using annual soil nutrient data from China. Soil pH, total nitrogen, organic matter, fast-acting potassium, and effective phosphorus were selected as evaluation indicators. The prediction results of the IGA–BP, GA–BP, and BP neural network models were compared and analyzed. For the IGA–BP prediction model, the coefficient of determination for soil pH was 0.8, while those for total nitrogen, organic matter, fast-acting potassium, and effective phosphorus were all greater than 0.98, exhibiting a strong generalization ability. The root-mean-square errors of the IGA–BP prediction models were reduced to 50% of the BP models.

Unfortunately, because of many difficulties such as climate variables (50% global fog cover) with limited temporal accuracy, the remotely detected information necessary to predict crop production was often insufficient. As a result of these problems, existing methods of estimating agricultural production are ineffective or out of date. Several efforts have been made to overcome these challenges by combining images with high temporal accuracy but poor geographic detail. On the other hand, it is this kind of situation that is most suitable for extremely large and homogeneous agricultural areas. An innovative theoretical framework has developed that explains this absence of high-quality satellite images. This intelligent method was built around this new theoretical framework, which incorporates its use of something like the energy equation to improve the predictions of multiple cultures.

Apart from humid environment, the plant also requires a wide variety of nutrients. Any deficiencies will directly affect its growth and palm oil production. These can often be detected from the change of leaf colour and texture. Deviations from the standard dark green colour indicates lack of certain nutrients. Therefore, this study proposes convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify nutrient deficiency in oil palms using leaf images. A total of 180 leaf images are acquired using standardized protocol. The samples are evenly distributed into healthy, nitrogen-deficient, and potassium-deficient groups. Residual network (ResNet)-50, visual geometry group-16 (VGG-16), Densely connected network (DenseNet)-201, and AlexNet are trained and tested using the randomized samples. Each attained classification accuracies of 96.7%, 100%, 98.3%, and 100% respectively. Despite yielding similar performance, AlexNet is the more computational efficient architecture with less convolutional layers compared to VGG-16. © 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The agricultural industry is one of the world’s most important industries, and it is critical to the achievement of the SDGs. The second major aspect of the SDGs, i.e., zero hunger, addresses food security (SDG 2). To measure the status of food security, accurate statistics on paddy production must be accessible. Paddy phenological classification is a way to determine a food plant’s growth phase. Imbalanced data are a common occurrence in agricultural data, and machine learning is frequently utilized as a technique for classification issues. The current trend in agriculture is to use remote sensing data to classify crops. This paper proposes a new approach—one that uses two phases in the bootstrap stage of the random forest method—called a two-phase stratified random forest (TPSRF). The simulation scenario shows that the proposed TPSRF outperforms CART, SVM, and RF. Furthermore, in its application to paddy growth phase data for 2019 in Lamongan Regency, East Java, Indonesia, the proposed TPSRF showed higher overall accuracy (OA) than the compared methods. © 2022 by the authors.","classification; data imbalance; paddy phenology; sustainable development goals; two-phase stratified random forest","accessibility; agricultural market; classification; food security; growth rate; phenology; remote sensing; satellite data; Sustainable Development Goal; East Java; Indonesia",Article,Scopus

From a biometrics point of view, a person's gender is a demographic category like a soft trait, while a Handwritten Signature is a behavioural trait. Numerous fields, including forensics and psychology, have alluded to the possibility of gender classification based on handwritten signatures. Feminist aesthetics can be found in works written by men with a high degree of intraclass variation and vice versa. This provides evidence for using a signature to determine a person's gender. Extraction of numerical features from male and female dynamic trademark samples forms the basis of the proposed method. Five hundred thirty-five people of varying ages were surveyed. These signature examples were then transformed into numerical attributes, yielding more than 60 signature features for each dataset. Six distinct Machine Learning approaches were used in the experiments; Overall, these techniques achieved an accuracy of 78% (KNN), 83% (LR), 73% (Poly kernel-SVM), and 51% (RBF kernel in SVM). In contrast, a Poly kernel trained with cross-validation achieved 85% (SVM), 91% (DT), 97% (RF) and 98% with Deep Neural nets.

Although the main effects of G and E are typically larger and easier to model, the GEI interaction effects are important and a critical factor when considering such issues as to why some genotypes perform consistently well across a range of environments. In plant breeding, a major challenge is limited information, including a single genotype is tested in only a small subset of all possible test environments. The two-way table of phenotype responses will therefore commonly contain missing data. In this paper, we propose a new model of GEI effects that only requires an input of a two-way table of phenotype observations, with genotypes as rows and environments as columns that do not assume the completeness of data. Our analysis can deal with this scenario as it utilizes a novel biclustering algorithm that can handle missing values, resulting in an output of homogeneous cells with no interactions between G and E. In other words, we identify subsets of genotypes and environments where phenotype can be modeled simply. Based on this, we fit no-interaction models to predict phenotypes of a given crop and draw insights into how a particular cultivar will perform in the unused test environments. Our new methodology is validated on data from different plant species and phenotypes and shows superior performance compared to well-studied statistical approaches.

Supervised machine learning models can learn nonlinear patterns from complex agrometeorological data. However, environment-based predictive analysis of oil palm yield with machine learning methods is not widely explored. Therefore, this work presents the application of a non-parametric regression algorithm k-nearest neighbor (KNN) for oil palm yield prediction using weather and soil data.

Secondly, it involves predicting suitable crop types using soil parameters and weather conditions that may be implanted by the farmers, using machine learning techniques, displayed on an android based application. Results: The system proposed in this work recommends suitable crops as per the current weather and soil conditions in a particular geographical area by applying the XGBoost classifier with the automation of the irrigation process. The study also does a comparative performance analysis of the XGBoost classifier based on the F1 Score and Accuracy. Conclusion: The study proposed a micro-controller-based model for crop maximization and irrigation automation. The system mainly fulfills two major objectives of agriculture-maximization of crop yield and farmer's profit using crop prediction, and automation of the irrigation process leads to water conservation. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.","automation; crop yield; IoT; irrigation; machine learning; maximization","Automation; Crops; Forecasting; Internet of things; Machine learning; Profitability; Soils; Water conservation; Agricultural land; Agriculture sectors; Automation process; Automation systems; Crop yield; Food-safety; Irrigation systems; Machine-learning; Technological innovation; Yield maximization; Irrigation",Article,Scopus

R. Br.) yields recorded in Niger. Field experiments were conducted at the National Agricultural Research Institute of Niger (N’Dounga) during the 2016 and 2017 rainy seasons to evaluate the performance of the CERES-Millet model in simulating the growth and yield of pearl millet varieties. Treatments consisted of two sowing windows (late June and mid-July) and four varieties (HKP, ZATIB, CIVT, and H80-10 GR) arranged in a split-plot design with three replications. Sowing dates were allocated to the main plots, whereas varieties were assigned to the subplots. The data collected on days to 50% flowering, days to physiological maturity, grain yield, and above-ground biomass during 2016 and 2017 were used to calibrate and evaluate the CERES-Millet model for simulating sowing windows. The model was used to simulate the long-term effects of different sowing windows using long-term historical weather data from 1983 to 2017 in Kollo. The results for model calibration showed that simulated growth and yield of millet were in good agreement with their corresponding observed values. The d-index was 0.99 for days to anthesis, 0.97 for days to physiological maturity, 0.93 for grain yield, and 0.79 for above-ground biomass. The results for both calibration and evaluation showed that normalized root mean square errors were less than 10%. The values of the d-index were also within the acceptable range for all the parameters. Therefore, the CERES-Millet model was robust enough to successfully simulate millet growth and yield in Niger. Seasonal analysis revealed that sowing should be done from early June to mid-June for ZATIB and H80-10 GR varieties. However, it should be done from early June to late June for CIVT and from mid-June to early July for HKP. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","CERES-millet model; DSSAT; optimum sowing window; pearl millet; varieties",,Article,Scopus

Hence, it is necessary to quickly filter out an optimal dataset from massive dataset to support various remote sensing applications. However, with the improvements in temporal and spatial resolution, remote sensing data have become fragmented, which brings challenges to data retrieval. At present, most data service platforms rely on the query engines to retrieve data. Retrieval results still have a large amount of data with a high degree of overlap, which must be manually selected for further processing. This process is very labour-intensive and time-consuming. This paper proposes an improved coverage-oriented retrieval algorithm that aims to retrieve an optimal image combination with the minimum number of images closest to the imaging time of interest while maximized covering the target area. The retrieval efficiency of this algorithm was analysed by applying different implementation practices: Arcpy, PyQGIS, and GeoPandas.

Process-based simulation models are widely used to predict crop yields, but their application remains limited by the requirements of substantial expertise, intensive data, and extensive calibration. Therefore, greater attention is currently being devoted to machine learning (ML) methods that are more computationally expedient. We evaluated six ML algorithms (linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, random forest, XGboost, and artificial neural network (ANN)) to predict cotton (Gossypium spp.) yield and determine the yield response to critical determinants using long-term (1986–2018) data on management, climate, historical yield, and point measurement of soil organic carbon (SOC) from continuous no-till (NT) cotton cropping system in west Tennessee. Data from 1986 to 2015 were used for model training, hyper-parameterization and testing, while data from 2016 to 2018 were used for independent model validation. Results showed that tree-based models (random forest and XGboost) outperformed other models in predicting lint yield. The variable importance scores, predicted by random forest model, indicated that cotton yield was more responsive to management variables (nitrogen (N) fertilization rate, cover crop, and years since NT establishment) followed by soil (SOC) and climate variables at the study site. The model identified optimal N application at 60 kg ha-1N rate for cotton lint yield, and also highlighted that the benefits of NT in enhancing yield can be achieved after 15 years of practice. The model predicted that the long-term adoption of hairy vetch (Vicia villosa), a legume cover crop, has the potential to increase cotton yield. Among the climate variables, cotton lint yield was most impacted by average maximum temperature and precipitation during flowering to open boll period. While random forest and XGboost proved to be the most effective ML models in this study, multi-site data is needed to build a more robust model with greater generalization and interpretation capabilities under a wider prediction domain. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Cotton yield; Cover crop; Growing season; Hairy vetch; Machine Learning; Nitrogen; No tillage; Random forest","Climate models; Cotton; Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Forecasting; Information management; Machine learning; Neural networks; Organic carbon; Random forests; Regression analysis; Cotton yield; Cover crops; Crop yield; Growing season; Hairy vetch; Lint yield; Machine-learning; No tillage; No-till; Random forests; Nitrogen; artificial neural network; conservation management; cotton; cover crop; crop yield; cropping practice; growing season; legume; long-term change; machine learning; management practice; prediction; yield response; Tennessee; United States",Article,Scopus

Timely and accurate estimation of cotton yield in Xinjiang is important for sustainable agricultural development and food security. However, most current studies have been devoted to the linkage of crop yield with remotely sensed reflectance and climate parameters. This has caused numerous uncertainties due to that these explanatory variables are unable to quickly reflect the actual photosynthetic dynamics of crops. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), as a direct proxy of plant photosynthesis (gross primary productivity, GPP), has recently been suggested to be a promising method for crop yield estimation, but the spatial resolution of current SIF products derived from satellites is usually very low (such as Global OCO-2 SIF (GOSIF): 0.05°). This greatly limited the ability of SIF to accurately estimate field-scale cotton yield in Xinjiang. Here, we first proposed a two-step convolutional neural network (CNN) strategy to downscale the monthly GOSIF products sequentially from 0.05°, 0.005° to 0.0005° to match the size of cotton field parcels, and then linear regression and random forest (RF) regression were respectively conducted using the monthly downscaled SIF product (CNN-SIF) to assess its feasibility to estimate field-scale yield. Results showed that the proposed stepwise approach for downscaling GOSIF worked well, indicating a high goodness of fit (R2 &gt; 0.85) with the referenced SIF as well as strong correlations to both GPP products and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) (the median r &gt; 0.90). On this basis, preferable accuracies (the optimal R2 = 0.62 and the ratio of prediction to deviation = 1.64) were also achieved for our proposed cotton yield estimation models in the Mosuowan region, Xinjiang only by the 0.0005° SIF products. With the assistance of NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), the higher performance was given (R2 = 0.67 and RPD = 1.72). This study reveals the importance of finer-resolution SIF products for accurate crop yield estimation and offers a promising and practical approach for estimating agricultural yield, especially for fragmented farmlands. © 2022 The Authors","Convolutional Neural Network; Cotton yield estimation; Downscaling; Field scale; Sentinel-2; Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence","Chlorophyll; Convolutional neural networks; Cotton; Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Fluorescence; Food supply; Photosynthesis; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Convolutional neural network; Cotton yield; Cotton yield estimation; Down-scaling; Field scale; Sentinel-2; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Xinjiang; Yield estimation; Convolution; agricultural development; artificial neural network; chlorophyll; cotton; crop yield; downscaling; estimation method; fluorescence; solar radiation; China",Article,Scopus

At present, research on orchard classification based on optical images in complex mountain areas is vulnerable to the influence of cloudy weather, especially in the summer, which leads to a lack of key phenological characteristics. To solve this problem, a parcel-level orchard mapping experiment with an irregular time series was carried out in Qixia City, China. Firstly, the candidate parcels in the study area were extracted from VHR images with a spatial resolution of 0.55 m based on RCF and DABNet models. The F1 score and area-based intersection-over-union (IoU) of the parcel extraction results were calculated. When the boundary buffer radius was 1 m, the F1 score was 0.93. When the radius was 2 m, the F1 score was 0.96. The IoU was 0.872, which shows the effectiveness of the parcel extraction method. Then, based on Sentinel-2 data, the NDVI, EVI, and SAVI vegetation indexes were calculated to construct an irregular time series. A two-dimensional CNN model was used for classification. In order to verify the effectiveness of this method, the study also constructed regular time series for the study area and conducted classification experiments using the 2DCNN and LSTM as classifiers, respectively. Confusion matrices were constructed for the classification results, and the overall accuracy was calculated. The results show that the overall accuracy of the method based on irregular time series is 97.76%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.96, higher than the other experiments, which indicates that the classification method based on irregular time series is effective and can make full use of the fragmented spectral features. Finally, based on the candidate parcels and pixel-level classification results of the study area, the crop categories of the parcels were filled to achieve accurate parcel-level mapping of horticultural crops in complex mountain areas. This method can provide a theoretical reference for orchard crop mapping and serves the development of regional precision agriculture. © 2022 by the authors.","2DCNN; deep leaning; horticultural crop orchard; irregular time-series data; map-level mapping; precise parcel extraction","Crops; Geometrical optics; Image resolution; Landforms; Long short-term memory; Mapping; Orchards; Time series; 2DCNN; Deep leaning; Horticultural crop orchard; Horticultural crops; Irregular time series; Irregular time-series data; Level mapping; Map-level mapping; Precise parcel extraction; Time-series data; Extraction",Article,Scopus

After testing different model architectures, hyper parameters, class weights and image sizes, we selected a U-Net architecture with a Resnet-34 backbone for this purpose. We applied transfer learning to increase training efficiency and model performance. We considered four irrigation systems as well as urban and background areas as land use/cover classes, and applied the model to 8,600 very high resolution (1 m) images, labeled with ground-truth observations of irrigation types, in a case study in Idaho, USA. Images were obtained from the US Department of Agriculture's National Agriculture Imagery Program. Our model achieved state-of-the-art performance for segmentation of different classes on the train data (85% to 94%), validation data (72% to 86%), and test data (70% to 86%), which attests to the efficacy of the model for the segmentation of images based on spatial features. Aside from leveraging deep learning and remote sensing for resolving the standing real-world problem of multiple irrigation type segmentation, this study develops and publicly shares labeled data, as well as a trained deep learning model, for irrigation type segmentation that can be applied/transferred to other regions globally.

Three areas in Hubei province (i.e., Jingzhou, Xiaogan, and Huanggang) were used as research sites to test the performance of the proposed extraction method. First, the Sentinel-2 images were spatially constrained using LUSD categories of irrigated land and dry land. Seven classification schemes were created based on spectral features, vegetation index (VI) features, and texture features, which were then used to generate the SVM classifier. To minimize misclassification between cotton and soybean fields, the cotton and soybean separation index (CSSDI) was introduced based on the red band and red-edge band of Sentinel-2. The configuration combining VI and spectral features yielded the best cotton extraction results, with F1 scores of 86.93%, 80.11%, and 71.58% for Jingzhou, Xiaogan, and Huanggang. When CSSDI was incorporated, the F1 score for Huanggang increased to 79.33%. An alternative approach using LUSD for non-target sample augmentation was also introduced. The method was used for Huangmei county, resulting in an F1 score of 78.69% and an area error of 7.01%. These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to extract cotton cultivated areas, particularly in regions with smaller and scattered plots. © 2022 by the authors.

However, a correctly selected hyperparameter combined with neural network architecture could highly increase the final metrics. Therefore, the hyperparameters optimization problem becomes a key issue in a deep learning algorithm. The process of finding a suitable hyperparameter combination could be performed manually or automatically. Manual search is based on previous research and requires enormous human efforts. However, there are many automated hyperparameter optimization methods have been successfully applied in practice. The automated hyperparameter tuning techniques are divided into two groups: black-box optimization techniques (such as Grid Search, Random Search) and multi-fidelity optimization techniques (HyperBand, BOHB). The most recent and promising among all approaches is BOHB which, which combines both Bayesian optimization and bandit-based methods, outperforms classical approaches, and can run asynchronously with given GPU resources and time budget that plays a vital role in the hyperparameter optimization process. The previous study proposed a convolutional deep learning neural network for solving land cover classification problems in the EuroSAT dataset. It was found that adding spectral indexes NDVI, NDWI, and GNDVI with RGB channels increased the result accuracy (from 64.72% to 84.19%) and F1 (from 63.89 % to 84.05%) score. However, the convolutional neural network architecture and hyperparameter combination were selected manually. The research optimizes convolutional neural network architecture and finds suitable hyperparameter combinations applied to land cover classification problems using multispectral images. The obtained results must increase result performance compared with the previous study and given budget constraints. © 2022. Vladyslav Yaloveha, Andrii Podorozhniak, Heorhii Kuchuk.

This paper introduces a “satellite-derived crop health index” as an alternative to yield data in such an insurance model. The new approach was implemented in the 2020 crop season, covering 3.5 million ha of paddy crop over 3200 Insurance Units in the West Bengal state of India. Data of Sentinel satellites, gridded weather data, and Mobile-app based field data were analyzed to generate paddy crop map and crop health indicators, namely NDVI, LSWI, Backscatter and FAPAR for the current (2020) and past years (2016-2019). Using the metrics derived from these indices and entropy technique, a composite index of crop performance called Crop Health Factor (CHF), ranging from 0-1, was generated. Deviations of CHF and yield between the years showed good correlation. The CHF data has successfully replaced the yield data for indemnity and pay-out assessments in 2020, as notified by the Government in advance. Thus, this project makes an entry point for developing remote sensing based transformative crop insurance solutions to enhance risk transfer in agriculture which perhaps the most plausible way forward. © 2022 The Author(s).

This information consists of satellite multi-band images, local soil samples obtained from national databases, local weather as well as field data from 23 farms cultivating winter wheat in southern Sweden. This is inherently a large multi-scale problem due to the large temporal and spatial variation of the input data. We aggregate the data on spatially averaged features over grids which temporally span a seasonal timeline from seeding to harvest. Data cleaning is performed through interpolation for satellite images due to cloud obstructions. Furthermore data is heavily imbalanced since the amount of satellite information far exceeds that of the ground data. Data variance therefore can be an issue which we counter by using a decision tree approach. We find that the Light Gradient Boosting decision tree trained on 262 input features is able to predict winter wheat yield with 82% accuracy. Subsequently we employ game theory in order to better understand the relational importance of specific input features towards forecasting yield. Specifically we find that some of the most important features towards the resulting predictions are the percent clay and magnesium in the soil. Similarly the most important features from the satellite data are: a) the NORM index (Euclidean distance of all bands) computed in the second week of April, b) the NORM index computed in the middle of May as well as c) the second spectral band from the last week of June. © 2022 The Authors","Decision trees; Relational importance; Satellite; Shapley values; Soil samples; Winter wheat yield",,Article,Scopus

In order to simplify the detection model and improve the detection efficiency, the NSGA-II-based (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II-based) pruning algorithm was proposed to obtain an optimal pruning that balanced the detection accuracy and speed of the pruned model. A green pepper detection model was trained using YOLOv5l, and the NSGA-II-based pruning algorithm was implemented to obtain a YOLOv5l pepper detection model. The number of model parameters, model size, and GFlops of the pruned model were reduced by 73.9 %, 73.5 %, and 62.7 %, respectively. The mAP0.5 of the pruned model was 81.4 %, only slightly lower (by 0.973 %) than that of the original model.The detection speed of the pruned model was 70.9f/s, which was 59.0 % higher than that of the model before pruning. The NSGA-II-based pruning also significantly outperformed other two algorithms, namely, Slim pruning and EagleEye pruning, in terms of number of parameters, model size, GFlops, and detection speed, with a slight reduction in mAP0.5 0.973 % compared to EagleEye pruning. Finally, the NSGA-II-based pruned YOLOv5l pepper detection model was compared with other 11 deep learning models. Except that the mAP0.5 was only 0.367 % lower than that of YOLOv4, our method again showed had obvious advantages in terms of parameter quantity, model size, GFlops, mAP0.5, and detection speed.

However, an important hyperparameter, the number of classification or regression trees within the ensemble must be specified in these algorithms. The number of trees within the ensemble can adversely affect bias or computational cost and should ideally be adapted for each task. For this reason, a novel tree ensemble is described, the feature-ranked self-growing forest (FSF), that allows the automatic growth of a tree ensemble based on the structural diversity of the first two levels of trees’ nodes. The algorithm’s performance was tested with 30 classification and 30 regression datasets and compared with RF. The computational complexity was also theoretically and experimentally analyzed. FSF had a significant higher performance for 57%, and an equivalent performance for 27% of classification datasets compared to RF. FSF had a higher performance for 70% and an equivalent performance for 7% of regression datasets compared to RF. Computational complexity of FSF was competitive compared to that of other tree ensembles, being mainly dependent on the number of observations within the dataset. Therefore, it can be implied that FSF is a suitable out-of-the-box approach with potential as a tool for feature ranking and dataset’s complexity analysis using the number of trees computed for a particular task.

Frequently, the total number of coffee beans per area unit is estimated manually by physically counting the coffee cherries, the branches, or the flowers. However, estimating yield requires an investment in time and work, so it is not usual for small producers. This paper studies a non-intrusive and attainable alternative to predicting coffee crop yield through multispectral aerial images. The proposal is designed for small low-tech producers monitored by capturing aerial photos with a MapIR camera on an unmanned aerial vehicle. This research shows how to predict yields in the early stages of the coffee tree productive cycle, such as at flowering by using aerial imagery. Physical and spectral descriptors were evaluated as predictors for yield prediction models. The results showed correlations between the selected predictors and 370 yield samples of a Colombian Arabica coffee crop. The coffee tree volume, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the Coffee Ripeness Index (CRI) showed the highest values with 71%, 55%, and 63%, respectively. Further, these predictors were used as the inputs for regression models to analyze their precision in predicting coffee crop yield. The validation stage concluded that Linear Regression and Stochastic Descending Gradient Regression were better models with determination coefficient values of 56% and 55%, respectively, which are promising for predicting yield. © 2023 by the authors.","coffee; crop yield; image segmentation; MapIR; multispectral; predictor; UAV","Aerial photography; Antennas; Crops; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial imagery; Colombia; Crop yield; Images segmentations; MapIR; Multi-spectral; Predictor; Production process; Tree-based; Yield prediction; Image segmentation",Article,Scopus

SWH was predicted for lead times of 6-, 12-, and 24-h at two locations off the coast of the western Tohoku, Japan. The results showed that the application of transfer learning could improve the accuracy of SWH prediction. For example, the coefficient of determination (R2) of the 6-h lead time SWH prediction off the coasts of Akita and Yamagata improved from 0.685 to 0.807 and from 0.710 to 0.850, respectively. Its accuracy was nearly equivalent to that of previous studies employing LSTM networks trained by almost ten years datasets. Furthermore, the results showed that transferring all layers improved the accuracy compared to transferring a part of the hidden or output layers.

The resulting image has the same resolution as the input image, albeit with slightly smaller size, and the fractal dimension measures are consistent with the definition of the conventional global feature. The sliding windows can be large since the dependence of the computational cost on the window size is logarithmic. We demonstrate the success of the approach for geometric examples and for land use data and show that the resulting features can aid in a downstream classification task.

To overcome these issues, an intelligent YE system was proposed which detects, localizes and counts the number of tomatoes in the field using SegNet with VGG19 (a deep learning-based semantic segmentation architecture). The dataset of 672 images was given as an input to the SegNet with VGG19 architecture for training.

In Saudi Arabia (SA), agriculture relies on groundwater, seasonal water, desalinated water, and recycled water due to a lack of surface water resources, a dry environment, and scanty rainfall. Estimating water consumption to plan crop water requirements (CWR) in changing environments is difficult due to a lack of micro-level data on water consumption, particularly in agricultural systems. High-resolution satellite data combined with environmental data provides a valuable tool for computing the CWR. This study aimed to estimate the CWR with a greater spatial and temporal resolution and localized field data and environmental variables. Obtaining this at the field level is appropriate, but geospatial technology can produce repeatable, time-series phenomena and align with environmental data for wider coverage regions. The CWR in the study area has been investigated through two methods: firstly, based on the high-resolution PlanetScope (PS) data, and secondly, using the FAO CROPWAT model v8.0. The analysis revealed that evapotranspiration (ETo) showed a minimum response of 2.22 mm/day in January to a maximum of 6.13 mm/day in July, with high temperatures (42.8). The humidity reaches a peak of 51%, falling to a minimum in June of 15%. Annual CWR values (in mm) for seven crops studied in the present investigation, including date palm, wheat, citrus, maize, barley, clover, and vegetables, were 1377, 296, 964, 275, 259, 1077, 214, respectively. The monthly averaged CWR derived using PS showed a higher correlation (r = 0.83) with CROPWAT model results. The study was promising and highlighted that such analysis is decisive and can be implemented in any region by using Machine Learning and Deep Learning for in-depth insights. © 2022 by the authors.","agriculture; CWR; evapotranspiration; Saudi Arabia","arid region; climate change; evapotranspiration; machine learning; water use; Saudi Arabia",Article,Scopus

In this study, a feed rate monitoring system is designed and developed. The system consists of a torque sensor for measuring the header power shaft torque, an angel sensor for measuring header height, a humidity sensor for measuring grains moisture content, a Global Navigation Satellite System receiver, and a vehicle industrial computer. Data, such as the moisture content of grains and the working position of the harvester, are collected by the system during harvest. The height of the header, the moisture content of grains, and the torque of the header power shaft are selected as the input quantity, and feed rate is selected as the output quantity. A calculation model for feed rate is established using a particle swarm optimization–back propagation neural network, and then real-time monitoring of feed rate is realized. On the basis of the monitoring of feed rate, an estimation method for yield distribution information is proposed. Through analyzing the rice samples in the experimental area, the method establishes a binary linear model between the header height, the grain moisture content, and the stem-to-grain ratio of the rice fed to the harvester. The model is combined with the monitoring results of feed rate to obtain the rice yield data fed to the harvester. Then, the rice yield data are matched with the positional information at the time of harvesting to obtain a yield distribution map of the harvested area. Field experiments are conducted in a rice-growing area in Northeast China, and the average relative error of the feed rate monitoring system is 7.69%. The field sample verification accuracy of the stem-to-grain ratio model is higher than 90%, and the correlation coefficient R2 is 0.93. The estimation accuracy of the yield distribution is higher than 90%, which provides a scientific basis for agricultural decision making. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Feed rate; PSO–BP neural network; Stem-to-grain ratio; Yield distribution","Backpropagation; Decision making; Harvesters; Harvesting; Moisture; Moisture determination; Monitoring; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); BP neural networks; Estimation methods; Feedrate; Monitoring system; Power; PSO–BP neural network; Rate monitoring; Real time monitoring; Stem-to-grain ratio; Yield distribution; Grain (agricultural product); estimation method; feeding mechanism; harvesting; humidity; yield response; China",Article,Scopus

Some state-of-the-art fusion discriminations are used to identify stator SLG fault, but these methods extract fault features artificially, and application conditions are limited. Convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown superior automatic feature extraction ability in various fields, but it cannot directly extract features from one-dimensional time series vectors collected by powerformers. Therefore, this article proposed a novel SLG fault protection scheme based on the hub-and-spoke grid data converting algorithm (HSGC) and CNN. First, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients (PCCs) are used to calculate the correlations of one-dimensional time series vectors, establish a correspondence between them and the distance of two-dimensional grid cells, and then convert one-dimensional time series vectors to two-dimensional grid-structured data by HSGC. Second, the trained CNN automatically extracts the features of two-dimensional grid-structured data. Finally, the faulty powerformer can be identified based on the output of CNN. The proposed protection scheme is verified through the simulation of ATP-EMTP and Python.

This study investigated four spectral indices for high-resolution RGB images for segmenting yellow flower pixels. The study compared vegetation indices to digitally quantify canola flower area to develop a seed yield prediction model. A small plot (2.75 m × 6 m) experiment was conducted at Kernen Research Farm, Saskatoon, where canola was grown under six row spacings and eight seeding rates with four replicates (192 plots). The flower canopy reflectance was imaged using a high-resolution (0.15 cm ground sampling distance) 100 MP iXU 1000 RGB sensor mounted on an unpiloted aerial vehicle (UAV). The spectral indices were evaluated for their efficiency in identifying canola flower pixels using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Digitized flower pixel area was used as a predictor of seed yield to develop four models. Seventy percent of the data were used for model training and 30% for testing. Models were compared using performance metrics: coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean squared error (RMSE). The High-resolution Flowering Index (HrFI), a new flower index proposed in this study, was identified as the most accurate in detecting flower pixels, especially in high-resolution imagery containing within-canopy shadow pixels. There were strong, positive associations between digitized flower area and canola seed yield with the peak flowering timing having a greater R2 (0.82) compared to early flowering (0.72). Cumulative flower pixel area predicted 75% of yield. Our results indicate that the HrFI and Modified Yellowness Index (MYI) were better predictors of canola yield compared to the NDYI and RBNI (Red Blue Normalizing Index) as they were able to discriminate between canola petals and within-canopy shadows. We suggest further studies to evaluate the performance of the HrFI and MYI vegetation indices using medium-resolution UAV and satellite imagery. © 2022 by the authors.","high-resolution RGB; UAV; yellowness indices; yield prediction","Antennas; Discriminant analysis; Mean square error; Satellite imagery; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Aerial vehicle; High resolution; High-resolution RGB; Pixel areas; Seed yield; Spectral indices; Unpiloted aerial vehicle; Vegetation index; Yellowness indices; Yield prediction; Pixels",Article,Scopus

Yet, climate change inevitably threatens their production and leads to tremendous losses. Furthermore, climatic and nonclimatic factors are likely to influence their producing behaviors and yields. Accordingly, this work aims to explore both the qualitative and quantitative nexus between climate change, nonclimatic drivers, and agroproduct yield in China. We choose lychee (Litchi chinensis Sonn.), with world's largest production in China and one of the most demanding agroproduct for climatic conditions, as the subject. A two-way fixed-effect Poisson model with robust standard error is developed based on county-level panel data in 39 main producing counties in China along with climatic and cultural festival factors from 2014 to 2019. The main conclusions are as follows: (a) the lychee culture festival, a nonclimatic driver, has negative effect on lychee yield, and this is a novel effect pathway theoretically and we verify it empirically; (b) climate changes in various phenological phases are significantly correlated to lychee yield; precipitation during the exposure phase or flowering phase has negative effect, and minimum temperature during the heading phase has positive effect, which is the first paper in this field; and (c) a new method is developed to analyze nonnegative yield and production, which could also be applied in other industries. © 2022 The Authors.

The Canadian Prairies experience high variability in weather conditions both within and between years, which impact spring wheat gluten strength and bread-making quality. This study aimed to identify climatic factors that affect spring wheat gluten strength and the growth stages when the impact is greatest. Nine hard red spring wheat genotypes of the Canada Western Red Spring (CWRS) class were grown in replicated field trials in nine locations across the Prairies over three years, 2015 through 2017. Agronomic and meteorological data were collected and used to derive 98 agroclimatic variables which were assessed for their impact on eight different response parameters of gluten quality including dough mixing and protein composition. Results clearly showed the opposing effects of temperature and precipitation on wheat gluten strength; especially during the late anthesis to grain filling growth stage. Higher temperatures around late anthesis to grain filling periods were associated with stronger gluten; while higher precipitation during the same wheat growth stages were linked to weaker gluten. Multiple linear regression (MLR), penalised ridge regression (PRR) and principal component regression (PCR) models selected similar weather variables as the most important affecting each of the various gluten strength parameters. These were slightly different from those selected by the partial least squares regression (PLSR) and random forest regression (RFR) models. The PCR, PLSR and RFR models outperformed the MLR and PRR models as indicated by lower root mean squared error and mean absolute error produced by the former. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Canadian Prairies; Growing-season weather conditions; Multicollinearity; Regression analyses; Wheat gluten strength",,Article,Scopus

The change of climate was built using the CORDEX, RCM daily precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature under RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. The climate model was examined in the historical period 1996–2015 for its ability to capture observed precipitation and temperature. Bias correction was performed on RCM temperature and precipitation to minimize the uncertainties that may occur from climate model projection. After the successful calibration and validation of the HBV hydrological model, streamflow was simulated for the periods of 2021–2040 and 2041–2060 and compared to streamflow of the baseline period 1996–2015 to investigate the changes. The results suggested that overall, following the precipitation increment, streamflow is expected to increase under both RCPs. The average monthly changes of streamflow are expected to increase by 40.1 and 29.4% under RCP4.5 and 16.9 and 18.5% under RCP8.5 scenarios for 2021– 2040 and 2041–2060, respectively.

The primary challenge for agricultural growth is the need to maintain the wellbeing of the plants and the crops. One industry that significantly affects people's lives and the state of the economy is agriculture. Poor management leads to the loss of agricultural products. The most delicate plant leaves are the first to show symptoms of sickness. The use of equipment to anticipate disease has proven to be quicker, less expensive, and more reliable than farmers' traditional method of manual observation. Most often, disease symptoms are visible on the leaves, stems, and fruits. The crop's productivity is impacted by a number of factors. Climate change, insect infestations, and numerous plant diseases are some of the contributing reasons. An automatic detection system is intended to pick up illness signs as they emerge or progress.

Current robotic sampling methods seek to gather information about an observable spatial field. However, many applications, such as environmental monitoring and precision agriculture, involve phenomena that are not directly observable or are costly to measure, called latent phenomena. In our approach, we seek to reason about the latent phenomenon in real-time by effectively sampling the observable spatial fields using a team of robots with heterogeneous sensors, where each robot has a distinct sensor to measure a different observable field. The information gain is estimated using a learned model that maps from the observable spatial fields to the latent phenomenon. This model captures aleatoric uncertainty in the relationship to allow for information theoretic measures. Additionally, we explicitly consider the correlations among the observable spatial fields, capturing the relationship between sensor types whose observations are not independent. We show it is possible to learn these correlations, and investigate the impact of the learned correlation models on the performance of our sampling approach. Through our qualitative and quantitative results, we illustrate that empirically learned correlations improve the overall sampling efficiency of the team.

Therefore, understanding and predicting the final crop production, with a view to adaptation and sustainability, is essential. The need for information on decision-making at all levels, from crop management to adaptation strategies, is constantly increasing and methods of providing such information are urgently needed in a relatively short period of time. Thus arises the need to use effective data such as satellite and meteorological, but also operational tools, to assess crop yields over local, regional, national, and global scales.

In Bangladesh, approximately 50% of the population are primarily employed in agriculture and more than 70% of the land area is used for cultivation. However, due to the traditional agricultural system, the country still lags behind to the best use of its resources. In our research, we investigate the presence of major soil nutrients using the hyperspectral images from Landsat-8 satellite of the northern regions of Bangladesh. In these regions, people are still using the ancient agricultural system despite being mostly dependent on agriculture. They are less likely to understand the soil quality, which consequently impacts on the production of crops.

Then, we apply the latest computer vision technologies, i.e., the ArcMap software to identify the major spatial properties. Later, we collect the actual soil ingredients of those locations from agriculture extension offices and government websites.

Both techniques are manual, costly and time-consuming. Detecting plant leaf diseases is a challenging task since it involves numerous variables such as genotype, environment, and their interplay. Accurate detection of plant leaf diseases involves a fundamental understanding of functional relativity and the collaborative factors. Deep learning helps in recognition of plant diseases and it provides earlier and timely detection of plant diseases for efficient disease management. It expresses a different infusion that gives systematic and automated detection of diseases. A convolutional neural network model is designed to use for detection of leaf spot diseases in plants. A tomato plant disease dataset has been generated from the local farms of Chittoor District, Andhra Pradesh, India. The tomato leaf spot diseases considered for training are Septoria leaf spot, bacterial spot, target spot and leaf mold which are most popular diseases in tomato plants.

It is the primary source of food for the whole world's population. It does, however, confront a significant challenge: producing more and better while also boosting sustainability via prudent use of natural resources, decreasing environmental damage, and responding to climate change. As a result, it is critical to the transition from old to contemporary farming practices. Precision agriculture is one of the options for addressing the increased need for food while also maintaining sustainability. The importance of information is growing in Precision Agriculture. Information about weather conditions, soils, illnesses, insects, seeds, fertilizers, and other factors contribute significantly to the sector's economic and long-term development. The collection, transmission, selection, and analysis of data are all part of Precision management. As the amount of agricultural data grows, powerful analytical approaches capable of processing and evaluating enormous volumes of data to acquire more trustworthy information and much more precise forecasts are becoming increasingly important for handling real-time data analysis with vast data, Data Mining is projected to play a critical role in Precision Agriculture.

It becomes a difficult and time-consuming process for radiologists to do the manual identification and categorization of the tumour. It is a complex and time-consuming procedure conducted by radiologists or clinical professionals to remove the contaminated tumour region from magnetic resonance (MR) pictures. It is the goal of this study to improve the performance and reduce the complexity of the image segmentation process by investigating FCM predicted image segmentation procedures in order to reduce the intricacy of the process. Furthermore, relevant characteristics are collected from each segmented tissue and aligned as input to the classifiers for autonomous identification and relegation of encephalon cancers in order to increase the accuracy and quality rate of the neural network classifier. An evaluation, validation, and presentation of the experimental performance of the suggested approach have been completed. A unique APSO (accelerated particle swarm optimization) based artificial neural network model (ANNM) for the relegation of benign and malignant tumours is presented in this study effort, which allows for the automated identification and categorization of brain tumours. Using APSO training to improve the suggested ANNM model parameters would give a unique method to alleviate the stressful work of radiologists performing manual identification of encephalon cancers from MR images. The use of an APSO-based ANNM (artificial neural network model) model for automated brain tumour classification has been presented in order to demonstrate the resilience of the classification model. It has been suggested to utilise the improved enhanced fuzzy c means (IEnFCM) method for image segmentation, while the GLCM (gray level co-occurrence matrix) feature extraction approach has been employed for feature extraction from magnetic resonance imaging (MR pictures). © 2022 K.

Soil temperature is the most significant factor that influences the freezing depth. Therefore, monitoring and predicting this characteristic is crucial for frostbite protection. This study aims to predict soil temperature on cold days to prevent frostbite injury in crops. For this matter, we used the registered and logged hourly data by the HOBO U30 data logging device and predicted the soil temperature from air temperature, soil water content, and relative humidity. We used 80% of the data set for the training data and assigned the other 20% to the test data. RMSE and MSE were two of the evaluation criteria of the neural network in this study. Also, we calculated P-value and T-value for statistical hypothesis testing. In another approach for weighting the neural network, we used evolutionary algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization instead of the gradient-based methods. According to the results, Multi-layer perceptron neural network with the respective values 0.082 and 0.0068 for RMSE and MSE in training data and 0.085 and 0.0073 for RMSE and MSE in testing data proved to have a better performance in the soil temperature prediction compared to the ANN-GA and ANN-PSO models.

The challenge of increasing crop yield while ensuring sustainable development of environmentally friendly agriculture is a common issue through-out the world. Autonomous systems, sensing technologies, and artificial intelligence offer great opportunities to tackle this issue. In precision agriculture (PA), non-destructive and non-invasive remote and proximal sensing methods have been widely used to observe crops in visible and invisible spectra. Nowadays, the integration of high-performance imagery sensors (e.g., RGB, multispec-tral, hyperspectral, thermal, and SAR) and unmanned mobile platforms (e.g., satellites, UAVs, and terrestrial agricultural robots) are yielding a huge number of high-resolution farmland images, in which rich crop information is compressed. However, this has been accompanied by challenges, i.e., ways to swiftly and efficiently making full use of these images, and then, to perform fine crop management based on information-supported decision making. In the past few years, deep learning (DL) has shown great potential to reshape many industries because of its powerful capabilities of feature learning from massive datasets, and the agriculture industry is no exception. More and more agricultural scientists are paying attention to applications of deep learning in image-based farmland observations, such as land mapping, crop classification, biotic/abiotic stress monitoring, and yield prediction. To provide an update on these studies, we conducted a comprehensive investigation with a special emphasis on deep learning in multiscale agricultural remote and proximal sensing. Specifically, the applications of convolutional neural network-based supervised learning (CNN-SL), transfer learning (TL), and few-shot learning (FSL) in crop sensing at land, field, canopy, and leaf scales are the focus of this review. We hope that this work can act as a reference for the global agricultural community regarding DL in PA and can inspire deeper and broader research to promote the evolution of modern agriculture. © 2022 by the authors.

Although many remote sensing approaches have been developed to estimate maize yields, few have been tested under lodging conditions. Thus, the feasibility of existing approaches under lodging conditions and the influence of lodging on maize yield estimates both remain unclear. To address this situation, this study develops a lodging index to quantify the degree of lodging. The index is based on RGB and multispectral images obtained from a low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle and proves to be an important predictor variable in a random forest regression (RFR) model for accurately estimating maize yield after lodging. The results show that (1) the lodging index accurately describes the degree of lodging of each maize plot, (2) the yield-estimation model that incorporates the lodging index provides slightly more accurate yield estimates than without the lodging index at three important growth stages of maize (tasseling, milking, denting), and (3) the RFR model with lodging index applied at the denting (R5) stage yields the best performance of the three growth stages, with R2 = 0.859, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1086.412 kg/ha, and a relative RMSE of 13.1%. This study thus provides valuable insight into the precise estimation of crop yield and demonstra\tes that incorporating a lodging stress-related variable into the model leads to accurate and robust estimates of crop grain yield.

To that end machine learning approaches were used to identify the prevailing climatic and soil hydrological drivers of spatial and temporal yield variability of four crops, comprising 40 years yield data each from 351 counties in Germany. Effects of progress in agricultural management and breeding were subtracted from the data prior the machine learning modelling by fitting smooth non-linear trends to the 95th percentiles of observed yield data. An extensive feature selection approach was followed then to identify the most relevant predictors out of a large set of candidate predictors, comprising various soil and meteorological data. Particular emphasis was placed on studying the uniqueness of identified key predictors. Random Forest and Support Vector Machine models yielded similar although not identical results, capturing between 50% and 70% of the spatial and temporal variance of silage maize, winter barley, winter rapeseed and winter wheat yield. Equally good performance could be achieved with different sets of predictors. Thus identification of the most reliable models could not be based on the outcome of the model study only but required expert's judgement. Relationships between drivers and response often exhibited optimum curves, especially for summer air temperature and precipitation. In contrast, soil moisture clearly proved less relevant compared to meteorological drivers.

Thus, it is difficult for deep learning models to detect and distinguish every weed species with high accuracy. Training convolutional neural networks for detecting weeds susceptible to herbicides can offer a new strategy for implementing site-specific weed detection in turf. DenseNet, EfficientNet-v2, and ResNet showed high F1 scores (≥0.986) and MCC values (≥0.984) to detect and distinguish the sub-images containing dollarweed, goosegrass, old world diamond-flower, purple nutsedge, or Virginia buttonweed growing in bermudagrass turf. However, they failed to reliably detect crabgrass and tropical signalgrass due to the similarity in plant morphology. When training the convolutional neural networks for detecting and distinguishing the sub-images containing weeds susceptible to ACCase-inhibitors, weeds susceptible to ALS-inhibitors, or weeds susceptible to synthetic auxin herbicides, all neural networks evaluated in this study achieved excellent F1 scores (≥0.995) and MCC values (≥0.994) in the validation and testing datasets. ResNet demonstrated the fastest inference rate and outperformed the other convolutional neural networks on detection efficiency, while the slow inference of EfficientNet-v2 may limit its potential applications. Grouping different weed species growing in turf according to their susceptibility to herbicides and detecting and distinguishing weeds by herbicide categories enables the implementation of herbicide susceptibility-based precision herbicide application. We conclude that the proposed method is an effective strategy for site-specific weed detection in turf, which can be employed in a smart sprayer to achieve precision herbicide spraying.

Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate, by means of multivariate statistics and machine learning techniques, the relationship between irrigation management and spectral bands in predicting maize yields. Field experiments were carried out over two seasons (first and second seasons) in a randomized block design with four treatments (control and three additional irrigation levels) and eighteen sample repetitions. The response variables analyzed were vegetation indices (IVs) and crop yield (GY). Measurement of spectral wavelengths was performed with the Sensefly eBee RTK, with autonomous flight control. The eBee was equipped with the Parrot Sequoia multispectral sensor acquiring reflectance at the wavelengths of green (550 nm ± 40 nm), red (660 nm ± 40 nm), red-edge (735 nm ± 10 nm), and NIR (790 nm ± 40 nm). The blue length (496 nm) was obtained by additional RGB imaging. Data were subjected to Pearson correlations (r) between the evaluated variables represented by a correlation and scatter plot. Subsequently, the canonical analysis was performed to verify the interrelationship between the variables evaluated. Data were also subjected to machine learning (ML) analysis, in which three different input dataset configurations were tested: using only irrigation management (IR), using irrigation management and spectral bands (SB+IR), and using irrigation management, spectral bands, and temperature (IR+SB+Temp).

Blueberries are blooming plants, valued for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Yield on the plantations depends on several factors, both internal and external. Predicting the accurate amount of harvest is an important aspect in work planning and storage space selection. Machine learning algorithms are commonly used in such prediction tasks, since they are capable of finding correlations between various factors at play. Overall data were collected from years 2016–2021, and included agronomic, climatic and soil data as well satellite-imaging vegetation data. Additionally, growing periods according to BBCH scale and aggregates were taken into account. After extensive data preprocessing and obtaining cumulative features, a total of 11 models were trained and evaluated. Chosen classifiers were selected from state-of-the-art methods in similar applications. To evaluate the results, Mean Absolute Percentage Error was chosen. It is superior to alternatives, since it takes into account absolute values, negating the risk that opposite variables will cancel out, while the final result outlines percentage difference between the actual value and prediction. Regarding the research presented, the best performing solution proved to be Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm, with MAPE value equal to 12.48%.

This paper proposes a systematic methodology to predict the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using time-series data extracted from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The key idea is to obtain accurate NDVI predictions by combining the merits of two effective computational intelligence techniques; namely, fuzzy clustering and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks under the framework of dynamic time warping (DTW) similarity measure. The study area is the Lesvos Island, located in the Aegean Sea, Greece, which is an insular environment in the Mediterranean coastal region. The algorithmic steps and the main contributions of the current work are described as follows. (1) A data reduction mechanism was applied to obtain a set of representative time series. (2) Since DTW is a similarity measure and not a distance, a multidimensional scaling approach was applied to transform the representative time series into points in a low-dimensional space, thus enabling the use of the Euclidean distance. (3) An efficient optimal fuzzy clustering scheme was implemented to obtain the optimal number of clusters that better described the underline distribution of the low-dimensional points. (4) The center of each cluster was mapped into time series, which were the mean of all representative time series that corresponded to the points belonging to that cluster. (5) Finally, the time series obtained in the last step were further processed in terms of LSTM neural networks. In particular, development and evaluation of the LSTM models was carried out considering a one-year period, i.e., 12 monthly time steps. The results indicate that the method identified unique time-series patterns of NDVI among different CORINE land-use/land-cover (LULC) types. The LSTM networks predicted the NDVI with root mean squared error (RMSE) ranging from 0.017 to 0.079. For the validation year of 2020, the difference between forecasted and actual NDVI was less than 0.1 in most of the study area.

Skilful yield forecasts at the beginning of, or before, a cropping season can provide farmers and other stakeholders in agribusiness with the necessary information for early planning and actions. Only a few yield forecast studies have a forecast lead time of four months or longer due to the problem complexity. To enable SCFs from Global Climate Models (GCMs) to be used for early-season yield forecasts, this paper uses a statistical downscaling technique, Extended Copula Post-Processing (ECPP) and the Schaake shuffle, to downscale four climate variables to generate weather-like daily data that are suitable for agricultural applications. Climate forecasts drive a process-based crop model APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) to simulate crop forecasts on 50 stations, well-distributed across the Australian grain zone. To focus on yield forecast skills attributable to SCF, we propose best practice management rules to predict water-limited winter wheat yield. Yield forecasts from ECPP have a significant improvement over quantile mapping downscaling and raw SCF from the Australian recent seasonal forecast model ACCESS-S1 in terms of bias, accuracy, reliability, and overall forecast skill. In addition, even at the beginning of a cropping season with a forecast lead time of four or more months, yield forecasts driven by ECPP illustrate higher skill than climatology, a benchmark for yield forecast. Early-season yield forecasts driven by SCFs provides a promising alternative to regression/machine-learning-based forecasts. Performance sensitivity and issues, and gaps on using skilful SCFs to help growers with their farming decision-making are discussed. © 2022","Crop model; Post-processing; Probabilistic yield forecasts; Seasonal climate forecasts; Wheat yield forecast","agroindustry; climate modeling; crop yield; cropping practice; downscaling; weather forecasting; wheat",Article,Scopus

Satellite images hold enormous crop information at finer spatial resolution. Crop yield mapping with optical images is particularly challenging if cloud-free images are unavailable during the crucial crop developmental stages. All-weather availability and sensitivity to crop structure, dielectric properties make synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images an excellent resource for yield estimation. Both types of data provide complementary information about crop conditions. A random forest regression model with genetic algorithm-based feature selection is developed to exploit the Sentinel-2 optical and Sentinel-1 SAR images for yield estimation. We utilized the crop harvest and quality survey (BEE) yield data set collected by the Hessisches Statistisches Landesamt (HSL), Wiesbaden, Germany, over 490 fields. We prepared 20 m resolution yield maps for winter wheat, winter barley, winter rye and winter rapeseed. Input features for the yield estimation model are selected based on the prior knowledge of remote sensing of vegetation. Baseline random forest regression models are developed for all the four crop types with optical and SAR input features. An optimized random forest regression model with genetic algorithm-based feature selection results in performance improvement. Dissimilarity in genetic algorithm selected image features highlights the significance of crop-specific feature selection for yield estimation. The optimized models reliably estimate yield by achieving correlation coefficient (r) of 0.65–0.86, mean absolute error 0.93–1.16 t ha–1 and root mean square error 1.12–1.56 t ha–1 with BEE yield on testing data set. The proposed models could estimate the intra-field yield variation when winter wheat, winter barley, winter rye were in the shooting phase to the beginning of ear-shifting, and winter rapeseed began to flower or was already flowering. These results demonstrate the merits of our model for early-stage crop yield estimation at the field level with mono-temporal image and adaptability for the cropping season with high cloud cover. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Crop yield; genetic algorithm; random forest regression; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2",,Article,Scopus

To tackle the problem of unlabelled data, unsupervised learning has been proposed. Among many unsupervised learning algorithms, K-means is the most popular algorithm. However, in a low-dimensional space, fuzzy c-means, which is more robust and less sensitive to initialization, has several advantages over K-means clustering. On the other hand, stacked convolutional pooling structures and manifold representation play pivotal roles in image clustering. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised multilayer fuzzy neural network for image clustering that unifies fuzzy systems, multilayer convolutional structures and manifold representation. The main contributions are as follows. First, we extend fuzzy systems to unsupervised tasks by introducing manifold representation, which expands the applications of fuzzy systems. Next, we propose the idea of using only a small number of attributes to compute firing strengths. This is implemented to prevent the firing strengths from falling to zero. Finally, randomly generated convolutional weights are used to extract features, which is a good choice for data without labels. It is demonstrated on a wide range of image datasets that the proposed approach is competitive with existing fuzzy and nonfuzzy clustering algorithms. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy neural networks; Image clustering","Convolution; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; K-means clustering; Learning algorithms; Multilayer neural networks; Multilayers; Unsupervised learning; Firing strength; Fuzzy-c means; Fuzzy-neural-networks; Image clustering; K-means; K-means++ clustering; Labelings; Low-dimensional spaces; Unlabeled data; Unsupervised learning algorithms; Fuzzy neural networks",Article,Scopus

Generally, big data is the storage of a huge amount of information, which causes the classification process to be very challenging. Numerous big data classification approaches are implemented, but the computational time and secure handling of information are the major problems. The aim of the study is the development of big data approach in Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare application. Hence, this paper presents the proposed Dragonfly Rider Competitive Swarm Optimization-based Deep Residual Network (DRCSO-based DRN) for big data classification in IoT. First, the IoT nodes are simulated, and the heart disease patient data are collected through sensors. The routing is done using the Multi-objective Fractional Gravitational Search Algorithm (Multi-objective FGSA). In the Base Station (BS), the big data classification is done. Here, the classification is done using MapReduce (MR) framework, which includes two phases, like mapper and the reducer phase. The input data is initially fed to the mapper phase in the map-reduce (MR) framework. In the mapper phase, feature selection is carried out based on Dragonfly Rider Optimization Algorithm (DROA) in order to select the appropriate features for further processing. The DROA is modeled through merging Dragonfly Algorithm (DA) and Rider Optimization Algorithm (ROA). In the reducer phase, the classification is performed using DRN, which is trained by the developed DRCSO algorithm. The DRCSO is modeled by incorporating DA, ROA and Competitive Swarm Optimization (CSO). In addition, the performance of the developed method is outperformed than the existing approaches such as Linguistic Fuzzy Rules with Canopy Mapreduce (LFR-CM) + Fuzzy classifier, Machine learning-dependent k-nearest neighbors (FML-KNN), MapReduce-Fuzzy Integral-dependent Ensemble Learning Model+Single hidden layer feedforward neural network (MR-FI-ELM + SLFN) and DROA-recurrent neural network (RNN) based on the accuracy, average residual energy and throughput with the value of 0.929, 0.086J and 86.585.

However, these pesticides have an unforeseeable long-term impact on people's wellbeing as well as the ecosystem. Due to a shortage of basic pesticide exposure awareness, farmers typically utilize pesticides extremely close to harvesting. Pesticide residues within foods, particularly fruits as well as veggies, are a significant issue among farmers, merchants, and particularly consumers. The residual concentrations were far lower than these maximal allowable limits, with only a few surpassing the restrictions for such pesticides in food. There is an obligation to provide a warning about this amount of pesticide use in farming. Previous technologies failed to forecast the large number of pesticides that were dangerous to people, necessitating the development of improved detection and early warning systems. A novel methodology for verifying the status and evaluating the level of pesticides in regularly consumed veggies as well as fruits has been identified, named as the Hybrid Chronic Multi-Residual Framework (HCMF), in which the harmful level of used pesticide residues has been predicted for contamination in agro products using Q-Learning based Recurrent Neural Network and the predicted contamination levels have been analyzed using Complex Event Processing (CEP) by processing given spatial and sequential data. The analysis results are used to minimize and effectively use pesticides in the agricultural field and also ensure the safety of farmers and consumers.

Timely and accurate forecast of the price helps the farmers switch between the alternative nearby markets to sale their produce and getting good prices. The farmers can use the information to make choices around the timing of marketing. For forecasting price of agricultural commodities, several statistical models have been applied in past but those models have their own limitations in terms of assumptions. Methods In recent times, Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been much successful in modeling time series data. Though, numerous empirical studies have shown that ML approaches outperform time series models in forecasting time series, but their application in forecasting vegetables prices in India is scared. In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to explore efficient ML algorithms e.g. Generalized Neural Network (GRNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) for forecasting wholesale price of Brinjal in seventeen major markets of Odisha, India. Results An empirical comparison of the predictive accuracies of different models with that of the usual stochastic model i.e. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is carried out and it is observed that ML techniques particularly GRNN performs better in most of the cases. The superiority of the models is established by means of Model Confidence Set (MCS), and other accuracy measures such as Mean Error (ME), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Prediction Error (MAPE). To this end, Diebold-Mariano test is performed to test for the significant differences in predictive accuracy of different models.

As with any design problem, two challenges are faced; firstly, how to determine all the input data required by the simulation model, and secondly to, a priori, anticipate what the performance of the designed system will be. This study sought to evaluate the performance of the WaSim model to simulate fluctuating water table depths (WTD), and drainage discharges (DD) in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), which is an input to the WaSim model, was estimated by the Rosetta computer program, based on soil particle size distribution data, bulk density, and soil water retention characteristics at pressure heads of – 33 and – 1500 kPa. performance of the WaSim model was statistically assessed using the coefficient of determination (R2), coefficient of residual mass (CRM), mean absolute error (MAE), mean percent error (MPE), and the nash–sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). during the validation period, the WaSim model predicted WTDs with R2, CRM, MAE, MPE, and NSE of 0.86, 0.003, 4.9 cm, 6.0%, and 0.98, respectively. In the same validation period, the model predicted DDs with R2, CRM, MAE, MPE, and NSE of 0.57, 0.002, 0.30 mm day−1,11%, and 0.76, respectively. These results suggest that the use of Rosetta-estimated Ksat data as inputs to the WaSim model compromised its accuracy and applicability as a subsurface drainage design tool. Owing to the relatively low R2 value of 0.57, and that the WaSim model was empirically developed, we recommend further improvement on the calibration of the model for it to be suitable for application under the prevailing conditions. Also, in the absence of other means of determining Ksat, we caution the use of Rosetta-estimated Ksat data as inputs to the WaSim model for the design and analysis of subsurface drainage systems in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. © 2022, The Author(s).","Drainage; Pedotransfer functions; Rosetta; WaSim; Water management","Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Hydraulic conductivity; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Soil moisture; Water management; Mean absolute error; Mean percent error; Pedo-transfer functions; Pedotransfer functions; Performance; Residual mass; Rosetta; Subsurface drainage design; Wasim; Waters managements; Drainage; design; drainage; estimation method; hydraulic conductivity; modeling; particle size; size distribution; soil water; water management; water table; KwaZulu-Natal; South Africa",Article,Scopus

However, there is insufficient overview of the studies conducted so far. Particularly, there is little insight into the extent of studies conducted in the context of actual business cases. In this study we conducted a systematic literature review to shed light on the state-of-the-art knowledge about data-driven decision making in the pig sector. In order to cover both classical data analysis techniques and machine learning, we used two separate search strings to search the literature. The results show that the various attributes of live pigs and slaughter data are used in analytics. Most studies focus on the occurrence and prevention of diseases, followed by DNA-related analysis and the effect of feeding strategies on growth. Among the studies we analysed, there was a large variation in herd size under study. Most studies used a selected group of pigs in an experimental environment; fewer studies used a larger number of pigs. Notably, all studies except two focussed on real-life business contexts where real-time data is used. The application of machine learning, mainly the use of random forest and neural network algorithms, took off since 2018. Current studies focus on isolated and one-off problems, and we suggest future research to consider the complexity encountered in real-life business circumstances and routine decision making through the integration of data analytics within farm information management systems. © 2022 The Author(s)","Data analysis; Data processing; Decision support; Machine learning; Pig farming","volatile organic compound; algorithm; animal lameness; artificial neural network; behavioral science; coccidiosis; convolutional neural network; data analysis; data processing; decision making; decision support system; decision tree; deep learning; DNA determination; electric conductivity; feeding; leg movement; livestock; machine learning; mastitis; nonhuman; pig; pig farming; principal component analysis; random forest; Review; slaughtering; support vector machine; systematic review",Review,Scopus

The present study evaluates different hyperspectral indices for phenotyping the canopy of M. arvensis winter crop (cv. CIM-Kranti) for detection of optimum harvest time using ground-based plant traits. Field experiments were conducted during mid-crop growth stage to late crop growth period for two consecutive years using hyperspectral camera (400–940 nm) to acquire images representing the spectral reflectance of crop canopies. Hyperspectral vegetation indices (HVIs) derived from these images were further evaluated with an aim to identify those hyperspectral indices showing a strong correlation to measured crop parameters. Out of the 18 HVIs, 4 HVI's i.e. photochemical reflectance index (PRI), carotenoids reflectance index (CRIr), hyperspectral normalized difference vegetation index (HNDVI) and plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI) were recognized as potential predictors for sucker traits (weight and length) and thereby indicators of optimum harvesting time for M. arvensis winter crop (cv. CIM-Kranti) cultivated primarily to produce suckers for crop propagation. Our results show promise for the development of non-destructive methods for the detection of optimum harvest time using crop reflectance.

The solar dryer dome, typically used for agricultural purposes in Indonesia, produces a sufficient amount of heat to increase the evaporation rate inside the dome and reduce the moisture content of the commodity. A hybrid solar dryer accompanied by a photovoltaic panel, fan, and ventilation system is generally suitable. The system can provide an optimum environment with minimum control. However, as the outdoor temperature and humidity change dramatically, such as at night time, more control is required. Based on Industry 4.0 technologies, we have developed a new kind of hybrid solar dryer that provides an optimum environment 24/7. The system, called Smart Dome 4.0, is an intelligent, low-cost, self-sufficient drying and storage system to support Indonesia Agriculture 4.0. The system has a local power generation unit to self-sustain the required energy and operate without connecting to the electricity grid. The system utilizes a machine-learning algorithm to predict the environmental condition and optimally uses self-generated electric power.

The purpose of this paper is to propose and compared different methods to isolate the impacts of meteorological change on crop yield based on long time series of maize yield in Yellow River-water irrigated region in Ninxia province of China.【Method】The analysis is based on maize yield measured from1988 to 2019 in 6 counties located in the Yellow River-watered irrigation areas. We compared three methods for the separation: five -year moving average method, quadratic exponential smoothing method, and five-point quadratic smoothing method. The consistent correlation coefficient, trend coincidence conformity analysis method, consistency of climate change characteristics, which lead to the same rise-fall in meteorological yield, were used as the evaluation criteria. Their applicability and rationality were compared and analyzed. All methods were calibrated based on the relationship between meteorological factors and maize yield.【Result】All methods can fit the yield trend well. Compared with the average yield trend, the consistency correlation coefficients of all three methods were >0.5, suggesting that there was no significant difference between these methods for fitting the yield trend. The advantage of the quadratic exponential smoothing method and the five-point quadratic smoothing method is that they accurately describe the change in the yield as affected by national productivity and national policy. The change in the yield due to meteorological factors estimated by the five-point quadratic smoothing method described the effect of inter-annual meteorological factors better, and its associated meteorological yield model is able to describe the relationship between the meteorological factors and the maize yield.【Conclusion】Comprehensive analysis showed that the five-point quadratic smoothing method modeled the yield change due to meteorological factors better than the other two methods. © 2022, Editorial Office of Journal of Irrigation and Drainage.

Protectiveness of data is natural in this setting: data is a precious commodity for data owners, which if used properly can provide them with useful insights on operations and processes leading to a competitive advantage. Unfortunately, novel AI technologies often require large amounts of training data in order to perform well, something that in many scenarios is unrealistic. However, recent machine learning advances, e.g. federated learning and privacy-preserving technologies, can offer a solution to this issue via providing the infrastructure and underpinning technologies needed to use data from various sources to train models without ever sharing the raw data themselves. In this paper, we propose a technical solution based on federated learning that uses decentralized data, (i.e. data that are not exchanged or shared but remain with the owners) to develop a cross-silo machine learning model that facilitates data sharing across supply chains. We focus our data sharing proposition on improving production optimization through soybean yield prediction, and provide potential use-cases that such methods can assist in other problem settings. Our results demonstrate that our approach not only performs better than each of the models trained on an individual data source, but also that data sharing in the agri-food sector can be enabled via alternatives to data exchange, whilst also helping to adopt emerging machine learning technologies to boost productivity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Agri-food; Data sharing; Federated learning; Machine learning","Competition; Electronic data interchange; Engineering education; Machine learning; Privacy-preserving techniques; Agri-food; AI Technologies; Competitive advantage; Data Sharing; Federated learning; Food sector; Large amounts; Privacy preserving; Train model; Training data; Supply chains; commodity; data set; machine learning; optimization; training",Article,Scopus

The current agricultural practices are being drastically altered, which is opening up new prospects. By 2050, there will be a huge demand for agricultural goods due to the 30% rise in the global population. Farmers have recently demonstrated a strong interest in smart agricultural approaches. Several things, including the growing availability of inexpensive, low-powered wireless Internet of Things (IoT) sensors that may be used to remotely monitor and report crop, weather, and field conditions, cause this. This enables effective resource management, such as reducing the number of hazardous pesticides used and the amount of water needed for irrigation. In addition, farmers may be able to use autonomous farming equipment and make better future forecasts based on current and previous conditions, thanks to the recent development in artificial intelligence, which would help farmers to reduce crop illnesses and insect infestation. These two enabling technologies have transformed traditional agricultural methods when used together.

In particular, strawberry fruits have a short ripening period and the fruits are heavily overlapped and shaded by each other, which is time-consuming and ineffective based on traditional detection methods. Therefore, we designed and developed a strawberry growth detection algorithm, SDNet (Strawberry Detect Net). The algorithm is based on the YOLOX model and replaces the original CSP block in the backbone network with a self-designed feature extraction module C3HB block to improve the spatial interaction capability and monitoring accuracy of the detection algorithm; Then, the normalized attention module (NAM) is embedded in the neck to improve the detection accuracy and attention weight of small target fruits; and we use the latest SIOU objective loss function to improve the prediction accuracy of the detection model, which finally achieves the monitoring of strawberry fruits under five growth states. The experimental results show that the precision, accuracy, and recall of SDNet are 94.26%, 93.15%, and 90.72%, respectively, and the monitoring speed is 30.5 ms. It is 4.08%, 3.64 and 2.04% higher than the precision, accuracy, and recall of YOLOX, respectively, and there is no significant change in the model size.

However, simulation is a time-consuming and labor-intensive endeavor for both humans and machines. The outstanding strategy of machine learning (ML) may expedite the lengthy procedure and reduce the arduous effort. In this work, we first prepared a custom dataset after getting data from the COMSOL Multiphysics simulation tool. After that, we experimented with numerous machine learning algorithms using the datasets to predict the design parameters of photonic crystal fiber. In each machine learning algorithm, the input features were wavelength, core radius, cladding radius, analyte, and pitch, and the output was the prediction of real and imaginary (x-direction, y-direction) values. The predicted values were used to look at the PCF's sensitivity and confinement loss. Furthermore, for each algorithm, the R squared score, mean square error (MSE), and mean average error (MAE) were assessed. Among the experimented algorithms, random forest regression obtained the highest R squared score and also the lowest MSE and MAE.

From 9.6 billion by 2050, agriculture needs to deliver even faster to meet this type of demand. This is possible with the latest technology, especially the IoT. The IoT enables labour free farms. Not only can it be used for large-scale agriculture, but it can also be used for livestock, greenhouse management, and agricultural land management. The most significant tool for the IoT is the sensor. A sensor is a device that collects important data that is interpreted to obtain the required analysis. The important objective of sensors are used to determine the soil's physical qualities and the environment. The main applications of sensors are control and supervise, safety, alarm, diagnostics, and analytics. Sensors make innovative agriculture more effective and trouble-free. In agriculture, the sensor is mainly used for measuring, measuring NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) levels, and detecting disease and soil moisture content. The main solution to this problem is smart farming, which modernizes traditional farming practices. This paper narrates the role of IoT application in smart agriculture.

According to WHO, COVID-19 has spread to 220 nations and territories, with the number of infected cases and deaths reaching 167 million and 3 million (as of May 25, 2021) (WHO dashboard, https://covid19.who.int [1]) and has a serious impact on the public health system. The key hurdles in containing the present COVID-19 outbreak are early detection and diagnosis. As a result, it is critical to screen COVID-19-affected individuals as soon as possible. Otherwise, it will spread quickly. In this case, screening can determine whether or not a patient has COVID-19 pneumonia. One of the most effective methods for reaching this goal is through chest X-ray diagnosis. It is the one that is most easily detected. This study provided a deep learning model of a convolutional neural network solution for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia patients using chest X-ray pictures. We used a publicly accessible chest X-ray dataset from Kaggle (Dataset link, https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database [2]) to train the model, which included 10,006 photos with COVID-19 pneumonia and normal images separated into train, test, and validation sets. This proposed model has a classification precision of 96% on the test set and 97% on the validation set, which is rather good for classifying COVID-19 pneumonia and normal patients. Along with this, we add the functionality of suggesting medicine based on symptoms. We build this suggesting model using machine learning model with accuracy 79% of 120 rows of dataset developed by our own to show it is possible to suggest medicine based on symptoms. We have developed an application using the flask framework. This application may be used on any computer by any medical professional to detect COVID positive and negative patients automatically using chest X-ray images in a matter of seconds and recommends some medicine that currently threatens the COVID-19.

Automation systems have been developed to improve these issues. In the process of automation, images are processed and sent to the remote brain for processing and decision making. It is noted that the image is written for compaction to reduce processing and computational costs. Images require large storage and transmission resources to perform their operations. A good strategy for pictures compression can help minimize these requirements. The question of compressing data on accuracy is always a challenge. Therefore, to optimize imaging, it is necessary to reduce inconsistencies in medical imaging. So this document introduces a new image compression scheme called the GenPSOWVQ method that uses a recurrent neural network with wavelet VQ. The codebook is built using a combination of fragments and genetic algorithms. The newly developed image compression model attains precise compression while maintaining image accuracy with lower computational costs when encoding clinical images. The proposed method was tested using real-time medical imaging using PSNR, MSE, SSIM, NMSE, SNR, and CR indicators. Experimental results show that the proposed GenPSOWVQ method yields higher PSNR SSIMM values for a given compression ratio than the existing methods. In addition, the proposed GenPSOWVQ method yields lower values of MSE, RMSE, and SNR for a given compression ratio than the existing methods. © 2022 Chethana Sridhar et al.",,"Automation; Decision making; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Genetic algorithms; Image compression; Recurrent neural networks; Automation systems; Computational costs; Decisions makings; Medical treatment; Model creation; Processing costs; Reduction models; Size-reduction; Storage resources; Transmission resources; Medical imaging; article; automation; brain; data compression; decision making; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic test accuracy study; genetic algorithm; recurrent neural network; algorithm; human; image processing; information processing; procedures; Algorithms; Data Compression; Diagnostic Imaging; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neural Networks, Computer",Article,Scopus

The NN variants, including the deep network models, as commonly used in remote sensing data prediction are also not free from this limitation. The issue becomes more prominent when the prediction is performed over data collected from spatial zones with a large degree of subregional variations or heterogeneity. In order to tackle this problem, in this article, we propose a multilayered adaptive recurrent incremental network (MARINE) model, offering a spatial heterogeneity-aware self-adaptation scheme that resolves the catastrophic forgetting issue in an autonomous manner. Typically, the proposed MARINE is equipped with an intrinsic mechanism of clustering the spatial subregions as per their heterogeneity levels and auto-constructing the recurrent network layers in an ensemble fashion so that the knowledge acquired about one group of heterogeneity level does not overwrite that acquired about other groups. With respect to spatiooral prediction of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series, as derived from MODIS Terra satellite remote sensing imagery, we demonstrate that our proposed MARINE achieves competitive results when compared with the state-of-the-arts. More significantly, in the presence of higher degree of spatial heterogeneity, MARINE outperforms others by better avoiding the catastrophic forgetting issue. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Autonomous learning; ensemble model; remote sensing; spatial heterogeneity; spatiooral prediction","Architecture; Arts computing; Computer architecture; Forecasting; Network architecture; Network layers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Adaptation models; Autonomous learning; Computational modelling; Ensemble models; Predictive models; Remote-sensing; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatio-temporal prediction; Time-series analysis; Time series analysis; artificial neural network; heterogeneity; NDVI; prediction; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; time series analysis",Article,Scopus

However, few studies have focused on using the crop model data assimilation (CMDA) method for regional-scale winter wheat yield estimation under drought stress and partial-irrigation conditions. In this study, we developed a CMDA framework to integrate remotely sensed water stress factor (MOD16 ET PET−1) with the WOFOST model using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for winter wheat yield estimation at the regional scale in the North China Plain (NCP) during 2008–2018. According to our results, integration of MOD16 ET PET−1 with the WOFOST model produced more accurate estimates of regional winter wheat yield than open-loop simulation. The correlation coefficient of simulated yield with statistical yield increased for each year and error decreased in most years, with r ranging from 0.28 to 0.65 and RMSE ranging from 700.08 to 1966.12 kg ha−1. Yield estimation using the CMDA method was more suitable in drought years (r = 0.47, RMSE = 919.04 kg ha−1) than in normal years (r = 0.30, RMSE = 1215.51 kg ha−1). Our approach performed better in yield estimation under drought conditions than the conventional empirical correlation method using vegetation condition index (VCI). This research highlighted the potential of assimilating remotely sensed water stress factor, which can account for irrigation benefit, into crop model for improving the accuracy of winter wheat yield estimation at the regional scale especially under drought conditions, and this approach can be easily adapted to other regions and crops. © 2022 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS","Data assimilation; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Winter wheat yield; WOFOST",,Article,Scopus

It has been a great challenge to non-destructively estimate plant N status across different agro-ecological zones (AZs). The objective of this study was to use random forest regression (RFR) models together with multi-source data to improve the estimation of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) N status across two AZs. Fifteen site-year plot and farmers' field experiments involving different N rates and 19 cultivars were conducted in two AZs from 2015 to 2020. The results indicated that RFR models integrating climatic and management factors with vegetation index (R2 = 0.72–0.86) outperformed the models by only using the vegetation index (R2 = 0.36–0.68) and performed well across AZs. The Pearson correlation coefficient-based variables selection strategy worked well to select 6–7 key variables for developing RFR models that could achieve similar performance as models using full variables. The contributions of climatic and management factors to N status estimation varied with AZs and N status indicators. In higher-latitude areas, climatic factors were more important to N status estimation, especially water-related factors. The addition of climatic factors significantly improved the performance of the RFR models for N nutrition index estimation. Climatic factors were important for the estimation of the aboveground biomass, while management variables were more important to N status estimation in lower-latitude areas. It is concluded that integrating multi-source data using RFR models can significantly improve the estimation of winter wheat N status indicators across AZs compared to models only using one vegetation index. However, more studies are needed to develop unmanned aerial vehicles and satellite remote sensing-based machine learning models incorporating multi-source data for more efficient monitoring of crop N status under more diverse soil, climatic, and management conditions across large regions.

Hence, the estimation of within-field variability of GY is pivotal for the agricultural management, especially in the current global change context. In this sense, Earth Observation Systems (EOS) are key technologies that use satellite data to monitor crop yield, which can guide the application of precision farming. Yet, novel research is required to improve the multiplatform integration of data, including data processing, and the application of this discipline in agricultural management. This article provides a novel methodological analysis and assessment of its applications in precision farming. It presents an integration of wheat GY, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), combine harvester data, and EOS Sentinel-2 multispectral bands. Moreover, it compares several indices and machine learning (ML) approaches to map within-field wheat GY. It also analyses the importance of multi-date remote sensing imagery and explores its potential applications in precision agriculture. The study was conducted in Spain, a major European wheat producer. Within-field GY data was obtained from a GPS combine harvester machine for 8 fields over three seasons (2017–2019) and consecutively processed to match Sentinel-2 10 m pixel size. Seven vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, EVI, RVI, TGI, CVI and NGRDI) as well as the biophysical parameter LAI (leaf area index) retrieved with radiative transfer models (RTM) were calculated from Sentinel-2 bands. Sentinel-2 10 m resolution bands alone were also used as variables. Random forest, support vector machine and boosted regressions were used as modelling approaches, and multilinear regression was calculated as baseline. Different combinations of dates of measurement were tested to find the most suitable model feeding data. LAI retrieved from RTM had a slightly improved performance in estimating within-field GY in comparison with vegetation indices or Sentinel-2 bands alone. At validation, the use of multi-date Sentinel-2 data was found to be the most suitable in comparison with single date images. Thus, the model developed with random forest regression (e.g. R2 = 0.89, and RSME = 0.74 t/ha when using LAI) outperformed support vector machine (R2 = 0.84 and RSME = 0.92 t/ha), boosting regression (R2 = 0.85 and RSME = 0.88 t/ha) and multilinear regression (R2 = 0.69 and RSME = 1.29 t/ha). However, single date images at specific phenological stages (e.g. R2 = 0.84, and RSME = 0.88 t/ha using random forest at stem elongation) also posed relatively high R2 and low RMSE, with potential for precision farming management before harvest. © 2022 The Author(s)","Grain yield; Machine learning; Precision farming; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Wheat","agricultural production; crop production; crop yield; estimation method; precision agriculture; remote sensing; Sentinel; wheat",Article,Scopus

As massive data processing develops in its practicality, machine learning (ML) techniques applied to time series can automate and improve prediction models. The radical novelty of this paper is the development of a hybrid model that combines a new approach to the classical Kalman filter with machine learning techniques, i.e., support vector regression (SVR) and nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) neural networks, to improve the performance of existing predictive models. The proposed hybrid model uses, on the one hand, an improved Kalman filter method that eliminates the convergence problems of time series data with large error variance and, on the other hand, an ML algorithm as a correction factor to predict the model error. The results reveal that our hybrid models obtain accurate predictions, substantially reducing the root mean square and absolute mean errors compared to the classical and alternative Kalman filter models and achieving a goodness of fit greater than 0.95. Furthermore, the generalization of this algorithm was confirmed by its validation in two different scenarios. © 2022 by the authors.","Kalman filter; nonlinear autoregressive neural networks; support vector regression model; time series prediction",,Article,Scopus

Several models based on remote sensing data have been developed in yield assessment, but their robustness—especially in small field scale areas—needs to be examined. Here we aim to develop a robust methodology for estimation/prediction of sunflower yield at pilot field scale using Sentinel-2 remote sensing satellite imagery. We conducted the study in Mezőhegyes, south-eastern Hungary. The Random Forest Regression (RFR), a machine learning technique was used in this research to translate the Sentinel-2 spectral bands to sunflower yield based on crop yield data provided by a combine harvester equipped with a yield-monitoring system. Sentinel-2 images obtained from April to September were used to find the best image for prediction. The satellite image acquired on June 28 was found best and considered further for prediction sunflower yield. A developed training model was tested and validated in 10 different parcels to evaluate the performance of the prediction. We examined the results of the prediction model (predicted) against the actual yield data (observed) collected by a combine harvester. The results demonstrated that using 10 spectral bands from Sentinel-2 imagery the best time to predict sunflower yields was between 85 and 105 d into the growing season during the flowering stage. This model achieved high accuracy with low normalized root means square error (RMSE) ranging from 121.9 to 284.5 kg/ha for different test fields. Our results are promising because they prove the possibility of predicting sunflower grain yield at the pixel or field level, 3–4 months before the harvest, which is crucial for planning food policy. © 2022","Random forest regression; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Sunflower; Yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

Among them, Spain is the world’s leading producer of olives. Due to its high economic significance, it is in the best interest of these countries to maintain the crop spread and its yield. Manual enumeration of trees over such extensive fields is impractical and humanly infeasible. There are several methods presented in the existing literature; nonetheless, the optimal method is of greater significance. In this paper, we propose an automated method of olive tree detection as well as crop estimation. The proposed approach is a two-step procedure that includes a deep learning-based classification model followed by regression-based crop estimation. During the classification phase, the foreground tree information is extracted using an enhanced segmentation approach, specifically the K-Mean clustering technique, followed by the synthesis of a super-feature vector comprised of statistical and geometric features. Subsequently, these extracted features are utilized to estimate the expected crop yield. Furthermore, the suggested method is validated using satellite images of olive fields obtained from Google Maps. In comparison with existing methods, the proposed method contributed in terms of novelty and accuracy, outperforming the rest by an overall classification accuracy of 98.1% as well as yield estimate with a root mean squared error of 0.185 respectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Crop yield estimation; Deep learning; Google maps; K-Mean clustering; Olive tree detection; Satellite Images","Classification (of information); Deep learning; K-means clustering; Mean square error; Crop yield; Crop yield estimation; Deep learning; Google maps; K-means++ clustering; Mediterranean countries; Olive tree detection; Satellite images; Tree detections; Yield estimation; Crops",Article,Scopus

Tree response to combined water and salt stress are critical consideration on management decisions but there is no appropriate information currently. That’s why, it was investigated the water and salt stress and combined water-salt stress on two almond varieties in a two year (2015 and 2016) outdoor experiment with young trees. Trees were 1 year old at the beginning of the experiment. The experiment was conducted USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) Salinity Laboratory, Riverside, California, USA. Drought treatments consisted of 100%, 80% and 60% of tree evapotranspiration (ET) and salt treatments of Electrical Conductivity (EC= 0.55, 1.20, 2.40 and 3.0 dS m-1), for a total of 120 trees in twelve treatments with two varieties and five replicates. We examined water use, trunk diameter and physiological parameters (leaf net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and leaf water potential). Photosynthetic rate values (Pn) ranged between 3.53 and 11.08 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1 for Nonpareil and 4.58 and 9.48 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1 for Aldridge. Stomatal conductance values ranged between 0.076 and 0.283 mol H2O m-2 s-1 for Nonpareil and 0.097 and 0.302 for Aldridge. All parameters showed significant decline starting at 80% water application and EC 1.2 dS m-1. In terms of growth rather than survival, almond was sensitive to water as well as salt stress. We evaluated combined stress using three stress response models: additive stress, dominant stress model and a multiplicative stress model where the predicted growth loss is obtained by multiplying the relative growth response for the individual stresses. Equation (2) for reduction in trunk growth were developed for treatments with either salinity only or water only stress. Both varieties grafted to Nemaguard rootstock were very sensitive to salinity with growth loss starting at EC 1.2 dS m-1. The results indicate that the Nonpareil is more sensitive to drought and salt stress than Aldridge. Aldridge almond variety can be recommended for areas where water supplies are scarce and salinized. © 2023, Ankara University.

The present study was carried out to understand temporal and spatial variations in deficient rainfall (drought) and their impact on national and regional FGP of India. Long-term (1901–2020) percentage departure in rainfall and drought areas over the country showed nonsignificant and significant trends, respectively. Subdivisional rainfall showed significant decreasing and increasing trends in 4 and 5 subdivisions, respectively. Drought years of high frequency (once in 3–4 years) and 4 to 5 consecutive drought years (once in 120 years) occurred in northwest and western subdivisions of India. Departure in de-trended production of All India Kharif food grains from its normal (DDP) showed significant quadratic relationship with departure in ISMR from its normal (DRF). Besides the quadratic equation, another multiple regression model taking de-trended crop area, DRF, and drought area as predictor variables was developed for predicting DDP. Both these models, with high R2 (0.8–0.88) between observed and predicted data and low RMSE (2.6–2.7%), can be employed for advanced estimation of DDP of the country and for taking country-level policy decisions by the Indian Government. For the first time, models were formulated to estimate state-wise departure in FGP (DP). In these models, novel indices viz., (i) rainfall departure and irrigation index (RDII) and (ii) physical and socio-economic index (PSEI), were used as predictor variables.

However, traditional hydrologic flood routing techniques cannot effectively address the huge uncertainties caused by the many factors that lead to ice-jam flooding. In this paper, a hazard assessment system for regulating flood discharge schemes is developed; it is composed of a machine learning (ML) model, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a river-ice dynamic model (RIVICE) within a probabilistic method. The modelling system is to aid in the challenge of predicting ice-jam flooding downstream of reservoirs. The LSTM model forecasts the downstream flow under the operational discharge scheme and, combined with the RIVICE model, the backwater level profile of ice jams can be forecasted. Furthermore, a set of backwater level profiles can be provided by probabilistic modelling, and the probability of ice-jam flood inundation can be calculated by comparing backwater levels with the elevation of the river bank; this information can be used to warn of the hazard induced by operational discharges to better aid in the preparedness and mitigation of ice-jam floods.

In this study, we provided a risk management framework for a rainfed paddy rice field in Savannakhet province of Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) that allows achieving the national target yield (5.0Mg ha-1) under climatic uncertainty. We collected the multi-model ensemble (MME) tercile hindcasts of 3-month (September to November, SON) and 5-month (July to November, JASON) rainfall for 1991–2010 from the international collaborative archive of the APEC Climate Center (APCC). The monthly probabilistic hindcasts were temporally downscaled by a stochastic weather generator to daily meteorological inputs for the CERES-Rice crop model. Then, the lowland rainfed rice yields at the field scale were simulated by the process-based crop model with different nitrogen (N) fertilizing strategies, and compared the outcomes against the observed rice yields. The results showed that the simulated rice yields from the 3-month hindcasts with the N-fertilizer application rate of level 1 (60 kg ha-1) were closer to the observed than those from the 5-month hindcasts.

The GRU model was constructed based on different input parameters and time scales to obtain the growth comprehensive monitoring index I of winter wheat. The results showed that the accuracy of the models at the ten-day scale were generally higher than those of the growth stage scales. Based on the five-fold cross-validation method, the robustness of the multi-parameter GRU model on the ten-day scale was further verified, and the winter wheat yield was estimated based on the linear regression model between the growth comprehensive monitoring index I and the official yield records. The results showed that the R between the estimated and official yield records of winter wheat was 0. 62, the RMSE was 509. 08 k g/h m 2, the mean relative error (M R E) was 9. 01 %, and the correlation reached the extremely significant level (P &lt; 0. 01), indicating that the multi-parameter yield estimation model at the ten-day scale can accurately estimate the yield of winter wheat in the Guanzhong Plain. The distribution of yield presented the spatial characteristics of high yield in the west and low yield in the east, and the inter-annual change characteristics of overall stability and steady growth. In addition, based on the GRU model, the cumulative effect of winter wheat growth was captured, and the influence of inputting parameters step by step in consecutive ten days on yield estimation was analyzed.

In non-rigid soils with high shrinkage and swelling, the AFP is not only related to the total porosity and soil moisture, but also to the soil shrinkage behaviour. However, the relationship between AFP and soil shrinkage has not been clarified. The objectives of this study were to (1) establish a mathematical equation to describe the behaviours of AFP associated with soil shrinkage (AFPsh); and (2) to evaluate the influence of tillage practice on the AFPsh. Undisturbed soil core samples were collected from the 0–10 cm to 10–20 cm layers in a Vertisol under four tillage treatments (No tillage, NT; Rotary tillage, RT; Subsoiling, SS; Deep ploughing, DP) to measure the changes in the volumes of soil core, soil water and air at different soil matric potentials. Our results showed that an equation of AFPsh as a function of moisture ratio (ϑ) was well established based on the developed soil shrinkage model (R2 &gt; 0.990, RMSE &lt;0.012). Compared with the AFP under a constant pore assumption (AFPc), the AFPsh was significantly decreased by 10.6% to 60.3% as soil water matric potentials were at &lt;−33 kPa in the 0–10 cm layer or at &lt;−10 kPa in the 10–20 cm layer (p &lt; 0.05). According to the AFPsh curve of the Vertisol, soil moisture content (θ) was approximately 68%–80% of the field capacity when AFPsh reached non-limiting status (0.10 cm3 cm−3), where the soil matric potential was close to the wilting point (−1500 kPa). Deep tillage treatment (SS and DP) increased AFPsh, showing good performance in decreasing the risk of soil aeration deficit relative to the NT and RT treatment. Our results demonstrate that neglecting the porosity variations during shrinkage may lead to a high bias in the AFP prediction. Highlights: An equation of AFP associated with soil shrinkage was established. AFP was significantly decreased when soil shrinkage was considered for a Vertisol. The Vertisol was easily subjected to both water and air stress due to soil shrinkage.

Satellite-based remote sensing offers a suitable and cost-effective technique for regional- and national-scale crop monitoring. The use of remote sensing data for crop yield estimation has been demonstrated using a semi-physical approach with reasonable success. Assimilating remote sensing data with the DSSAT model and spectral indices-based regression analysis are promising methods for spatially estimating rice crop yields. Rice area and yield in the Cauvery delta zone of Tamil Nadu, India was estimated during samba (August–January) season in the years 2020–2021 using Sentinel 1A Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite data with three different spatial yield estimation methods, namely a spectral indices-based regression analysis, semi-physical approach, and integrating remote products with DSSAT crop growth model. A rice area map was generated for the study area using a rule-based classifier approach utilizing parameterization with a classification accuracy of 94.5% and a kappa score of 0.89. The total classified rice area in Cauvery Delta Region was 379,767 ha, and the Start of Season (SoS) maps for samba season revealed that the major planting period for rice was between 22 September and 9 November in 2020. The study also aimed to identify promising spatial yield estimation techniques for optimal rice yield prediction over large areas. Regression models resulted in rice yields of 3234 to 3905 kg ha−1 with a mean of 3654 kg ha−1. The net primary product was computed using the periodical PAR, fAPAR, Wstress, Tstress, and maximum radiation use efficiency in a semi-physical approach. The resultant rice yields ranged between 2652 and 3438 kg ha−1 with the mean of 3076 kg ha−1. During the integration of remote sensing products with crop growth models, LAI values were extracted from dB images and utilized to simulate rice yields in the range of 3684 to 4012 kg ha−1 with the mean of 3855 kg ha−1. When compared to the semi-physical approach, both integrating remote sensing products with the DSSAT crop growth model and spectral indices-based regression analysis had R2 greater than 0.80, NRMSE of less than 10%, and agreement of more than 90%, indicating that these two approaches could be used for spatial rice yield estimation. © 2022 by the authors.","crop growth model; fAPAR; remote sensing; rice yield; semi-physical approach; spectral indices; synthetic aperture radar",,Article,Scopus

Or else, traditional sequential pattern-mining algorithms cannot be applied efficiently or directly to remote sensing images. Here a new technique is proposed for enhancing the mining efficacy of spatial sequential patterns from raster serial remote sensing images (SRSI) based on pixel grouping approach. The modified extrema pattern is employed to offering grey-scale invariant transform of intensity values unlike previously employed local ternary pattern. The pattern features are computed by transformation process from which the multilinear matrix decomposition of the image is made by computing the covariance estimation on recognizing their orthogonal component. The matrix decomposition is then attained based on run length encoding process (RLC). The two rows of RLC vectors are intersected to attain pixel groupmatrix. Finally, the compressed image is attained in an efficient manner with effective mining time. The performance outcome reveals that the technique offered in this paper is capable of extracting spatial sequential patterns from SRSI effectively.

However, the development of high-rate feedback systems is a complex task because these dynamic systems are uniquely characterized by (1) large uncertainties in their external loads, (2) high levels of non-stationarity and heavy disturbance, and (3) unmodeled dynamics from changes in system configuration. In this paper, we present a deep learning algorithm specifically engineered for HRSHM applications. It consists of an ensemble of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) constructed with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells with transfer learning capabilities to cope with the highly limited availability of training data as it is typical for high-rate systems. The use of an ensemble of RNNs empowers multi-rate sampling capability to capture multi-temporal features of the time series, thus enabling modeling of non-stationarities. Also, because the RNNs use short-sequence LSTMs and are arranged in parallel, the computation time is substantially reduced to the sub-millisecond range. The performance of the algorithm is investigated on experimental high-rate dynamic data produced from accelerated drop tower tests and benchmarked against results from a prior investigation using a purely on-the-edge algorithm termed variable input space observer (VIO) and its hybrid architecture (hybrid VIO) that incorporated physical knowledge and is considered as an upper bound on the algorithm performance. Numerical results show that the ensemble of RNNs, composed of five RNNs, significantly outperformed the VIO, with performance close to that of the hybrid VIO when it comes to the estimation error metrics, with an average computation time of 25μs per prediction step. Yet, the ensemble of RNNs exhibits chattering for low-amplitude excitations, likely attributable to the behavior of RNNs sampling at small time delays. An examination of the RNN weights and hidden states confirms that the algorithm can capture multi-temporal features, and an investigation with respect to noise in the training dataset showed that the algorithm is robust for signal-to-noise ratios up to 20 dB. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; High-rate systems; Long short-term memory; Nonlinear time series; Recurrent neural network; Structural health monitoring; Transfer learning","Brain; Deep neural networks; Hypersonic vehicles; Learning algorithms; Signal to noise ratio; Structural health monitoring; Deep learning; Health monitoring; High rate; High-rate systems; Input space; Neural-networks; Nonlinear time series; Short term memory; Structural health; Transfer learning; Long short-term memory",Article,Scopus

Economic and ecological performances are directly linked to adapted farming practices, which require timed and precise information on the nutritive value of the forage. Field spectrometers could offer an interesting alternative to time-consuming laboratory measurements, as they provide near real time information. We used a handheld version of a field spectrometer already commercialized for cereal adjustable rate fertilization, to evaluate its potential for grassland nutritive quality estimation. Spectral data and samples were acquired over experimental fields and plots in four locations in Northern Sweden; samples were analyzed using wet chemistry to determine the crude protein concentration, the in vitro true digestibility, the neutral detergent fiber and the neutral detergent fiber digestibility. Grid-based adjusted spectral indices, partial least squares, random forest and support vector machine were tested to link the spectral data to the nutritive traits. Partial least squares and support vector machine outperformed the adjusted spectral indices and random forest. Best predictions were obtained with partial least squares for in vitro true digestibility and neutral detergent fiber (R2 of 0.64 and 0.78 and normalized root mean square error [nRMSE] of 2.1 and 8.0%, respectively) and with support vector machine for crude protein and neutral detergent fiber digestibility (R2 of 0.49 and 0.65 and nRMSE of 13.0 and 3.8%, respectively).

Studies conducted in this area are not at the level that is desirable due to the diversity of plant species and the regional characteristics of many of these species. Although numerous researchers have studied diseases on plant leaves, it is undeniable that timely diagnosis of diseases on olive leaves remains a difficult task. It is estimated that people have been cultivating olive trees for 6000 years, making it one of the most useful and profitable fruit trees in history. Symptoms that appear on infected leaves can vary from one plant to another or even between individual leaves on the same plant. Because olive groves are susceptible to a variety of pathogens, including bacterial blight, olive knot, Aculus olearius, and olive peacock spot, it has been difficult to develop an effective olive disease detection algorithm. For this reason, we developed a unique deep ensemble learning strategy that combines the convolutional neural network model with vision transformer model. The goal of this method is to detect and classify diseases that can affect olive leaves. In addition, binary and multiclassification systems based on deep convolutional models were used to categorize olive leaf disease. The results are encouraging and show how effectively CNN and vision transformer models can be used together.

The study made harmonious use of remote sensing and field survey methods based on modern and traditional approaches in terms of time and space. Based on Sentinel-2 satellite images, regression analysis was carried out to determine the dependency of vegetation indices on soil electronegativity and maize biomass from 73 sampling points in the representative area. As a result, in the study of the growth and development of maize, it was found that the dependence of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) on maize biomass within 18 vegetation indices was ""high"" (R2 = 0.76) in spring. The dynamics of maize biomass grown on soils of different salinity levels were developed.

One such widely used LMS in higher education institutions around the world is Blackboard. This is due to its capabilities of aligning items of learning content, student-student and student-teacher interactions, and assessment tasks to specified goals and student learning outcomes. This study aimed to determine how certain Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) based on student interactions with Blackboard helped to forecast the learning outcomes of students. A mixed-methods study design was used which included analysis of four deep learning models for predicting student performance. Data were collected from reports on seven general preparation courses. They were analyzed using a documentary analysis approach to establish possible predictive KPIs associated with the electronic Blackboard report. Correlational analyses were performed to examine the extent to which these factors are linearly correlated with the performance indicators of students. Results indicated that a predictive model which combined convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) was the optimal method among the four models tested. The main conclusion drawn from this finding is that the combined CNN-LSTM approach may lead to interventions that optimize and expand use of the Blackboard LMS in universities. © 2013 IEEE.","CNN; Deep learning; Learning management systems; LSTM; Student prediction","Benchmarking; Convolution; Education computing; Job analysis; Long short-term memory; Online systems; Social networking (online); Students; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Learning management system; Learning models; LSTM; Predictive models; Social networking (online); Student prediction; Task analysis; Forecasting",Article,Scopus

However, knowledge on application of these tools to manage peanut maturity variability is still lacking. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare and validate linear and multiple linear regression with models using artificial neural networks (ANN) for estimating peanut maturity under irrigated and rainfed conditions. The models were trained (80% dataset) and tested (20% dataset) using results from the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons from irrigated and rainfed fields. In each field, plant reflectance was collected weekly from 90 days after planting using a UAV-mounted multispectral camera. Images were used to develop vegetation indices (VIs). Peanut pods were collected on the same dates as the UAV flights for maturity assessment using the peanut maturity index (PMI). The precision and accuracy of the linear models to estimate PMI using VIs were, in general, greater in irrigated fields with R2 > 0.40 than in rainfed areas, which had a maximum R2 value of 0.21. Multiple linear regressions combining adjusted growing degree days (aGDD) and VIs resulted in decreased RMSE for both irrigated and rainfed conditions and increased R2 in irrigated areas. However, these models did not perform successfully in the test process. On the other hand, ANN models that included VIs and aGDD showed accuracy of R2 = 0.91 in irrigated areas, regardless of using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP, RMSE = 0.062) or Radial Basis Function (RBF, RMSE = 0.065), as well as low tendency (1:1 line). These results indicated that, regardless of the ANN architecture used to predict complex and nonlinear variables, peanut maturity can be estimated accurately through models with multiple inputs using VIs and aGDD. Although the accuracy of the MLP or RBF models for irrigated and rainfed areas separately was high, the overall ANN models using both irrigated and rainfed areas can be used to predict peanut maturity with the same precision. © 2021 by the authors.","Arachis hypogaea L; Artificial intelligence; Remote sensing; Vegetation index","Crops; Image enhancement; Linear regression; Oilseeds; Radial basis function networks; Testing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Arachis hypogaea L; Artificial neural network modeling; Growing degree-days; Linear modeling; Maturity indices; Multispectral images; Rainfed; Rainfed condition; Remote-sensing; Vegetation index; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

Wheat is one of the major food crops, covering 21% of global food needs. The food supply issue necessitates reliable mathematical methods for predicting wheat yields. Crop yield information is necessary for agricultural management and strategic planning. Our mathematical model was developed based on a three-year field experiment in a semi-arid climate zone. Wheat yields ranged from 4310 to 6020 kg/ha. The novelty of this model is the inclusion of some stochastic data (weather and technological). The proposed method for wheat yield modeling is based on the theory of random sequence analysis. The model does not impose any restrictions on the number of production parameters and environmental indicators. A significant advantage of the proposed model is the absence of limits on the yield function. Consideration of the stochastic features of wheat production (technological and weather parameters) allows researchers to achieve the best accuracy.

Prior knowledge on yield helps coffee farmers in their decision-making and planning for the future harvest, avoiding unnecessary costs and losses during the harvesting process. Thus, we sought to predict coffee yield with regressive models using meteorological data of the state of Paraná, Brazil. This study was carried out in 15 localities that produce Coffea arabica in this Brazilian state. The climate data were collected using the NASA/POWER platform from 1989 to 2020, while the data of arabica coffee yield (bags/ha) were obtained by CONAB from 2003 to 2018. The Penman–Monteith method was used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration and the climatological water balance (WB) was calculated based on Thornthwaite and Mather (1955). Multiple linear regression was used in the data modeling, in which C. arabica yield was the dependent variable and air temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, water deficit, water surplus, and soil water storage were the independent variables. The comparison between the estimation models and the actual data was performed using the statistical indices RMSE (accuracy) and adjusted coefficient of determination (R2adj) (precision). Multiple linear regression models can predict arabica coffee yield in the state of Paraná 2 to 3 months before harvest. The maximum air temperature is the climate element that most influences coffee plants, especially during fruit formation (March). Maximum air temperatures of 31.01 °C in March can reduce coffee production. Wenceslau Braz, Jacarezinho, and Ibaiti presented the highest yields, with mean values of 32.5, 29.9, and 29.3 bags ha−1, respectively. The models calibrated for localities that have Argisol had the highest mean accuracy, with an RMSE of 2.68 bags ha−1. The best models were calibrated for Paranavaí (Latosol), with an RMSE of 0.78 bags ha−1 and R2adj of 0.89, and Ibaiti (Argisol), with RMSE and R2adj values of 3.09 bags ha−1 and 0.83, respectively. Paranavaí has a mean difference between the actual and estimated coffee yield of only 0.86 bags ha−1. The highest deviations were observed in Wenceslau Braz (9.17 bags ha−1) and the lowest deviations were found in Paranavaí (0.86 bags ha−1).

Therefore, the accurate RUL prediction can avoid both many safety accidents and the waste of resources, which is a key and challenging problem. Accordingly, a novel RUL prediction method based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network optimized by improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA) for lithium-ion battery is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the hyperparameters of LSTM which need to be optimized are selected since they directly affect the prediction accuracy. Then, according to the battery capacity data of different datasets, the hyperparameters of LSTM are optimized by ISSA to achieve RUL prediction. Finally, the proposed RUL prediction method is respectively compared with the support vector regression (SVR), convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN) and LSTM. The experiment results show that the proposed RUL prediction method is more accurate and robust which contributes to the rational use of lithium-ion battery to a higher degree. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Improved sparrow optimization; Lithium-ion batteries; Long short-term memory; Remaining useful life","Accidents; Battery management systems; Brain; Forecasting; Ions; Learning algorithms; Lithium-ion batteries; Hyper-parameter; Improved sparrow optimization; Life estimation; Life prediction methods; Memory network; Optimisations; Remaining useful life predictions; Remaining useful lives; Safety accidents; Search Algorithms; Long short-term memory",Article,Scopus

Researchers used statistical inference for discovering the relationships of data to build predictive model. However, crop production and its price trend do not only depend on ecosystems, molecular biology, precision agriculture, veterinary science, animal genes, and technology, but also depend on the environmental change and economic factors. Most importantly, the crop price trend is in non-stationary pattern and is influenced by multiple dimensional factors that the traditional techniques of time series forecasting, such as ARIMA, cannot perform well in prediction. Since CNN model can cope with non-stationary data and learn non-linearity by adjusting the model parameters, it can overcome the limitations of the traditional statistical methods in prediction. Therefore, the aims of this research are to conduct a review to identify a more complete factors that may influence crop production and price changes, and to propose a novel Clustered 3D-CNN model for predicting crop future price. The experiments to compare the performance of our proposed model and ARIMA model were done. The average results found that our proposed Clustered 3D-CNN model (MAPE = 0.083, RMSE = 40.39, MAE = 32.31) outperforms the ARIMA model (MAPE = 0.108, RMSE = 59.95, MAE = 46.35).

There are several mathematical models used for the estimation of the wheat crop but these models are implemented without considering the wheat species which is an important independent variable. The task of wheat species identification is challenging both for human experts as well as for computer vision-based solutions. With the use of satellite remote sensing, it is possible to identify and monitor wheat species on a large scale at any stage of the crop life cycle. In this work, nine popular wheat species are identified by using Landsat8 operational land imager (OLI) and thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) data. Two thousand samples of eachwheat crop species are acquired every fifteen days with a temporal resolution of ten multispectral bands (band two to band eleven). This study employs random forest (RF), artificial neural network, support vector machine, Naive Bayes, and logistic regression for nine types of wheat classification. In addition, deep neural networks are also developed. Experimental results indicate that RF shows the best performance of 91% accuracy while DNN obtains a 90.2% accuracy.

In image processing–based applications, vegetation detection, in other words, segmentation that allows monitoring of plant growth and health as well as identification of weeds has a great importance. Vegetation indices (VIs) are widely used algorithms for segmentation. Their advantages include low computational cost and easy implementation and handling compared to the other algorithms. Nevertheless, they require a manual threshold detection that customizes the process and prevents generalization. In this study, a novel automatic segmentation method, which does not require a manual threshold detection by combining VIs with a classification algorithm, is proposed. It deals with the segmentation process as a two class classification problem (vegetation and background). As the classification algorithm, Discriminative Common Vector Approach (DCVA) that has a high discrimination power is used. Each image pixel is represented with a 3 × 1 dimensional vector whose elements correspond to Excess Green (ExG), Green minus Blue (GB), and Color Index of Vegetation (CIVE); VI values are obtained. Then, on the sample space accepting this pixel vector as a sample, DCVA is applied and a discriminative common vector for each class which is unique and describes that class in the best way possible is obtained and it is used for classification.

However, it is a challenging task to accurately predict water demand affected by a range of factors with nonlinear and uncertainty temporal patterns. This paper proposes a new hybrid framework for urban daily water demand with multiple variables, called the attention-based CNN-LSTM model, which combines convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), attention mechanism (AM), and encoder-decoder network. CNN layers are used to learn the representation and correlation between multivariate variables. LSTM layers are utilized as the building blocks of the encoder-decoder network to capture temporal characteristics from the input sequence, while AM is introduced to the encoder-decoder network to assign corresponding attention according to the importance of water demand multivariable time series at different times. The new hybrid framework considers correlation between multiple variables and neglects irrelevant data points, which helps to improve the prediction accuracy of multivariable time series. The proposed model is contrasted with the LSTM model, the CNN-LSTM model, and the attention-based LSTM to predict the daily water demand time series in Suzhou, China. The results show that the hybrid model achieves higher prediction performance with the smallest mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and largest correlation coefficient (R2). © 2022 by the authors.","attention mechanism; convolutional neural network; encoder-decoder network; long short-term memory; multivariate time series; water demand forecasting","artificial neural network; correlation; error analysis; forecasting method; multivariate analysis; performance assessment; prediction; time series; water demand; China; Jiangsu; Suzhou",Article,Scopus

Plants of the family Lemnaceae (duckweeds) are the smallest flowering plants in the world, and biometric measurements of single plants and their growth rate are highly challenging. Although the use of software for digital image analysis has changed the way scientists extract phenomenological data (also for studies on duckweeds), the procedure is often not wholly automated and sometimes relies on the intervention of a human operator. Such a constraint can limit the objectivity of the measurements and generally slows down the time required to produce scientific data. Herein lies the need to implement image analysis software with artificial intelligence that can substitute the human operator. In this paper, we present a new method to study the growth rates of the plants of the Lemnaceae family based on the application of machine-learning procedures to digital image analysis. The method is compared to existing analogical and computer-operated procedures. The results showed that our method drastically reduces the time consumption of the human operator while retaining a high correlation in the growth rates measured with other procedures. As expected, machine-learning methods applied to digital image analysis can overcome the constraints of measuring growth rates of very small plants and might help duckweeds gain worldwide attention thanks to their strong nutritional qualities and biological plasticity. © 2022 by the authors.","aquatic plants; duckweed; image analysis; Lemna; Lemnaceae; machine learning; machine training",,Article,Scopus

In this study, we applied machine learning to 16S rRNA sequence and nitrification potential data from an experiment examining interactions between cropping systems and rhizosphere on microbial community assembly and nitrogen cycling processes. Given the high dimensionality of microbiome datasets, we only included nitrifers since only a few taxa are capable of ammonia and nitrite oxidation. We compared the performance of linear and nonlinear algorithms with and without qPCR measures of bacterial and archaea ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) gene abundance. Our feature selection process facilitated the identification of taxons that are most predictive of nitrification and to compare habitats. We found that Nitrosomonas and Nitrospirae were more frequently identified as important predictors of nitrification in conventional systems, whereas Thaumarchaeota were more important predictors in diversified systems. Our results suggest that model performance was not substantively improved by incorporating additional time-consuming and expensive qPCR data on amoA gene abundance. We also identified several clades of nitrifiers important for nitrification in different cropping systems, though we were unable to detect system- or rhizosphere-specific patterns in OTU-level biomarkers for nitrification. Finally, our results highlight the inherent risk of combining data from disparate habitats with the goal of increasing sample size to avoid overfitting models.

This is because the yield record is not long enough, and/or the data are only available at a local farm level. A data-driven approach is developed here to 1) identify how sensitive Vietnamese robusta coffee is to weather on district and provincial levels, 2) during which key moments weather is most influential for yield, and 3) how long before harvest, yield could potentially be forecasted. Robusta coffee yield time series were available from 2000 to 2018 for the Central Highlands, where 40% of global robusta coffee is produced. Multiple linear regression has been used to assess the effect of weather on coffee yield, with regularization techniques such as PCA and leave-one-out to avoid over-fitting the regression models. The data suggest that robusta coffee in Vietnam is most sensitive to two key moments: a prolonged rainy season of the previous year favoring vegetative growth, thereby increasing the potential yield (i.e., number of fruiting nodes), while low rainfall during bean formation decreases yield. Depending on location, these moments could be used to forecast the yield anomaly with 3–6 months’ anticipation. The sensitivity of yield anomalies to weather varied substantially between provinces and even districts. In Dak Lak and some Lam Dong districts, weather explained up to 36% of the robusta coffee yield anomalies variation, while low sensitivities were identified in Dak Nong and Gia Lai districts. Our statistical model can be used as a seasonal forecasting tool for the management of coffee production. It can also be applied to climate change studies, i.e., using this statistical model in climate simulations to see the tendency of coffee in the following decades.

Affected by light, weather, and operating angle, it brings new challenges to the efficient and accurate detection and segmentation of the green object fruit under complex orchard backgrounds. For the green fruit segmentation, an efficient YOLOF-snake segmentation model is proposed. First, the ResNet101 structure is adopted as the backbone network to achieve feature extraction of the green object fruit. Then, the C5 feature maps are expanded with receptive fields and the decoder is used for classification and regression. Besides, the center point in the regression box is employed to get a diamond-shaped structure and fed into an additional Deep-snake network, which is adjusted to the contours of the target fruit to achieve fast and accurate segmentation of green fruit.

However, owing to the low efficiency of traditional manual seedling rate monitoring, survey methods have been gradually replaced by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and real-time peanut video counting models. In this study, we propose an efficient and fast real-time peanut video counting model (combining the improved YOLOV5s, DeepSort, and OpenCV programs) to accurately distinguish peanut seedlings from weeds, and to count peanut seedlings based on videos. The improved YOLOV5s combines a vision transformer with CSNet to replace the original CSNet backbone. The field experiment results show that the real-time peanut video counting model count capabilities is close to those of humans with an accuracy of 98.08%; however, the seedling calculation model takes only one-fifth of the time required for human detection. Therefore, the video-based model outperforms the image-based target detection algorithm, and was more suitable for application in practical germination rate investigation in peanut production. © 2022","DeepSort; Improved YOLOV5s; Peanut seedlings rate; UAV; Video monitoring","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Cultivation; Deep learning; Oilseeds; Counting models; Deepsort; Improved YOLOV5; Peanut seedling rate; Real time monitoring; Real- time; Real-time detection; Seed germination; Seedling emergence; Video monitoring; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); biomonitoring; emergence; germination; legume; machine learning; seedling; unmanned vehicle; videography",Article,Scopus

The detection of cardiac disease in its early stages by the use of early-stage symptoms is a major problem in today’s environment. As a result, there is a demand for a technology that can identify cardiac disease in a non-invasive manner while also being less expensive. In this research we have developed a hybrid deep learning methodology for the categorization of cardiac disease. Classifying synthetic data using RNN and LSTM hybrid approaches has been done using different cross-validations. The system’s performance also be evaluated using a variety of machine learning methods and soft computing approaches. During the classification process, RNN employs three separate activation functions. To balance the data, certain pre-processing methods were used to sort and classify the data. The extraction of features has been done using relational, bigram, and density-based approaches.

However, in recent years, the planting area in China has decreased by approximately 12.2% due to the low yield and economic benefits. Thus, to ensure oil security, it is necessary to develop high-efficiency cultivation for rapeseed production. Crop growth models are powerful tools to analyze and optimize the yield composition of crops under certain environmental and management conditions. In this study, the CROPGRO-Canola model was first calibrated and evaluated using the rapeseed planting data of four growing seasons in Wuhan with nine nitrogen fertilizer levels (from 120 to 360 kg ha−1 ) and five planting densities (from 15 to 75 plants m−2 ). The results indicated that the CROPGRO-Canola model simulated rapeseed growth well under different nitrogen rates and planting densities in China, with a simulation error of 0–3 days for the anthesis and maturity dates and a normalized root mean square error lower than 7.48% for the yield. Furthermore, we optimized the management of rapeseed by calculating the marginal net return under 10 nitrogen rates (from 0 to 360 kg ha−1 at an increasing rate of 40 kg ha−1 ) and 6 planting densities (from 15 to 90 plant m−2 at an increasing rate of 15 plant m−2 ) from 1989 to 2019. The results indicated that the long-term optimal nitrogen rate was 120–160 kg N ha−1, and the optimal planting density was 45–75 plants m−2 under normal fertilizer prices. The optimal nitrogen rate decreased with increasing fertilizer price within a reasonable range. In conclusion, long-term rapeseed management can be optimized based on rapeseed and nitrogen cost using long-term weather records and local soil information. © 2022 by the authors.

Eight cultivars, namely Kouhdasht, Mehregan, Karim, line 17, N-80-19, Atrak, N-92-9, and Ehsan were crossed. Agronomical, phenological and morphological attributes including, days to emergency, days to flowering, days to maturity, flag leaf length, flag leaf weight, flag leaf width, length of grain filling period, number of spikes, number of grains per spike, spike weight per plant, grain yield, plant height, awn length, peduncle length, spike length, stem diameter, stem weight, total spike weight, and grain weight per spike were recorded. Polymorphic Informative Content for markers ranged from 0.791 for the BARC173 to 0.194 for the XBARC171. Regression analysis showed that twenty-nine SSR informative alleles were related to traits. Then, SSR informative alleles were used as input of artificial intelligence methods. Five algorithms were used for network training to predict grain yield. Based on the analysis of MLP, the validation accuracy prediction varied from 0.96 for the phenotypic data to 0.99 for the combined data. The ANFIS with five inputs and the least mean square error and an accuracy of more than 98% was the best system to estimate hybrid yield using phenotypic data.

Using data derived from soil core samples previously collected in Universal Transverse Mercator zone 50 (Western Australia) and remotely sensed data, a model that predicted ground movement (GM) was developed specific to Australian Standards manual AS 1726–2017. This is the first approach for Australian soils and first in the world for soils older than 200 million yr. The model developed reliably predicted GM with 91.1% accuracy. The error obtained from the prediction is within acceptable limits currently used by engineers in calculations concerning soil classification for engineering purposes. Concerning the remotely sensed data analyzed, accuracy of the Atterberg limits method might be improved if additional information about soil structure (layering and horizon) or other variables (seasonal data) are built into this model. This model can be used to save on construction material costs, reduce the potential for human error associated with data collection and sample manipulation, but also fast-track (by up to 6 wk based on current wait times) building approvals while ensuring compliance to the relevant legislation.

This work focuses on the utilization of predictive computational intelligence technique for the evaluation of nitrogen status in wheat crop. The evaluation depends on the analysis of crop images captured in field at varying lighting illuminations. The wheat crop is initially subjected to HSI color normalization, followed by the optimization process using genetic algorithm (GA) and artificial neural network (ANN) based prediction and crop precision status classification. This ANN based optimized approach can significantly differentiate between the wheat crops from the other unwanted plants and weeds while identifying the crop yield age into categorical classes.

Two indices, the effective leaching water amount (We) and the ratio of the salt discharge rate to the soil desalination rate (Rs/N), combined with the water drainage rate (Rw) and salt discharge rate (Rs), were used to evaluate the effects of salt discharge under different pipe layouts. The experimental results showed that water drainage only started when groundwater completely submerged the subsurface pipes. Furthermore, Rs and Rs/N increased with decreasing burial depth, while the total salt discharge decreased and Rw increased with We.

In contrast to linear approaches, which often provide algorithms that are simple to apply, nonlinear learning machines such as neural networks demand more computing and are more likely to have nonlinear optimization difficulties, which are more difficult to solve. Kernel methods, a recently developed technology, are strong machine learning approaches that have a less complicated architecture and give a straightforward way to transforming nonlinear optimization issues into convex optimization problems. Typical analytical tasks in kernel-based learning include classification, regression, and clustering, all of which are compromised. For image processing applications, a semisupervised deep learning approach, which is driven by a little amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data, has shown excellent performance in recent years. For their part, today's semisupervised learning methods operate on the assumption that both labeled and unlabeled information are distributed in a similar manner, and their performance is mostly impacted by the fact that the two data sets are in a similar state of distribution as well. When there is out-of-class data in unlabeled data, the system's performance will be adversely affected. When used in real-world applications, the capacity to verify that unlabeled data does not include data that belongs to a different category is difficult to obtain, and this is especially true in the field of synthetic aperture radar image identification (SAR). Using threshold filtering, this work addresses the problem of unlabeled input, including out-of-class data, having a detrimental influence on the performance of the model when it is utilized to train the model in a semisupervised learning environment. When the model is being trained, unlabeled data that does not belong to a category is filtered out by the model using two different sets of data that the model selects in order to optimize its performance. A series of experiments was carried out on the MSTAR data set, and the superiority of our method was shown when it was compared against a large number of current semisupervised classification algorithms of the highest level of sophistication. This was especially true when the unlabeled data had a significant proportion of data that did not fall into any of the categories. The performance of each kernel function is tested independently using two metrics, namely, the false alarm (FA) and the target miss (TM), respectively. These factors are used to calculate the proportion of incorrect judgments made using the techniques. © 2022 Pooja Chopra et al.",,"Classification (of information); Computer aided instruction; Convex optimization; Data handling; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Radar imaging; Supervised learning; Synthetic aperture radar; Automated registration; Data set; Linear methods; Multi angle; Non-linear optimization; Nonlinear data; Performance; Polynomial filters; SAR Images; Unlabeled data; Nonlinear programming",Article,Scopus

When done manually, postharvest grading of Calamansi is a laborious operation. Thus, an effective method of assessing them according to size, color, and maturity is required to assist calamansi farmers in grading and classifying it non-destructively with precision and accuracy. Deep learning architectures have been useful in a wide range of agricultural applications including classifying, grading fruits, and quality recognition. The goal of the study is to compare the performance of four deep learning architectures: VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet201 in classifying Calamansi. Three types of optimizers were considered in the training including Adam, SGD, and RMSProp. Furthermore, data augmentation is applied to the datasets to reduce overfitting and increase variation in the training datasets because of limited data. With Adam as optimizer, classification accuracies resulted to 96.98%, 91.48%, 27.95% and 65.95% for ResNet50, VGG16, InceptionV3 and DenseNet201, respectively.

Regardless of their strength, the CP-ANNs still have some limitations in pattern recognition tasks when they encounter ambiguities during the learning process, which leads to the inaccurate classification of the Kohonen-Self-Organizing-Map (K-SOM). This problem has an impact on the performance of the CP-ANNs. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel strategy to improve the CP-ANNs by the Gram-Schmidt algorithm (GSHM) as a pre-processing step of the original data without changing their architecture. Three datasets examples from various domains, such as correlation, crop, and fertilizer, were employed for experimental validation. To obtain the results, we relied on two simulations. The first simulation uses CP-ANNs, and the datasets are inputted into the network without any prior pre-processing. The second simulation uses MCP-ANNs, and the datasets are pre-processed through the GSHM block. Experiment results show that the proposed MCP-ANNs recognize all patterns with a classification accuracy of 100% versus 62.5% for CP-ANNs in the Correlation Dataset. Furthermore, the proposed MCP-ANNs reduce the execution time and training parameter values in all datasets versus CP-ANNs. Thus, the proposed approach based on the GSHM algorithm significantly improves the performance of the CP-ANNs. © 2022 CCIS.","Classification performance; Counter propagation artificial neural networks (CP-ANNs); Data preprocessing; Gram-Schmidt algorithm (GSHM); Kohonen-self organizing-map (K-SOM); Modified counter propagation artificial neural networks (MCP-ANNs)",,Article,Scopus

Here we show that growth rate (Gr) can be well-predicted by artificial intelligence (AI)-based artificial neural networks (ANN) and gene-expression programming (GEP), with accumulated air temperatures based on growth degree day (GDD). In total, 10,246 Gr from 95 cultivations were obtained with three cultivars, TK9, TNG71, and KH147, in Central and Southern Taiwan. The model performance was evaluated by the Pearson correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative RMSE (r-RMSE) in the whole growth period (lifecycle), as well as the average and specific key stages (transplanting, 50% initial tillering, panicle initiation, 50% heading, and physiological maturity). The results in lifecycle Gr modeling showed that ANN and GEP models had comparable r (0.9893), but the GEP model had the lowest RMSE (3.83 days) and r-RMSE (7.24%). In stage average and specific key stages, each model has its own best-fit growth period. Overall, GEP model is recommended for rice growth prediction considering the model performance, applicability, and routine farming work. This study may lead to smart rice production due to the enhanced capacity to predict rice growth in the field. © 2022 by the authors.

Results showed the largest irrigation depth led to reductions in irrigation and crop evapotranspiration (ETc) with slightly increased cotton yields compared to the baseline scenarios under different hydroclimatic regimes. However, soil water content and surface runoff values were increased when using the largest irrigation depth. The opposite results were observed for the small irrigation depth. Early planting of cotton resulted in decreased irrigation and ETc, and increased cotton yields under both irrigated and dryland conditions, particularly in normal and wet years. By contrast, the late planting scenarios indicated the opposite for those variables. Simulated hydrologic variables were relatively stable using various maturity cultivars. Nevertheless, greater than 10% reductions in irrigated cotton yield under diverse hydroclimatic years and dryland yields during normal and wet years were identified in the long-season cotton. The opposite was determined for the short-season cotton. These outcomes suggest that a larger irrigation depth, earlier planting date, and short-season cultivar are promising cultivation practices for improving cotton yield and water conservation in the Texas Panhandle. © 2021 by the authors.

This crop management has high technological and economic demand, thus the search for the efficient use of inputs such as crop growth regulator (to balance vegetative and reproductive growth) has become important in applied research areas such as precision agriculture. The objective of this work was to evaluate a predictive framework for cotton height based on field and remote sensing data and machine learning techniques, since this is an important variable in management planning of crop growth regulators on large scale cotton production. Field data from two agricultural seasons (2020/2021 and 2021/2022) from 16 fields and approximately 2800 hectares of commercial planted area were used as input along with Planet's satellite imagery. Machine learning techniques were used to answer the following main questions: (i) Can algorithms accurately predict crop height using two entire seasons of this data and remote sensing? (ii) Which remote sensing data and machine learning algorithm presents the best performance in the predictions? The algorithms could predict cotton height for the entire season with R-squared ranging from 0.31 to 0.87. Considering the main phenological phases, R-squared of the predictions ranged from -0.2 to 0.83. The inclusion of days after emergence showed an improvement in the performance of all models, decreasing the mean absolute error. For the main phenological phases, the best model performances were found from emergence to first flower appearance. Difference vegetation index and near infrared bands were the best predictors, considering the entire season and phenological phases. Random forest regressor presented the best overall performance, considering R-squared and mean absolute error. The use of two variables (remote sensing and time) proved to be sufficient to achieve one of the best performances. © 2022 The Author(s)","Cerrado; Multispectral imagery; Phenology; Plant biometrics; Regression models",,Article,Scopus

A key process in treating odor gases is predicting the production of odors from domestic waste. In this study, four factors of domestic waste (weight, wet composition, temperature, and fermentation time) were adopted to be the prediction indicators in the prediction for domestic waste odor gases. Machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) were established using the odor intensity values of 512 odor gases from domestic waste. Based on these data, the regression prediction with supervised machine learning was achieved, in which three different algorithmic models were evaluated for prediction performance. A Random Forest model with a R2 value of 0.8958 demonstrated the most accurate prediction of the production of domestic waste odor gas based on our data. Furthermore, the prediction results in the Random Forest model were further discussed based on the microbial fermentation of domestic waste.

A case in point is remote sensing images (RSI), now available in large-scale RSI archives, which have attracted a considerable amount of research on image classification within the remote sensing community. The basic task of single-target multi-class image classification considers the case where each image is assigned exactly one label from a predefined finite set of class labels. Recently, however, image annotations have become increasingly complex, with images labeled with several labels (instead of just one). In other words, the goal is to assign multiple semantic categories to an image, based on its high-level context. The corresponding machine learning tasks is called multi-label classification (MLC). The classification of RSI is currently predominantly addressed by deep neural network (DNN) approaches, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can be utilized as feature extractors as well as end-to-end methods. After only considering single-target classification for a long period, DNNs have recently emerged that address the task of MLC. On the other hand, trees and tree ensembles for MLC have a long tradition and are the best-performing class of MLC methods, but need predefined feature representations to operate on. In this work, we explore different strategies for model training based on the transfer learning paradigm, where we utilize different families of (pre-trained) CNN architectures, such as VGG, EfficientNet, and ResNet. The architectures are trained in an end-to-end manner and used in two different modes of operation, namely, as standalone models that directly perform the MLC task, and as feature extractors. In the latter case, the learned representations are used with tree ensemble methods for MLC, such as random forests and extremely randomized trees. We conduct an extensive experimental analysis of methods over several publicly available RSI datasets and evaluate their effectiveness in terms of standard MLC measures. Of these, ranking-based evaluation measures are most relevant, especially ranking loss. The results show that, for addressing the RSI-MLC task, it is favorable to use lightweight network architectures, such as EfficientNet-B2, which is the best performing end-to-end approach, as well as a feature extractor. Furthermore, in the datasets with a limited number of images, using traditional tree ensembles for MLC can yield better performance compared to end-to-end deep approaches. © 2023 by the authors.","convolutional neural networks; multi-label classification; remote sensing; tree ensemble methods","Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Image classification; Learning systems; Network architecture; Semantics; Transfer learning; Classification of remote sensing image; Convolutional neural network; End to end; Ensemble methods; Feature extractor; Multi-label classifications; Remote sensing images; Remote-sensing; Tree ensemble method; Tree ensembles; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

The model introduced Efficient Channel Attention (ECA), hard-Swish activation function, and Focal Loss function into YOLOX, which improved the ability of the model to extract image features, solved the problem of sample imbalance, improved the detection speed and accuracy, and enhanced the detection effect of cotton diseases and pests.

The unknowns that accompany projects, the different risks, the uniqueness of each project, and the differences between organizations’ culture and management techniques, hinder the ability to build one project duration prediction tool that can fit all types of projects and organizations. When machine learning (ML) techniques are used for project duration prediction, the challenge is even greater, as each organization has a different dataset structure, different features, and different quality of data. This hinders the ability to create one ML model that fits all types of organizations. This paper presents a new dynamic ML tool for improving the prediction accuracy of project duration. The tool is based on an artificial neural network (ANN) which is automatically adapted and optimized to different types of prediction methods and different datasets. The tool trains the ANN model multiple times with different architectures and uses a genetic algorithm to eventually choose the architecture which gives the most accurate prediction results. The validation process of the prediction accuracy is performed by using real-life project datasets supplied by two different organizations which have different project management approaches, different project types, and different project features.

This study takes place in the wheat belt region of Ethiopia and evaluates forty-two predictors that represent the major vegetation index categories of green, water, chlorophyll, dry biomass, and VH polarization SAR indices. The study also applies field-collected agronomic data from 165 farm fields for training and validation. According to results, compared to other methods, a combined automated machine learning (AutoML) approach with a generalized linear model (GLM) showed higher performance. AutoML, which reduces training time, delivered ten influential parameters. For the combined approach, the mean RMSE of wheat yield was from 0.84 to 0.98 ton/ha using ten predictors from the test dataset, achieving a 99% confidence interval. It also showed a correlation coefficient as high as 0.69 between the estimated yield and measured yield, and it was less sensitive to the small datasets used for model training and validation. A deep neural network with three hidden layers using the ten influential parameters was the second model. For this model, the mean RMSE of wheat yield was between 1.31 and 1.36 ton/ha on the test dataset, achieving a 99% confidence interval. This model used 55 neurons with respective values of 0.1, 0.5, and 1 × 10−4 for the hidden dropout ratio, input dropout ratio, and l2 regularization. The approaches implemented in this study are fast and reproducible and beneficial to predict yield at scale.

For the time being, ML is involved in a variety of aspects of farming, assisting ranchers in making smarter decisions on the basis of the observed data. In this study, we provide an overview of AI-driven precision farming/agriculture with related work and then propose a novel cloud-based ML-powered crop recommendation platform to assist farmers in deciding which crops need to be harvested based on a variety of known parameters. Moreover, in this paper, we compare five predictive ML algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—to identify the best-performing ML algorithm on which to build our recommendation platform as a cloud-based service with the intention of offering precision farming solutions that are free and open source, as will lead to the growth and adoption of precision farming solutions in the long run. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; cloud computing; cop recommendation; deep learning; Internet of Things; IoT; machine learning; smart agriculture","Adaptive boosting; Crops; Decision trees; Deep learning; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Recommender systems; Support vector machines; Cloud-based; Cloud-computing; Cop recommendation; Deep learning; IoT; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Modern agricultures; Precision-farming; Smart agricultures; Internet of things; agricultural land; agriculture; artificial intelligence; crop; machine learning; Agriculture; Artificial Intelligence; Crops, Agricultural; Farms; Machine Learning",Article,Scopus

This paper investigates the effect of changing climate on Indian agriculture, and the climate sensitivity of food grain yield in the eastern region. Using a panel set of physical crop yields and analyzing district-level data from 1990 to 2017, the study estimates agricultural production functions for specific food grains with extrinsic seasonal weather variables. These include average temperature, rainfall, evapotranspiration and wind speed. Spatially disaggregated district-level data provides information from low administrative units, creating a broader picture to be examined. The research indicates that climate change significantly affects east Indian agriculture, and its outcomes are consistent with other state and district-level studies conducted in India. Changing weather patterns over the year considerably influence crop production and disrupt food availability and quality. Hence, the study further expands the implications of results for inter-region inequality and recommends corrective measures. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Climate sensitivity; East Indian agriculture; Food grain yield; Panel data analysis",,Article,Scopus

Although the crop growth models provide accurate yield forecasting, these models are difficult to implement in developing countries like India due to inhomogeneous or/and lack of required information about crop, soil, weather, etc. On the contrary, remotely sensed imagery available homogeneously provides valuable inputs for this purpose. Particularly, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data proved to have great potential for paddy growth monitoring and biophysical parameters retrieval over optical data. Moreover, the effective use of artificial neural network (ANN) may enable us to understand the complex relation between parameters as well as improve the forecasting performance than using empirical-/semiempirical-based approaches. Thus, the study aims to analyze multi-temporal dual-polarization C-band Sentinel-1 SAR data for paddy yield forecasting using ANN model. In this study, smart sampling based on the normalized difference vegetation (NDVI) and normalized difference water index has been considered to obtain in situ yield measurements in the study area. The peak stage signature of backscattering coefficients is considered to estimate yield due to the maximum possibility of signal to interact with crop cover characteristics. It is observed that the VH-polarization-based ANN model provides better accuracy with coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.72 and 600.11 kg/ha, respectively, in comparison with VV polarization which has shown 0.26 and 948.46 kg/ha, respectively. Overall, the study demonstrates that the effective use of ANN model may provide reliable yield estimation accuracy from remotely sensed imagery alone. © 2022, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","ANN; Crop yield; Paddy; Remote sensing; SAR","artificial neural network; crop yield; forecasting method; paddy field; remote sensing; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar",Article,Scopus

Machine learning is an emerging technique in the field of agriculture in various ways, including soil classification, soil nutrient analysis, crop prediction or suggestion.

Accurately estimating the effect of change in structural parameters on the discharge exponent is critical for the design and optimization of emitters. In this research, the response surface methodology (RSM) and two machine learning models, the artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR), are used to predict the discharge exponent of tooth-shaped labyrinth channel emitters. The input parameters consist of the number of channel units (N), channel depth (D), tooth angle (α), tooth height (H) and channel width (W). The applied models are assessed through the coefficient of determination (R2 ), root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The analysis of variance shows that tooth height had the greatest effect on the discharge exponent. Statistical criteria indicate that among the three models, the SVR model has the highest prediction accuracy and the best robustness with an average R2 of 0.9696, an average RMSE of 0.0037 and an average MAE of 0.0031.

In this study, estimates for combining ability effects for grain yield and secondary traits of selected inbred lines, identify potential parents for hybrid development and yield potential of the crosses under sub-optimal and optimal N environments. One hundred hybrids were evaluated under sub-optimal and optimal N environments for two years. The experimental layout was a 10 × 10 alpha lattice design with two replications for two experiments. The results obtained showed that, the genotypes evaluated varied for grain yield and the characters measured under sub-optimal and optimal N conditions. Grain yield reduction due to N stress was 40.9%. General and specific combining ability (GCA) and (SCA) effects for mean squares varied for grain yield demonstrating the importance of additive and non-additive genetic effects for the hybrids evaluated under the study conditions. Even though significant variations were detected for GCA and SCA, GCA which is the additive gene action component mainly controlled the heritage of grain yield under both conditions. Inbred line 15 was identified as the superior parent with positive and significant GCA for grain yield under sub-optimal N. Genotypic correlation studies displayed that grain yield was positively correlated with ears per plant under sub-optimal N and was also positively associated with anthesis-silking interval under high N. The hybrids 52, 75, 81 and 37 were identified to be significantly superior in terms of grain yield, ASI and EPP under the two-contrasting conditions. The results suggest that, there is a need for development of low N tolerant inbred lines and hybrids for production under soils with low N status in the Guinea savanna of Ghana for high grain yield to be realised. © 2022 The Author(s)","Combining ability; Correlation; Grain yield; Hybrid; Low soil nitrogen",,Article,Scopus

For objective and time-efficient estimation of legume proportion, convolutional neural network (CNN) models were trained by fine-tuning the GoogLeNet to estimate the coverage of timothy (TY), white clover (WC), and background (Bg) on the unmanned aerial vehicle-based images. The accuracies of the CNN models trained on different datasets were compared using the mean bias error and the mean average error. The models predicted the coverage with small errors when the plots in the training datasets were similar to the target plots in terms of coverage rate. The models that are trained on datasets of multiple plots had smaller errors than those trained on datasets of a single plot. The CNN models estimated the WC coverage more precisely than they did to the TY and the Bg coverages.

Commonly, high operating costs in a smart farm are primarily due to inefficient energy usage. Therefore, accurate estimation of agricultural energy usage and environmental factors is considered as one of the significant tasks for crop growth control. The growth sequences of crops in agricultural environments like smart farms are related to agricultural energy usage and consumption. This study aims to develop and validate an algorithm that can interpret the crop growth rate response to environmental and solar energy factors based on machine learning, and to evaluate the algorithm's accuracy compared to the base model. The proposed model was determined through a comparative experiment of three representative machine learning techniques, which are random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and gradient boosting machine (GBM), considering the energy usage for environmental control is highly associated with the paprika crop growth. Through the experiment performance with real data gathered from a paprika smart farm in South Korea, the multi-level RF can effectively predict paprika growth with an accuracy of 0.88, considering data analysis of factors that use solar energy. As a result of the experiment with the suggested model, the growth factors such as leaf length, leaf width, and environmental factors were found.

Further extending this paradigm, we propose a model based on convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) that is computationally efficient (lightweight), however obtains superior results to the previous baselines. By introducing a ConvLSTM-based architecture to this problem, we can not only ingest the heterogeneous data sources (Sentinel-2 time-series, weather data, and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM)) but also explicitly condition the future predictions on the weather. Our experiments confirm the importance of weather parameters in understanding the land cover dynamics and show that weather maps are significantly more important than the DEM in this task. Furthermore, we perform generative simulations to investigate how varying a single weather parameter can alter the evolution of the land surface.

The advances of the last few decades in machine learning techniques have created new possibilities for estimating aboveground biomass. A pipeline was established from image acquisition to modelling shoot biomass of two wheat cultivars used in Southern Brazil (TBIO Toruk and BRS Parrudo). A UAV was used to acquire multispectral images with high spatial resolution to calculate vegetation indices (VIs). These VIs along with machine learning approaches are used to model the measured biomass of crops in different growth phases. To correlate the wheat images with measured shoot dry biomass, the following regression models were investigated: random forest, support vector regression, and artificial neural networks. An experiment was designed and conducted at the Agriculture Experimental Station of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (EEA/UFRGS) to assess wheat growth. Variability in crop growth was created for all test areas by varying nitrogen availability. To determine shoot biomass, plants were sampled at three different crop growth stages: V6 (stage of six fully developed leaves), three nodes, and flowering. Our results indicate the importance of the radiometric calibration used. Also, the features extracted from images, such as the VIs combined with machine learning models can be used in precision agriculture for predicting the spatial variability of shoot biomass. The best model for Brazilian wheat cultivars was an artificial neural network with (Formula presented.) of 0.90, RMSE of 0.83t/ha, and nRMSE of 8.95%.

A model based on the water pipeline method is proposed in order to efficiently utilize sensor nodes in agricultural production and water distribution. A water pipeline serves as an important structure for transporting potable water across a distance for consumption or irrigation. In contrast, the biggest transportation problems of water pipelines are leaks. So, water resources may be lost as a result. These pipes need real-time monitoring to prevent such problems. The wireless sensor network technique, however, is considered one of the best solutions available today for monitoring water pipelines. A detailed analysis of agriculture is provided by the model. Aspects of WSN are discussed and their agricultural use is expounded. Moreover, this paper describes the various types of applicability of existing sensor networks in the field of agriculture, along with some technical perspectives. To achieve the best power consumption and communication for the two types of range, ZigBee wireless protocols are utilized. As such, high-performance information that provides a platform for WSNs to better support agricultural production is also included in our proposed model in order to address the shortcomings of existing WSNs regarding energy efficiency.

However, different stakeholders in the agri-food sector require different levels of accuracy and lead times in which a yield prediction should be available. For the producers, predictions during the growing season are essential to ensure that information is available early enough for the timely implementation of agronomic decisions, while industries can wait until later in the season to optimize their production process and increase their production traceability. In this study, we used machine learning algorithms, dynamic and static predictors, and a phenology approach to determine the time for issuing the yield prediction. In addition, the effect of data reduction was evaluated by comparing results obtained with and without principal component analysis (PCA). Gaussian process regression (GPR) was the best for predicting maize yield. Its best performance (nRMSE of 13.31%) was obtained late in the season and with the full set of predictors (vegetation indices, meteorological and soil predictors). In contrast, neural network (NNET) and support vector machines linear basis function (SVMl) achieved their best accuracy with only vegetation indices and at the tasseling phenological stage. Only slight differences in performance were observed between the algorithms considered, highlighting that the main factors influencing performance are the timing of the yield prediction and the predictors with which the machine learning algorithms are fed. Interestingly, PCA was instrumental in increasing the performances of NNET after this stage. An additional benefit of the application of PCA was the overall reduction between 12 and 30.20% in the standard deviation of the maize yield prediction performance from the leave one-year outer-loop cross-validation, depending on the feature set. © 2022 by the authors.","dimensionality reduction; machine learning; multi-source data; phenology; Sentinel-2; yield prediction","Data reduction; Food supply; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Supply chains; Support vector machines; Vegetation; Dimensionality reduction; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Maize yield; Multisource data; Performance; Phenology; Principal-component analysis; Sentinel-2; Yield prediction; Principal component analysis",Article,Scopus

For example, drought-induced increases in plant diseases and rainfall caused a decrease in food production. Machine Learning and Agricultural Big Data are high-performance computing technologies that allow analyzing a large amount of data to understand agricultural production. Machine Learning and Agricultural Big Data are high-performance computing technologies that allow the processing and analysis of large amounts of heterogeneous data for which intelligent IT and high-resolution remote sensing techniques are required. However, the selection of ML algorithms depends on the types of data to be used. Therefore, agricultural scientists need to understand the data and the sources from which they are derived. These data can be structured, such as temperature and humidity data, which are usually numerical (e.g., float); semi-structured, such as those from spreadsheets and information repositories, since these data types are not previously defined and are stored in No-SQL databases; and unstructured, such as those from files such as PDF, TIFF, and satellite images, since they have not been processed and therefore are not stored in any database but in repositories (e.g., Hadoop). This study provides insight into the data types used in Agricultural Big Data along with their main challenges and trends. It analyzes 43 papers selected through the protocol proposed by Kitchenham and Charters and validated with the PRISMA criteria. It was found that the primary data sources are Databases, Sensors, Cameras, GPS, and Remote Sensing, which capture data stored in Platforms such as Hadoop, Cloud Computing, and Google Earth Engine. In the future, Data Lakes will allow for data integration across different platforms, as they provide representation models of other data types and the relationships between them, improving the quality of the data to be integrated. © 2022 by the authors.","agriculture; big data; data source; data type; machine learning","climate change; data set; humidity; machine learning; processing",Review,Scopus

Herein, we combined multi- ML algorithms with multi-crop models (CMs) of the DSSAT platform to develop a hybrid approach for wheat yield simulation over 40 years in different locations. The simulation analysis included temperatures (minimum and maximum), solar radiation, and precipitation as important key ecological factors in wheat production that varied across sites and years. Detailed observed datasets of wheat yield from 1981 to 2020 were used for training and testing Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest Regressor (RFR), and Support Vector Regressor (SVR) using Google Colaboratory (Colab). Such models were built to create four main approaches, including two approaches as hybrid (CMs-ML) and benchmark (pure ML), as well as two testing methods for each approach such as default (75 % training and 25 % testing) and warmest years (2001, 2006, 2009, 2010, and 2018). In addition to wheat yield simulations, ML approaches were used to identify the important features, improve accuracy, and reduce overfitting. We developed ML approaches by novel cells on the built models (i.e., pure ML and hybrid) to eliminate less important features from permutation. Our results revealed that ANN and RFR outperformed other ML algorithms (SVR and KNN) in wheat yield simulation accuracy. Application of ML algorithms reduced yield change from 31.7 % under DSSAT simulations to 8.1 % and uncertainty from 12.8 % to 7.2 % relative to observed wheat yield over the last four decades (1981–2020). Our novel approach, which includes a hybrid CMs-ML model, cloud computing, and a new permutation tool, could be effectively used for robust crop yield simulation on a regional and global scale, contributing to better aid decision-making strategies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial Neural Network; DSSAT; Google Colaboratory; K-Nearest Neighbors; Random Forest; Support Vector Regressor; Uncertainty; Wheat yield simulation","Cloud computing; Crops; Machine learning; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Random forests; Simulation platform; Textures; Well testing; DSSAT; Google colaboratory; Google+; K-near neighbor; Nearest-neighbour; Random forests; Support vector regressor; Uncertainty; Wheat yield; Wheat yield simulation; Decision trees; arid region; artificial neural network; cloud phenomena; crop yield; machine learning; simulation; uncertainty analysis",Article,Scopus

Merr.) is a leguminous and oil crop with rapidly growing importance and demand in Africa following the increasing demand for oil and livestock and poultry feed in sub-Saharan Africa. However, soybean productivity is low in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa, especially in West Africa, where productivity is below one ton per ha. Hence, concerted soybean varietal development and testing efforts have been underway by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), collaborating with the various African and US-based soybean breeding programs. Integrating new varietal evaluation approaches based on advanced phenotyping techniques into IITA's soybean breeding program is crucial for designing efficient crop genetic improvement techniques. Hence, this work aims to investigate machine learning (ML) models and Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAVs) to aid rapid high throughput phenotypic workflow for soybean yield estimation. We acquired multispectral images through a Sequoia® camera aboard a senseFly eBee X UAV from five variety trials during the 2020 growing season in Nigeria. UAV-based spectral bands, canopy height, vegetation indices (VI), and texture features were generated by gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and integrated to predict crop grain yield using five machine learning (ML) regression models, including Cubist, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Stochastic Gradient Boosting (GBM), Support vector machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). The main findings are the textural information generated using gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) slightly outperformed predictors based mainly on vegetation indices (VI) and provided a promising alternative to the conventional use of VI in crop yield estimation. All the five ML models performed moderately well in predicting grain yield for all the soybean trials investigated, though the Cubist and RF model stood out, with R2 reaching 0.89. The study provides a framework to perform crop breeding trial assessments more effectively and consistently at high spatial scales that African crop breeding programs did not commonly apply. The workflow can also be successfully modified and applied for high throughput phenotyping of breeding platforms in other crops. © 2022 The Authors","Gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM); Machine learning models; Soybean; Vegetation indices; Yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

In the present study, a robust yield estimation method was improved for estimating the yield of corn, winter wheat, sunflower, and rapeseed in Hungary for the period 2000–2020 using 16 vegetation indices. Then, meteorological data were used to reduce the differences between the estimated and census yield data. In the case of corn, the best result was obtained using the Green Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index, where the correlation between estimated and census data was R2 = 0.888 before and R2 = 0.968 after the meteorological correction. In the case of winter wheat, the Difference Vegetation Index produced the best result with R2 = 0.815 and 0.894 before and after the meteorological correction. For sunflower, these correlation values were 0.730 and 0.880, and for rapeseed, 0.765 and 0.922, respectively. Using the meteorological correction, the average percentage differences between estimated and census data decreased from 7.7% to 3.9%, from 6.7% to 3.9%, from 7.2% to 4.2%, and from 7.8% to 5.1% in the case of corn, winter wheat, sunflower, and rapeseed, respectively. © 2022 by the authors.

Although the use of regression models is common in forest measurement, there is a constant search for estimation procedures that provide greater accuracy. Recently, machine learning techniques have been used with satisfactory performance in measuring forests. However, methods such as Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Random Forest are relatively poorly studied for predicting the volume of wood in eucalyptus plantations in Brazil. Therefore, it is essential to check whether these techniques can provide gains in terms of accuracy. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the use of Random Forest and ANFIS techniques in the prognosis of forest production. The data used come from continuous forest inventories carried out in stands of eucalyptus clones. The data were divided into 70% for training and 30% for validation. The algorithms used to generate rules in ANFIS were Subtractive Clustering and Fuzzy-C-Means. Besides, training was done with the hybrid algorithm (descending gradient and least squares) with the number of seasons ranging from 1 to 20. Several RFs were trained, varying the number of trees from 50 to 850 and the number of observations by five leaves to 35. Artificial neural networks and decision trees were also trained to compare the feasibility of the techniques. The evaluation of the estimates generated by the techniques for training and validation was calculated based on the following statistics: correlation coefficient (r), relative Bias (RB), and the relative root mean square error (RRMSE) in percentage. In general, the techniques studied in this work showed excellent performance for the training and validation data set with RRMSE values <6%, RB < 0.5%, and r > 0.98. The RF presented inferior statistics about the ANFIS for the prognosis of forest production. The Subtractive Clustering (SC) and Fuzzy-C-Means (FCM) algorithms provide accurate baseline and volume projection estimates; both techniques are good alternatives for selecting variables used in modeling forest production. © 2021 China Agricultural University","Artificial Intelligence; Artificial Neural Networks; Ensemble Learning; Forest inventory; Forest Measurement; Regression","Clustering algorithms; Error statistics; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mean square error; Regression analysis; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference; Ensemble learning; Forest inventory; Forest measurement; Forest production; Machine learning techniques; Neuro-fuzzy inference systems; Performance; Random forests; Regression; Decision trees",Article,Scopus

Such early season predictions are of practical relevance for instance for yield forecasts or the modeling of agricultural water balances, therefore being important for the public as well as the private sector. Furthermore, we improve the mechanism of combining different data sources for the prediction task, allowing for both optical and radar data as inputs (multi-modal data fusion) without the need for temporal interpolation.

The purpose of this study is to use time-series UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) multispectral and RGB remote sensing images combined with machine learning to model four main quality indicators of cotton fibers. A deep learning algorithm is used to identify and extract cotton boll pixels in remote sensing images and improve the accuracy of quantitative extraction of spectral features. In order to simplify the input parameters of the model, the stepwise sensitivity analysis method is used to eliminate redundant variables and obtain the optimal input feature set. The results of this study show that the R2 of the prediction model established by a neural network is improved by 29.67% compared with the model established by linear regression. When the spectral index is calculated after removing the soil pixels used for prediction, R2 is improved by 4.01% compared with the ordinary method.

The exploration of key growth phases and features is beneficial to improving the efficiency and accuracy of yield prediction. In this study, a hybrid approach using the WOFOST model and deep learning was developed to forecast corn yield, which analysed yield prediction potential at different growth phases and features. The World Food Studies (WOFOST) model was used to build a comprehensive simulated dataset by inputting meteorological, soil, crop and management data. Different feature combinations at various growth phases were designed to forecast yield using machine learning and deep learning methods. The results show that the key features of corn’s vegetative growth stage and reproductive growth stage were growth state features and water-related features, respectively. With the continuous advancement of the crop growth stage, the ability to predict yield continued to improve. Especially after entering the reproductive growth stage, corn kernels begin to form, and the yield prediction performance is significantly improved.

Drones offer a unique advantage over other existing methods to sample data from soil sensors because of the high density of sensors required to gather spatially granular data to capture soil variability. To determine the placement of sensors within an agricultural field, a novel sequential gap-reduction algorithm that minimizes sensor overlap was developed and used to assign sensor placement for four types of agricultural fields. A genetic algorithm optimized multi-agent flight paths for scanning sensors in a simulated agricultural field using a robust agent-based model. The locations of soil sensors for a simulated 400 m center-pivot irrigation field were used to determine flight paths for swarms of 1-8 drones. Increasing the number of drones in the swarm had a negligible effect on total energy expenditure but reduced the time to scan the sensors from 19 min to less than three minutes. The proposed sequential gap reduction algorithm maximizes the coverage of any arbitrarily-shaped agricultural field with fewer sensors than a grid-based distribution in most cases. The proposed multi-agent flight path mapping can effectively and efficiently generate flight paths for variable numbers of drones to scan all sensors. The framework proposed here can be utilized and expanded for variable rate irrigation, precision application of biological control agents, and smart farming. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Agent-based model; Agricultural sensors; Genetic algorithms; Geostatistics; UAVs","Agricultural robots; Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Drones; Irrigation; Machine learning; Mapping; Multi agent systems; Simulation platform; Soils; Agent-based model; Agricultural fields; Agricultural sensor; Agricultural soils; Geo-statistics; Machine-learning; Multi agent; Reduction algorithms; Soil data; Soil sensors; Genetic algorithms; agricultural modeling; agricultural soil; algorithm; genetic algorithm; geostatistics; machine learning; mapping method; sensor; unmanned vehicle",Article,Scopus

This research is devoted to the prediction of both spread and behavior of wildfires at a specific time and/or in specific regions for helping fire management agencies minimize the damages caused. The Brazilian Federal District, inserted in the Cerrado biome, is the focus of the analyses, due to its large number of fire occurrences and reduced number of studies conducted on the region.

Therefore, having a good fruit yield forecast with anticipation allows making timely correct decisions for providing the resources, transport, and cold storage contracts, among others. Therefore, fruit yield over or underestimation could cause important inefficiencies with regards to FSC. Because of its relevance, a method based on machine learning (ML) techniques that uses spectrometric vegetation data is proposed. This method, known as Spectrometry Based Method for Fruit Production Forecast (SBM-Fruit), allows exploring the georeferenced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), collected in different phenological stages, aiming to capture spatial and temporal dependency in the fruit yield forecast. In the first step of SBM-Fruit, several clusters are obtained in a clustering process using the georeferenced NDVI in all phenological stages as input, while, in the second step, two validation functions are used for determining the best clustering. Finally, in the third step, the predictor variables of the best clustering are incorporated into an artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting the fruit yield. The SBM-Fruit was applied to forecast table grape yield of an orchard located in the Valparaíso Region, Chile. The results show fruit yield estimations with mean errors around 0.013 percent for every spatial zone of the orchard, forecasted at least two months in advance. The use of the SBM-Fruit would allow FSC stakeholders to make better decisions, improving the coordination of the FSC stages, and reducing costs and fruit losses. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial neural network; Fruit yield forecast; Machine learning; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; Spatial Fuzzy c-Means algorithm","algorithm; artificial neural network; fruit; NDVI; orchard; phenology; vegetation type; Chile",Article,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach: This study used a conceptual framework of individual-level determinants of entrepreneurship and ML. The Google Survey instrument was prepared on a 5-point scale and administered to 656 students in different sections of the same class during regular virtual classrooms in 2021. The datasets were analyzed and compared using ML. Findings: Entrepreneurial traits existed among students before attending undergraduate entrepreneurship courses. Establishing strong partnerships (0.359), learning (0.347) and people-organizing ability (0.341) were promising correlated entrepreneurial traits. Female students exhibited fewer entrepreneurial traits than male students. The random forest model exhibited 60% accuracy in trait prediction against gradient boosting (58.4%), linear regression (56.8%), ridge (56.7%) and lasso regression (56.0%). Thus, the ML model appeared to be unsuitable to predict entrepreneurial traits. Quality data are important for accurate trait predictions. Research limitations/implications: Further studies can validate K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) models against random forest to support the statement that the ML model cannot be used for entrepreneurial trait prediction. Originality/value: This research is unique because ML models, such as random forest, gradient boosting and lasso regression, are used for entrepreneurial trait prediction by agricultural domain students. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agribusiness; Business enterprise; Business studies; Education; Entrepreneurial traits; Gradient boost; Machine learning; Random forest; Undergraduate students",,Article,Scopus

Furthermore, prior to the activation layer, we use Global Average Pooling (GAP) instead of dense layer with the aim of averaging the results of predictions along with having more information compared to the dense layer. To check the validity of our model, we validate our model on the validation set which achieves satisfactory results. Also, for the localization task, we propose an architecture that consists of localization aware block, which captures localization information for better prediction and residual connections to handle the over-fitting problem.

In addition, we use class weights and Focal Loss (FL) to handle class imbalance problems along with reducing false predictions. Actually, class weights assign less weights to classes having fewer instances and large weights to classes having more number of instances.

Calibration of hydrological models using streamflow and actual evapotranspiration (AET) data, which the latter has a remarkable spatial and temporal distribution in the watershed scale, gives more confidence on the partitioning of water between soil storage and aquifer recharge. Therefore, this study aims to improve hydrological response of the agricultural-based Neishaboor watershed, located at the northeast of Iran, using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). To this end, monthly streamflow data at three hydrometric stations (1997–2010) and monthly AET values, computed by SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land) algorithm using MODIS products (2001−2010), were employed for the SWAT hybrid calibration and validation. The results showed that RCHRG_DP, SOL_AWC, ESCO, EPCO and CANMX are the most sensitive parameters to AET estimation. The proposed hybrid calibration method had reasonable performance on AET estimation in which NS and RMSE values varied between 0.7–0.88 and 7.89–9.96 mm.month−1 in calibration and 0.86–0.93 and 6.79–7.91 mm.month−1 in validation periods, respectively. In comparison to SEBAL-based AET, a general under-prediction tendency was observed by the SWAT-based AET with the proposed method. Highest error rate of the SWAT model for the calibration (average RMSE = 17.18) and validation (average RMSE = 9.44) periods was obtained in the range of measured AET values which were higher than 50 mm.month−1.

To efficiently calculate this index, there is a high demand for precise and automatic plant phenotyping methods that quantify images. As a tool for estimating crop yields, machine vision is rapidly advancing. In the majority of crop phenotyping fields, however, annotating thousands of small objects using bounding boxes or polygons is extremely time- and labor-intensive. This study aims to develop a state-of-the-art framework for localizing and counting wheat spikes using dotted annotation datasets in conjunction with Gaussian and constant density map generation algorithms. In addition, we developed hybrid UNet architectures as the computational component, including VGG16-UNet, ResNet34-UNet, ResNet50-UNet, and ResNeXt-UNet. Furthermore, we improved the performance of wheat counting by employing a hybrid density map estimation-non-maximal supervision algorithm. Wheat images from the ACID and GWHD datasets are used to evaluate the proposed models. With F1 score and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.96 and 1.68%, respectively, the results from the ACID dataset demonstrate a significant improvement in spike localization and counting compared to previous research studies. Additionally, to assess the proposed models’ generalizability in real-world modeling scenarios, the ACID-based pretrained models are used to predict the more complex in-field GWHD dataset.

The traditional manual methods for disease detection in plants involve expert knowledge that may be biased. The modern computing techniques and image processing can assist non-experts in plant disease management. Recently, deep learning techniques have observed remarkable success in image-based health assessment of plants. In this paper, the state-of-the-art pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models are fine-tuned to detect and diagnose the diseases in apple crop using digital images. The experiments are performed on a publicly available dataset PlantVillage. The dataset consists of three classes of apple diseases including Scab, Black Rot, and Cedar Rust, and one class of Healthy leaves. The experimental results on ten well-known CNN models DenseNet201, DenseNet169, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, MobileNet, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, VGG16, VGG19, and Xception showed that deep learning techniques can accurately discriminate the apple diseases. DenseNet201 outperformed the other models with an accuracy of 98.75%.

Thus, seasonal forecasts of precipitation and temperature are an essential tool for stakeholders to make timely choices regarding the strategies required to maximize their expected cereal yield outcomes. The availability of state-of-the-art seasonal forecasts such as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) system 5 (SEAS5) may be an asset to help decision making. However, uncertainties and reduced skill may hamper the use of seasonal forecasts in several applications. Hence, in this work, we aim to understand the added value of such dynamical forecasts when compared to persistent anomalies of climate conditions used to predict the production of wheat and barley yields. With that in mind, empirical models relating annual wheat and barley yields in Spain to monthly values of precipitation and temperature are developed by taking advantage of ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis. Then, dynamical and persistence forecasts are issued at different lead times, and the skill of the subsequent forecasted yield is verified through probabilistic metrics. The results presented in this study demonstrate two different outcomes: (1) wheat and barley yield anomaly forecasts (dynamical and persistent) start to gain skill later in the season (typically from April onwards); and (2) the added value of using the SEAS5 forecast as an alternative to persistence ranges from 6 to 16%, with better results in the southern Spanish regions. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"article; cereal; climate; harvest; human; nonhuman; plant yield; precipitation; season; skill; Spain; uncertainty; weather; wheat; food grain; forecasting; temperature; weather; Edible Grain; Forecasting; Seasons; Temperature; Triticum; Weather",Article,Scopus

Thus, it is an important and urgent task for crop breeders to find the freezing-tolerant rapeseed materials in the process of breeding. Existing large-scale freezing-tolerant rapeseed material recognition methods mainly rely on the field investigation conducted by the agricultural experts using some professional equipments. These methods are time-consuming, inefficient and laborious. In addition, the accuracy of these traditional methods depends heavily on the knowledge and experience of the experts. Methods: To solve these problems of existing methods, we propose a low-cost freezing-tolerant rapeseed material recognition approach using deep learning and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images captured by a consumer UAV. We formulate the problem of freezing-tolerant material recognition as a binary classification problem, which can be solved well using deep learning. The proposed method can automatically and efficiently recognize the freezing-tolerant rapeseed materials from a large number of crop candidates. To train the deep learning network, we first manually construct the real dataset using the UAV images of rapeseed materials captured by the DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2.0. Then, five classic deep learning networks (AlexNet, VGGNet16, ResNet18, ResNet50 and GoogLeNet) are selected to perform the freezing-tolerant rapeseed material recognition. Result and conclusion: The accuracy of the five deep learning networks used in our work is all over 92%. Especially, ResNet50 provides the best accuracy (93.33%) in this task. In addition, we also compare deep learning networks with traditional machine learning methods. The comparison results show that the deep learning-based methods significantly outperform the traditional machine learning-based methods in our task. The experimental results show that it is feasible to recognize the freezing-tolerant rapeseed using UAV images and deep learning. © 2022, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Freezing injury recognition; Machine learning; Rapeseed; UAV images",,Article,Scopus

Knowing banana production is due to the need to maximize the investment–profit ratio, and the availability of this information in advance allows decisions to be made about the management of important diseases. The objective of this study was to predict the number of banana bunches from epidemiological parameters of Black Sigatoka (BS), using random forests (RF) for its ability to predict crop production responses to epidemiological variables. Weekly production data (number of banana bunches) and epidemiological parameters of BS from three adjacent banana sites in Panama during 2015–2018 were used. RF was found to be very capable of predicting the number of banana bunches, with variance explained as 70.0% and root mean square error (RMSE) of 1107.93 ± 22 of the mean banana bunches observed in the test case. The site, week, youngest leaf spotted and youngest leaf with symptoms in plants with 10 weeks of physiological age were found to be the best predictor group.

This study aimed to estimate the relationship between vegetation indices (VIs) and carbon stock in an upland rice field intercropped with Brachiaria, an exotic grass species in the savanna ecosystem of Brazil (Cerrado biome), using multispectral aerial imaging with a high cartographic scale. The research was conducted in an experimental iLP system located at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa Arroz e Feijão), Goiás State. During the data collection stage, flights were conducted with a fixed-wing UAV (eBee Plus RTK) on the same day or close to collecting biomass samples in the field. In the processing step, a correlation was performed between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), simple ratio (SR), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and modified photochemical reflectance index (MPRI) VIs and the biomass measured in the field. The results indicated that the vegetation index (VI) that used the near-infrared (NIR) band showed a stronger correlation with biomass than the VI that used only the visible band information. All VIs were significantly correlated with the estimated field biomass (P &lt; 0.05) using Pearson's correlation. The regression models were able to predict the biomass and carbon stock in Phase 1 (3.93 Mg ha−1, 1.66 Mg ha−1, R2 = 0.748) and Phase 2 (7.53 Mg ha−1, 3.19 Mg ha−1, R2 = 0.816).

With an expanding base of dynamic customer demands and the adoption of multiple technological advancements, there is a high possibility that human-centric sales management will be transformed into a fully automated form aimed at increasing productivity and being able to cater to effectively a broader customer base. A review of the relevant literature demonstrates that machine learning is one of the most prevalent techniques in analytics for predicting sales behaviour. However, SESaaS includes many features beyond the sales component. Internet-of-Things (IoT) can additionally be used for networking and data analytics to enrich sales data. Therefore, the proposed scheme introduces a novel SESaaS model capable of balancing the sales team’s needs with those of the customers to maximise profits. The proposed model also presents a novel learning scheme in the IoT environment that aids in projecting the service quality score to the final customer, thereby positively influencing the customer to pay a service fee for a superior and desired quality of experience. Unlike any existing sales management scheme, the proposed scheme offers a novel research methodology for improving sales enablement practices, emphasising service scalability, and forecasting company profit. In contrast to any existing system for sales management, the proposed scheme provides greater accuracy, higher service quality, and faster response time in its predictive strategy for projecting the cost of the adoption of SESaaS, which is not reported in any existing studies. In an extensive testing environment, it is determined that the proposed scheme achieves accuracy and service quality of approximately 98.75% and 92.91%, respectively. In addition, the proposed SESaaS model has a significantly faster response time of 1.256 s.

This article covers how to evaluate the performance of the designed antenna by using a combination of simulation, measurement, creation of the RLC equivalent circuit model, and the implementation of machine learning approaches. The MPA’s measured frequency range is 7.9–14.6 GHz, while its simulated frequency range is 8.35–14.25 GHz in CST microwave studio (CST MWS) 2018. The measured and simulated bandwidths are 6.7 GHz and 5.9 GHz, respectively. The antenna substrate is composed of FR-4 Epoxy, which has a dielectric constant of 4.4 and a loss tangent of 0.02. The equivalent model of the proposed MPA is developed by using an advanced design system (ADS) to compare the resonance frequencies obtained by using CST. In addition, the measured return loss of the prototype is compared with the simulated return loss observed by using CST and ADS. At the end, 86 data samples are gathered through the simulation by using CST MWS, and seven machine learning (ML) approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN), linear regression (LR), random forest regression (RFR), decision tree regression (DTR), lasso regression, ridge regression, and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) regression, are applied to estimate the resonant frequency of the patch antenna. The performance of the seven ML models is evaluated based on mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and variance score. Among the seven ML models, the prediction result of DTR (MSE = 0.71%, MAE = 5.63%, RMSE = 8.42%, and var score = 99.68%) is superior to other ML models.

Prediction and early warning of temperature changes is an important measure to ensure the healthy growth of sheep. Aiming at the randomness and empirical problem of parameter selection of the traditional single Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, this paper proposes an optimization method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Then, using the proposed PCA-PSO-XGBoost to predict the temperature in the sheep house. First, PCA is used to screen the key influencing factors of the sheep house temperature. The dimension of the input vector of the model is reduced; PSO-XGBoost is used to build a temperature prediction model, and the PSO optimization algorithm selects the main hyperparameters of XGBoost. We carried out a global search and determined the optimal hyperparameters of the XGBoost model through iterative calculation. Using the data of the Xinjiang Manas intensive sheep breeding base to conduct a simulation experiment, the results show that it is different from the existing ones. Compared with the temperature prediction model, the evaluation indicators of the PCA-PSO-XGBoost model proposed in this paper are root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), which are 0.0433, 0.0019, 0.9995, 0.0065, respectively. RMSE, MSE, and MAE are improved by 68, 90, and 94% compared with the traditional XGBoost model.

Due to its distributed network and frequently changing topology, it is extremely prone to security attacks. The researchers have proposed different strategies for detecting various forms of network attacks. However, VANET is still exposed to several attacks, specifically Sybil attack. Sybil Attack is one of the most challenging attacks in VANETS, which forge false identities in the network to undermine communication between network nodes. This attack highly impacts transportation safety services and may create traffic congestion. In this regard, a novel collaborative framework based on majority voting is proposed to detect the Sybil attack in the network. The framework works by ensembling individual classifiers, i.e., K-Nearest Neighbor, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM, and Logistic Regression in a parallel manner. The Majority Voting (Hard and Soft) mechanism is adopted for a final prediction. A comparison is made between Majority Voting Hard and soft to choose the best approach.

However, post-harvest losses due to pulse beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus (F.), are significant due to improper storage management practices and undetected internal infestations. The detection of early stages of infestation could help in implementing suitable control practices for insect disinfestation. This study determined the potential of detecting internal infestations caused by C. maculatus using the soft X-ray method and deep learning. Furthermore, this study aims to reduce the time and effort needed to prepare a huge amount of image data for this highly data-driven process by using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Methods: A three-class classification method was implemented to identify the infestation stages, namely, uninfested kernel, larva stage, and pupa stage. The approach was based on features extraction from the deepest pooling layer of a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network architecture—the Xception, and using support vector machine as the classifier. Moreover, a GAN model was proposed to synthesize artificial X-ray images. Results: The overall F1-score produced by the model was improved from 0.86 to 0.91 when the GAN-synthesized dataset additionally supported the training data. Also, the classification accuracy for detecting the stage of internal infestation improved by 5.5%. Conclusion: The experiment showed that X-ray imaging and deep learning–based automatic features extraction could identify internal infestation in green gram grains. The results determine that augmentation using GANs can enhance the status of learning-based grain quality assessment models with reduced manual effort. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Korean Society for Agricultural Machinery.","Convolutional neural network; Grain quality; Green gram; Support vector machine; X-ray imaging","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Digital storage; Extraction; Generative adversarial networks; Grain (agricultural product); Multilayer neural networks; Multilayers; Network architecture; Callosobruchus maculatus; Convolutional neural network; Grain quality; Green gram; Management practises; Network-based; Post-harvest loss; Soft X-ray; Support vectors machine; X-ray imaging; Support vector machines",Article,Scopus

Among the different plant parts, the economic part, the yield, has the highest importance and becomes the ultimate goal for the farming community. It depends on many genetic and environmental factors, so this curiosity about knowing the yield brought several precise pre-harvest prediction methods using different ways. Out of those techniques, non-invasive yield prediction techniques using computer vision have been proved to be the most efficient and trusted platform. This study developed a novel methodology, called SlypNet, using advanced deep learning networks, i.e., Mask R-CNN and U-Net, which can extract various plant morphological features like spike and spikelet from the visual image of the wheat plant and provide a high-throughput yield estimate with great precision. Mask R-CNN outperformed previous networks in spike detection by its precise detection performance with a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.57%, a F1 score of 0.67, and an MCC of 0.91 by overcoming several natural field constraints like overlapping and background interference, variable resolution, and high bushiness of plants. The spikelet detection module’s accuracy and consistency were tested with about 99% validation accuracy of the model and the least error, i.e., a mean square error of 1.3 from a set of typical and complex views of wheat spikes. Spikelet yield cumulatively showed the probable production capability of each plant. Our method presents an integrated deep learning platform of spikelet-based yield prediction comprising spike and spikelet detection, leading to higher precision over the existing methods.

However, ET is difficult to directly measure, so an ideal solution was to develop a simulation model to obtain ET. There are many ways to calculate ET, most of which use models based on the Penman–Monteith equation, but they are often inaccurate when applied to greenhouse crop evapotranspiration. The use of machine learning models to predict ET has gradually increased, but research into their application for greenhouse crops is relatively rare. We used experimental data for three years (2019–2021) to model the effects on ET of eight meteorological factors (net solar radiation (Rn), mean temperature (Ta), minimum temperature (Tamin), maximum temperature (Tamax), relative humidity (RH), minimum relative humidity (RHmin), maximum relative humidity (RHmax), and wind speed (V)) using a greenhouse drip irrigated tomato crop ET prediction model (XGBR-ET) that was based on XGBoost regression (XGBR). The model was compared with seven other common regression models (linear regression (LR), support vector regression (SVR), K neighbors regression (KNR), random forest regression (RFR), AdaBoost regression (ABR), bagging regression (BR), and gradient boosting regression (GBR)). The results showed that Rn, Ta, and Tamax were positively correlated with ET, and that Tamin, RH, RHmin, RHmax, and V were negatively correlated with ET. Rn had the greatest correlation with ET (r = 0.89), and V had the least correlation with ET (r = 0.43). The eight models were ordered, in terms of prediction accuracy, XGBR-ET &gt; GBR-ET &gt; SVR-ET &gt; ABR-ET &gt; BR-ET &gt; LR-ET &gt; KNR-ET &gt; RFR-ET. The statistical indicators mean square error (0.032), root mean square error (0.163), mean absolute error (0.132), mean absolute percentage error (4.47%), and coefficient of determination (0.981) of XGBR-ET showed that XGBR-ET modeled daily ET for greenhouse tomatoes well. The parameters of the XGBR-ET model were ablated to show that the order of importance of meteorological factors on XGBR-ET was Rn &gt; RH &gt; RHmin&gt; Tamax&gt; RHmax&gt; Tamin&gt; Ta&gt; V. Selecting Rn, RH, RHmin, Tamax, and Tamin as model input variables using XGBR ensured the prediction accuracy of the model (mean square error 0.047).

Accurate carbon price forecasting is crucial for relevant policy makers and investors. However, due to the non-linearity, uncertainty, and complexity of carbon prices, the current predication models fail to predict carbon prices accurately. In this paper, an advanced deep neural network model named TCN-Seq2Seq is proposed to forecast carbon prices. The novelty of the proposed model focuses on the “sequence to sequence” layout to learn temporal data dependencies using only fully convolutional layers. Being provided with parallel training for fewer parameters, TCN-Seq2Seq forecasting model is more suitable for small carbon price dataset in few-shot learning way.

Particularly, our proposed model achieves forecasting accuracy with the highest DA value (0.9697), the lowest MAPE value (0.0027), and the lowest RMSE value (0.0149), showing superior prediction performance compared with the traditional statistical forecasting models.

However, accurate small green fruit detection, affected by many factors such as the unstructured orchard environment, the morphological diversity of target fruits, and multiple-scale fruits, is still an unsolved challenge, especially for small-scale fruits in the night environment. In this paper, we propose an optimized Retinanet-PVTv2 by introducing the gradient harmonizing mechanism to detect small green apple/begonia fruits in the night environment, namely GHFormer-Net. Specifically, PVTv2-B1 based on Transformer is applied as the backbone network to extract feature information from the global receptive, which breaks the limitation that spatial convolution is utilized to extract information from the local area; Next, with the help of FPN, shallow features and high-level features with rich semantic information are incorporated by lateral connections and a top-down structure to generate multi-scale feature maps; Then, a detector of RetinaNet is applied to detect green fruits. To adapt to small apple/begonia fruits detection in the night environment, a gradient harmonizing classification loss (GHM-R Loss) and a gradient harmonizing regression loss (GHM-R Loss) are introduced to improve RetinaNet-PVTv2.

To avoid downtime and losses, predictive maintenance is one relevant policy that utilizes prior information and domain knowledge to help in scheduling operations and maintenance. Predictive maintenance (PdM) in industrial applications is known to improve the efficiency, lifetime, and reliability of the machines and thereby reducing the maintenance cost.

The arid agriculture region of Thal, Pakistan, is the major chickpea-growing region of the world. It was important to analyze the chickpea growth rate and yield with modern growing technology for better production in the changing climate. This study compared unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Landsat imagery to monitor the crop growth and environmental parameters throughout the growing season. Twelve plots (2 × 2 m) were established in the field to monitor seven environmental parameters (plant height, number of pods and plant density, and final yield) for chickpea crop growth. A UAV drone mounted with Zenmuse X3 camera with four spectral was flown over the chickpea field on a biweekly basis to capture images with a spatial resolution of 1.86 m. The Landsat imagery (30 m spatial resolution) was also obtained, having the same UAV flight date. In spatio-temporal analysis, various vegetation indices, i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), were derived from UAV and Landsat imageries. The environmental impact parameters for crop growth were compared with the estimated final yield of chickpea crop. A coefficient of correlation (r2 = 0.67; p ≤ 0.05) between observed chickpea crop yield and UAV-derived SAVI was significant (p ≤ 0.05). In comparison, a non-significant coefficient (r2 = 0.21; p ≥ 0.05) was found between NDVI derived from Landsat imagery with yield. The chickpea crop yield was analyzed by estimating simple linear regression between NDVI and actual yield of chickpea crop during 30–40 days before the harvesting period. The average difference between actual yield and predicted yield through SAVI-D and NDVI-L was 558.42, 553.12, 556.84 kg/ha, respectively.

This paper focuses on the black soil area of Northeast China, a national strategic grain production base, applying the AquaCrop crop growth model to simulate the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and maize yield from 2000 to 2020 and then forming a reliable FVC optimization dataset based on an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) assimilation algorithm with remote sensing products. Using the random forest model, the regression relationship between FVC and yield was established from the long-term time series data, which is crucial to achieve better yield estimation through the optimized FVC. The major findings include the following: (1) The R2 of the assimilated FVC and maize yield can reach 0.557. (2) When compared with the local statistical yield, our method reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) from 1.164 ton/ha (based on GLASS FVC products) to 1.004 ton/ha (based on the calibrated AquaCrop model) and then to 0.888 ton/ha (the result after assimilation). The above results show that we have proposed a yield estimation method to provide accurate yield estimations by combining data assimilation and machine learning. This study provided deep insights into understanding the variations in FVC and revealed the spatially explicit yield prediction ability from the time series land surface parameters, which has significant potential for optimizing water and soil resource management.

Assessing the impact of climate warming on suitable planting regions, especially the potential northern planting boundaries of these crops, is therefore critical to help guide agricultural policymaking and further maintain food security. In this study, we analyzed the effect of climate warming on the potential northern planting boundaries of three specific crops (winter wheat, spring maize, double and triple rice cropping systems) during two time periods (1961–1990 and 1991–2020) using meteorological data from 2437 national weather stations. Results show that the potential planting boundaries of these crops present a northward movement and a westward expansion during the time period of 1991–2020 under the background of temperature increase compared with the time period of 1961–1990. Moreover, the boundaries of winter wheat and spring maize also show a trend of expansion to high-altitude areas (e.g., the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau). The average moving distance of these crops ranged from 20 km to 300 km. In general, the potential planting boundaries of winter wheat, spring maize, double and triple rice cropping systems changed significantly due to climate warming, and the suitable planting area was increased.

In wastewater treatment plants, adaptive machine learning models can reduce process disruptions and generate savings through optimized operation. Machine learning is also useful when simulating processes that are particularly complex and where the physio-chemical interactions are not well understood, such as biological nutrients removal. Current models in literature only focus on the prediction of a small number of effluent parameters using a direct input-output approach. This paper presents a machine learning ensemble model that combines artificial neural networks, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems, and support vector regression to predict 15 process parameters that include biomass properties, operation parameters, and effluent characteristics. A historical dataset between 2010 and 2020 was used to develop and validate the model. The model features a six-stage modular model structure where each parameter was predicted using a separate model and based on the preceding predicted parameters. The average correlation coefficient, normalized root mean square error, and symmetric mean absolute error of 69%, 0.06%, and 7.5%, respectively. The ensemble approach improved the average prediction accuracy over individual base models by 5%.

A randomized complete block design with three replicates was used to conduct the study in the greenhouse where the amount of irrigation water was at 100 % evapotranspiration 78 L Plant−1 at the end of the season. The nano-silica particle (Si-NP) treatments were Si-NP0 (0 mg kg−1), Si-NP100 (100 mg kg−1), Si-NP200 (200 mg kg−1), Si-NP300 (300 mg kg−1) and Si-NP400 (400 mg kg−1). The results revealed that the Si-NP had a significant effect (p &lt; 0.0001) on the soluble silicon (Si mg kg−1), field capacity (Fc, cm3cm−3), welting point (WP, cm3cm−3), available water (AW, cm3cm−3) and moisture content (θs, cm3cm−3), of the soil after harvesting crop and also, yield (g plant−1) and water use efficiency (WUE, g cm−3). The values of all parameters in the study increased with increasing the rates of silicon-nano particles. The main results can be summarized as follows: An increase of soluble Si4+ in the soil according to the application of Si-NP leads to a rise of all behaviour water properties in the soil such as FC, WP, AW and θs, which caused the increase in cucumber yield and water use efficiency by 178% as compared with Si-NP0. The higher mean values of all properties were found in plants exposed to Si-NP400 treatment. © 2022 The Author(s)","Available water; Cucumis sativus L; Field capacity; Moisture content; Nanotechnology; Silicon nanoparticles; Soluble silicon in soil; Water use efficiency; Welting point",,Article,Scopus

To increase the chaotic performance and to reduce the time-complexity of conventional chaotic neural networks, this paper presents an innovative chaotic architecture called cascade chaotic neural network (CCNN). Cascade chaotic system is inspired by cascade structures in electronic circuits. Cascade structure is based on a combination of two or more one-dimensional chaotic maps. This combination provides a new chaotic map that has more complicated behavior than its grain maps. The fusion of this structure into the network neurons makes the CCNN more capable of confronting nonlinear problems. In the proposed model, cascade chaotic activation function (CCAF) is introduced and applied. Using the CCAF with inherent chaotic features such as increasing variability, ergodicity, maximum entropy, and free saturation zones can be promising to solve or reduce learning problems in conventional AFs without increasing complexity. The complexity does not increase because no parameter is added to the system in use. The required chaos for neural network is generated by the Li oscillator, and then when using the neural network, parameters are considered as constants. Chaotic behavior of the CCNN is investigated through bifurcation diagram. Also, prediction capability of the proposed model is verified through popular benchmark problems. Simulation and analysis demonstrate that in comparison with outstanding chaotic models, the CCNN provides more accurate and robust results in various conditions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Benchmark chaotic time series problem; Bifurcation diagram; Cascade chaotic system; Chaotic maps; Chaotic neural network","Bifurcation (mathematics); Complex networks; Lyapunov methods; Neural networks; Activation functions; Benchmark chaotic time series problem; Bifurcation diagram; Cascade chaotic system; Cascade structures; Chaotic map; Chaotic neural network; Chaotic time series; Chaotics; Human brain; Chaotic systems",Article,Scopus

With the recent advances in deep learning, many supervised learning approaches have been implemented to perform phenotypic trait measurement from images for various crops, but few studies have been conducted to count cotton bolls from field images. Supervised learning models require a vast number of annotated images for training, which has become a bottleneck for machine learning model development. The goal of this study is to develop both fully supervised and weakly supervised deep learning models to segment and count cotton bolls from proximal imagery. A total of 290 RGB images of cotton plants from both potted (indoor and outdoor) and in-field settings were taken by consumer-grade cameras and the raw images were divided into 4350 image tiles for further model training and testing. Two supervised models (Mask R-CNN and S-Count) and two weakly supervised approaches (WS-Count and CountSeg) were compared in terms of boll count accuracy and annotation costs. The results revealed that the weakly supervised counting approaches performed well with RMSE values of 1.826 and 1.284 for WS-Count and CountSeg, respectively, whereas the fully supervised models achieve RMSE values of 1.181 and 1.175 for S-Count and Mask R-CNN, respectively, when the number of bolls in an image patch is less than 10. In terms of data annotation costs, the weakly supervised approaches were at least 10 times more cost efficient than the supervised approach for boll counting. In the future, the deep learning models developed in this study can be extended to other plant organs, such as main stalks, nodes, and primary and secondary branches. Both the supervised and weakly supervised deep learning models for boll counting with low-cost RGB images can be used by cotton breeders, physiologists, and growers alike to improve crop breeding and yield estimation. © 2022 by the authors.

Accurate and timely identification of Anopheles larval habitats and analysis of environmental factors affecting the formation and stability of these locations are very effective in the prevention and spread of malaria. In the absence of sufficient field observations and environmental parameters required in a suitable spatial coverage, remote sensing data can be effective in predicting the habitats of Anopheles mosquitoes. In this article, high-risk depressions that have the potential for Anopheles larval habitats had been identified by fusing a Digital Surface Model (DSM) extracted from very high spatial resolution aerial stereo images with land-use and soil type maps. land-useFinally, the high-risk map of malaria based on the prone larval habitats of Anopheles was created. To evaluate the results, 22 important depressions were identified using field observations in the 1.5 km buffer around Qaleh-Ganj city, Kerman Province, Iran. Of these 22 samples, 14 of them were stable for more than one month at temperatures above 30 °C and the rest were able to store water for three to four weeks. 12 out of 14 samples were consistent with the identified 130 high-risk depressions in the buffer range. Also, 19 of these 22 samples were compatible with the optimal depressions in the buffer range. By comparing the proposed method with previous methods based on data with medium and low spatial resolution or meteorological data, it was concluded that the correct and accurate seasonal and temporary position of Anopheles larval habitats depend on higher spatial resolution of remote sensing data. In addition, this study demonstrated that the use of vegetation and water indices cannot predict the exact location of all habitats of Anopheles. Because many of these habitats were temporary and these indices could not estimate and predict their exact location. The proposed method can be applied to search for suitable larval habitats of Anopheles around local residential areas, where neither medium and low spatial resolution data nor limited field observations can be used. © 2022 The Author(s)","Anopheles larval habitat; Depression; Malaria; Remote sensing","disease prevalence; habitat selection; habitat structure; malaria; mosquito; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; soil type; Iran; Kerman [Iran]",Article,Scopus

Here we compare two deep learning-based strategies for early warning detection of crop stress, using multitemporal imagery throughout the growing season to predict field-scale yield in irrigated rice in eastern Arkansas. Both deep learning strategies showed improvements upon traditional statistical learning approaches including linear regression and gradient boosted decision trees. First, we explicitly accounted for variation across developmental stages using a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that captures both spatial and temporal dimensions of UAV images from multiple time points throughout one growing season. 3D-CNNs achieved low prediction error on the test set, with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 8.8% of the mean yield. For the second strategy, a 2D-CNN, we considered only spatial relationships among pixels for image features acquired during a single flyover. 2D-CNNs trained on images from a single day were most accurate when images were taken during booting stage or later, with RMSE ranging from 7.4 to 8.2% of the mean yield. A primary benefit of convolutional autoencoder-like models (based on analyses of prediction maps and feature importance) is the spatial denoising effect that corrects yield predictions for individual pixels based on the values of vegetation index and thermal features for nearby pixels. Our results highlight the promise of convolutional autoencoders for UAV-based yield prediction in rice.

The variations for the vegetation coverage changes are identified utilizing five meteorological elements (temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, sunshine hour, and ground temperature) in the SVM model. The performance of the SVM model is also evaluated on simulating vegetation coverage anomaly change by comparing with statistical model multiple linear regression (MLR) and partial least squares (PLS)-based models. The symbol agreement rates (SAR) of simulations produced by MLR, PLS, and SVM models are 55%, 57%, and 66%, respectively.

Using the Australian-funded Trees for Food Security (T4FS) project as a case study, we obtained quantitative data from questionnaire interviews with 400 smallholder farmers belonging to four farmer categories in the Mt. Elgon region of Uganda. The categories were: (1) those actively participating in the T4FS project from phase 1 (2014); (2) farmers neighbouring those actively participating in the T4FS project from phase 1; (3) farmers actively participating in the T4FS project from phase 2 (2017) and; (4) farmers living distant and unaware of the T4FS project. Farmer perceptions and knowledge of the impact of trees on farm and their management varied across the farmer categories studied. The intended purpose of trees on farm was perceived differently by the four farmer categories (p < 0.05), which may have implications to their adoption and scaling up. Unlike other farmer categories, the majority of farmers actively participating in the T4FS project from phase 1 perceived planting of trees for shade as not being too much trouble for what it is worth (complexity), and that a garden shaded with trees has more general benefits than an unshaded garden (relative advantage). While 50% of farmers actively participating in the T4FS project from phase 1 indicated that they pruned their tree canopies, tree pruning was mainly driven by the need for fuelwood, rather than the need to reduce tree shade. All the four farmer categories perceived that coffee grown under shade was more likely to be infected by diseases than unshaded coffee, attributing it to poor shade tree management. Managing these trees would otherwise control the negative effects of over shading and prolong the period of intercropping.

Traditionally, some satellite observations can be easily affected by cloudy and rainy weather, thereby generating undesired images. These low-quality images can normally be excluded or reconstructed using the temporal filters for the remote sensing classification in practice. However, temporal filtering can also eliminate some useful information in the temporal trajectory of original images, leading to the uncertain identification of crop types. Meanwhile, the land cover mixtures within a pixel grid can pose a great influence on the performance of temporal filters, with the decrease in the spatial resolution of images. This study aims to comprehensively investigate the impacts of Savitzky-Golay (S-G) and Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS) filter on the crop type mapping over different spatial resolutions using the random forest classifier, Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS, 30 m), and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, 500 m) data. Specifically, six indices of time-series vegetation were selected to identify three crop types (soybeans, corn, and rice) in Heilongjiang Province in China. According to the derived maps of crop type, the temporal filtering posed a greater impact on the spatial distribution of crop classification in the decametric spatial resolution image (HLS) than that in MODIS. The evaluation results showed that the overall accuracy of the crop type maps derived by S-G and HANTS was reduced by 1.73 and 5.17 percentage points, compared with the original observations for decametric resolution images. By contrast, the overall accuracies were 84.73%, 85.51%, and 83.05% using the original, S-G, and HANTS observations over the low-resolution images, respectively, indicating no significant change in the crop type mapping before and after temporal filtering. Compared with the time-series vegetation indices over different crop types, both the intra- and inter-class differences of crop types changed significantly after temporal filtering in the decametric resolution images, indicating some great impacts on the accuracy of crop type mapping. Specifically, the inter-class difference between two similar crop types was incorrectly identified as the inherent noise by the temporal filtering. In this case, the temporal filtering had reduced the difference for the low accuracy of crop type mapping. For instance, the user's accuracies of soybeans and corn were reduced by 4.60 and 8.77 percentage points, respectively, before and after the HANTS filter. The temporal filtering had improved the accuracy of crop type identification (e.g., the user's accuracy of rice was improved after HANTS filter), because the significant intra-class difference of each crop type was further reduced in the time-series vegetation indices, compared with the observations without filtering. In terms of crop type mapping on the low-resolution images (i.e., MODIS), the temporal filtering posed no impacts on the accuracy of crop type identification, particularly for the larger effects of land cover mixtures in the pixel grid. Consequently, there were some impacts of temporal filtering on the performance of crop type mapping over different spatial scales. The finding can provide theoretical references and technical support for the spatial distribution of crop types. © 2022, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The aim of the present study is to model almond nut production based on inputs by employing artificial neural networks (ANNs) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) procedures. To predict the almond nut yield with respect to the energy inputs, several ANN and ANFIS models were developed, evaluated, and compared. Among the several developed ANNs, a network with an architecture of 8-12-1 and a log-sigmoid, and a linear transfer function in the hidden and output layers, respectively, is found to be the best model. In general, both approaches had a good capability for predicting the nut yield. The comparison results revealed that the ANN procedure could predict the nut yield more precisely than the ANFIS models. Furthermore, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in almond orchards are determined where the total GHG emission is estimated to be about 2348.85 kg CO2eq ha−1.

The agricultural sector is one of the most affected by these changes, having to optimise scarce water resources. An important phenomenon within the water cycle is the evaporation from water reservoirs, which implies a considerable amount of water lost during warmer periods of the year. Indeed, evaporation rate forecasting can help farmers grow crops more sustainably by managing water resources more efficiently in the context of precision agriculture. In this work, we expose an interpretable machine learning approach, based on a multivariate decision tree, to forecast the evaporation rate on a daily basis using data from an Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, which is deployed on a real irrigated plot located in Murcia (southeastern Spain). The climate data collected feed the models that provide a forecast of evaporation and a summary of the parameters involved in this process. Finally, the results of the interpretable presented model are validated with the best literature models for evaporation rate prediction, i.e., Artificial Neural Networks, obtaining results very similar to those obtained for them, reaching up to 0.85R2 and 0.6MAE.

We demonstrate these effects using simulation modelling at two contrasting sites supporting Eucalyptus globulus Labill. or Pinus radiata D.Don plantations. The APSIM Eucalyptus and Pinus models simulated plantation growth within 2% of observed growth where the water table was at 4 m depth for eucalypts (height 28 m, MAI 32 m3 ha−1 year−1) and at 23 m for pines (height 37 m, MAI 20 m3 ha−1 year−1). In simulations without an aquifer, observed growth could only be matched using unrealistically high surface soil nitrogen (N) supply, suggesting this is an unlikely mechanism. Simulated aquifer N concentrations, evapotranspiration, and net N mineralization and leaching (emergent properties of modelling) were similar to measured values. These results strengthen the plausibility that aquifer N uptake by plantations could be contributing to tree growth. This hypothesis warrants further research that quantifies these processes at multiple sites. Simulations included growth of herbaceous and tree weed species, and pasture, which demonstrated the utility of the process-based APSIM modelling framework for dynamically simulating carbon, water and N of plantations and other mixed-species systems. © 2022 by the authors.

Inadequate application increases the risk of quality and yield losses as well as environmental pollution. Accurate determination of both crops' water and N supply status is essential for an effective management strategy that couples N and water supply, thus accounting for the water–N interaction. In a field experiment with spinach as model crop, hyperspectral reflectance was measured and related to the relative water content (RWC), nitrogen and chlorophyll (Chl) content of leaves indicating plants' supply status. Three statistical methods were applied to estimate plants’ water and N status by reflectance spectroscopy: i) Published Vegetation Indices (VI) for N and water status, ii) Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling - Partial Least Squares Regression (CARS-PLSR) to identify key wavelengths and to build a simple robust model based on full spectra, and iii) inflection points (IP) based on the first and second derivatives. The best model fit for Chl was obtained for VI REIP and IP1. For N, best results were found for mrNDVI and IP1. The estimation of RWC was not significant. Higher Chl content was found in stressed plants due to smaller and thicker leaves. At full water supply, REIP and IP1 as well as CARS-PLSR differentiated N status levels. In water-deficient plants, VIs and IPs successfully detected water stress levels. The basis for a differentiating nitrogen and water management using spectral data has been established. © 2021 The Authors","Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling (CARS); Fertilization; Irrigation; Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR); VIS-NIR reflectance","Coherent scattering; Crops; Irrigation; Nitrogen fertilizers; Plants (botany); Raman scattering; Reflection; Sampling; Water management; Water supply; Chlorophyll contents; Competitive adaptive reweighted sampling; Fertilisation; Hyperspectral reflectance; Partial least square regression; Relative water content; Vegetation index; VIS-NIR reflectance; Water status; Least squares approximations",Article,Scopus

Structural transformation captures a country’s level of dependence on agriculture, while rural transformation captures the productivity in the agricultural sector. Specifically, the agri-food system and employment transitions accompany country transformations and shape the spatial distribution of populations by influencing where people live, work and eat, all of which closely relate to food system transitions. We create a food systems index (FSI) capturing a rich set of drivers established in the literature. Using country level data from 85 low and middle-income countries (LMIC’s), we analyse the linkages between food system, structural and rural transformations as well as spatial population distributions. We also analyse a large number of policy relevant variables using machine-learning methodology to shed light on patterns related to institutions, female empowerment, infrastructure and health. Our analysis indicates that rural-dominant countries in the lowest FSI group will see their youth populations more than double in the next 30 years, indicating that their food system investments today will affect one third of global youth in the future. Medium FSI countries need to invest more in the semi-rural and peri-urban areas. We find that structural transformation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for desirable food system outcomes. Rural transformation by itself without structural transformation is not enough either. For LMIC’s, broad development interventions such as financial and digital connectivity as well as women’s empowerment loom more important than narrowly focused interventions regarding progress in the food system. © 2021, International Society for Plant Pathology and Springer Nature B.V.","Food policy; Food systems index; Machine learning; Spatial population data; Women’s empowerment","aquaculture industry; empowerment; food industry; food market; food policy; food supply; machine learning; quantitative analysis",Article,Scopus

The earlier the prediction during the growing season the better. Accurate soybean yield prediction is important for germplasm innovation and planting environment factor improvement. But until now, soybean yield has been determined by weight measurement manually after soybean plant harvest which is time-consuming, has high cost and low precision. This paper proposed a soybean yield in-field prediction method based on bean pods and leaves image recognition using a deep learning algorithm combined with a generalized regression neural network (GRNN). A faster region-convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN), feature pyramid network (FPN), single shot multibox detector (SSD), and You Only Look Once (YOLOv3) were employed for bean pods recognition in which recognition precision and speed were 86.2, 89.8, 80.1, 87.4%, and 13 frames per second (FPS), 7 FPS, 24 FPS, and 39 FPS, respectively. Therefore, YOLOv3 was selected considering both recognition precision and speed. For enhancing detection performance, YOLOv3 was improved by changing IoU loss function, using the anchor frame clustering algorithm, and utilizing the partial neural network structure with which recognition precision increased to 90.3%. In order to improve soybean yield prediction precision, leaves were identified and counted, moreover, pods were further classified as single, double, treble, four, and five seeds types by improved YOLOv3 because each type seed weight varies. In addition, soybean seed number prediction models of each soybean planter were built using PLSR, BP, and GRNN with the input of different type pod numbers and leaf numbers with which prediction results were 96.24, 96.97, and 97.5%, respectively. Finally, the soybean yield of each planter was obtained by accumulating the weight of all soybean pod types and the average accuracy was up to 97.43%. The results show that it is feasible to predict the soybean yield of plants in situ with high precision by fusing the number of leaves and different type soybean pods recognized by a deep neural network combined with GRNN which can speed up germplasm innovation and planting environmental factor optimization.

Yield precision maps, an application of precision agriculture, can be used by farmers to address these challenges by reducing input costs and optimizing yield. These maps can be created using machine learning models trained on field data (e.g., imagery data). Although performing satellite-based remote sensing to gather imagery has some advantages, using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)s is favorable over satellite-based approaches due to the higher spatial and temporal resolutions of the imagery. Vegetation indices (VI)s can be computed from the imagery and can represent the state or condition of vegetation. The present work performed yield prediction regression experiments that analyzed the effects of image spatial resolution (satellite vs. UAV) on prediction results, compared and ranked the prediction power of 33 VIs (and 5 raw-bands) over the growing season, and explored the optimal image acquisition date that produced the best prediction results. We gathered yield data and UAV-based multispectral imagery from a Canadian smart farm and trained random forest (RF) and linear regression (LR) machine learning models. High spatial resolution data generally led to better prediction results than lower spatial resolution data, especially for the RF model, where regardless of the VI choice or image acquisition date, good results were obtained. VIs that included the near-infrared and/or red-edge band generally performed better than the red-green-blue (RGB) VIs. The best performing VIs were: simple ratio index (near-infrared (NIR) & red-edge), normalized difference vegetation index with red-edge instead of red, normalized green index, green chlorophyll index, and simple ratio index (NIR & green). When higher spatial resolution imagery was available, optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index and renormalized difference vegetation index also performed well. We found that imagery from the middle of the growing season produced the best prediction results, even for some RGB VIs and raw-bands. © 2022 IEEE.","machine learning; precision agriculture; remote sensing; yield prediction","Antennas; Climate change; Farms; Forestry; Image acquisition; Image resolution; Infrared devices; Machine learning; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation mapping; Water levels; Aerial vehicle; Machine-learning; Multispectral imagery; Near Infrared; Near-infrared; Precision Agriculture; Red edge; Remote-sensing; Vegetation index; Yield prediction; Forecasting",Conference Paper,Scopus

From the three aspects of elevation, slope, and aspect, combined with the BP neural network model of corn biomass, the spatial distribution of corn biomass in the study area is analyzed. The results showed that the average biomass per unit area of maize increased with the increase in altitude below 1000 m. There are relatively more human activities in low altitude areas, which are more active in forestry production. The best planting altitude of corn is 0 ∼ 1000 m. When the altitude is higher than 1000 m, the corn biomass gradually decreases. In terms of slope, if the slope is lower than 15°, the biomass of maize increases with the increase in slope. If the slope is lower than 15°, the biomass of maize decreases gradually with the increase in slope.

Validation of simulated streamflow of ungauged catchments is a challenge in hydrological science due to the non-availability of gauging data. Generally, complex linear and nonlinear mathematical approaches are used to generate regionalized streamflow for ungauged catchments with available observed hydrological data from a neighbouring catchment. Machine learning (ML) is broadly used to model complex nonlinear relationships between different variables.

It has global data coverage and high temporal resolution, which constitute the most attractive features for medium-resolution 3D reconstruction and change detection in remote sensing applications. One shortfall of the PlanetScope images is that they are often captured at very small off-nadir angles to minimize relief differences for 2D time-series image analysis, which is not intended for classic stereo 3D reconstruction due tothe very small base-to-height ratios of stereo pairs. However, considering the abundant PlanetScope images, the multi-view stereo 3D reconstruction approach leveraging a large number of images may drive the possibility of achieving more accurate 3D reconstruction, and consequently, 3D change detection on a global scale. In this paper, a multi-view stereo 3D reconstruction pipeline was adopted to comprehensively evaluate the 3D potential of PlanetScope images by performing accuracy analysis for both 3D reconstruction and change detection in semi-randomly selected regions with ground truth data. Three case studies using the PlanetScope images were performed: (1) a case study on multi-view stereo 3D reconstruction, (2) a case study on 3D change detection of buildings and trees, and (3) a case study on volumetric estimation for natural disaster monitoring. Our experiments showed that the PlanetScope images provided sufficient coverage for multi-view stereo 3D reconstruction given an area of interest. It could achieve a reasonably acceptable accuracy with root-mean-square errors of 4–6 m in our test regions and detect significant 3D changes. The capability of estimating the volumetric changes was also evaluated for the recent avalanche in Chamoli, India, and the estimated volume favorably matched the results from existing studies using data with higher resolution. © 2022 The Author(s).

We focus on corn production as a significant contributor to the economy of the US Midwest. Nitrogen is one of the key nutrients needed to increase production efficiency, but its leaching and loss as nitrate through subsurface flow and agricultural drainage systems poses a threat to water quality. We build a novel two-stage stochastic mixed-integer program to find the annual farm management decisions that maximize the expected farm profit. A decomposition-based solution strategy is suggested to reduce the computational complexity resulting from the predominance of binary variables and complicated constraints. Case study results indicate that farmers may compensate for the additional risks associated with nutrient reduction strategies by increasing the planned nitrogen application rate. Significant financial incentives would be required for farmers to achieve substantial reductions in nitrate loss by fertilizer management alone. The complicated interactions between fertilizer management and crop insurance decisions observed in the numerical study suggest that crop insurance programs can affect water quality by influencing the adoption of environmentally beneficial practices. © Copyright © 2022 “IISE”.","crop insurance; Farm management optimization; fertilizer application; nitrate loss; stochastic programming","Crops; Decision making; Decision theory; Environmental regulations; Fertilizers; Integer programming; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Stochastic systems; Water quality; Crop insurance; Economic risks; Farm management; Farm management optimization; Fertilizer applications; Fertilizer management; Nitrate loss; Optimisations; Optimization under uncertainty; Quality risks; Stochastic programming",Article,Scopus

Using soil samples collected from 88 site-years in commercial fields in New Brunswick, Canada from 2013–2017, this study examined how within-field variation in potato tuber yield was related to soil properties and topographic features. At each of 774 sampling locations, a wide range of soil physical and chemical properties was measured in the lab and topographic features were assessed using a regional digital elevation model. Principal component (PC) analysis identified three PCs, which accounted for 79.1% of the total variation. The PC1 (41.3% of total variance) was dominated by soil texture (i.e., sand, silt) and the quantity and quality of soil organic matter (i.e., soil organic C, particulate organic matter C, and soil C/N ratio). Under rain-fed potato production in New Brunswick, finer soil texture and increased soil organic matter pools are expected to enhance soil water availability and thereby improve yield. The PC2 (22.7% of total variance) was related primarily to parameters associated with soil fertility, and PC3 (15.1% of total variance) was related primarily with concave or convex landforms, which may influence yield through drought or excess water. This study demonstrated the value in using multivariate approaches to identify the factors that control within-field yield variability in the presence of significant regional variation in soil properties and environmental conditions. The findings point to the value of enhancing the quantity and quality of soil organic matter as a key strategy to overcome yield limitations under rain-fed production. © 2021 The Authors.

In the present study, we present an analysis of global cropland area change for the first two decades of the twenty-first century derived from satellite data time-series. We estimate that, in 2019, the cropland area was 1,244 Mha with a corresponding total annual net primary production (NPP) of 5.5 Pg C year−1. From 2003 to 2019, cropland area increased by 9% and cropland NPP by 25%, primarily due to agricultural expansion in Africa and South America. Global cropland expansion accelerated over the past two decades, with a near doubling of the annual expansion rate, most notably in Africa. Half of the new cropland area (49%) replaced natural vegetation and tree cover, indicating a conflict with the sustainability goal of protecting terrestrial ecosystems. From 2003 to 2019, global per-capita cropland area decreased by 10% due to population growth. However, the per-capita annual cropland NPP increased by 3.5% as a result of intensified agricultural land use.

For this study, Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and Leaf area index (LAI) of the crops Maize (Zea mays), Mustard (Brassica), and pink Lentils (Lens esculenta) under different irrigation and fertilizer treatments have been analyzed. In total, rigorous assessment of 25-hyperspectral vegetation indices (VIs) at both leaf and canopy level for chlorophyll content, whereas 7- hyperspectral VIs for LAI at canopy level were computed to investigate the robustness of these VIs for LCC and LAI assessment. Variable importance in projection (VIP) using Partial Least Square regression (PLSR) and coefficient of determination (R2) were computed for all the VIs to extract the most sensitive information for the retrieval of LCC and LAI. As a result, the VIs using the red-edge reflectance bands at 705 and 750 nm were found highly responsive to LAI compared to other wavebands. In contrast, the VIs indices made of green (550 nm), red (670, 690, and 700 nm), and red-edge (705, 750 nm) bands were found highly sensitive to the temporal LCC values of lentils and maize crop beds. In addition, the temporal LCC values of Mustard crop beds’ were found sensitive to the VIs made of green (550 nm), red (670, 690, and 700 nm), and NIR (800 nm) wavebands. The three VIs having high VIP and R2 values were selected as optimum sets of input to build support vector regression models using radial (SVR-Rad), linear (SVR-Li), polynomial (SVR-Poly), Random Forrest Regression (RFR), Partial least square regression (PLSR), and Hybrid neural fuzzy inference system (HyFIS).

The study focused mainly on three fundamental aspects, namely descriptive modelling, predictive modelling, and spatial modelling of expected risks and vulnerability to drought. Thus, out of 417 articles across all studies on drought, 226 articles published from 2010 to 2022 were analyzed to provide a global overview of the current state of knowledge on multivariate drought modelling using the inclusion criteria. The main objective is to review the recent available scientific evidence regarding multivariate drought modelling based on the joint use of geospatial technologies and artificial intelligence. The analysis focused on the different methods used, the choice of algorithms and the most relevant variables depending on whether they are descriptive or predictive models. Criteria such as the skill score, the given game complexity used, and the nature of validation data were considered to draw the main conclusions. The results highlight the very heterogeneous nature of studies on multivariate modelling of agricultural drought, and the very original nature of studies on multivariate modelling of agricultural drought in the recent literature. For future studies, in addition to scientific advances in prospects, case studies and comparative studies appear necessary for an in-depth analysis of the reproducibility and operational applicability of the different approaches proposed for spatial and temporal modelling of agricultural drought. HIGHLIGHTS The components and fundamentals of multivariate modelling of agricultural drought were discussed. The importance of hybrid artificial intelligence models is widely discussed in improving the performance of traditional machine learning models. Quantum machine learning algorithms are weakly explored in multivariate drought modelling. Therefore, future studies should explore this approach. The major challenge of multivariate modelling of drought frequency is mainly related to the difference in the return periods of the different variables (time-shifted and spatially effects). © 2022 The Author(s).

Nano-specific descriptors (size-dependent molecular descriptors and image-based descriptors) were introduced to estimate the behavior of NPs in plants to appropriately represent the wide space of NPs. The results showed that size-dependent molecular descriptors (e.g., E-state and connectivity indices) and image-based descriptors (e.g., extension, area, and minimum ferret diameter) were associated with the behavior of NPs in rice.

Elucidating the responses of crop productivity to drought is essential for informing agricultural management and ensuring food security. Here we used satellite-derived solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data and vegetation indices to evaluate the impacts of the 2012 drought on crop productivity in the U.S. Midwest. We used SIF from the global, OCO-2 based SIF product (GOSIF; 0.05°, 8-day), GOME-2 SIF product (0.5°, monthly), and three MODIS-derived vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, and NIRv). We compared the seasonal cycles and anomalies of SIF and VIs from 2008 to 2018. We also examined to what extent these proxies could capture the variations of gross primary production (GPP) for eddy covariance flux sites. SIF and VIs were able to capture the seasonal cycle in drought and normal years. SIF better captured the photosynthesis changes due to water and heat stresses than vegetation indices. In particular, GOSIF data with the finer spatio-temporal resolution was a good monitor of crop response to drought. Crop yield decreased by 25% in the 2012 drought relative to the multi-year mean, while GOSIF, NDVI, EVI, and NIRv reduced by 22%, 4%, 10%, and 8%, respectively. GOSIF had the strongest relationship with crop yield (R2 = 0.91), followed by NIRv (R2 = 0.89), EVI (R2 = 0.68) and NDVI (R2 = 0.48). Compared to the crop yield data, the mean difference of the yield estimates based on GOSIF, EVI, and NIRv were 379.32, 328.43, and 503.67 kg/ha, respectively.

Permanent grassland represents around 70% of all agricultural land. In comparison with other agroecosystems, grasslands are more sensitive to climate change. The aim of this study was to create deterministic models based on artificial neural networks to identify highly significant factors influencing the yield and digestibility of grassland sward in the climatic conditions of central Poland. The models were based on data from a grassland experiment conducted between 2014 and 2016. Phytophenological data (harvest date and botanical composition of sward) and meteorological data (average temperatures, total rainfall, and total effective temperatures) were used as independent variables, whereas qualitative and quantitative parameters of the feed made from the grassland sward (dry matter digestibility, dry matter yield, and protein yield) were used as dependent variables. Nine deterministic models were proposed Y_G, DIG_G, P_G, Y_GB, DIG_GB, P_GB, Y_GC, DIG_GC, and P_GC, which differed in the input variable and the main factor from the grassland experiment. The analysis of the sensitivity of the neural networks in the models enabled the identification of the independent variables with the greatest influence on the yield of dry matter and protein as well as the digestibility of the dry matter of the first regrowth of grassland sward, taking its diverse botanical composition into account. The results showed that the following factors were the most significant (rank 1): the average daily air temperature, total rainfall, and the percentage of legume plants. This research will be continued on a larger group of factors influencing the output variables and it will involve an attempt to optimise these factors. © 2022 by the authors.

Adaptation to future climate change by breeding climate resilient cultivars is essential. However the precise information as to where, when, and what cultivar traits should be applied to adapt to climate change in the coming decades has not been available. In this study, we developed novel hybrid assessment models by incorporating a process-based crop model and machine learning algorithms based on a large number of cultivars field experiments data. The models were applied to assess the impact of climate change on wheat productivity and to identify the timescale of wheat cultivar adaptation in the major wheat cultivation regions across China. Wheat yield was projected to decrease on average by 6.3% (9.4%) in the 2050 s under RCP 4.5 (8.5), relative to the baseline period (1986–2005), without the CO2 effect. By contrast, it was projected to increase on average by 5.7% (8.1%) in the 2050 s with the CO2 effect, across the regions and cultivar-maturing traits in China. Solar radiation, precipitation, temperature, cultivar-maturing traits, and CO2 are critical factors affecting wheat productivity in the major wheat cultivation regions. About 44% (39%) and 68% (57%) of wheat planting grids would require cultivar renewal before 2050 (2040) under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 emission scenario, respectively, at a medium risk level without the CO2 effect. The cultivars with a long reproductive growth duration, high photosynthetic efficiency and large harvest index would be generally promising although there are specific traits desirable for certain regions. This study developed a novel framework to identify the precise information on where, when, and what cultivar traits should be applied for wheat to adapt to future climate change, helping the stakeholders to cope with climate change timely and precisely. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Agriculture; Climate change impact; Climate resilient cultivars; Ideotypic traits; Machine learning","climate change; crop production; cultivar; local adaptation; machine learning; modeling; wheat; China",Article,Scopus

South America (SA) is one of the main grain and protein producers in the world but the status of DA in the region is unknown. A systematic review and case studies from Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile were conducted to address the following objectives: (1) quantify adoption of existing DA technologies, (2) identify limitations for DA adoption; and (3) summarise existing metrics to benchmark DA benefits. Level of DA adoption was led by Brazil and Argentina followed by Uruguay and at a slower rate, Chile. GPS guidance systems, mapping tools, mobile apps and remote sensing were the most adopted DA technologies in SA. The most reported limitations to adoption were technology cost, lack of training, limited number of companies providing services, and unclear benefits from DA. Across the case studies, there was no clear definition of DA. To mitigate some of these limitations, our findings suggest the need for a DA educational curriculum that can fulfill the demand for job skills such as data processing, analysis and interpretation. Regional efforts are needed to standardise these metrics. This will allow stakeholders to design targeted initiatives to promote DA towards sustainability of food production in the region. © 2022 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

They are vital for identifying a person’s behaviour and mental condition. Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is extracting a speaker’s emotional state from their speech signal. SER is a growing discipline in human–computer interaction, and it has recently attracted more significant interest. This is because there are not so many universal emotions; therefore, any intelligent system with enough computational capacity can educate itself to recognise them. However, the issue is that human speech is immensely diverse, making it difficult to create a single, standardised recipe for detecting hidden emotions. This work attempted to solve this research difficulty by combining a multilingual emotional dataset with building a more generalised and effective model for recognising human emotions. A two-step process was used to develop the model. The first stage involved the extraction of features, and the second stage involved the classification of the features that were extracted. ZCR, RMSE, and the renowned MFC coefficients were retrieved as features. Two proposed models, 1D CNN combined with LSTM and attention and a proprietary 2D CNN architecture, were used for classification. The outcomes demonstrated that the suggested 1D CNN with LSTM and attention performed better than the 2D CNN. For the EMO-DB, SAVEE, ANAD, and BAVED datasets, the model’s accuracy was 96.72%, 97.13%, 96.72%, and 88.39%, respectively. The model beat several earlier efforts on the same datasets, demonstrating the generality and efficacy of recognising multiple emotions from various languages. © 2023 by the author.","1D and 2D Convolution Neural Networks (CNN); ANAD; BAVED datasets; EMO-DB; ensembling techniques; human–computer Interaction; LSTM; SAVEE; speech emotion recognition (SER)","Convolution; Emotion Recognition; Human computer interaction; Long short-term memory; Speech recognition; 1d and 2d convolution neural network; 2-D convolution; ANAD; BAVED dataset; Convolution neural network; EMO-DB; Ensembling technique; LSTM; SAVEE; Speech emotion recognition; Intelligent systems; attention; computer; emotion; human; speech; Attention; Computers; Emotions; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Speech",Article,Scopus

With the power of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), the world has become a global village, where every digital object that prevails in the world is connected to each other with the Internet of Things (IoT). The fast proliferation of IoT-based technology has revolutionized practically every sector, including agriculture, shifting the industry from statistical to quantitative techniques. Such profound transformations are reshaping traditional agricultural practices and generating new possibilities in the face of various challenges. With the opportunities created, farmers are now able to monitor the condition of crops in real time. With the automated IoT solutions, farmers can automate tasks in the farmland, as these solutions are capable of making precise decisions based on underlying challenges and executing actions to overcome such difficulties, alerting farmers in real-time, eventually leading to increased productivity and higher harvest. In this context, we present a cloud-enabled low-cost sensorized IoT platform for real-time monitoring and automating tasks dealing with a tomato plantation in an indoor environment, highlighting the necessity of smart agriculture.

However, when building these AI-based models, identifying the most critical input features from the widely used blast design and explosive parameters is a research gap yet to be fully explored. Therefore, this study was conducted to predict blast-induced noise by proposing a new synergistic model of neighbourhood component analysis (NCA) and AI method. First, the NCA reduced the original input data dimension by selecting the most relevant features. The resulting NCA selected features then served as inputs data for the various AI methods, including support vector machine (SVM), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), generalised regression neural network (GRNN) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). This created the respective hybrid models that merged NCA with AI to form NCA-SVM, NCA-BPNN, NCA-GRNN and NCA-RBFNN. The NCA-AI hybrid models were compared against the traditional single AI models (SVM, BPNN, GRNN and RBFNN) and hybrid models of principal component analysis (PCA) and AI (PCA-SVM, PCA-BPNN, PCA-GRNN and PCA-RBFNN). The models were statistically evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE), scatter index (SI), correlation coefficient (R), coefficient of residual mass (CRM), uncertainty at 95% (U95) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The overall analyses revealed more compelling predictions by merging NCA and AI. However, inter-comparison of the models shows that the NCA-BPNN is the best because it achieved the most extensive R (0.912) and the least RMSE (1.558 dB), SI (0.039), CRM (0.00), U95 (4.334) and BIC (78.4912) values.

Aiming at the damage identification of the SCR, the acceleration time series signals at multiple locations are taken as the damage characteristics. The damage characteristics include spatial information of the measurement point location and time information of the acquisition signal. Therefore, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed to obtain spatial information. Considering the variable period characteristics of the acceleration time series of the SCR, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network is utilized to study these characteristics. However, neither a single CNN nor GRU model can simultaneously obtain temporal and spatial data information. Therefore, by combining a CNN with a GRU, the CNN-GRU model is established. Moreover, the hyperparameters of deep learning models have a significant influence on their performance. Therefore, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied to solve the hyperparameter optimization problem of the CNN-GRU. Thus, the PSO-CNN-GRU (PCG) model is established. Subsequently, an SCR damage identification method based on the PCG model is presented to predict the damage location and degree by SCR acceleration time series. By analyzing the SCR acceleration data, the prediction performances of the PCG model and the PSO optimization capacity are verified. The experimental results indicate that the identification result of the proposed PCG model is better than that of several existing models (CNN, GRU, and CNN-GRU). © 2023 by the authors.","convolutional neural network; damage identification; gated recurrent unit; hyperparameters; particle swarm optimization; steel catenary riser",,Article,Scopus

Yield data from a same study area in 2017, 2018 and 2019, Sentinel 2 images, Random Forest (RF) algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN) and Linear Regression (LR) were used. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the absolute Pearson correlation and coefficient of determination values.

Despite the low spatial resolution in estimating agricultural variables below the canopy, the presence of specific bands such as the red edge, mid infrared and the derived vegetation indices, act as a countermeasure. The results show that the blue band and green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) exhibit greater correlation with yield.

At present, the monitoring of maize tassels mainly depends on manual work, which is very labor intensive and may be biased by human errors. The U-Net model has proved effective for crop segmentation using RGB imagery. However, there has not been a systematic study to test how the accuracy of U-Net model vary when applied to different maize varieties, at different tasseling stages, and on images of different spatial resolutions. Moreover, the capability of U-Net model for monitoring the dynamics of tassel area has not been explored. In this study, the potential of the U-Net model to provide an accurate segmentation of the tassels in complex situations from near-ground RGB images and UAV images were comprehensively studied. The results showed that the segmentation accuracy of U-Net model with Vgg16 as feature extraction network (IoU = 0.71) for tassels at the whole tasseling stages was better than that of U-Net model with MobileNet (IoU = 0.63). The U-Net model with Vgg16 as the feature extraction network maintained a good segmentation accuracy for maize tassels at different tasseling stages (IoU = 0.63–0.76), for different varieties (IoU = 0.65–0.79), and at different resolutions (IoU = 0.57–0.71), which proved the robustness of the model. Changes in the segmented area of tassels from images were basically consistent with the trends observed in the actual area of tassel measured manually. UAV RGB images with resolution of 3.06 mm showed a good segmentation accuracy (IoU = 0.54). In summary, the results showed that the U-Net model has a good segmentation accuracy of maize tassels under various complex situations.

Existing remote sensing-based approaches in the literature rely mainly on the timing and temporal frequency of satellite data acquisition during a growing season to obtain optimal identification feature (OIF) to complete crop mapping. At present, the optimal features for mapping crop types are commonly generated by using different feature selection methods, and thereby are not generic in nature. In this paper, a novel approach based on the OIF knowledge graph is proposed for identification of crop types within the crop growing season. The concept of OIF was proposed based on the one-class classification and optimization theory, which relates a specific crop type to its OIF. The OIF knowledge graph can be created to describe the seasonal trend of OIF in a season. Eventually, the OIF knowledge graphs can be incorporated into the moment-preserving segmentation method to automatically identify crop types within the growing season. To evaluate the performance of the new method, crop mapping was conducted using 2019 Sentinel-2 data in Heilongjiang province, China, and Illinois, USA, respectively. Results demonstrate that integrating the OIF knowledge graph and moment-preserving thresholding method is effective in identifying crop types without ground-truth data. The overall accuracy higher than 90 % (Kappa coefficient greater than 0.90), and the producer's accuracies for corn, soybean, and rice are generally greater than 93 % in Heilongjiang province.

Therefore, machine learning (ML) techniques could help optimize the processes and obtain accurate results for decision-making in the seed storage process. This study aimed to analyze the performance of ML algorithms from variables monitored during seed conditioning (temperature and packaging) and storage time to predict the physical and physiological quality of stored soybean seeds. Data analysis was performed using the Artificial Neural Networks, decision tree algorithms REPTree and M5P, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. In predicting seed quality, the combination of the input variables temperature and storage time for REPTree and Random Forest algorithms outperformed the linear regression, providing higher accuracy indices. Among the most important results, it was observed for apparent specific mass that T + P + ST, T + ST, P + ST, and ST had the highest r means and the lowest MAE means, however, Person's r coefficient for these inputs was 0.63 and the MAE between 9.59 to 10.47. The germination results for inputs T + P + ST and T + ST had the best results (r = 0.65 and r = 0.67, respectively) in the ANN, REPTree, M5P and RF models.

We aim to design a series of forecasting models and find the factors that affect the incidence of TB, thereby improving the accuracy of the incidence prediction. Results: In this paper, we developed a new interpretable prediction system based on the multivariate multi-step Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method. Four accuracy measures are introduced into the system: Root Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Absolute Percentage Error, and symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error. The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and seasonal ARIMA model are established. The multi-step ARIMA–LSTM model is proposed for the first time to examine the performance of each model in the short, medium, and long term, respectively. Compared with the ARIMA model, each error of the multivariate 2-step LSTM model is reduced by 12.92%, 15.94%, 15.97%, and 14.81% in the short term. The 3-step ARIMA–LSTM model achieved excellent performance, with each error decreased to 15.19%, 33.14%, 36.79%, and 29.76% in the medium and long term. We provide the local and global explanation of the multivariate single-step LSTM model in the field of incidence prediction, pioneering. Conclusions: The multivariate 2-step LSTM model is suitable for short-term prediction and obtained a similar performance as previous studies. The 3-step ARIMA–LSTM model is appropriate for medium-to-long-term prediction and outperforms these models. The SHAP results indicate that the five most crucial features are maximum temperature, average relative humidity, local financial budget, monthly sunshine percentage, and sunshine hours. © 2022, The Author(s).","Hybrid forecasting model; Machine learning; Model explanation; Multivariate multi-step LSTM model; SHAP; Tuberculosis","Article; China; environmental temperature; financial management; high temperature; human; humidity; incidence; long short term memory network; machine learning; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; prediction; tuberculosis; forecasting; incidence; statistical model; temperature; tuberculosis; China; Forecasting; Humans; Incidence; Models, Statistical; Temperature; Tuberculosis",Article,Scopus

Using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool, detailed conservation practices (conservation tillage, contour farming, no-tillage, and terracing) are simulated to determine crop yields, sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loss of three crops (winter wheat, irrigated cotton, and pasture) by each land use unit (hydrologic response units) and location in the watershed. An economic model is used to determine the cost-minimizing choice of BMP scenarios for each land-use unit that meets 50%, 75%, and 90% reduction of sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loads and the impact of climate change on the net return to farmers. Results indicate that the effective spatial placement of BMP scenarios is not the same under different climatic conditions. The average optimal net return to farmers ranges from 170.39 to 316.32 $/acre for all the scenarios. The shadow prices vary from 2.36 to 17.78 $/ton/acre of sediment abated. Although individual BMP scenario is effective in reducing sediment loads, combined BMP scenarios achieve higher performance.

Drying temperature and air velocity had remarkable effects on the drying kinetics, color, total phenol content, total flavonoid content, and vitamin C content (VCC) of apple slices. Infrared radiation distance demonstrated similar results, other than for VCC and color. The shortest drying time was obtained at 70 °C, air velocity of 3 m/s and infrared radiation distance of 10 cm. A deep neural network (DNN) was developed, based on 4526 groups of apple slice drying data, and was applied to predict changes in moisture ratio (MR) and dry basis moisture content (DBMC) of apple slices during drying. DNN predicted that the coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.9975 and 1.0000, and the mean absolute error (MAE) was 0.001100 and 0.000127, for MR and DBMC, respectively. Furthermore, DNN obtained the highest R2 and lowest MAE values when compared with multilayer perceptron (MLP) and support vector regression (SVR).

However, the action space is usually composite, composed of multiple sub-action with different functions, and time-varying for practical tasks. The existing sub-actions might be temporarily invalid due to the external environment, while unseen sub-actions can be added to the current system. To solve the robustness and transferability problems in time-varying composite action spaces, we propose a structured cooperative reinforcement learning algorithm based on the centralized critic and decentralized actor framework, called SCORE. We model the single-agent problem with composite action space as a fully cooperative partially observable stochastic game and further employ a graph attention network to capture the dependencies between heterogeneous sub-actions. To promote tighter cooperation between the decomposed heterogeneous agents, SCORE introduces a hierarchical variational autoencoder, which maps the heterogeneous sub-action space into a common latent action space. We also incorporate an implicit credit assignment structure into the SCORE to overcome the multi-agent credit assignment problem in the fully cooperative partially observable stochastic game. Performance experiments on the proof-of-concept task and precision agriculture task show that SCORE has significant advantages in robustness and transferability for time-varying composite action space. © 1979-2012 IEEE.","composite action space; Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning; time-varying action space","Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Combinatorial optimization; E-learning; Learning algorithms; Multi agent systems; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Action spaces; Aerospace electronics; Composite action; Composite action space; Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning; Game; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Reinforcement learnings; Robustness; Task analysis; Time varying; Time-varying action space; Reinforcement learning; article; attention network; autoencoder; decomposition; precision agriculture; proof of concept; reinforcement learning (machine learning); robotics; stochastic model",Article,Scopus

However, farmers face challenges not only to decide the optimal harvesting time but to predict the optimum levels for both forage production and quality. Fortunately, remote sensing technologies can significantly contribute to obtaining production and quality insights, providing scalability, and supporting complex farming decision-making. Therefore, we aim to develop a systematic review of the current scientific literature to identify the current status of research in remote sensing for alfalfa and to evaluate new perspectives for enhancing prediction of both biomass and quality (herein defined as crude protein and fibers) for alfalfa. Twelve papers were included in the database from a total of 198 studies included in the initial screening process.

Based on the longwave TIR instrument (Hyper-CAM), this study designed two experiments to collect HTIR datasets, separate the temperature and emissivity of different vegetation of grassland, and analyze the relationship between the emissivity of vegetation and soil moisture content. First, we collected the HTIR remotely sensed dataset of different kinds of vegetation and used the temperature/emissivity separation algorithm to separate the temperature and emissivity of seven types of vegetation. The temperature and emissivity of these types of vegetation were separated. Then, the absorption characteristics of the emissivity spectral curves of each type of grass were analyzed. The distribution and differences of the temperature and specific emissivity in different parts of these seven grassland vegetation types were quantitatively analyzed, and the relationship between their changes and vegetation leaf moisture and vegetation health status was also analyzed. Second, to monitor the drought of grassland vegetation, a second experiment was designed to measure the changes in the emissivity under different soil water contents. This observation experiment took Artemisia frigida as the research object. From the results of the separation of the temperature and emissivity, we found that the emissivity of Artemisia frigida has significantly changed with the increase in the water content, and the emissivity showed an overall increasing trend. We also quantitatively analyzed the differences in the temperature and specific emissivity between Artemisia frigida and Artemisia subulata Nakai, both belonging to the genus Artemisia, under different water content conditions. The overall waveform characteristics and their similarities and differences at 850–1280 cm−1 were compared and analyzed. The experimental results shows that Hyper-CAM can effectively obtain the emissivity of various types of grassland vegetation as the absorption characteristics of grassland vegetation in the thermal infrared spectral region were quite notable, which shows the significant potential ability of identification and discrimination of different types of grassland vegetation. © 2022 by the authors.","drought monitoring; grassland remote sensing; soil moisture; spectral emissivity; temperature retrieval; water content","Drought; Electromagnetic wave emission; Infrared radiation; Separation; Soil moisture; Spectroscopy; Vegetation; Water content; Absorption characteristics; Drought monitoring; Grassland remote sensing; Grassland vegetation; HyperSpectral; Northwestern China; Remote-sensing; Spectral emissivity; Temperature retrieval; Thermal-infrared; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

In this study, an advanced biomass estimation approach for sugarcane fields is proposed based on multi-source remote sensing data. Since feature interpretability in agricultural data mining is significant, a feature extraction method of deep archetypal analysis (DAA) that has good model interpretability is introduced and aided by principal component analysis (PCA) for feature mining from the multi-mode multispectral and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing data pertaining to sugarcane. In addition, an integrated regression model integrating random forest regression, support vector regression, K-nearest neighbor regression and deep network regression is developed after feature extraction by DAA to precisely predict biomass of sugarcane. In this study, the biomass prediction performance achieved using the proposed integrated learning approach is found to be predominantly better than that achieved by using conventional linear methods in all the time periods of plant growth. Of more significance, according to model interpretability of DAA, only a small set of informative features maintaining their physical meanings (four informative spectral indices and four key LiDAR metrics) can be extracted which eliminates the redundancy of multi-mode data and plays a vital role in accurate biomass prediction. Therefore, the findings in this study provide hands-on experience to planters with indications of the key or informative spectral or LiDAR metrics relevant to the biomass to adjust the corresponding planting management design. © 2022 by the authors.","biomass prediction; deep archetypal analysis; integrated learning; multi-mode remote sensing data","Data mining; Decision trees; Deep learning; Extraction; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Nearest neighbor search; Optical radar; Principal component analysis; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Archetypal analysis; Biomass prediction; Deep archetypal analyse; Integrated learning; Interpretability; Light detection and ranging; Multi-mode remote sensing data; Multimodes; Plantings; Remote sensing data; Biomass",Article,Scopus

The plants are prone to infection at any growth stage, and there are no chemical or cultural controls. Thus, the development of resistant pea cultivars is important. Phenomics technologies to support the selection of resistant cultivars through phenotyping can be valuable. One such approach is to couple imaging technologies with deep learning algorithms that are considered efficient for the assessment of disease resistance across a large number of plant genotypes. In this study, the resistance to ARR was evaluated through a CNN-based assessment of pea root images. The proposed model, DeepARRNet, was designed to classify the pea root images into three classes based on ARR severity scores, namely, resistant, intermediate, and susceptible classes. The dataset consisted of 1581 pea root images with a skewed distribution. Hence, three effective data-balancing techniques were identified to solve the prevalent problem of unbalanced datasets. Random oversampling with image transformations, generative adversarial network (GAN)-based image synthesis, and loss function with class-weighted ratio were implemented during the training process. The result indicated that the classification F1-score was 0.92 ± 0.03 when GAN-synthesized images were added, 0.91 ± 0.04 for random resampling, and 0.88 ± 0.05 when class-weighted loss function was implemented, which was higher than when an unbalanced dataset without these techniques were used (0.83 ± 0.03).

Availability of spatial information at actionable field units is vital for using remote sensing data in agriculture. Crop discrimination and biophysical characterisation sensitive to nutrient levels have not been addressed at the patch level. This work investigates the synergetic application of high-resolution satellite imagery and terrestrial LiDAR point cloud for object-level discrimination and biophysical characterisation of a few crops at different nitrogen (N) levels. To this end, cabbage, eggplant, and tomato at three levels of N were grown on the experimental fields of the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru, India, in 2017. Fusing the multispectral imagery (WorldView-III) and LiDAR point cloud (terrestrial laser scanner) at the feature level, object-level supervised classification and estimation of two critical biophysical parameters (crown area and biomass) were performed using the support vector machine (SVM) and Random Forests (RF) algorithms with reference to different N levels. Results suggest discrimination of vegetable crops with high accuracy (92%), about 20% higher than the individual sensors, from the fused imagery sensitive to N levels. The quality of retrievals indicates a contrasting pattern wherein the accuracy of the crown area is high with the LiDAR point cloud at various N levels. For the biomass, there is no perceptible differentiation of N levels within a crop. The accuracy of crop classification with reference to N levels is similar from both RF and SVM algorithms. However, RF algorithm offered substantially higher classification results when the N status is ignored. In contrast, the quality of biophysical modelling is very high and is similar from both the algorithms. Weather conditions and sub-field level environment-induced variations in the crop growth likely are the factors responsible for the reduced sensitivity of remote sensing data to crop N levels at the patch level. © 2022 IAgrE","Biophysical characterisation; Crown area and biomass; Data fusion; LiDAR point cloud; Precision agriculture; Supervised crop classification","Biomass; Data fusion; Decision trees; Image classification; Nitrogen; Optical radar; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Sensitivity analysis; Support vector machines; Vegetables; Biophysical characterization; Crop classification; Crown area; Crown area and biomass; LiDAR point cloud; Point-clouds; Precision Agriculture; Remote sensing data; Supervised crop classification; Vegetable crops; Crops",Article,Scopus

Despite these improvements, the adoption of such approaches in the domain of satellite imagery is not straightforward. Typical vision datasets used in generative tasks are well-aligned and annotated, and exhibit limited variability. In contrast, satellite imagery exhibits great spatial and spectral variability, wide presence of fine, high-frequency details, while the tedious nature of annotating satellite imagery leads to annotation scarcity - further motivating developments in unsupervised learning. In this light, we present the first pre-trained style- and wavelet-based GAN model1 that can readily synthesize a wide gamut of realistic satellite images in a variety of settings and conditions - while also preserving high-frequency information. Furthermore, we show that by analyzing the intermediate activations of our network, one can discover a multitude of interpretable semantic directions that facilitate the guided synthesis of satellite images in terms of high-level concepts (e.g., urbanization) without using any form of supervision.

In this article, malaria cell segmentation and classification methods are proposed. The malaria cells are segmented using a color-based k-mean clustering approach on the selected number of clusters. After segmentation, deep features are extracted using pre-trained models such as efficient-net-b0 and shuffle-net, and the best features are selected using the Manta-Ray Foraging Optimization (MRFO) method. Two experiments are performed for classification using 10-fold cross-validation, the first experiment is based on the best features selected from the pre-trained models individually, while the second experiment is performed based on the selection of best features from the fusion of extracted features using both pre-trained models. The proposed method provided an accuracy of 99.2% for classification using the linear kernel of the SVM classifier. An empirical study demonstrates that the fused features vector results are better as compared to the individual best-selected features vector and the existing latest methods published so far.

The research was conducted on five varieties of sugarcane, as a way to make a robust approach. Multispectral images were collected every 40 days and the evaluated biometric parameters were: number of tillers (NT), plant height (PH), and stalk diameter (SD). Two ML models were used: multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF). The results showed that models for predicting sugarcane NT, PH, and SD using time series and ML algorithms had accurate and precise predictions.

The Kjeldahl method is the most common approach to measuring sugarcane nitrogen, but it is a laborious, costly, and time-consuming process. Conversely, multispectral satellite imagery can provide timely, cost-effective, and large-scale information on the nitrogen content in sugarcane fields. The current study applied random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR) models to estimate sugarcane leaf nitrogen using vegetation indices and spectral bands of Sentinel-2. In-situ data was taken from 45 farms (1125 ha) in a sugarcane production agro-industrial complex in southwest Iran. The global environmental monitoring index (GEMI), chlorophyll index green (Clgreen), and Sentinel-2 red-edge position index (S2REP) were found to be the most important variables related to sugarcane nitrogen. The coefficient of determination (R2) for RF and SVR was 0.59 and 0.58, respectively, and the corresponding root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.08 and 0.09, respectively. Despite the similar performances of the two models, RF showed higher accuracy; however, to improve the results, the use of multi-temporal data for model calibration is recommended. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Crop growth Monitoring; GEMI index; Red-edge bands; Spatial cross validation","Cost effectiveness; Crops; Decision trees; Mean square error; Random forests; Satellite imagery; Vegetation; Crop growth; Crop growth monitoring; Edge bands; Global environmental monitoring; Global environmental monitoring index index; Growth monitoring; Monitoring index; Red edge; Red-edge band; Spatial cross validations; Nitrogen; environmental monitoring; estimation method; index method; leaf area; model validation; regression analysis; satellite imagery; vegetation type; Iran",Article,Scopus

Hyperspectral imaging can be used to obtain the physiological and biochemical parameters of maize leaves with the advantages of being rapid, non-destructive, and high throughput. This study aims to estimate the multiple amino acid contents in maize leaves using hyperspectral imaging data. Two nitrogen (N) fertilizer experiments were carried out to obtain the hyperspectral images of fresh maize leaves. The partial least squares regression (PLSR) method was used to build the estimation models of various amino acid contents by using the reflectance of all bands, sensitive band range, and sensitive bands. The models were then validated with the independent dataset. The results showed that (1) the spectral reflectance of most amino acids was more sensitive in the range of 400–717.08 nm than other bands. The estimation accuracy was better by using the reflectance of the sensitive band range than that of all bands; (2) the sensitive bands of most amino acids were in the ranges of 505.39–605 nm and 651–714 nm; and (3) among the 24 amino acids, the estimation models of the β-aminobutyric acid, ornithine, citrulline, methionine, and histidine achieved higher accuracy than those of other amino acids, with the R2, relative root mean square error (RE), and relative percent deviation (RPD) of the measured and estimated value of testing samples in the range of 0.84–0.96, 8.79%–19.77%, and 2.58–5.18, respectively.

The conventional method for rice yield-related trait evaluation faces the problems of rice threshing difficulties, measurement process complexity, and low efficiency. To solve these problems, a novel intelligent system, which includes an integrated threshing unit, grain conveyor-imaging units, threshed panicle conveyor-imaging unit, and specialized image analysis software has been proposed to achieve rice yield trait evaluation with high throughput and high accuracy. To improve the threshed panicle detection accuracy, the Region of Interest Align, Convolution Batch normalization activation with Leaky Relu module, Squeeze-and-Excitation unit, and optimal anchor size have been adopted to optimize the Faster-RCNN architecture, termed ‘TPanicle-RCNN,’ and the new model achieved F1 score 0.929 with an increase of 0.044, which was robust to indica and japonica varieties. Additionally, AI cloud computing was adopted, which dramatically reduced the system cost and improved flexibility. To evaluate the system accuracy and efficiency, 504 panicle samples were tested, and the total spikelet measurement error decreased from 11.44 to 2.99% with threshed panicle compensation. The average measuring efficiency was approximately 40 s per sample, which was approximately twenty times more efficient than manual measurement.

Hence, Saffron adulterants is always a challenging issue. It should be noted that traditional methods that are being used to solve this problem, are costly and time-consuming. In this study, for the first time, Saffron adulterants was detected using a deep neural network and RGB photos taken under uncontrolled/unstructured conditions. There were five classes of fake Saffron include mixed saffron stamen and dyed straw, mixed stigma and stamens, dyed orange blossom, Safflower and dyed stamens, and two classes of genuine Saffron consisting of freeze-drying and microwave-drying saffron used to design, develop and optimize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 60% of the images were used to train and optimize the neural network model. For preventing over-training, the number of images used in the training phase increased by applying the augmentation method. The general structure of the model to detect saffron adulterants consisted of multiple convolutional (input layer), pooling layers and fully-connected layers, respectively. In this study, five structures (S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5) were proposed for CNN using Batch Normalization methods. Additionally, this paper compared these five structures with Popular Convolutional Networks consisted of VGG11, ResNet18, ResNet50, Inception V3 and DarkNet53. According to the results, the best configuration was S5 that achieved the accuracy of 99.8% and the cross-entropy loss of 0.019. Although the time process of this structure was 36.26 ms, the shortest time process was 19.38 ms related to the S1. This number was more than 300 ms for Popular CNN.

Compared with complex mechanism models, sampling statistical surveys and empirical models based on multi-source data have better reliability and operability for county-level or city-level yield estimation. Previous studies have proposed many factors related to winter wheat yield, but systematic research on the selection and analysis of multi-source factors is lacking. On the basis of remote sensing, meteorological, and statistical data, this study systematically explored the influence of key-phase growth-environment-landscape features on winter wheat yield estimation at the county-level and determined the best time phase and characteristic parameters. The considered features included crop condition, environmental forcing (e. g., precipitation, light, and temperature), and farmland landscape. The key phases were the key periods of winter wheat yield formation (P1—P5), which were extracted from the NDVI curve of the crop growth process. Random Forest (RF) regression models were developed using different combinations of phases and features to simulate statistical wheat yield data and evaluate the importance of different combinations via an accuracy assessment. The performance of the models built from each layer combination was compared using the Mean Relative Error (MRE), Root Mean-Squared Error (RMSE), Normalized Root Mean-Squared Error (NRMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2). Data on years 2014—2017 were used to build the models, and 2018 data were utilized for validation. Results showed that P2, P3, and P4 resulted in higher accuracy than P1 and P5 in terms of single phases. The model accuracy using multi-phase features was higher than that of using single phases, and the combination of P2 and P4 was the best. Among all the features, crop growth features had the greatest impact on yield estimation accuracy, whereas the addition of environmental forcing factors (e.g., water, light, and temperature) did not significantly improve the accuracy. The addition of farmland landscape features could effectively improve the accuracy of yield estimation. Moreover, five important features (PROP, NDVI_P2, B2_P2, ED, and B1_P4) were selected, and a yield estimation model was established to obtain the county-level yield of winter wheat in Hebei Province. The MRE of wheat yield estimation at the county level in 2018 was as low as 2.85%, and the RMSE, NRMSE, and R2 were 253.25 kg/ha, 4.09%, and 0.83, respectively. Conclusion Multi-phase performance is better than single-phase performance. Combining crop growth features with farmland landscape features (RMSE of 247.79 kg/ha) provides more accurate estimates than using crop growth features alone (RMSE of 295.95 kg/ ha). Furthermore, the RF model produces good yield estimation results.

The ideas of target attraction and obstacle rejection of the artificial potential field method are introduced into the distributed proximal policy optimization algorithm, and the APF-DPPO learning model is established. To solve the range repulsion problem of the artificial potential field method, which affects the optimal driving strategy, this paper proposes a directional penalty function method that combines collision penalty and yaw penalty to convert the range penalty of obstacles into a single directional penalty, and establishes the vehicle motion collision model. Finally, the APF-DPPO learning model is selected to train the driving strategy for the virtual vehicle, and the transfer learning method is selected to verify the comparison experiment. The simulation results show that the completion rate of the virtual vehicle in the obstacle environment that generates penalty feedback is as high as 96.3%, which is 3.8% higher than the completion rate in the environment that does not generate penalty feedback. Under different reward functions, the method in this paper obtains the highest cumulative reward value within 500 s, which improves 69 points compared with the reward function method based on the artificial potential field method, and has higher adaptability and robustness in different environments. The experimental results show that this method can effectively improve the efficiency of autonomous driving strategy learning and control the virtual vehicle for autonomous driving behavior decisions, and provide reliable theoretical and technical support for real vehicles in autonomous driving decision-making. © 2022 by the authors.

To tackle this issue, we propose a novel DenseNet regression model where convolution and pooling layers are replaced by fully connected layers and the original concatenation shortcuts are maintained to reuse the feature. To investigate the effects of depth and input dimensions of the proposed model, careful validations are performed by extensive numerical simulation. The results give an optimal depth (19) and recommend a limited input dimension (under 200). Furthermore, compared with the baseline models, including support vector regression, decision tree regression, and residual regression, our proposed model with the optimal depth performs best. Ultimately, DenseNet regression is applied to predict relative humidity, and the outcome shows a high correlation with observations, which indicates that our model could advance environmental data science. © 2022 by the authors.

Previous studies on guayule have shown a close association between morphological traits or biomass and rubber content. We collected multispectral and RGB-derived Struc-ture-from-motion (SfM) data using an unmanned aircraft system (UAS; drone) to determine if incorporating both high-resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; an indicator of plant health) and canopy height (CH) information could support model predictions of crop produc-tivity. Ground-truth resource allocation in guayule was measured at four elevations (i.e., tiers) along the crop’s vertical profile using both traditional biomass measurement techniques and a novel vol-umetric measurement technique. Multiple linear regression models estimating fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), fresh volume (FV), fresh-weight-density (FWD), and dry-weight-density (DWD) were developed and their performance compared. Of the crop productivity measures considered, a model predicting FWD (i.e., the fresh weight of plant material adjusted by its freshly harvested volume) and incorporating NDVI, CH, NDVI:CH interaction, and tier parameters reported the low-est mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between field measurements and predictions, ranging from 9 to 13%. A reduced FWD model incorporating only NDVI and tier parameters was developed to explore the scalability of model predictions to medium spatial resolutions with Sentinel-2 satellite data.

Primarily, how do we produce more, but in a way that is healthier for the animals, public, and the environment? Implementing a smart agri-systems approach, utilising multiplatform precision technologies, internet of things, data analytics, machine learning, digital twinning and other emerging technologies can support a more informed decision-making and forecasting position that will allow us to move towards greater sustainability in future. If we look to precision agronomy, there are a wide range of technologies available and examples of how digitalisation and integration of platform outputs can lead to advances in understanding the agricultural system and forecasting upcoming events and performance that have hitherto been impossible to achieve. There is much for the livestock sector and animal scientists to learn from the developments of precision technologies and smart agri-system approaches in the arable and horticultural contexts. However, there are several barriers the livestock sector must overcome: (i) the development and implementation of precision livestock farming technologies that can be easily integrated and analysed without the support of a dedicated data analyst in house; (ii) the lack of extensive validation of many developed and available precision livestock farming technologies means that reliability and accuracy are likely to be compromised when applied in commercial practice; (iii) the best smart agri-systems approaches are reliant on large quantities of data from across a wide variety of conditions, but at present the complications of data sharing, commercial sensitivities, data ownership, and permissions make it challenging to obtain or knit together data from different parts of the system into a comprehensive picture; and (iv) the high level of investment needed to develop and scale these technologies is substantial and represents significant risk for companies when a technology is emerging. Using a case study of the National Pig Centre (a flagship pig research facility in the UK) we discuss how a smart agri-systems approach can be applied in practice to investigate alternative future systems for production, and enable monitoring of these systems as a commercial demonstrator site for future pork production. © 2022 The Author(s)","Digital farming; Pork; Precision Livestock Farming; Production; Systems approach","agricultural land; agriculture; animal; livestock; meat; pig; reproducibility; Agriculture; Animals; Farms; Livestock; Meat; Reproducibility of Results; Swine",Article,Scopus

In this study, crop growth was non-destructively monitored based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology. Three irrigation levels (W1, W2 and W3) and four fertilization levels (F3, F2, F1 and F0) were set in this study, and drip irrigation fertilization treatments adopted a complete block design. A correlation analysis was conducted using UAV multispectral image data obtained from 2019 to 2021 and the field-measured leaf nitrogen content (LNC), leaf potassium content (LKC) and leaf phosphorus content (LPC) values; from the results, the vegetation indices (VIs) that were sensitive to LNC, LKC and LPC were determined. By combining spectral indices with partial least squares (PLS), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning machine (ELM) machine-learning algorithms, prediction models were established. Finally, the optimal combinations of spectral variables and machine learning models for predicting LNC, LPC and LKC in each grape growth period were determined. The results showed that: (1) there were high demands for nitrogen during the new shoot growth and flowering periods, potassium was the main nutrient absorbed in the fruit expansion period, and phosphorus was the main nutrient absorbed in the veraison and maturity periods; (2) combining multiple spectral variables with the RF, SVM and ELM models could result in improved LNC, LPC and LKC predictions. The optimal prediction model determination coefficient (R2) derived during the new shoot growth period was above 0.65, and that obtained during the other growth periods was above 0.75. The relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of the above models was below 0.20, and the Willmott consistency index (WIA) was above 0.88.

Advances in computer vision techniques allow for the extraction of various information from remote sensing satellite imagery. This information is crucial in making quantitative and qualitative assessments for monitoring of forest clearing in protected areas for power lines, as well as for environmental analysis, in particular for making assessments of carbon footprint, which is a highly relevant task. Solving these problems requires precise segmentation of the forest mask. Although forest mask extraction from satellite data has been considered previously, no open-access applications are able to provide the high-detailed forest mask. Detailed forest masks are usually obtained using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) that set particular limitations such as cost and inapplicability for vast territories. In this study, we propose a novel neural network-based approach for high-detailed forest mask creation. We implement an object-based augmentation technique for a minimum amount of labeled high-detailed data. Using this augmented data we fine-tune the models, which are trained on a large forest dataset with less precise labeled masks. The provided algorithm is tested for multiple territories in Russia. The F1-score, for small details (such as individual trees) was improved to 0.929 compared to the baseline score of 0.856. The developed model is available in an SAAS platform.

In Indonesia, there are production forests, including teak, pine, sengon, and resin, especially in teak, pine, and sengon forests, soybean cultivation with agroforestry systems has developed. The main obstacle to cultivation in the agroforestry system is low light due to the shade of the tree canopy. It requires efforts: tree spacing, especially between rows, trimming the tree canopy when the canopy is getting tighter, and low light tolerant plant varieties. Soybeans are low-light tolerant plants. The national average soybean production of about 1.5 tons ha-1 can be achieved in teak-based agroforestry systems up to 3-4 years old tree, pine-based up to 3 years old, and sengon-based up to 5 years old. The agroforestry system has the potential as land for the cultivation of organic plants in mitigating the impacts of climate change. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","agroforestry; climate change; soybean; vegetable protein",,Conference Paper,Scopus

Vibration analysis is a powerful tool for monitoring the condition of rotating machinery. Furthermore, vibration signals have the characteristics of time series. Hence, it is necessary to monitor the condition of vibration signal series to avoid any catastrophic failure. To this end, this paper proposes an effective condition monitoring strategy under a hybrid method framework. First, we add variational mode decomposition (VMD) to preprocess the data points listed in a time order into a subseries, namely intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then the framework of the hybrid prediction model, namely the autoregressive moving average (ARMA)-artificial neural network (ANN), is adopted to forecast the IMF series. Next, we select the sensitive modes that contain the prime information of the original signal and that can imply the condition of the machinery. Subsequently, we apply the support vector machine (SVM) classification model to identify the multiple condition patterns based on the multi-domain features extracted from sensitive modes. Finally, the vibration signals from the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) laboratory are utilized to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. The comparison results demonstrate advantages in prediction and condition monitoring. © 2022 by the authors.

In this study, the accuracy of the AquaCrop model in simulating the yield and dry matter of winter wheat under different plant densities and water levels was evaluated. Then using economic-mathematical analysis, the optimum values of plant density and irrigation water were determined. Next, using time-series models, the values of optimum irrigation water and economic yield were forecasted for the next 10 years. Results showed that the accuracy of the AquaCrop model to simulate grain yield and dry matter of winter wheat was very satisfactory. For seasonal rainfall of 289.9 and 394.5 mm (the values related to an occurrence probability of 50 and 80%, respectively), applying optimum irrigation water resulted in a 22.4 and 29.9% decrease in water consumption and 28.9 and 42.7% increase in land area and 47.4 and 50.2% increase in total benefit compared to full irrigation, respectively.

ETc is affected by the by type of plant, its physiological properties, and meteorological parameters. Rapid measurement of these factors facilitates quantification of ETc and enables skilled decision-making for data-driven irrigation. Our main objective was to quantify the performance of different modeling approaches for forecasting seasonal ETc using meteorological and vegetative data (e.g., leaf area) from five consecutive growing seasons (2013–2017) of Vitis vinifera 'Cabernet Sauvignon' vines. Time series of ETc was acquired from water balance from vines grown in drainage lysimeters within the vineyard. ETc forecasts were generated for each season using twelve regression models: six linear and six non-linear multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) models. Each regression model constituted a unique combination of variables, some relying on crop coefficient (Kc) and others based on direct ETc forecasting. The models were trained using data from four growing seasons and compared via measures of coefficient of determination (R2), residual standard deviation, and coefficient of variation. Each model was then tested using ETc forecasts for a fifth growing season, and compared to the measured ETc values using correlation, root mean squared error (RMSE), and normalized RMSE. Finally, a mean-seasonal rolling RMSE with a window of 7 days was used to assess the accuracy of the different models. The results show a clear advantage to using non-linear modeling for ETc forecasting (average RMSE range of 0.81–1.05 vs. 0.64–0.71 mm day−1, respectively). Furthermore, direct forecasting and Kc-based methods yielded similar results, and all models benefited from the incorporation of leaf area data. Similar outcomes were found for the rolling RMSE analysis, with improved model accuracy credited to the inclusion of leaf area, especially early in the season. Our findings confirm that advanced algorithms promote site-specific and location-oriented irrigation management. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Crop evapotranspiration; Leaf area index; Lysimeters; Meteorological variables; Multivariate analysis; Statistical modeling; Vineyards; Vitis vinifera","Crops; Decision making; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Irrigation; Lysimeters; Mean square error; Physiological models; Regression analysis; Soil surveys; Crop evapotranspiration; Growing season; Leaf area; Leaf Area Index; Meteorological variables; Multi variate analysis; Root mean squared errors; Statistic modeling; Vineyard; Vitis vinifera; Multivariant analysis; agricultural modeling; evapotranspiration; growing season; leaf area index; multiple regression; vine; water budget",Article,Scopus

A small plot field experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with winter oat (Avena sativa L.) varieties in Debrecen, Hungary in the 2020/2021 cropping year. Multiple field measurements and aerial surveys were carried out examining the response of oat on Silicon and Sulfur foliar fertilization treatments thereby monitoring their effects on the physiology, production and stress tolerance. Parallel application of in situ (elevation, soil pH, NDVI, SPAD, chlorophyll content) and aerial (NDVI, NDRE) surveys including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provided a diverse source of data for evaluation. Both the oat varieties (88.9%) and the foliar fertilization treatments (87.5%) were correctly classified and clearly separated with the discriminant analysis based on measured data. The Pearson correlation analysis showed a very strong positive connection (r = 0.895–1.00) between the NDVI values measured using a hand-held system and UAV-installed camera, except the third measurement time, where the correlation was weaker (r = 0.70).

However, there are few studies quantitatively predicting the internal thermal and moisture environment of duck houses. In this study, high-accuracy recurrent neural network (RNN) models were used to predict the internal air temperature and relative humidity of mechanically and naturally ventilated duck houses. The models were developed according to the type of duck houses, seasons, and environmental variables by learning the monitoring data of the internal and external environments. The optimal sequence length of learning data for the development of the RNN model was selected as 120 min. As a result of the validation, both air temperature and relative humidity could be accurately predicted within 1% error. In addition, simplified RNN models were additionally developed by learning only from the data of external air temperature, relative humidity, and duck weight, which are relatively easy to acquire at the farms. The accuracy of the simplified RNN models was similar to the basic model for predicting the internal air temperature and relative humidity of duck houses in real time. In the future, for the convergence of information and communications technologies (ICTs) and application of smart farms in duck houses, the RNN models of duck houses developed in this study can be applied to predict and control the internal environments of duck houses using the model predictive control (MPC) technique. © 2022 by the authors.

However, these methods are with heavy-weight architectures in nature, and hence require a higher storage and expensive training operations due to feeding a large number of training parameters. There is a necessity to explore lightweight deep learning models without compromising the classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a lightweight deep learning model using the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model and attention module. First, the convolution features are extracted to capture the high-level object-based information. Second, an attention module is used to capture the interesting semantic information. The convolution and attention modules are then combined together to fuse both the high-level object-based information and the interesting semantic information, which is followed by the fully connected layers and the softmax layer. Evaluation of our proposed method, which leverages transfer learning approach, on three public fruit-related benchmark datasets shows that our proposed method outperforms the four latest deep learning methods with a smaller number of trainable parameters and a superior classification accuracy. Our model has a great potential to be adopted by industries closely related to the fruit growing and retailing or processing chain for automatic fruit identification and classifications in the future.

However, the effects of tree canopy structure on the microenvironment and associated crop yield remain unclear. We set up a field experiment with four tree forms of almonds (Amygdalus communis L.), delayed open-central shape (DC), semicircle small-canopy shape (SC), open-center shape (OC), and high-stem shape (HS), which were intercropped with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) separately. We measured the wheat yields and the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), temperature, humidity, and red/far-red light ratio at various intercropped positions (1 m, 2 m, and 3 m apart from tree line). The results showed that wheat yield and yield components were affected jointly by the tree forms and the intercropping position. Compared with monoculture wheat, the yields of intercropped wheat with DC, SC, OC, and HS were decreased by 63.7%, 18.2%, 35.4%, and 33.0%, respectively. Tree form is largely influential to PAR, red light/far-red light, temperature, and humidity in the intercropped areas. The PAR in the intercropped wheat area was SC > HS/OC > DC, and PAR was increased with the distance from the tree line. PAR correlated significantly with R/FR, mean daily temperature, and relative humidity. PAR measured for wheat at various growth and development stages had significant positive correlations with thousand kernel weight, number of spikes, kernel number per spike, and grain yield. The structural equation model revealed that the yields of wheat were affected primarily by the PAR at the flowering and filling stages, with a contribution of up to 68%. Choosing a proper tree form (i.e., SC) and pruning to increase the trunk height or to remove the center pole is important to increase the quantity of light penetration and thereby increase the potential of wheat grain yields. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Agroforestry management; Light; Microenvironment; Tree form; Triticum aestivum L; Yield","agroforestry; growth and development; intercropping; wheat; China",Article,Scopus

Very-high-resolution remote sensing image sets collected repeatedly throughout a crop growing season are becoming increasingly common. Analytical methods able to learn from both spatial and time dimensions of the data may allow for an improved estimation of crop traits, as well as the effects of genetics and the environment on these traits. Multispectral and geometric time series imagery was collected by UAV on 11 dates, along with ground-truth data, in a field trial of 866 genetically diverse biomass sorghum accessions. We compared the performance of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architectures that used image data from single dates (two spatial dimensions, 2D) versus multiple dates (two spatial dimensions + temporal dimension, 3D) to estimate lodging detection and severity. Lodging was detected with 3D-CNN analysis of time series imagery with 0.88 accuracy, 0.92 precision, and 0.83 recall. This outperformed the best 2D-CNN on a single date with 0.85 accuracy, 0.84 precision, and 0.76 recall. The variation in lodging severity was estimated by the best 3D-CNN analysis with 9.4% mean absolute error (MAE), 11.9% root mean square error (RMSE), and goodness-of-fit (R2) of 0.76. This was a significant improvement over the best 2D-CNN analysis with 11.84% MAE, 14.91% RMSE, and 0.63 R2. The success of the improved 3D-CNN analysis approach depended on the inclusion of “before and after” data, i.e., images collected on dates before and after the lodging event. The integration of geometric and spectral features with 3D-CNN architecture was also key to the improved assessment of lodging severity, which is an important and difficult-to-assess phenomenon in bioenergy feedstocks such as biomass sorghum. This demonstrates that spatio-temporal CNN architectures based on UAV time series imagery have significant potential to enhance plant phenotyping capabilities in crop breeding and precision agriculture applications. © 2022 by the authors.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the feasibility of using deep convolutional neural networks for detecting broadleaf weed seedlings growing in wheat. RESULTS: The object detection neural networks, including CenterNet, Faster R-CNN, TridenNet, VFNet, and You Only Look Once Version 3 (YOLOv3) were insufficient for weed detection in wheat because the recall never exceeded 0.58 in the testing dataset. The image classification neural networks including AlexNet, DenseNet, ResNet, and VGGNet were trained with small (5500 negative and 5500 positive images) or large training datasets (11 000 negative and 11 000 positive images) and three training image sizes (200 × 200, 300 × 300, and 400 × 400 pixels). For the small training dataset, increasing image sizes decreased the F1 scores of AlexNet and VGGNet but generally increased the F1 scores of DenseNet and ResNet. For the large training dataset, no obvious difference was detected between the training image sizes since all neural networks exhibited remarkable classification accuracies with high F1 scores (≥0.96).

However, our predictive understanding of these systems is still limited due to their complexity and uncertainty about how key drivers and their legacy effects influence carbon fluxes. Here, we propose an interpretable Long Short-Term Memory (iLSTM) network for predicting net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and interpreting the influence on the NEE prediction from environmental drivers and their memory effects. We consider five drivers and apply the method to three forest sites in the United States. Besides performing the prediction in each site, we also conduct transfer learning by using the iLSTM model trained in one site to predict at other sites. Results show that the iLSTM model produces good NEE predictions for all three sites and, more importantly, it provides reasonable interpretations on the input driver's importance as well as their temporal importance on the NEE prediction. Additionally, the iLSTM model demonstrates good across-site transferability in terms of both prediction accuracy and interpretability. The transferability can improve the NEE prediction in unobserved forest sites, and the interpretability advances our predictive understanding and guides process-based model development. © 2022 IEEE.","driver importance; Inter-pretable machine learning; Long Short-Term Memory networks; memory effects; net ecosystem CO2 exchange","Brain; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Ecosystems; Forecasting; Forestry; Legacy systems; CO2 exchange; Driver importance; Forest sites; Inter-pretable machine learning; Long short-term memory network; Machine-learning; Memory effects; Memory modeling; Memory network; Net ecosystem CO2 exchange; Long short-term memory",Conference Paper,Scopus

The present study aimed to develop a date tree climber device (DTCD) covering all aspects of safety, ergonomics and efficiency. A primary model of the DTCD was structured and modified based on a review of existing devices, a field investigation and an unstructured interview with 20 farmworkers. Participants rated their comfort, perceived pain and discomfort as well as exertion levels when using the DTCD compared to a traditional device (Parband). In total, eight key elements were suggested for the desired device. More than 60% of the participants reported that the DTCD was comfortable/very comfortable compared to Parband. Additionally, DTCD could significantly reduce the pain and discomfort of the back (p <.001), knees (p =.001) and Ankles/feet (p =.01). However, no significant difference was found between devices when the physical exertion was compared through Borg’s RPE scale and heart rate analysis. The results of regression analysis showed that the DTCD users perceived lower exertion as the body weight increased (β = −0.18, p =.013). The signs of musculoskeletal disorders, pain and discomfort were strongly reduced among DTCD users and safety aspects improved, generally by reducing discomfort and physical exertion. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climbing device; date tree; Ergonomic intervention; plantation",,Article,Scopus

A theory-grounded, normalized measure of systemic risk, R2, is developed and made amenable to empirical analysis through the logit link. The measure is estimated on a large-scale, unit-level corn yield dataset. We find that systemic risk explains less than half of total unit yield variability on average, suggesting that the risk management effectiveness of area yield insurance is low. By relating natural resource endowments with systemic risk, we find that more excessive heat and drought events lead to larger while more excessive precipitation events lead to smaller systemic risk. We then study whether current area yield insurance subsidy rates provide farmers with sufficient subsidy transfers to compensate for the uncovered risk exposure associated with area yield insurance. A new concept, the threshold relative area subsidy rate (TRASR), quantifies a lower bound on the ratio of area yield insurance subsidy rate over individual yield insurance subsidy rate below which risk-averse farmers should always prefer individual yield insurance to area yield insurance. The calibrated TRASR values indicate that current area yield insurance subsidy rates discourage farmers from choosing area yield insurance over individual yield insurance, especially at low area yield insurance coverage levels. We also find that TRASR is positively correlated with systemic risk at the unit-level of analysis, suggesting that farmers who like area yield insurance's risk management features will dislike its transfer implications and vice versa. © 2022 The Authors.

The goal of this work was to develop a new algorithm for early yield prediction in different grapevine varieties using computer vision and machine learning. Vines from six grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) varieties were photographed using a mobile platform in a commercial vineyard at pea-size berry stage. A SegNet architecture was employed to detect the visible berries and canopy features. All features were used to train support vector regression (SVR) models for predicting number of actual berries and yield. Regarding the berries’ detection step, a F1-score average of 0.72 and coefficients of determination (R2) above 0.92 were achieved for all varieties between the number of estimated and the number of actual visible berries. The method yielded average values for root mean squared error (RMSE) of 195 berries, normalized RMSE (NRMSE) of 23.83% and R2 of 0.79 between the number of estimated and the number of actual berries per vine using the leave-one-out cross validation method. In terms of yield forecast, the correlation between the actual yield and its estimated value yielded R2 between 0.54 and 0.87 among different varieties and NRMSE between 16.47% and 39.17% while the global model (including all varieties) had a R2 equal to 0.83 and NRMSE of 29.77%. The number of actual berries and yield per vine can be predicted up to 60 days prior to harvest in several grapevine varieties using the new algorithm. © 2022, The Author(s).","Digital viticulture; Non-invasive sensing technologies; SegNet architecture; Yield estimation",,Article,Scopus

This problem, however, may be handled and treated effectively through early detection. Crop/plant diseases must be identified and prevented as soon as possible to improve yield. Plant disease classification and identification by plant protection professionals through eye observation is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Previously, many researchers used hand-crafted techniques for the detection and classification of diseases. Also, due to a lack of knowledge experts and improper laboratory facilities, classification at an early stage is not possible. In terms of precision agriculture applications, developing effective, rapid, and highly successful computer-aided disease detection systems have become a necessity. A deep learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) technique is used successfully in numerous computer vision tasks such as picture classification, object detection, segmentation, and image analysis for finding the best results. The existing models had been worked on a mixed crop approach and single class dataset with average accuracy. In this paper, the Modified InceptionResNet-V2 (MIR-V2) which is a form of the CNN model is used in conjunction with a transfer learning approach to recognize illnesses in images of tomato leaves. The proposed model is trained on a public dataset and self-collected dataset that includes seven different tomato leaf disease classifications with one healthy leaf. For the evaluation of model performance, different parameters such as dropout, learning rate, batch size, count of epochs, and accuracy are used. The disease classification accuracy rate for the applied models is 98.92% and the F1 score is 97.94%.

Potential Evapotranspiration was estimated by the Thornthwaite method. The model performed good agreement in predicting paddy’s water balance for the period of 2017-18. Also, Projections of the future climate in the Kunshan region, showed that there will be a decrease in the annual precipitation during rice-growing seasons for both Near Future (2021-2060) and Far Future (2061-2099). The DRAINMOD model was utilized to evaluate the impact of such a future decrease in precipitation on ground Water Tables Depth. Compared to the rice-growing season of 2018, DRAINMOD simulations showed that future Water Table Depths will drop by 38% to 40% for both the Near Future and Far Future under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Such future remarkable drop in Water Table Depths may affect rice yield in the study region. The future water balance in the study area was re-simulated after replacing conventional drainage with Controlled Drainage and an increase in the drain spacing. Simulations revealed that practicing Controlled Drainage and an increase in drain spacing mitigated the future drop in Water Table Depths, thus ensuring better soil moisture conditions for rice.

Unaware, young male and female farmers leave the agriculture profession as they perform unsustainable practices. Precision agriculture using the Internet of Things (IoT) is a solution to sustainable agriculture. Extension professionals are at the heart of disseminating agricultural advisory agricultural services in India. The discourse on the IoT is entering the space of extension advisory services (EASs) and social sciences. Thus, the present paper seeks to review the application of IoT in Indian agriculture, its challenges and its effect on EASs. The conceptual framework is drawn from disruptive and surveillance capitalist theories. Design/methodology/approach: Online literature review was conducted on electronic e-book Ebsco, Google scholar, PubMed, Jane, j gate, research4life, springer journal and Mendeley databases for full-text repositories, textbook, thesis, web articles, newspaper articles, reports, blogs for the year 1990 to May 2021 using keywords “IoT application in agriculture,” “emerging technologies in agriculture,” “challenges in IoT application,” “extension advisory services sources of information,” “big data and extension advisory, “IoT and extension advisory in India.” Only publications in the English language were included. Findings: IoT aids progressive farmers and small farmers alike. Drones, robotics, precision irrigation, livestock tracking and crop disease surveillance are examples of IoT applications in agriculture. Only large corporations and governments access IoT, and for them, big data storage is an issue. Privacy and security concerns demand upgrades in IoT systems. Solutions to the convergence of IoT with the cloud will leverage agricultural EASs, resulting in fast computing, precise and proactive up-to-date problem solving. Hence, the need for communication between firms and clients has ceased. Thus, the jobs of extension agents are replaced. Research limitations/implications: The competence of future human extension agents lies in reskilling as a “knowledge broker” of relationships and expertise, as s/he cannot have all multidisciplinary knowledge. Originality/value: Although IoT applications in agriculture are available from a technological standpoint, there remains an awareness gap regarding the impact of IoT applications in agricultural EASs. This study will aid in a better comprehension of IoT applications from current and prospective EASs. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agriculture extension agent; Extension advisory services; India; IoT",,Article,Scopus

Plant diseases can have a devastating influence towards food safety and a considerable loss in the production of agricultural products. Disease identification on the plant is essential for long‐term agriculture sus-tainability. Manually monitoring plant diseases is difficult due to time limitations and the diversity of diseases. In the realm of agricultural inputs, automatic characterization of plant diseases is widely required. Based on performance out of all image‐processing methods, is better suited for solving this task. This work investigates plant diseases in grapevines. Leaf blight, Black rot, stable, and Black measles are the four types of diseases found in grape plants. Several earlier research proposals using machine learning algorithms were created to detect one or two diseases in grape plant leaves; no one offers a complete detection of all four diseases. The photos are taken from the plant village dataset in order to use transfer learning to retrain the EfficientNet B7 deep architecture. Following the transfer learning, the collected features are down‐sampled using a Logistic Regression tech-nique. Finally, the most discriminant traits are identified with the highest constant accuracy of 98.7% using state‐of‐the‐art classifiers after 92 epochs. Based on the simulation findings, an appropriate classifier for this application is also suggested.

However, very few studies were performed to adapt crop models to simulate these systems. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the current capacity of the APSIM Next Generation model to estimate Piatã palisadegrass growth and soil water in different positions in a silvopastoral system with eucalyptus by looking at the impact of modelling belowground and aboveground competition separately. METHODS: A field experiment was conducted from December 2014 to January 2016 in a silvopastoral system with eucalyptus trees arranged in single rows, in East-West orientation, with 15 m between rows and 2 m between trees in the rows. This experiment was conducted under grazing management and rainfed conditions, during 11 growth cycles, with pasture variables, soil moisture and microclimatic conditions assessed at four distances from the eucalyptus north row (0.00 m, 3.75 m, 7.50 m and 11.25 m). APSIM testing was performed in two ways: focusing on belowground competition for soil water and nitrogen, using a multi-root-zone approach, and focusing on competition for solar radiation, using the measured data of solar radiation at each position. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The APSIM-Tropical Pasture model was effective in simulating pasture growth when only competition for solar radiation was considered (R2 from 0.75 to 0.86, Agreement index (d) from 0.88 to 0.96, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) between 0.32 and 0.85). These simulations are promising taking into account the difficulties to simulate pasture growth in silvopastoral systems with grazing; however, in systems with strong belowground competition for soil water and nutrients, this approach has strong limitations. Simulations of pasture growth were not as effective when using the multi-root-zone approach (R2 between 0.57 and 0.87, d between 0.53 and 0.74, and NSE from −5.32 to −1.20), despite reasonable simulations of soil water for the positions between the tree rows (R2 between 0.70 and 0.80, d from 0.91 to 0.94, and NSE between 0.60 and 0.77). In view of these results, improvements should be performed in APSIM to better simulate silvopastoral systems, mainly for solar radiation transmission and tree roots growth and distribution. SIGNIFICANCE: This study allowed identifying the key drivers of competition within the studied environment and to inform where the main efforts should be targeted in building a more effective model for silvopastoral systems. This is important to help model development teams in organising and optimising their efforts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agroforestry; Brachiaria brizantha; Grazing; Solar radiation; Tree-crop interactions; Tropical pasture model","dicotyledon; grass; growth response; simulation; soil water; solar radiation; Eucalyptus; Urochloa brizantha",Article,Scopus

Greenhouses can also help crops resist natural disasters and ensure the stable growth of crops. However, it is highly challenging to carefully control the greenhouse climate. Therefore, the proposal of a greenhouse climate prediction model provides a way to solve this challenge. We focus on the six climatic factors that affect crops growth, including temperature, humidity, illumination, carbon dioxide concentration, soil temperature and soil humidity, and propose a GCP_lstm model for greenhouse climate prediction. The climate change in greenhouse is nonlinear, so we use long short-term memory (LSTM) model to capture the dependence between historical climate data. Moreover, the short-term climate has a greater impact on the future trend of greenhouse climate change. Therefore, we added a 5-min time sliding window through the analysis experiment. In addition, sensors sometimes collect wrong climate data. Based on the existence of abnormal data, our model still has good robustness. We experienced our method on the data sets of three vegetables: tomato, cucumber and pepper. The comparison shows that our method is better than other comparison models. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","climate prediction; greenhouse; LSTM; sliding window","Brain; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Crops; Disasters; Forecasting; Greenhouses; Long short-term memory; Predictive analytics; Vegetables; Carbon dioxide concentrations; Climatic factors; Comparison models; Greenhouse climates; Natural disasters; Short term memory; Time sliding windows; Vegetables and fruits; Climate models",Article,Scopus

Traditional I2I translation methods usually train data in two or more domains together. This requires lots of computation resources. The results are of lower quality, and contain more artifacts. The training process could be unstable when the data in different domains are not balanced, and modal collapse is more likely to happen. In this paper, we propose a new I2I translation method that generates a new model in the target domain via a series of model transformations on a pre-trained StyleGAN2 model in the source domain.

Here we present a study that combines twenty-years of Landsat and MODIS data, climate and weather records, municipality-level crop yield statistics, random forests and linear regression models for mapping crop yield in a multi-temporal, multi-scale modeling framework. The study was conducted for soybean in Brazil. Using a recently developed 30 m resolution, annual (2001–2019) soybean classification map product, we aggregated multi-temporal phenological metrics derived from Landsat and MODIS data over soybean pixels to the municipality scale. We combined phenological metrics with topographic features, long-term climate data, in-season weather data and soil variables as inputs to machine learning models. We trained a multi-year random forests model using yield statistics as reference and subsequently applied linear regression to adjust the biases in the direct output of the random forests model. This model combination achieved the best performance with a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 344 kg/ha (12% relative to long-term mean yield) and an r2 of 0.69, on the basis of 20% withheld test data. The RMSE of the leave-one-year-out model assessment ranged from 259 kg/ha to 816 kg/ha. To eliminate the artifacts caused by the coarse-resolution climate and weather data, we developed multiple models with different categories of input variables. Employing the per-pixel uncertainty estimates of different models, the final soybean yield maps were produced through per-pixel model composition. We applied the models trained on 2001–2019 data to 2020 data and produced a soybean yield map for 2020, demonstrating the predictive capability of trained machine learning models for operational yield mapping in future years. Our research showed that combining satellite, climate and weather data and machine learning could effectively map crop yield at high resolution, providing critical information to understand yield growth, anomaly and food security. © 2022","Climate; Crop yield map; Landsat; MODIS; Random forests; Weather","climate change; crop yield; Landsat; machine learning; mapping method; MODIS; satellite data; soybean; Brazil",Article,Scopus

Advances in crop phenomics, enviromics, together with the other “omics” approaches are paving ways for elucidating the detailed complex biological mechanisms that motivate crop functions in response to environmental trepidations. These “omics” approaches have provided plant researchers with precise tools to evaluate the important agronomic traits for larger-sized germplasm at a reduced time interval in the early growth stages. However, the big data and the complex relationships within impede the understanding of the complex mechanisms behind genes driving the agronomic-trait formations.

The present review will encompass how applications of AI technology, utilized for current breeding practice, assist to solve the problem in high-throughput phenotyping and gene functional analysis, and how advances in AI technologies bring new opportunities for future breeding, to make envirotyping data widely utilized in breeding. Furthermore, in the current breeding methods, linking genotype to phenotype remains a massive challenge and impedes the optimal application of high-throughput field phenotyping, genomics, and enviromics. In this review, we elaborate on how AI will be the preferred tool to increase the accuracy in high-throughput crop phenotyping, genotyping, and envirotyping data; moreover, we explore the developing approaches and challenges for multiomics big computing data integration.

Numerous studies have developed machine vision-based high-throughput phenotyping algorithms and demonstrated that the developed models could accurately detect and count wheat spikes. However, the drawback of previously developed models is their expensive and time-consuming data preparation process. While capturing images of wheat is relatively straightforward, annotating thousands of small wheat spikes in the collected dataset requires immense time and effort. This study, therefore, proposes a novel augmentation algorithm, Automatic Object Level Augmentation (AutoOLA), that can considerably reduce the required number of training samples in Deep Learning (DL) models. In this algorithm, different objects in the wheat images, including the spikes, leaves, stems, and backgrounds, are decoupled and augmented independently based on their augmentation policy. The augmented images are then generated by randomly assembling the augmented objects. In addition, an evolutionary optimization algorithm is used to automatically design the types of transformations and their magnitudes for each decoupled object. The results demonstrated that the proposed AutoOLA technique could improve wheat spike counting performance by up to 60 percent. With only one trainable image, the employed hybrid AutoOLA-DL model can predict the number of wheat spikes in the field with Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values of 2.695, 2.085, and 13.817, respectively. © 2023","Computer vision; Deep learning; High-throughput phenotyping; Object-level augmentation; Optimized augmentation; Wheat spike counting; Yield estimation","Deep learning; Errors; Evolutionary algorithms; Mean square error; Optimization; Plants (botany); Deep learning; Developed model; High-throughput phenotyping; Learning models; Machine-vision; Object-level augmentation; Optimized augmentation; Wheat plants; Wheat spike counting; Yield estimation; Computer vision; algorithm; computer vision; data set; optimization; phenotype; yield",Article,Scopus

We set out to assess the accuracy of within-field soybean yields predicted by two data assimilation methods and to assess these methods’ assimilation efficiency (AE). Yields were estimated by assimilating remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI) data from Sentinel-2 into a soybean crop growth model on a pixel basis. The LAI data was integrated into the model by Ensemble Kalman Filtering (EnKF) or by recalibrating with the Subplex algorithm (recalibration-based). An open-loop setting which only integrates information on the soil layers was used as a baseline scenario for quantifying the AE. We assessed both data assimilation techniques on eight fields (3067 pixels) in the Corn Belt region (Nebraska, Kansas and Kentucky) in the United States. The data set encompassed substantial variation in crop growth conditions: three growing seasons (2018, 2019 and 2020), rainfed and irrigated fields, and early and late planting dates. Ground truth yield acquired from combine monitors was used to validate the yield estimations. Agreement between predicted and observed yield at pixel level was two times higher for both data assimilation methods compared to the open-loop. The root mean square error (RMSE) was 476 kg.ha−1 (RRMSE of 10 %) in the recalibration-based method and 573 kg.ha−1 (RRMSE of 12 %) in the EnKF-based method. For both data assimilation methods, assimilating the LAI improved predictions for 68 % of the pixels. For a further 12 % of pixels, there was no accuracy improvement. For the remaining 20 %, AE was positive for one of the two assimilation methods. The high proportion of pixels with positive AE indicates the potential for overcoming the limitations in applying crop models at high spatial resolution by integrating a crop growth indicator. Assimilating an in-season indicator of crop growth (LAI) into a soybean model made it possible to adjust the simulation pathway, thereby greatly improving the accuracy of the yield estimations at the pixel level. This study elucidates the practical applications of data assimilation strategies for fine-scale within-field crop yield mapping. © 2022 The Authors","Assimilation efficiency; Crop models; Sentinel-2; Soybean; Yield prediction","algorithm; assimilation efficiency; crop yield; data assimilation; data set; leaf area index; resource use; simulation; soybean; spatial resolution; United States",Article,Scopus

Identifying the factors that affecting phytoextraction efficiency has important application value in guiding the efficient remediation of heavy metal contaminated soil. However, it is challenging to identify the critical factors that affect the phytoextraction of heavy metals in soil–hyperaccumulator ecosystems because the current projections on phytoremediation extrapolations are rudimentary at best using simple linear models. Here, machine learning (ML) approaches were used to predict the important factors that affecting phytoextraction efficiency of hyperaccumulators. ML analysis was based on 173 data points with consideration of soil properties, experimental conditions, plant families, low-molecular-weight organic acids from plants, plant genes, and heavy metal properties. Heavy metal properties, especially the metal ion radius, were the most important factors that affect heavy metal accumulation in shoots, and the plant family was the most important factor that affect the bioconcentration factor, metal extraction ratio, and remediation time. Furthermore, the Crassulaceae family had the highest potential as hyperaccumulators for phytoremediation, which was related to the expression of genes encoding heavy metal transporting ATPase (HMA), Metallothioneins (MTL), and natural resistance associated macrophage protein (NRAMP), and also the secretion of malate and threonine.

Water resource management is a specific field of study which deals with the efficient management of water resources towards fulfilling the needs of society and preventing from water-related disasters. Many activities within this domain are getting benefitted with the recent technological advancements. Within many others, computer vision-based solutions have emerged as disruptive technologies to address complex real-world problems within the water resource management domain (e.g., flood detection and mapping, satellite-based water bodies monitoring, monitoring and inspection of hydraulic structures, blockage detection and assessment, drainage inspection and sewer monitoring). However, there are still many aspects within the water resource management domain which can be explored using computer vision technologies. Therefore, it is important to investigate the trends in current research related to these technologies to inform the new researchers in this domain. In this context, this paper presents the bibliometric analysis of the literature from the last two decades where computer vision technologies have been used for addressing problems within the water resource management domain. The analysis is presented in two categories: (a) performance analysis demonstrating highlighted trends in the number of publications, number of citations, top contributing countries, top publishing journals, top contributing institutions and top publishers and (b) science mapping to demonstrate the relation between the bibliographic records based on the co-occurrence of keywords, co-authorship analysis, co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling analysis.

However, what is the most suitable deep learning architecture for high-dimension spatio-temporal representation of remote sensing time series remains unclear. In this study, we theoretically analyzed the different mechanisms of the different deep learning structures, including the commonly used convolutional neural network (CNN), the high-dimension CNN [three-dimensional (3-D) CNN], the recurrent neural network, and the newest vision transformer (ViT), with regard to learning and representing the temporal information for spatio-temporal data. The performance of the different models was comprehensively evaluated on large-scale Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series images covering the whole of Slovenia. First, the 3-D CNN, long short-term memory (LSTM), and ViT, which all have specific structures that preserve temporal information, can effectively extract the spatio-temporal information, with the 3-D CNN and ViT showing the best performance. Second, the performance of the 2-D CNN, in which the temporal information is collapsed, is lower than that of the 3-D CNN, LSTM, and ViT but outperforms the conventional methods. Thirdly,using both optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images performs almost the same as using only optical images, indicating that the information that can be extracted from optical images is sufficient for land-cover classification. However, when optical images are unavailable, SAR imagescan provide satisfactorily classification results. Finally, the modern deep learning methods can effectively overcome the disadvantages in imaging conditions where parts of an image or images of some periods are missing.

The recent development of Sentinel satellites opened new avenues for yield forecasting at field and farm level, thanks to their operational spatial resolution and revisiting time. In this study, we combined remote sensing data (in-season green area index, GAI) and statistical modeling to forecast sunflower yield at field level for a range of cultivars and crop practices over different small production areas and years in southwestern France. From 2014–2016, 359 sunflower fields were monitored throughout the growing season in the ‘Haute-Garonne’ and ‘Gers’ administrative departments (SW France). From the satellite GAI estimates, two variables were calculated: GAImax (maximum GAI, between F1 stage and F1 + 10 days) and GAD (Green Area Duration). Different statistical modeling procedures were tested namely a linear regression (LR), a second degree polynomial regression (PR), a random forest regressor (RF) and a Gaussian process (GP). In each case, the models were tested using either GAD, GAImax or both variables, and each model was trained using in a first time GAD and GAImax obtained with linear interpolation, and in a second time, the same variables computed using the double sigmoid interpolation. In a perspective of yield prediction, GAD was calculated from anthesis to maturity but also from anthesis to 10/07, 20/07, 30/07 and 10/08 using remote sensing data. Sunflower grain yield at maturity was predicted with 10 models differing by their forms and the agronomic variables involved. At individual level, GY was slightly better predicted by models including GAD + GAImax or GAD, while models based only on GAImax were the less accurate. This was consistent with the major importance of post-anthesis radiation interception and senescence dynamics in the development of grain yield in sunflower. Better predictions were achieved in 2014, then in 2015 and finally 2016. However, at the grain catchment area level, PR models including GAD were the most accurate ones with absolute errors ranging from 0.53 to 4.68 q.ha−1 as a function of years.

For the United States (U.S.), the influence of the latter is more pronounced due to the size of the U.S. biofuel industry. Using a global agricultural trade model and different climate change pathways until 2050, we show that global commodity price increases triggered by declining yields due to climate change are dampened by an accelerated increase of U.S. BEV sales, which decrease maize ethanol demand. Accelerated BEV sales also reduce cropland requirements compared to baseline electrification scenarios. The accelerated market share of BEVs also (1) lowers the decrease in caloric intake for maize, rice, and wheat which has important food security implications in the presence of climate change and (2) changes trade relationships. The implications of those findings are that policy discussions surrounding policies to promote BEVs should include lower commodity prices and increased food security that dampen some of the negative effects of climate change.

We find that countries with larger differences in extreme weather stress and synchronous yield variations tend to be trade partners and with higher trade volumes, even after controlling for factors conventionally implemented in international trade models (e.g., production level and trade agreement).

Arable land had the highest proportion of sediment and nutrient loadings into the reach, especially in the 2005–2009 period (conducting afforestation, agricultural expansion, and urbanization) and in the 2010–2014 period (applying crop conversion policy involving a shift from mixed forests to rubber forests). Understanding the watershed characteristics along with the combination of spatial land use, local land-use policies, and agricultural practices will support the implementation of regional land use and water resources management strategies more comprehensively. © 2022 The Authors","Agricultural practices; Hilly areas; Land-use changes; Land-use policies; Water resources management",,Article,Scopus

Since changes in morphological traits to drought and salinity stress are influenced by multiple factors, advanced computational analysis has great potential for computing nonlinear and multivariate data. In this work, the effect of four input variables including GABA concentration, pomegranate cultivars, days of treatment, and drought and salinity stress evaluated to predict and modeling of morphological traits using artificial neural network (ANN) models including multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF). Image processing technique was used to measure the LLI, LWI, and LAI parameters. Among the ANNs applied, the MLP algorithm was chosen as the best model based on the highest accuracy. Furthermore, to predict and estimate the optimal values of input variables for achieving the best morphological parameters, the MLP algorithm was linked to a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). Based on the results of MLP-NSGA-II, the best values of crown diameter (18.42 cm), plant height (151.82 cm), leaf length index (5.67 cm), leaf width index (1.76 cm), and leaf area index (13.82 cm) could be achieved with applying 10.57 mM GABA on ‘Atabaki’ cultivar under control (non-stress) condition after 20.8 days. The results of modeling and optimization can be helpful to predict the morphological responses to drought and salinity conditions. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"4 aminobutyric acid; drought; pomegranate; salinity; Droughts; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid; Neural Networks, Computer; Pomegranate; Salinity",Article,Scopus

We develop a method for accurate, scalable field delineation in smallholder systems. Fields are delineated with state-of-the-art deep learning and watershed segmentation. What is the implication of the main finding? Transfer learning and weak supervision reduce training labels needed by 5× to 10× 10,000 new crop field boundaries are generated in India and publicly released. Crop field boundaries aid in mapping crop types, predicting yields, and delivering field-scale analytics to farmers. Recent years have seen the successful application of deep learning to delineating field boundaries in industrial agricultural systems, but field boundary datasets remain missing in smallholder systems due to (1) small fields that require high resolution satellite imagery to delineate and (2) a lack of ground labels for model training and validation. In this work, we use newly-accessible high-resolution satellite imagery and combine transfer learning with weak supervision to address these challenges in India. Our best model uses 1.5 m resolution Airbus SPOT imagery as input, pre-trains a state-of-the-art neural network on France field boundaries, and fine-tunes on India labels to achieve a median Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.85 in India. When we decouple field delineation from cropland classification, a model trained in France and applied as-is to India Airbus SPOT imagery delineates fields with a mIoU of 0.74. If using 4.8 m resolution PlanetScope imagery instead, high average performance (mIoU > 0.8) is only achievable for fields larger than 1 hectare. Experiments also show that pre-training in France reduces the number of India field labels needed to achieve a given performance level by as much as 10× when datasets are small. These findings suggest our method is a scalable approach for delineating crop fields in regions of the world that currently lack field boundary datasets. We publicly release 10,000 Indian field boundary labels and our delineation model to facilitate the creation of field boundary maps and new methods by the community. © 2022 by the authors.","agriculture; deep learning; field delineation; remote sensing; segmentation; smallholders; transfer learning; weak supervision","Crops; Deep learning; Learning systems; Satellite imagery; Transfer learning; Crop fields; Deep learning; Field boundaries; Field delineation; Remote-sensing; Segmentation; Smallholder; State of the art; Transfer learning; Weak supervision; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

Therefore, knowledge of pasture above-ground canopy features help understand the crop status. This paper finds how to construct machine learning models to predict above-ground canopy features in Brachiaria pasture from ground truth data (GTD) and remote sensing at larger (satellite data on the cloud) and smaller (unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)) scales. First, we used above-ground biomass (AGB) data obtained from Brachiaria to evaluate the relationship between vegetation indices (VIs) with the dry matter (DM). Next, the performance of machine learning algorithms was used for predicting AGB based on VIs obtained from ground truth and satellite and UAV imagery. When comparing more than twenty-five machine learning models using an Auto Machine Learning Python API, the results show that the best algorithms were the Huber with R2 = 0.60, Linear with R2 = 0.54, and Extra Trees with R2 = 0.45 to large scales using satellite. On the other hand, short-scale best regressions are K Neighbors with an R2 of 0.76, Extra Trees with an R2 of 0.75, and Bayesian Ridge with an R2 of 0.70, demonstrating a high potential to predict AGB and DM. This study is the first prediction model approach that assesses the rotational grazing system and pasture above-ground canopy features to predict the quality and quantity of cattle feed to support pasture management in Colombia. © 2022 by the authors.","above-ground biomass; machine learning prediction; precision agriculture; remote sensing; UAV","Antennas; Biomass; Food supply; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Above grounds; Aboveground biomass; Aerial vehicle; Cattle feed; Machine learning models; Machine learning prediction; Machine-learning; Precision Agriculture; Remote-sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Forecasting",Article,Scopus

Lowering the groundwater in natural and man-made slopes can help to mitigate the hazards. Subsurface drainage systems equipped with pumps have traditionally been regarded as a temporary remedy for lowering the groundwater in geosystems, whereas long-term usage of pumping-based techniques is uncommon due to the associated high operational costs in labor and energy. This study investigates the intelligent control of groundwater in slopes enabled by deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a subfield of machine learning for automated decision-making. The purpose is to develop an autonomous geosystem that can minimize the operating cost and enhance the system’s safety without introducing human errors and interventions. To prove the concept, a seepage analysis model was implemented using a partial differential equation solver, FEniCS, to simulate the geosystem (i.e., a slope equipped with a pump and subjected to rainfall events). A Deep Q-Network (i.e., a DRL learning agent) was trained to learn the optimal control policy for regulating the pump’s flow rate. The objective is to enable intermittent control of the pump’s flow rate (i.e., 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the pumping capacity) to keep the groundwater close to the target level during rainfall events and consequently help to prevent slope failure. A comparison of the results with traditional proportional-integral-derivative-controlled and uncontrolled water tables showed that the geosystem integrated with DRL can dynamically adapt its response to diverse weather events by adjusting the pump’s flow rate and improve the adopted control policy by gaining more experience over time. In addition, it was observed that the DRL control helped to mitigate slope failure during rainfall events. © 2022 by the authors.","Deep Q-Network; deep reinforcement learning; intelligent control; landslide; seepage analysis; slope stability analysis","Decision making; Deep learning; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Pumps; Rain; Reinforcement learning; Seepage; Two term control systems; Deep Q-network; Deep reinforcement learning; Energy; Geosystems; Rainfall event; Reinforcement learnings; Seepage analysis; Slope failure; Slope stability analysis; Subsurface drainage system; Landslides; ground water; human; machine learning; Groundwater; Humans; Machine Learning",Article,Scopus

Due to advances in technology, the amount and variety of available data have been increasing over the years. However, compared to other economic sectors, there is not always enough quality data for one particular domain (crops, plantations, plots) to obtain acceptable forecasting results with machine learning algorithms. In this context, transfer learning can help extract knowledge from different but related domains with enough data to transfer it to a target domain with scarce data. This process can overcome forecasting accuracy compared to training models uniquely with data from the target domain. In this work, a novel instance weighting-based transfer learning algorithm is proposed and applied to the phenology forecasting problem. A new metric named DIAFAN is proposed to weight samples from different source domains according to their relationship with the target domain, promoting the diversity of the information and avoiding inconsistent samples. Additionally, a set of validation schemes is specifically designed to ensure fair comparisons in terms of data volume with other benchmark transfer learning algorithms. The proposed algorithm, DIAFAN-TL, is tested with a proposed dataset of 16 plots of olive groves from different places, including information fusion from satellite images, meteorological stations and human field sampling of crop phenology. DIAFAN-TL achieves a remarkable improvement with respect to 15 other well-known transfer learning algorithms and three nontransfer learning scenarios.

Since satellite images have a trade-off in spatial and temporal resolution, spatiotemporal image fusion (STIF) has been applied to construct time-series images at a consistent scale. With the increased availability of high spatial resolution images, it is necessary to develop a new STIF model that can effectively reflect the properties of high spatial resolution satellite images for small-scale crop field monitoring. This paper proposes an advanced STIF model using a single image pair, called high spatial resolution image fusion using object-based weighting (HIFOW), for blending high spatial resolution satellite images. The four-step weighted-function approach of HIFOW includes (1) temporal relationship modeling, (2) object extraction using image segmentation, (3) weighting based on object information, and (4) residual correction to quantify temporal variability between the base and prediction dates and also represent both spectral patterns at the prediction date and spatial details of fine-scale images. The specific procedures tailored for blending fine-scale images are the extraction of object-based change and structural information and their application to weight determination. The potential of HIFOW was evaluated from the experiments on agricultural sites using Sentinel-2 and RapidEye images. HIFOW was compared with three existing STIF models, including the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF), and Fit-FC. Experimental results revealed that the HIFOW prediction could restore detailed spatial patterns within crop fields and clear crop boundaries with less spectral distortion, which was not represented in the prediction results of the other three models. Consequently, HIFOW achieved the best prediction performance in terms of accuracy and structural similarity for all the spectral bands. Other than the reflectance prediction, HIFOW also yielded superior prediction performance for blending normalized difference vegetation index images. These findings indicate that HIFOW could be a potential solution for constructing high spatial resolution time-series images in small-scale croplands. © 2022 by the authors.","crop monitoring; image segmentation; multi-sensor images; resolution",,Article,Scopus

In today’s medical practices, skin cancer detection is a time-consuming procedure that may lead to a patient’s death in later stages. The diagnosis of skin cancer at an earlier stage is crucial for the success rate of complete cure. The efficient detection of skin cancer is a challenging task. Therefore, the numbers of skilful dermatologists around the globe are not enough to deal with today’s healthcare. The huge difference between data from various healthcare sector classes leads to data imbalance problems. Due to data imbalance issues, deep learning models are often trained on one class more than others. This study proposes a novel deep learning-based skin cancer detector using an imbalanced dataset. Data augmentation was used to balance various skin cancer classes to overcome the data imbalance. The Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 dataset was employed, which consists of seven classes of skin lesions. Deep learning models are widely used in disease diagnosis through images. Deep learning-based models (AlexNet, InceptionV3, and RegNetY-320) were employed to classify skin cancer. The proposed framework was also tuned with various combinations of hyperparameters. The results show that RegNetY-320 outperformed InceptionV3 and AlexNet in terms of the accuracy, F1-score, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve both on the imbalanced and balanced datasets. The performance of the proposed framework was better than that of conventional methods. The accuracy, F1-score, and ROC curve value obtained with the proposed framework were 91%, 88.1%, and 0.95, which were significantly better than those of the state-of-the-art method, which achieved 85%, 69.3%, and 0.90, respectively. Our proposed framework may assist in disease identification, which could save lives, reduce unnecessary biopsies, and reduce costs for patients, dermatologists, and healthcare professionals. © 2022 by the authors.","deep learning; disease diagnosis system; healthcare; medical imaging; skin cancer","Article; artificial neural network; cancer classification; classifier; deep learning; dermatologist; diagnostic imaging; human; pattern recognition; residual neural network; skin cancer",Article,Scopus

High spatial and temporal resolution spectral data acquired by multispectral and conventional cameras (or red, green, blue (RGB) sensors) onboard UAVs can be useful for plant water status determination and, as a consequence, for irrigation management. A study in a vineyard located in south-eastern Spain was carried out during the 2018, 2019, and 2020 seasons to assess the potential uses of these techniques. Different water qualities and irrigation application start throughout the growth cycle were imposed. Flights with RGB and multispectral cameras mounted on a UAV were performed throughout the growth cycle, and orthoimages were generated. These orthoimages were segmented to include only vegetation and calculate the green canopy cover (GCC). The stem water potential was measured, and the water stress integral (Sψ) was obtained during each irrigation season. Multiple linear regression techniques and artificial neural networks (ANNs) models with multispectral and RGB bands, as well as GCC, as inputs, were trained and tested to simulate the Sψ. The results showed that the information in the visible domain was highly related to the Sψ in the 2018 season. For all the other years and combinations of years, multispectral ANNs performed slightly better. Differences in the spatial resolution and radiometric quality of the RGB and multispectral geomatic products explain the good model performances with each type of data. Additionally, RGB cameras cost less and are easier to use than multispectral cameras, and RGB images are simpler to process than multispectral images. Therefore, RGB sensors are a good option for use in predicting entire vineyard water status. In any case, field punctual measurements are still required to generate a general model to estimate the water status in any season and vineyard. © 2022 by the authors.","ANN; machine learning; multispectral images; RGB images; UAV; vineyard; water stress",,Article,Scopus

Assessing climate change impacts on the main staple food crops is essential to ensure food security. This study aims to assess climate change impacts on millet and sorghum in Niakhar and Toubacouta, two locations in the Senegalese groundnut basin. Field experiment and climate data from RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 greenhouse gas concentration pathways were used to simulate future crop yield and growth cycle length. For each crop, two varieties were considered, a short (90 days) and a long (120 days) maturation cycle. Projections made using the SARRA–O model showed a downward trend of crop yield for all considered varieties and scenarios. These results were, however, more pronounced for the short-cycle variety. In addition, the short-cycle variety showed greater variability in yield trends with larger confidence intervals. In Niakhar, millet and sorghum yield loss for short duration is estimated around 30% by 2050, while the long-cycle variety yield gap was less than 20% compared to the reference period yield (1976–2005). Millet and sorghum yield reduction by 2050 is less pronounced in Toubacouta with around 20%. A slight relationship was inferred between rainfall and yield change, whereas a significant negative linear relationship was inferred between temperature and yield change. The future impact of climate change on these cereals would be mainly a loss of yield induced by rising temperatures. Thus, a thorough consideration of temperature effects will be essential for better adapting cereal production to future climatic conditions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Crop yields; Millet; Senegal; Sorghum",,Article,Scopus

In this study, we evaluated the role of Si in regulating the salt stress tolerance of cotton by analyzing the induced morpho-physiological changes. A hydroponic experiment was conducted by using contrasting salt-tolerant cotton genotypes (sensitive Z0102; tolerant Z9807) and four treatments (CK, control; CKSi, 0.4 mM Si; NaCl, 150 mM NaCl; NaClSi, 150 mM NaCl+0.4 mM Si). The results showed that Si significantly enhanced the net photosynthesis rate and improved the growth of cotton seedling under salt stress in both salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant genotypes. Exogenous Si significantly reduced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content in salt-stressed cotton. In addition, the application of Si up-regulated the expression of CAT1, SODCC and POD, and significantly enhanced the antioxidant enzymatic activities, such as catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD), of the salt-stressed cotton seedlings. Further, Si addition protected the integrity of the chloroplast ultrastructure, including key enzymes in photosynthesis such as ferredoxin-NADP reeducates (FNR), ATP synthase (Mg2+Ca2+-ATPase) and ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO), and the structure and function of the photosynthetic apparatus PSII from salt stress. Moreover, Si significantly increased the effective stomatal density and stomatal aperture in the salt-stressed cotton seedlings. Taken together, Si could likely ameliorate adverse effects of salt stress on cotton by improving the ROS scavenging ability and photosynthetic capacity. © 2022 by the authors.","antioxidant enzymes; chloroplast ultrastructure; photosynthetic performance; salinity; silicon",,Article,Scopus

Then, we infer the posterior sets of model-simulated time-series LAI and the final yield of winter wheat with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for each meteorological data grid of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis (v5ERA5). Finally, we estimate the winter wheat yield at the spatial resolution of 10 m by combining Sentinel-2 LAI and the WOFOST model in Hengshui, the prefecture-level city of Hebei province of China. The results show that the proposed framework can estimate the winter wheat yield with a coefficient of determination R2 equal to 0.29 and mean absolute percentage error MAPE equal to 7.20% compared to within-field measurements.

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of an AquaCrop model for maize growth simulation under different soil conditions (humic acid (HA) and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)) and dosages and different levels of irrigation in the Shandong coastal saline–alkali area, China, and to optimize the amount of irrigation. Three years of experiments were carried out in the growing season of maize (Ludan 510) in 2019, 2020, and 2021. The dosages of HA were 5, 15, 25, and 35 g/m2, the dosages of CMC were 1, 2, 3, and 5 g/m2, and the levels of irrigation from 2019 to 2021 were all 120 mm. The model was calibrated with data from 2019, and the model was verified with data from 2020 to 2021, according to the recommended corn parameters in the AquaCrop model manual. The results showed that the model had a good simulation effect on canopy coverage, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of less than 15.2%, and the simulated aboveground biomass and yield were generally low. The simulated value of soil water content was generally high, with some treatments having errors of more than 15.0%. The simulation effect of irrigated maize from 2019 to 2020 was better than maize in 2021. The simulation effect of HA was better than that of CMC, while the simulation effect of a low-gradient modifier was better than that of high-gradient conditioner when compared with CMC. In conclusion, the AquaCrop model could be a viable method for predicting maize development under different soil conditioners in this area. The suitable levels of irrigation under HA and CMC treatments were 47.0–65.9 mm and 61.0–92.4 mm, respectively, according to the principle of high yield and water use efficiency. The results provided a reference for optimizing the drip irrigation of maize under the application of soil conditioners in coastal saline–alkali areas. © 2022 by the authors.

In this study, the ability of the DRAINMOD model to predict water table depth (WTD) in clayey soil was evaluated using measured field data from the 2019 and 2020 canola-growing seasons in Arborg, Manitoba, Canada. Statistical analysis and graphical plots showed close agreement between the measured and simulated WTD with an overall coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean average error (MAE) and mean bias error (MBE) of 0.93, 9.84 cm, 7.06 cm and −0.13 cm, respectively. Since the model simulation was deemed satisfactory, the model was run with 30-year historical climate data to assess the impacts of different drain spacing on canola yield. Simulation results showed that the average surface runoff increased while average drainage and relative canola yield decreased as drain spacing increased. The simulation results suggest that long-term average yield would be maximized by close drain spacing ≤ 15 m. Economic analysis showed that 10 m drain spacing would maximize the return on investment. The need for long-term simulations to develop appropriate site-specific water management strategies is demonstrated. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","drainage modelling; southern Manitoba; tile drainage; water management; yield response",,Article,Scopus

In 2019, chronically malnourished people numbered nearly 240 million, or 20% of the population in SSA. Globally, numerous efforts have been made to anticipate potential droughts, crop conditions, and food shortages in order to improve early warning and risk management for food insecurity. To support this goal, we develop an Earth Observation (EO) and machine-learning-based operational, subnational maize yield forecast system and evaluate its out-of-sample forecast skills during the growing seasons for Kenya, Somalia, Malawi, and Burkina Faso. In general, forecast skills improve substantially during the vegetative growth period (VP) and gradually during the reproductive development period (RP). Thus, mid-season assessment can provide effective early warning months before harvest. Skillful forecasts (Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) > 0.6 and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) < 20%) appear approximately two dekads after the VP; for example, skillful forecasts appear in May in Kenya and Somalia, January in Malawi, and July in Burkina Faso. During model development, effective EO features are also identified, such as precipitation and available water during VP, and dry days and extreme temperatures in early VP. Compared to monthly standard EO features, sub-monthly (dekadal), non-standard, and serial EO features significantly improve forecast skills by ＋ 0.3 NSE and -10% of MAPE, demonstrating the ability to precisely and effectively capture favorable or detrimental crop development conditions. Finally, skillful forecasts and practical utility are demonstrated in the recent normal and dry years in each region. Overall, the developed yield forecasting system can provide skillful predictions during the growing season, supporting regional and international agricultural decision-making processes, including informing food-security planning and management, thereby helping to mitigate food shortages caused by unfavorable climate conditions. © 2022 The Author(s)","Earth observation; Food security; Machine learning; Maize yield; Operational forecast; Sub-Saharan Africa",,Article,Scopus

The goal of this work was to estimate the number of actual berries per grapevine using computer vision and deep learning in commercial vineyards. Images from the visible range (RGB) were acquired from a set of 96 grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.) at pea-size berry stage using a red, green and blue camera (RGB). At harvest, the number of berries and per vine was manually assessed as the ground-truth values. The algorithm involved computer vision to detect berries in the images and to extract canopy features, in order to gain information about canopy occlusion. These were used by the machine learning regression models built to estimate the number of actual berries per vine. A SegNet architecture was used to segment individual berries and several canopy related features. Four datasets were created combining the number of estimated visible berries and different canopy features. Three different regression models were tested on the four datasets. The best results were achieved with support vector regression (SVR) on a dataset including six canopy features. This method yielded a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 205 berries, a normalised root mean squared error (NRMSE) of 24.99% and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.83 between the number of estimated and the number of actual berries per vine.

Finding rare diversity requires a deep understanding of biological interactions between the genetic makeup of one genotype and its environmental conditions. Most modern breeding programs still rely on linear regression models to solve this problem, generalizing the complex genotype by phenotype interactions through manually constructed linear features. However, the identification of positive alleles vs. background can be addressed using deep learning approaches that have the capacity to learn complex nonlinear functions for the inputs. Machine learning (ML) is an artificial intelligence (AI) approach involving a range of algorithms to learn from input data sets and predict outcomes in other related samples. This paper describes a variety of techniques that include supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms to improve our understanding of nonlinear interactions from plant breeding data sets. Feature selection (FS) methods are combined with linear and nonlinear predictors and compared to traditional prediction methods used in plant breeding. Recent advances in ML allowed the construction of complex models that have the capacity to better differentiate between positive alleles and the genetic background. Using real plant breeding program data, we show that ML methods have the ability to outperform current approaches, increase prediction accuracies, decrease the computing time drastically, and improve the detection of important alleles involved in qualitative or quantitative traits.

Few tools or soil tests exist to help managers guide N fertilizer decisions. Turf growth prediction models have the potential to be useful, but the lone turfgrass growth prediction model only takes into account temperature, limiting its accuracy. This study investigated the ability of a machine learning (ML)-based turf growth model using the random forest (RF) algorithm (ML-RF model) to improve creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) putting green management by estimating short-term clipping yield. This method was compared against three alternative N application strategies including (1) PACE Turf growth potential (GP) model, (2) an experience-based method for applying N fertilizer (experience-based method), and (3) the experience-based method guided by a vegetative index, normalized difference red edge (NDRE)-based method. The ML-RF model was built based on a set of variables including 7-day weather, evapotranspiration (ET), traffic intensity, soil moisture content, N fertilization rate, NDRE, and root zone type. The field experiment was conducted on two sand-based research greens in 2020 and 2021. The cumulative applied N fertilizer was 281 kg ha−1 for the PACE Turf GP model, 190 kg ha−1 for the experience-based method, 140 kg ha−1 for the ML-RF model, and around 75 kg ha−1 NDRE-based method. ML-RF model and NDRE-based method were able to provide customized N fertilization recommendations on different root zones. The methods resulted in different mean turfgrass qualities and NDRE. From highest to lowest, they were PACE Turf GP model, experience-based, ML-RF model, and NDRE-based method, and the first three methods produced turfgrass quality over 7 (on a scale from 1 to 9) and NDRE value over 0.30. N fertilization guided by the ML-RF model resulted in a moderate amount of fertilizer applied and acceptable turfgrass performance characteristics. This application strategy is based on the N cycle and has the potential to assist turfgrass managers in making N fertilization decisions for creeping bentgrass putting greens.

Here we assess the WUE of maize in the Hetao Irrigation District, which is a representative irrigation district in the arid region of Northwest China.

Validation results show that the adopted phenological-based vegetation classifier performed well in mapping the spatial distributions and inter-annual variations of maize planting, with a kappa coefficient of 0.86. In addition, the ET model based on the hybrid dual-source scheme and trapezoid framework also obtained high accuracy in spatiotemporal ET mapping, with an RMSE of 0.52 mm/day at the site scale and 26.21 mm/year during the maize growing season (April–October) at the regional scale. Further, the adopted crop water production function showed high accuracy in estimating the maize yield, with a mean relative error of only 4.3%. Using the estimated ET, transpiration, and yield of maize, the mean maize WUE based on ET and transpiration in the study region were1.94 kg/m3 and 3.06 kg/m3, respectively.

Vegetation index (VI) easily obtained by proximal remote sensing has been used as a non-destructive and high-throughput way in crop monitoring, especially in chlorophyll estimation. However, the estimated results of the field chlorophyll content by VIs always face challenges from soil background inhibition and estimation stability under the dynamic changes of vegetation biomass. Thus, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based chlorophyll content estimation was conducted by evaluating VI responses under different crop coverages. An analysis was conducted on 36 VIs under different crop coverage conditions to explore their response differences and robustness for chlorophyll estimation. This work focused on the three kinds of VIs named simple vegetation index, modified vegetation index, and functional vegetation index. In 2020, at the experimental station of Dryland Farming Institute of Hebei Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, UAV carrying multispectral sensor was used to collect visible and near-infrared images of the canopy at the jointing stage of maize under six fertilization levels to obtain VIs. After the UAV fled, ground calibration and sample collection were performed simultaneously, and chlorophyll content was measured. For data processing, correlation coefficient method (CCM) and maximal information coefficient (MIC) were first used to analyze the correlation response characteristics of VIs and chlorophyll content under three different coverage levels. The results showed that when the level of canopy coverage was increased, the linear correlation between VIs and chlorophyll content was substantially reduced. The MIC response indicating linear and non-linear combination relationship was more robust. In addition, the VIs obtained by UAV had a significant linear correlation with maize canopy chlorophyll under low (0.05–0.35) and medium (0.35–0.48) coverage, but an obvious non-linear correlation under high (0.48–0.75) coverage. Chlorophyll-sensitive parameters were then screened based on methods of CCM, MIC, and random frog method (RFM), respectively. Partial least squares regression (PLS) and random forest (RF) algorithms were used to establish the maize canopy chlorophyll content detection models. The findings showed that when Green minus red vegetation index (GMR), Red light normalized value (NRI), Normalized difference red edge (NDRE), Modified simple ratio with red edge (MSRREG), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized red green difference vegetation index (NDIg), Normalized red blue difference vegetation index (NDIb), Soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), Optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index with red edge (OSAVIREG), Soil-atmospherically resistant vegetation index (SARVI) were selected based on RFM as the optimal spectral variables, the chlorophyll content detection model constructed based on PLS had the least numbers of characteristic variables and the best model accuracy.

However, obtaining complete time-series remote sensing images during the growing season is challenging due to cloud contamination. Hence, given time-series multispectral data, it is important to impute missing data and accurately classify crops. A novel Imputation-BiLSTM model (Im-BiLSTM) was developed based on Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory network (BiLSTM) to jointly perform missing data imputation and crop classification. The Im-BiLSTM model regards missing data as network variables, which are efficiently updated during backpropagation. Im-BiLSTM treats the interaction between imputation and classification tasks, reducing the error and uncertainty caused by the separation operation of imputation to classification. Furthermore, we improved the interpretability of the Im-BiLSTM model by evaluating the importance of input features and visualizing hidden state units. In Shawan County, Xinjiang, China, we acquired a total of 10 Sentinel-2A images from April to October 2016, of which 3 images lost partial data due to cloud cover. The Im-BiLSTM model was applied to incomplete time-series data containing 10 time-steps for pixel-level crop classification, and the BiLSTM model was constructed based on cloud-free images for comparison. The performance of the proposed model was tested in four different cases of images missing and missing rates. The results showed that the classification of the Im-BiLSTM model outperformed the BiLSTM model, the overall accuracy was improved by a maximum of 4.2%, and the F1-scores of spring corn and tomato was improved by a maximum of 16.1% and 21.4%, respectively. Therefore, the Im-BiLSTM model can effectively improve classification performance by jointly imputing missing data. The imputation results (the coefficient of determination values range 0.4 ∼ 0.9) indicated that the bands with the larger contribution to the classification had higher imputation accuracy. Feature importance evaluation showed that the Im-BiLSTM model captured the key phenological periods and features from time-series input. The visualization of hidden units demonstrated that the Im-BiLSTM model accumulated useful information over time, and the learned high-level features made the crops more separable than the original inputs. © 2022 The Author(s)","Bidirectional LSTM; Crop classification; Data imputation; Interpretation; Joint learning; Multi-temporal","agricultural production; data interpretation; GIS; learning; satellite data; satellite imagery; temporal analysis; China; Xinjiang Uygur",Article,Scopus

However, it is still challenging to predict the grassland degradation status on a large scale because it is a multi-factorial phenomenon with complex changes in ecosystem structure and function, which is hard to be fully characterized through mechanism models. The emergence of machine learning algorithms provides a potential to model complex systems and mine information from multi-source data without elucidating underlying mechanisms. Here, we utilized random forest and neural network algorithms to predict the grassland degradation represented by the net primary productivity (NPP) changing rate based on multi-source data including geographic, meteorological, plant traits, land use type and microbial variables in the Chinese Northern grassland. Particularly, the microbial roles in determining the degradation status were concerned. Results show that a high prediction precision was achieved by random forest model, rather than by neural network model, with a mean relative error of 16.9% and a mean square error of 9.273e-05. Besides identified longitude, arid index and current NPP state, specific soil microbial groups, mainly Solirubrobacter, were screened as credible biomarkers. Regarding model fitting, geographic, meteorological and plant variables explained 61.8% of the total variance, which was enhanced up to 72.8% by the rest microbial markers. These findings provide a theoretical basis to establish a pre-warning system for grassland management and policy-making. © 2022 The Authors","Biomarkers; Chinese northern grassland; Modeling and validation; Multi-source remote sensing data; Net primary productivity changing rate; Random forest","Biomarkers; Climate change; Complex networks; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Land use; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mean square error; Photosynthesis; Remote sensing; Chinese northern grassland; Geographics; Grassland degradation; Modeling and validation; Multi-source remote sensing data; Multi-Sources; Net primary productivity; Net primary productivity changing rate; Random forests; Remote sensing data; Forecasting; algorithm; artificial neural network; bacterium; biomarker; climate change; ecosystem structure; error analysis; grassland; human activity; land degradation; machine learning; model validation; net primary production; prediction; remote sensing; satellite data; soil microorganism; China",Article,Scopus

In this study, wheat images were collected from fields where the environment varied both spatially and temporally. Res2Net50 was adopted as a backbone network, combined with multi-scale training, deformable convolutional networks, and Generic ROI Extractor for rich feature learning. The proposed methods were trained and validated, and the average precision (AP) obtained for the bounding box and mask was 0.904 and 0.907, respectively, and the accuracy for wheat spike counting was 99.29%. Comprehensive empirical analyses revealed that our method (Wheat-Net) performed well on challenging field-based datasets with mixed qualities, particularly those with various backgrounds and wheat spike adjacence/occlusion.

Agroforestry systems such as alley cropping are gaining more and more attention as a practice to maintain and/or increase SOC in agroecosystems. The aim of this study was to add to the knowledge on SOC in alley cropping systems and to evaluate the contribution of introducing trees into agricultural landscapes by conducting a meta-analysis of the available data. The soil carbon (C) input will increase with time. Our findings suggest that a beneficial effect on SOC occurs after approximately a decade of alley cropping practice adoption. Furthermore, the effect of alley cropping is more beneficial in regions with lower initial SOC concentration compared to that in regions rich in SOC. Higher relative SOC is observed in the tropical region compared to that in the temperate climate zone. The establishment of alley cropping systems on agricultural land needs to consider several parameters such as alley width and tree species when designing such systems to achieve the highest possible tree and crop productivity while increasing SOC. © 2022 by the authors.

To study the system's performance and the hazard level of the raw wastewater and treated effluent, several water quality parameters were chosen, including electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+). Four different sampling points (inlet, two intermediate points, and the outlet) were investigated in the study. According to the electrical conductivity, wastewater flowing to the wetland was classified as category four (C4), ‘extremely high salinity’ and thus unfit for irrigation. Both intermediate sampling points were in C3, whereas the outlet sampling point was in C1. According to SAR, 20% of the samples collected at the inlet were classified as ‘very high sodium hazard’ (S4), 45% as ‘high sodium hazard’ (S3) and 35% as ‘medium sodium hazard’ (S2).

Owing to the demand and supply gap may diminish food production due to diseases in plants, such as bacterial disease, viral disease, and fungal diseases. Early recognition of such diseases and applying an appropriate pesticide or fertiliser can improve crop yield. Accordingly, early plant disease detection necessitates continuous crop monitoring from its initial stages. Recently some research works have been proposed as remedial measures. However, such methodologies utilise costly equipment that is infeasible for small-scale farmers. Thus, there is a need for a cost-effective plant-disease-detection approach. This study embellishes the challenges and opportunities in plant disease detection. Correspondingly, this research proposes an ensemble deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis approach using a combination of AlexNet, ResNet50, and VGG16 deep learning-based models. It effectively ascertains plant diseases by analysing the plant leaf images. A broad set of experiments were conducted using different plant leaf image datasets such as cherry, grape, maize, pepper, potato, strawberry, and cardamom to evaluate the robustness of the proposed approach. Experiential results demonstrated that the proposed approach attained a maximum detection accuracy of 100% for binary and 99.53% for multi-class datasets.

Evapotranspiration (ET) by FAO-56 Penman-Monteith standard method is complex, especially for saline soils. Moreover, existing studies focus on the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning-enabled smart and precision irrigation water recommendation systems along with the ET estimation by limited parameters. The ETs for saline soils are also equally important for the reclamation of saline soils, which is ignored by the existing literature. The study proposed IoT and machine leaching-based architecture of context-aware monthly ETs estimations for saline soil reclamation with the effective leaching process. The IoT-enabled crop field contexts in terms of crop field temperature, soil salinity, and irrigation water salinity are used as input features to the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and ensembled LSTM models for monthly ETs predictions. The performance of the proposed solution is observed in terms of the accuracy of the machine learning models along with the comparison against the FAO-56 PM-based standard method. The implementation of the proposed solution reveals that the ensembled LSTM-based approach for ETs is more accurate as compared to the LSTM model with accuracies of 92 and 90% for the training and validation datasets, respectively. The predictions made by the ensembled LSTM are more in line with the FAO-56 PM-based method with a Pearson correlation of 0.916 as compared to LSTM models.

Nutrient Expert (NE) based fertilizer recommendation, government recommendation (GR), and farmers' nutrient management practice (FP) were evaluated in 600 on-farm trials in two eastern Terai districts of Nepal during 2014–2016. The machine learning (Random Forest) approach was used to identify major indicators to predict grain yield variability. The NE-based recommendation had the highest and FP had the lowest grain yield and gross return in all cereals. Farmer's practice had the highest probability of increasing energy-use efficiency (EUE) followed by NE in all cereals. NE had the lowest yield-scaled greenhouse gas emission (greenhouse gas emission intensity; GHGI) in rice and intermediate in maize and wheat compared with GR or FP. Farmers' practice had consistently the highest GHGI in rice and maize while GR had the highest GHGI in wheat. Except for rice in FP, specific energy (SE) followed by EUE were the major predictors of grain yield of all crops in all nutrient management practices.

While evaluating the models, four statistical performance indicators including coefficient of determination (r2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absoluter error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used. Furthermore, ranking scores were performed on statistical results to find the overall best model across all the input combinations. Based on total ranking scores, CatBoost (RMSE ranging between 0.06 – 0.09 unitless) was the best model in predicting CWSI, while Stacked Regression (RMSE ranging between 0.27 – 0.72 mm d−1) was the best model for ETc estimation. Future research will consider designing and evaluating an IDSS using identified best machine learning models to establish soil water and plant stress feedback for automated irrigation scheduling. © 2023","Canopy temperature; Decision support system; Irrigation scheduling; Machine learning models; Soil moisture; Soil water and plant feedback",,Article,Scopus

It put further challenges to achieve regional-level sustainable development targets. This is particularly true for countries like India where water, land, and climate problems are very complex and interconnected starting from the watershed level to the regional level. Interlinked synergies work as the key to achieving collective action to target multiple sustainable development goals (SDG). The land, water, and climate components are prioritized in SDG 6, 13, and 15 goals respectively, which are assessed through an integrated approach using a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. A semi-arid ungauged Khari basin is selected for the sustainability assessment and hydrologic response study. As the region is critical in terms of shortage of water, land conversions, and climate change and can present a way to address challenges in regional-level sustainability assessments. SWAT model is considered for two land-use scenarios, 1990 and 2015, for the period 1990–2019 and two climate scenarios, Representative Concentrated Pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), for the period 2021–2050 while keeping the slope and soil data same in both models. The simulated discharge data matched well with the observed discharge data, with NSE of 0.72, PBIAS of − 1.9, R2 of 0.72 during calibration, and NSE of 0.72, PBIAS of − 4.7, and R2 of 0.73 during validation. It can be observed from the Land use change scenario assessment that an increase in the fallow agriculture land area shows a positive relation with surface runoff and a negative relation with percolation. Similarly, climate change scenario assessment shows that in future scenarios temperature will increase in both the RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 but hydrological components are more responsive to the changes in rainfall than temperature changes. Study results pointed out that both land use change and climate change can significantly affect the surface as well as groundwater availability of the region and it also highlights the functionality of an integrated assessment approach that assesses land, water, and climate components of SDGs through a hydrological model. It supplies an understanding of important interlinked influences and responses that are to be studied and managed collectively at the regional level in future studies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Hydrological model; Semi-arid; Sustainability",,Article,Scopus

MELA is capable of extending temporally limited local hydroclimatic measurements at fine spatial resolution to longer periods, using remotely-sensed hydroclimatic data readily available for longer periods but at coarse spatial resolution. We demonstrate the implementation of MELA to extrapolate the monthly local soil moisture measurements at multiple depths from 2015–2021 to 1958–2021 in a semi-arid region. Such data extrapolators are imperative to generate longer historical data needed to adequately train and test AI models while enhancing the chance of capturing the effects of extreme climates on spatially variable soil moisture. The MELA-extrapolated local soil moisture subsequently allowed the construction of monthly time-series of field-scale soil moisture distributions with a normalized accuracy of 72% and prediction of countywide annual winter wheat yields – using MELA-extrapolated soil moisture data and eXplainable AI (XAI) – with a normalized accuracy of 81%. Furthermore, the XAI model ranked the predictors based on their importance in estimating winter wheat yields, in which the soil moisture near the surface and in the root zone and precipitation totals were found to be more influential than temperature on crop yields in the semi-arid region. The XAI model also unveiled the inflection points of the predictors beyond which crop yields would increase or decrease. Moreover, the AI-based analyses in conjunction with climate projections from global climate models suggest potential reductions in rainfed crop yields in the study area by 2050 and 2100 in the absence of climate-resilient mitigation and adaptation plans. © 2022 The Author(s)","Artificial Intelligence; Climate change impacts; Crop yield analysis; Data generator; Soil moisture analysis","Arid regions; Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Climate models; Crops; Extrapolation; Image resolution; Soil moisture; Climate change impact; Crop yield; Crop yield analyse; Data generator; Hydroclimatic; Semi-arid region; Soil moisture analysis; Spatial resolution; Winter wheat yields; Yield analysis; Learning algorithms",Article,Scopus

A larger problem is that the level of use of digital technology varies from person to person. Therefore, a digital divide may even exist among elderly individuals. Considering the recent accelerating digital transformation in our society, it is highly likely that elderly individuals are experiencing many difficulties in their daily life. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly address and manage these difficulties. Research objective This study aims to predict the digital divide in the elderly population and provide essential insights into managing it. To this end, predictive analysis is performed using public data and machine learning techniques. Methods and materials This study used data from the ‘2020 Report on Digital Information Divide Survey’ published by the Korea National Information Society Agency. In establishing the prediction model, various independent variables were used. Ten variables with high importance for predicting the digital divide were identified and used as critical, independent variables to increase the convenience of analyzing the model. The data were divided into 70% for training and 30% for testing. The model was trained on the training set, and the model’s predictive accuracy was analyzed on the test set. The prediction accuracy was analyzed using logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). A convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to further improve the accuracy. In addition, the importance of variables was analyzed using data from 2019 before the COVID-19 outbreak, and the results were compared with the results from 2020. Results The study results showed that the variables with high importance in the 2020 data predicting the digital divide of elderly individuals were the demographic perspective, internet usage perspective, self-efficacy perspective, and social connectedness perspective. These variables, as well as the social support perspective, were highly important in 2019. The highest prediction accuracy was achieved using the CNN-based model (accuracy: 80.4%), followed by the XGBoost model (accuracy: 79%) and LR model (accuracy: 78.3%). The lowest accuracy (accuracy: 72.6%) was obtained using the DT model. Discussion The results of this analysis suggest that support that can strengthen the practical connection of elderly individuals through digital devices is becoming more critical than ever in a situation where digital transformation is accelerating in various fields. In addition, it is necessary to comprehensively use classification algorithms from various academic fields when constructing a classification model to obtain higher prediction accuracy. Conclusion The academic significance of this study is that the CNN, which is often employed in image and video processing, was extended and applied to a social science field using structured data to improve the accuracy of the prediction model. The practical significance of this study is that the prediction models and the analytical methodologies proposed in this article can be applied to classify elderly people affected by the digital divide, and the trained models can be used to predict the people of younger generations who may be affected by the digital divide. Another practical significance of this study is that, as a method for managing individuals who are affected by a digital divide, the self-efficacy perspective about acquiring and using ICTs and the socially connected perspective are suggested in addition to the demographic perspective and the internet usage perspective. © 2023 Park, Feng.

The reliability with which these variables infer on yields depends, among many other factors, also on their aggregation in the space domain, for example on the type of the crop masks utilized in the aggregation process from point to regional scale. This work investigates how the yield explanatory power of satellite-derived indicators is changing moving from time-stable arable land masks to annual crop group-specific masks. We compare in particular the linkage between time series of regional crop yield in Europe and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), when generic arable land masks or crop group-specific and year-specific information are applied to aggregate pixel values at regional level. Regional (Eurostat level NUTS-2) crop yield statistics were collected from official databases for the period 2003–2019, while NDVI data were derived from MODIS daily products at 250 m spatial resolution for the same reference period. Regional NDVI profiles were retrieved by averaging single pixels time series according to the information of five crop masks, including generic arable land masks, crop group-specific static masks (separating winter and spring crops from summer crops), and annual crop group-specific masks (distinguishing between the two crop groups and varying in time). A compared correlation analysis between yield data and regional temporal NDVI profiles was performed assuming a linear regression model. Coefficient of determination R2 and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were computed to assess the models’ errors and to analyze the effect of the aggregation on the different crop masks. Results indicated an improvement in yield estimation when using annual crop group-specific indicators with respect to generic and static products. Although not homogeneously distributed throughout Europe, advantages have been highlighted both in terms of accuracy and timeliness of the prediction. In most regions, the introduction of annual masks allowed to reduce RMSE values by 0.3 t/ha and advanced forecast times by up to 30 days. The added value in the use of annual crop group-specific masks concerned the two European most cultivated crops, namely soft wheat and grain maize. © 2023 The Author(s)","Crop masks; Crop monitoring; Crop yield forecasting; NDVI; Regional forecast; Remote Sensing","Forecasting; Land use; Linear regression; Mean square error; Meteorology; Pixels; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Time series; Arable land; Crop mask; Crop monitoring; Crop yield; Crop yield forecasting; Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometers; Normalized difference vegetation index; Regional forecast; Remote-sensing; Times series; Crops; arable land; crop yield; MODIS; NDVI; spatial resolution; Europe",Article,Scopus

With the advent of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and advances in deep learning techniques, it has become possible to identify and classify weeds from crops at desired spatial and temporal resolution. In this research, a faster region based convolutional neural network was implemented for the automatic weed identification and classification using a mixed crop farmland as a case study. A DJI phantom 4 UAV was used to simultaneously collect about 254 image pairs of the study site. The images were annotated before transferring them into google colaboratory where they were trained over five epochs; 10,000, 20,000, 100,000, 200,000, and 242,000 with the aim of detecting the point when the model flattens out in the process of automatically identifying and classifying the weeds. The neural network identified and classified five classes which are; sugarcane, spinach, banana, pepper, and weeds. Finally, the accuracy of the automatic weed classification was evaluated with the aid of the recorded loss function and confusion matrix, and the result shows that the implemented model gave a classification accuracy of 52.5%, weed precision of 50%, weed recall of 7.7% and F1 score of 71.6% at 10,000 epochs, classification accuracy of 67.8%, weed precision of 67%, weed recall of 52.4% and a F1 score of 85.9% at 20,000 epochs, classification accuracy of 97.2%, weed precision of 96.2%, weed recall of 97.5% and a F1 score of 99% at 100,000 epochs, classification accuracy of 98.3%, weed precision of 98.1%, weed recall of 99.1% and a F1 score of 99.4% at 200,000 epochs, and classification accuracy of 97%, weed precision of 95%, weed recall of 99% and a F1 score of 99% at 242,000 epochs.

However, precise and continuous spectral signatures, important for large-area crop growth monitoring and early prediction of yield production with cutting-edge algorithms, can be only provided via hyperspectral imaging. Therefore, this article used new-generation Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) images to classify the main crop types (hybrid corn, soybean, sunflower, and winter wheat) in Mezőhegyes (southeastern Hungary). A Wavelet-attention convolutional neural network (WA-CNN), random forest and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms were utilized to automatically map the crops over the agricultural lands. The best accuracy was achieved with the WA-CNN, a feature-based deep learning algorithm and a combination of two images with overall accuracy (OA) value of 97.89% and the user's accuracy producer's accuracy was from 97% to 99%. To obtain this, first, factor analysis was introduced to decrease the size of the hyperspectral image data cube. A wavelet transform was applied to extract important features and combined with the spectral attention mechanism CNN to gain higher accuracy in mapping crop types.

This experiment was conducted in the main cotton-producing area of Xinjiang, China. A hyperspectrometer was used to monitor the canopy spectral reflectance of cotton at different stages of growth. The results showed that the leaf area index (LAI) increased with the increase in the amount of nitrogen fertilizer added during the early full boll stage and decreased with the increase in nitrogen fertilization in the full and late boll stages. Insufficient or excessive fertilization led to a decrease in the LAI. The visible light band indicated that the canopy spectral reflectance decreased, and the amount of fertilizer increased in all the growth stages. The near-infrared band revealed that the canopy spectral reflectance increased with the amount of nitrogen applied during the bud stage, early boll stage, and the most vigorous period of boll growth. During the flowering period, the spectral reflectance followed the order N3 > N4 > N2 > N1 > N0. During the entire growth period of cotton, the values of the cotton LAI predicted using the ratio vegetation index (RVI) model were found to best fit the measured values. The LAI monitoring models of cotton in each growth stage were different. The TVI model is the best in the bud and early boll stages. The NDVI model is the best in the flowering stage, and the DVI model is the best in the full boll stage.

In this study, we designed a new convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, called DS-SoybeanNet, to improve the performance of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based soybean maturity information monitoring. DS-SoybeanNet can extract and utilize both shallow and deep image features. We used a high-definition digital camera on board a UAV to collect high-definition soybean canopy digital images. A total of 2662 soybean canopy digital images were obtained from two soybean breeding fields (fields F1 and F2). We compared the soybean maturity classification accuracies of (i) conventional machine learning methods (support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)), (ii) current deep learning methods (InceptionResNetV2, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50), and (iii) our proposed DS-SoybeanNet method. Our results show the following: (1) The conventional machine learning methods (SVM and RF) had faster calculation times than the deep learning methods (InceptionResNetV2, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50) and our proposed DS-SoybeanNet method. For example, the computation speed of RF was 0.03 s per 1000 images. However, the conventional machine learning methods had lower overall accuracies (field F2: 63.37–65.38%) than the proposed DS-SoybeanNet (Field F2: 86.26%). (2) The performances of the current deep learning and conventional machine learning methods notably decreased when tested on a new dataset.

The analyses were carried out in coffee-growing areas at the development stages three, six, and twelve months after planting.

The training stage was undertaken using 7458 plants aged three, six, and twelve months, reaching stability in the iterations between 3000 and 4000 it. Plant detection within twelve months was not possible due to crown unification. A counting accuracy of 86.5% was achieved with plants at three months of development. The plants’ characteristics at this age may have influenced the reduction in accuracy, and the low uniformity of the canopy may have made it challenging for the neural network to define a pattern.

Over the last few years, global potato production has been increasing. This growth has created many opportunities for developing a wide range of value-added products from these crops. However, this requires monitoring the quality components of the tubers, such as moisture content, starch content, and soluble solid content. In particular, moisture content is one of the key quality parameters important for ensuring quality control throughout the supply chain and processing for consumer consumption. Ideally, moisture content would be estimated at the field level; however, current methods used by the industry to assess moisture content are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and destructive. Hence, the purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of hyperspectral imaging to quantify the moisture content of unpeeled potatoes before they were subsequently stored and processed. Hyperspectral images are collected from 47 intact potato tubers, with partial least squares regression (PLSR) models developed to predict moisture content from these spectra. The models showed predictive abilities for moisture content with acceptable ratios of prediction to deviation (RPDs) when considering the complete wavelength range (R2 = 0.53, RPD = 1.46, root mean square error (RMSE) = 5.04%) or the β-coefficient wavelength selection technique (R2 = 0.53, RPD = 1.47, RMSE = 5.02%). Furthermore, the prediction ability increased by more than 10% when the model wavelength was narrowed down to 733–970 nm. This study demonstrates the potential of using hyperspectral imaging for the quality assessment of intact, unpeeled potatoes, although further work is required to improve the model quality and implement this approach using remote sensing imagery. © 2022 by the authors.","hyperspectral imaging; infield assessment; moisture content; post-harvest handling; potato",,Article,Scopus

In the present study, we collected data on the main cargo movements in Brazilian ports in 2018 to develop a model for predicting the stay time of ships, using algorithms based on decision tree models. There are no studies in the literature on models for predicting the stay time of ships, which is the gap to be filled in this research. In addition, an exploratory data analysis was performed to discover the variables that most influence the stay time. This research used several classification machine learning algorithms (support vector machines, gradient boosting, decision tree, random forest, among others) to build stay time prediction. As a result, the best model generated was that of random forests that obtained acceptable performance, with accuracy and f1-score above 73%, and train and test times around 14 s and the most important features to the model involve geographical and cargo characteristics. Therefore, it is possible to use them in real environments to develop logistic planning of the waterway modal. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Brazilian ports; Data mining; Random forests; Stay time; Waterway modal","Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Forecasting; Freight transportation; Random forests; Ships; Support vector machines; Brazilian port; Climatic conditions; Decision-tree model; Logistical planning; Maritime transport; Planning and scheduling; Random forests; Stay time; Uncertainty; Waterway modal; Data mining",Article,Scopus

It has been a very significant research topic with high social impact, which can be widely applied to emergency management, traffic regulation, and urban planning. In particular, by meshing a large urban area to a number of fine-grained mesh-grids, citywide crowd and traffic information in a continuous time period can be represented with 4D tensor (Timestep, Height, Width, Channel). Based on this idea, a series of methods have been proposed to address grid-based prediction for citywide crowd and traffic.

Comparing with the existing ones, our dataset holds several advantages including large mesh-grid number, fine-grained mesh size, and high user sample.

To overcome this problem, the vegetation indices retrieved by remote sensing, can be used to get information about the hail damage. The aim of this work is the detection of medium-low damages (i.e., between 10 and 30% of the gross saleable production) using the much-used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in comparison with alternative vegetation indices (i.e., ARVI, MCARI, SAVI, MSAVI, MSAVI2) and their change from pre-event to post-event in five hailstorms in Lombardy in 2018. Seventy-four overlapping scenes (10% cloud cover) were collected from the Sentinel-2 in the spring-summer period of 2018 in the Brescia district (Lombardy). An unsupervised classification was carried out to automatically identify the maize fields (grain and silage), testing the change detection approach by searching for damage by hail and strong wind in the Lombardy plain of Brescia. A database of 125 field surveys (average size 4 Ha) after the hailstorm collected from the insurance service allowed for the selection of the dates on which the event occurred and provided a proxy of the extent of the damage (in % of the decrease of the yield). Hail and strong wind damages ranged from 5 to 70%, and they were used for comparison with the satellite image change detection. The differences in the vegetation indices obtained by Sentinel 2 before and after the hailstorm and the insurance assessments of damage after the events were compared to assess the degree of concordance. The modified soil-adjusted vegetation index outperformed other vegetation indices in detecting hail-related damages with the highest accuracy (73.3%). On the other hand, the NDVI resulted in scarce performance ranking last of the six indices, with an accuracy of 65.3%. Future research will evaluate how much uncertainty can be found in the method’s limitations with vegetation indices derived from satellites, how much is due to errors in estimating damage to the ground, and how much is due to other causes. © the Author(s), 2022.","change detection; damage estimation; Hailstorms; modified soil-adjusted vegetation index; vegetation indices","assessment method; comparative study; damage mechanics; detection method; estimation method; field method; hail; insurance system; maize; remote sensing; Sentinel; unsupervised classification; vegetation index; Brescia; Italy; Lombardy",Article,Scopus

Developments in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms and sensor technology help to estimate yields efficiency. Previous studies have been based on less cultivars (&lt;10) and ideal experimental environments, it is not available in practical production. Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate the yield parameters of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) under lodging conditions using RGB information. In this study, 17 time point data throughout the soybean growing season in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, China, were collected, and the vegetation index, texture information, canopy cover, and crop height were obtained by UAV-image processing. After that, partial least squares regression (PLSR), logistic regression (Logistic), random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine regression (SVM), and deep learning neural network (DNN) were used to estimate the yield parameters. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) The most suitable time point to estimate the yield was flowering stage (48 days), which was when most of the soybean cultivars flowered. (2) The multiple data fusion improved the accuracy of estimating the yield parameters, and the texture information has a high potential to contribute to the estimation of yields, and (3) The DNN model showed the best accuracy of training (R2=0.66 rRMSE=32.62%) and validation (R2=0.50, rRMSE=43.71%) datasets.

Strategies to advance the production of coffee grains involve better understanding its spatial variability along fields. The objectives of this study were to adjust yield-prediction models based on a time series of satellite images and high-density yield data, and to indicate the best phenological stage of coffee crop to obtain satellite images for this purpose. The study was conducted during three seasons (2019, 2020 and 2021) in a commercial area (10.24 ha), located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Data were obtained using a harvester equipped with a yield monitor that measures the volume of coffee harvested with 3.0 m of spatial resolution. Satellite images from the PlanetScope (PS) platform were used. Random forest (RF) regression and multiple linear regression (MLR) models were fitted to different datasets composed of coffee yield and time series of satellite-image data ((1) Spectral bands—red, green, blue and near-infrared; (2) Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); or (3) Green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI)). Whether using RF or MLR, the spectral bands, NDVI and GNDVI reproduced the spatial variability of yield maps one year before harvest. This information can be of critical importance for management decisions across the season. For yield quantification, the RF model using spectral bands showed the best results, reaching R2 of 0.93 for the validation set, and the lowest errors of prediction. The most appropriate phenological stage for satellite-image data acquisition was the dormancy phase, observed during the dry season months of July and August. These findings can help to monitor the spatial and temporal variability of the fields and guide management practices based on the premises of precision agriculture. © 2022 by the authors.","GNDVI; NDVI; precision agriculture; remote sensing",,Article,Scopus

This study aims to understand the impact of climate change on cotton crop change using Regional Climate Model (RCM) in the near and far future. The RCM model considered for the study is RegCM4 from CORDEX-SA experiment for the two RCP scenarios at RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. To refine these projections, we have bias-corrected the data using quantile mapping approach. This study is based on two locations: one in Hisar (mostly irrigated) and the other in Akola (mostly rainfed), located in the northern and central agro-climatic zones for cotton. The daily projected data have been summarised as 1971–2005(1990), 2006–2035(2020), 2036–2065(2050) and 2066–2095(2080). The RCM projections show good agreement with the observed climatology, but still bias exists, which is fine-tuned by bias-correction. The RCM model showed reduced diurnal temperature and night warming as it highly underestimates maximum temperature and slightly the minimum temperature. It also predicts rise in temperature at higher rates in northern than central zones. Also, the amount of rainfall is increasing in the northern region and decreasing in the central region at RCP8.5. The spatial variability is observed as the amount of rainfall is increasing in the northern irrigated region and decreasing in the central rainfed region. The rainfall intensity in Hisar is projected to increase till 2050 and a further decline in 2080. And in the central zone, it is presently higher than the northern region, but projected to decrease further from 1990 to 2080. These daily weather data were then employed in the cotton-CROPGRO model under DSSAT-CSM (v4.6) to assess its impact on future climate. The crop model has been simulated with these weather projections for the three sowing dates under rainfed, irrigated, and potential conditions. It is observed that the simulated crop yields and LAI in Akola are higher at RCP8.5 than RCP4.5, whereas in Hisar, it is lower at RCP8.5 than RCP4.5. So, in the cooler and wetter central zone, temperature may slightly rise at RCP8.5 along with increased rainfall and CO2, favouring the cotton crop. This shows the suitability of crops in this region even at RCP8.5 and far future. Whereas in the hot and dry northern agro-climatic cotton zone, it is projected that the temperature slightly increases from present at RCP4.5 and further at RCP8.5, and the amount of rainfall increases at RCP4.5 and reduces at RCP8.5. So, the crop here could stand the increased temperature at RCP4.5 and is also favoured due to increased CO2 and precipitation. But, at RCP8.5, the comparatively higher rate of increase in temperature and decreasing amount of rainfall may affect cotton crops adversely, with its maximum effects in the far future. Also, in future climate with temporal variability in the amount of precipitation and increasing temperature, late sown cotton crops are favoured, especially with proper irrigation practices in both the regions. The study embraces utilisation of RCMs and crop models to study the vulnerability of crops to climate change, which could help to assess the site-specific adaptive potential and mitigation measures for future climate. © 2022, Indian Academy of Sciences.","bias correction; Climate change; cotton; DSSAT; impacts; quantile mapping; RegCM4","adaptive management; climate change; correction; cotton; crop production; mapping; rainfed agriculture; risk assessment; Akola; Haryana; Hisar; India; Maharashtra",Article,Scopus

In pistachio trees, as in other woody crops, the volume of the canopy is a key factor that affects the pistachio crop load, water requirements, and quality. However, canopy/crown monitoring is time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it is traditionally carried out by measuring tree dimensions in the field. Therefore, methods for rapid tree canopy characterization are needed for providing accurate information that can be used for management decisions. The present study focuses on developing a new, fast, and low-cost technique, based on two main steps, for estimating the canopy volume in pistachio trees. The first step is based on adequately planning the UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) flight according to light conditions and segmenting the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) imagery using machine learning methods. The second step is based on measuring vegetation planar area and ground shadows using two methodological approaches: a pixel-based classification approach and an OBIA (object-based image analysis) approach. The results show statistically significant linear relationships (p &lt; 0.05) between the ground-truth data and the estimated volume of pistachio tree crowns, with R2 &gt; 0.8 (pixel-based classification) and R2 &gt; 0.9 (OBIA). The proposed methodologies show potential benefits for accurately monitoring the vegetation of the trees. Moreover, the method is compatible with other remote sensing techniques, usually performed at solar noon, so UAV operators can plan a flexible working day. Further research is needed to verify whether these results can be extrapolated to other woody crops. © 2022 by the authors.","aerial; drone; image analysis; leaf area; machine learning; pistachio; precision agriculture; random forest; spatial variability","Agricultural robots; Antennas; Crops; Forestry; Image analysis; Machine learning; Pixels; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Vegetation mapping; Aerial vehicle; Image-analysis; Leaf area; Machine-learning; Pistachio; Precision Agriculture; Random forests; Red green blues; Spatial variability; Woody crop; Drones",Article,Scopus

To capture unknown and complex dependencies from multiple spatiotemporal factors, i.e., autocorrelated, meteorological causal, meteorological spatial factors, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal feature extraction and fusion network inspired by humans’ multi-level cognition process, namely, SFEF-Net, including the data pre-processing stage, transfer pre-training stage, spatiotemporal feature extraction stage, and spatiotemporal feature fusion stage. Specifically, inspired by humans’ empirical analysis, the 24 Solar Terms knowledge and Pearson correlation coefficient analysis are utilized to respectively select input timestamps and influencing factors in the first stage. Inspired by humans’ associative learning, a Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) layer with powerful remember capability is trained via weather data from multiple neighbored monitoring stations in the second stage, and further is transferred for better feature extraction. Inspired by humans’ independent analysis, every factor is separately captured and analyzed via the pre-trained LSTM layer in the third stage, which also coincides with the philosophical idea of divide and conquer. Inspired by humans’ comprehensive consideration, extracted features are fused level by level via the attention mechanism with dynamic weights in the fourth stage, which avoids invalid dependencies between multiple features and overfitting. The real-world daily average air temperature forecasting in Shaanxi Province, China is taken to demonstrate the SFEF-Net beyond 12 baseline methods. Additionally, forecasts of drastic change period, ablation analysis, multiple steps, and different stations further present the effectiveness of the SFEF-Net. © 2022","Attention mechanism; Deep learning; Multi-level cognition process; Spatiotemporal systems; Weather forecast","Correlation methods; Decision making; Extraction; Factor analysis; Long short-term memory; Weather forecasting; Attention mechanisms; Deep learning; Features extraction; Features fusions; Memory network; Multi-level cognition process; Multilevels; Spatio-temporal system; Spatiotemporal feature; Weather forecast; Feature extraction",Article,Scopus

This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency and applicability of crop pattern prediction for the year 2050 with the CLUE-S model in an agricultural plain. The model was calibrated and validated based on the LULC changes to model future changes of the crop pattern by 2050. Twelve driving factors were utilised to quantify the relationship of LULC classes. The statistical relationship among the factors was examined with a Binomial Logistic Regression approach.

However, uncertainties remain in NPP estimation. Using winter wheat data obtained from an experimental station in 2019, this study evaluated the ability of the near-infrared radiance of vegetation (NIRV,Rad) to estimate NPP at different time scales and established an estimation model based on NIRV,Rad, where NIRV,Rad was defined as the product of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the near-infrared radiance. The results showed that the linear relationship between NIRV,Rad and NPP was superior to the relationship between NPP and NDVI, enhanced vegetation index-2 (EVI2), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV,Ref) at each time scale (hourly, daily, and growth period). The advantage of NIRV,Rad was more evident on the hourly scale, in which the R2 of NIRV,Rad and NPP reached 0.77, whereas the R2 values of the correlation of NDVI, EVI2, and NIRV,Ref with NPP were 0.30, 0.16, and 0.14, respectively. There existed a strong linear relationship between absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, net photosynthetic rate, leaf area index, and NIRV,Rad, which explained the good relationship between NIRV,Rad and NPP. Through a comparative analysis of the various models, the NIRV,Rad model was found to have the strongest ability to estimate NPP and the R2, with the measured NPP reaching 0.81.

A field experiment (2016–2018) was conducted with three conventional subsurface drainage systems to calibrate and validate the CROPGRO-canola model and project climate change impacts on winter canola growth, yield, and water use efficiency (WUE). The outputs of the general circulation model (CanESM2) were downscaled using SDSM software under three representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) for the 2021–2050 period. The DSSAT 4.7.5 crop model was adapted to simulate the responses of winter canola to the projected climate change under different planting dates. Measured phonological data, leaf area index (LAI), total dry matter (TDM), and grain yield were used to calibrate the crop model. The model showed good potential to simulate winter canola (Brassica napus cv. Hyola 401) growth and yield, with 1–2-day differences between observed and predicted phonological dates and nRMSE, d, and R2 of 12–29%, 0.89–0.99, and 0.84–0.99, respectively, across drainage systems and crop indices. Under the three RCP scenarios, climate change will reduce crop yield by 8–33% in different drainage systems at the common planting date. However, planting date management will improve canola yield and WUE by 20–64% and 19–58%, respectively, in different drainage systems, mainly due to an increased transpiration/precipitation ratio. Based on the results, proper drainage management and agronomic operations make it possible to control waterlogging and thus achieve optimal canola yield and acceptable WUE under climate change. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"assessment method; climate change; crop yield; future prospect; prediction; rainfed agriculture; transpiration",Article,Scopus

Use of plant-derived microorganisms is a promising strategy to alleviate salt stress. In a previous study, the endophytic strain Bacillus altitudinis WR10 isolated from wheat roots showed high salt resistance. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of WR10 in improving the salt tolerance of wheat and its potential mechanisms using a hydroponic test. Under salt stress, WR10 inoculation significantly increased the lengths and dry weights of the roots and shoots, indicating that WR10 improves wheat salt tolerance at the seedling stage. WR10 inoculation significantly reduced Na+ accumulation and enhanced K+, P, and Ca2+ uptake in salt-stressed plants, which can be attributed to the upregulated gene expression of H+-ATPase as well as the P-solubilizing and biofilm-producing characteristics of WR10. At the transcriptional level, L-ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione (GSH) synthetase related to GSH biosynthesis, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis genes (CYP73A, 4CL, and CAD) were significantly upregulated, whereas those of GSH metabolism genes (glutathione S-transferase and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase) were significantly downregulated in WR10-applied wheat roots under salt stress. These changes increased the APX activity and GSH levels and resulted in a decrease in hydrogen peroxide levels. Additionally, a decrease in proline content was observed in WR10-inoculated plants under salt stress because of WR10-induced upregulation of proline dehydrogenase gene expression. These results provide supporting evidence that WR10 improves wheat salt tolerance via more than one mechanism and open a window of opportunity for WR10 application in salinized soil.

As a result, numerous estimation approaches for mineral resources have been developed. It was investigated in this study by using five machine learning algorithms to estimate highly skewed gold data in the vein-type at the Quartz Ridge region, including Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Ensemble (DTE), Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN), and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN). The accuracy of MLA is compared to that of geostatistical approaches, such as ordinary and indicator kriging. Significant improvements were made during data preprocessing and splitting, ensuring that MLA was estimated accurately. The data were preprocessed with two normalization methods (z-score and logarithmic) to enhance network training performance and minimize substantial differences in the dataset’s variable ranges on predictions. The samples were divided into two equal subsets using an integrated data segmentation approach based on the Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA). The ranking shows that the GPR with logarithmic normalization is the most efficient method for estimating gold grade, far outperforming kriging techniques. In this study, the key to producing a successful mineral estimate is more than just the technique. It also has to do with how the data are processed and split. © 2022 by the authors.","data segmentation; geostatistics; machine learning algorithms MLA–Marine Predators Algorithm MPA; vein-type deposit; z-score normalization–logarithmic normalizing",,Article,Scopus

There is a discrepancy between the wind speed information required for agricultural management and that produced by weather agencies. To improve crop yield and increase farmers’ incomes, wind speed prediction systems must be developed that are customized for agricultural needs. The current study developed a high-resolution wind speed forecast system for agricultural purposes in South Korea. The system produces a wind speed forecast at 3 m aboveground with 100-m spatial resolution across South Korea. Logarithmic wind profile, power law, random forests, support vector regression, and extreme learning machine were tested as candidate methods for the downscaling wind speed data. The wind speed forecast system developed in this study provides good performance, particularly in inland areas. The machine learning–based methods give the better performance than traditional methods for downscaling wind speed data. Overall, the random forests are considered the best downscaling method in this study.

The objective of this research was to estimate soil pH from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 satellite-derived indices; data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 satellite missions were used to generate indices and as proxies in a statistical model to estimate soil pH. Step-wise multiple regression (SWMR), artificial neural networks (ANN), and random forest (RF) regression were used to develop predictive models for soil pH, SWMR, ANN, and RF regression models. The SWMR greedy method of variable selection was used to select the appropriate independent variables that were highly correlated with soil pH. Variables that were retained in the SWMR are B2, B11, Brightness index, Salinity index 2, Salinity index 5 of Sentinel-2 data; VH/VV index of Sentinel 1 and TIR1 (thermal infrared band1) Landsat-8 with p-value < 0.05. Among the four statistical models developed, the class-wise RF model performed better than other models with a cumulative correlation coefficient of 0.87 and RMSE of 0.35. The better performance of class-wise RF models can be attributed to different spectral characteristics of different soil pH groups. More than 70% of the soils in Angul and Balangir districts are acidic soils, and therefore, the training of the dataset was affected by that leading to misclassification of neutral and alkaline soils hindering the performance of single class models. Our results showed that the spectral bands and indices can be used as proxies to soil pH with individual classes of acidic, neutral, and alkaline soils.

In this study, the classification process of pistachios was carried out according to whether they are open or closed using deep learning techniques. The prominent aspect of the study is that the datasets obtained with an industrial experimental set-up are used in the training of the network in order to be suitable for industrial applications and to classify it with high accuracy. In this study, AlexNet and Inception V3 structure were trained and tested with this industrial data set, the test accuracy was calculated as 96.13% and 96.54%, respectively.

Two initial datasets were used based on soil survey and/or coffee crop management information. Eight sequences of tests were developed, involving: ranking of the most important variables for coffee yield modeling by random forest, reduction of data dimensionality through principal component analysis (PCA) or factorial analysis of mixed data (FAMD), generation of clusters with the hierarchical cluster on principal component (HCPC), applying hierarchical tree by using Ward's minimum variance method and improved by k-means classification. Cluster effectiveness was assessed by statistical difference in coffee yield. A total of 3 clusters were considered the most proper number of management classes, composed by the most accurate random forest model (crop age, crop density, silt fraction and soil organic matter content ranked as most important variables) and highest % of variables explanation by PCA.

In such a context, seasonal forecasts (i.e., climate predictions from a few weeks to several months ahead) are compelling instruments able to anticipate upcoming climate risks and guide tactical decisions. In this study, we assess the performance of seasonal forecasts for the summer period across Central Europe and the Mediterranean region in predicting some key indicators serving agriculture and forestry sectors, i.e., Potential EvapoTranspiration (PET), Potential Soil Moisture Deficit (PSMD), and Fire Weather Index (FWI). We exploit authoritative climate data from Copernicus Climate Data Store, i.e., ERA5 reanalyses and hindcasts from CMCC SPSv3 and ECMWF SEAS5 seasonal prediction systems (SPSs), to evaluate, using both deterministic and probabilistic evaluation scores, differences in performance across the two SPSs, two start dates (March and May) and four correction techniques applied to overcome modelling bias, namely bias correction (BC), calibration (CAL), quantile mapping (QM) and detrending (DET). Results show that seasonal predictions of PET perform better in Western and Eastern Europe and some areas of North Africa. PSMD predictions follow a similar spatial pattern as PET, except that for some areas in Central (Eastern) Europe in which the performance increases (decreases). FWI predictions reveal better results in some areas of the Iberian Peninsula, North-Western Africa, Balkan Peninsula, and Ukraine. Results also suggest that QM might be the most suitable technique for bias correction. Furthermore, the start date of the forecast might imply varying correlation significance, with the start date closest to the forecasted period not always being the best.

While traditional studies depended heavily on simulation tools, statistical approaches have recently provided higher flexibility and efficiency to explore factors associated with indoor air temperature. Under such background, this study systematically constructed building spatial design and occupancy features for 53 university classrooms in 4 teaching buildings in Beijing, China, and used statistical models to quantify their impacts on indoor air temperature. Both multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest regression (RFR) were conducted for different time periods in a day, and the MLR coefficients and RFR feature importance were examined. 16 spatial design features and 5 occupancy features were identified as significant. Among spatial design features, floor number of the classroom had the most notable positive impacts throughout a day. Window-to-wall ratios from different orientations had distinctive influences and added up to make a huge difference. Impacts from classroom size and position, parent building's forms and envelopes were certain but less important. Among occupancy features, it was found for teaching buildings that the whole-buildings’ occupancy had stronger impacts over the classrooms' one, and daily occupancy over temporal one, with building daily occupancy rate being the most influential.

Unfortunately, this type of application is characterized by datasets with a very limited number of samples (typically one sample per year). In general, statistical inference uses three datasets: the training dataset to optimize the model parameters, the validation dataset to select the best model, and the testing dataset to evaluate the model generalization ability. Splitting the overall database into three datasets is often impossible in crop yield modelling due to the limited number of samples. The leave-one-out cross-validation method, or simply leave one out (LOO), is often used to assess model performance or to select among competing models when the sample size is small. However, the model choice is typically made using only the testing dataset, which can be misleading by favouring unnecessarily complex models. The nested cross-validation approach was introduced in machine learning to avoid this problem by truly utilizing three datasets even with limited databases. In this study, we propose one particular implementation of the nested cross-validation, called the nested leave-two-out cross-validation method or simply the leave two out (LTO), to choose the best model with an optimal model selection (using the validation dataset) and estimate the true model quality (using the testing dataset). Two applications are considered: robusta coffee in Cu M'gar (Dak Lak, Vietnam) and grain maize over 96 French departments. In both cases, LOO is misleading by choosing models that are too complex; LTO indicates that simpler models actually perform better when a reliable generalization test is considered. The simple models obtained using the LTO approach have improved yield anomaly forecasting skills in both study crops. This LTO approach can also be used in seasonal forecasting applications. We suggest that the LTO method should become a standard procedure for statistical crop modelling.

The multispectral broadband Sentinel-2 mission carries four experimental red-edge and near infrared (NIR) hyperspectral narrow (≤20 nm) bands. We compared the performance of PRISMA and Sentinel-2 spectral bands at important phases of crop development (vegetative, reproductive, maturity) in estimating field-level biomass and yield for corn, rice, soybean, and wheat. We selected three data-driven methods: two-band vegetation indices (TBVIs), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and random forest (RF). The PRISMA and Sentinel-2 models on average explained approximately 20% more variability in biomass and yield with RF than TBVIs and PLSR. The mean RMSE of the PRISMA RF models was 0.42 and 0.17 kg m−2, which was lower than the Sentinel-2 RF models (0.48 and 0.18 kg m−2).

This study evaluated the CFSR and CHIRPS products against the observed climate for hydrologic prediction at two streamflow gauging stations. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to simulate hydrological processes in the watersheds. Model sensitivity analysis and calibration were conducted using the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting-2 (SUFI-2) algorithm in the SWAT-Calibration Uncertainty and Prediction (SWAT-CUP). Streamflow simulation performance was evaluated using several statistical, hydrological performances and prediction uncertainty of p-factor and r-factor within the SUFI-2 framework. Simulation of the model using the observed and gridded climate products provided satisfactory model performance in terms of the goodness of fit criteria and uncertainty prediction. Results show that CHIRPS rainfall combined with CFSR and observed temperatures demonstrates slightly better statistics and hydrological performance than observed, but shows substantial difference than CFSR. The simulations with CHIRPS and observed yielded minor differences in the water balance component estimates where the CFSR simulation gave lower average annual rainfall, resulting in lower water balance components.

GEPIC (CLM-CROP) performed best in simulating maize (wheat) yield in the north, east, and northwest (southwest and south), due to reasonable parameter (cultivar and phenology parameters) settings. Because the rice phenology parameters were calibrated against phenological observation networks and a simple nitrogen limitation index was introduced, ORCHIDEE-CROP performed well in rice yield simulation and soybean yield simulation (center and southwest). Among four crops, wheat has the largest yield gap (7.3-14.1%), in which the poor soil of northwest (14.1%) exposes wheat to relatively high nutritional stress. Thus, in northwest China, optimizing nitrogen management in wheat production can effectively mitigate the negative impact of climate change on crop production. © 2022 The Authors","China; food security; global gridded crop model (GGCM); model comparison; multimodel ensemble; yield gap","Climate change; Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Grain (agricultural product); Nitrogen; Agricultural productions; China; Crop modeling; Crop yield; Food security; Global gridded crop model; Grain crops; Models comparisons; Multi-model ensemble; Yield gap; Food supply; agricultural management; agricultural modeling; cereal; climate change; crop yield; phenology; soybean; China",Article,Scopus

As a result, better understanding of the magnitude and nature of the influence of variable UK weather conditions can be beneficial to many retailers and other stakeholders. This study addresses the dearth of research in this area by quantifying the relationship between different weather conditions and trading outcomes. By employing comprehensive daily sales data for a major high street retailer with over 2000 stores across England and adopting a random forest methodology, the study quantifies the influence of various weather conditions on daily retail sales. Results indicate that weather impact is greatest in the summer and spring months and that wind is consistently found to be the most influential weather condition. The top five most weather-dependent categories cover a range of different product types, with health foods emerging as the most susceptible to the weather. Also, sales from out-of-town stores show a far more complex relationship with the weather than those from traditional high street stores with the regions London and the South East experiencing the greatest levels of influence. Various implications of these findings for retail stakeholders are discussed and the scope for further research outlined. © 2021, The Author(s).","High street retailers; Machine learning; Retail; UK weather","research program; retailing; stakeholder; summer; weather; weather forecasting; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",Article,Scopus

Numerous experiments have been conducted to assess the performance of CA under various local conditions, and meta-analysis has become a standard approach in agricultural sector for analysing and summarizing the experimental data. Meta-analysis provides valuable synthetic information based on mean effect size estimation. However, summarizing large amounts of information by way of a single mean effect value is not always satisfactory, especially when considering agricultural practices. Indeed, their impacts on crop yields are often non-linear, and vary widely depending on a number of factors, including soil properties and local climate conditions. To address this issue, here we present a machine learning approach to produce data-driven global maps describing the spatial distribution of the productivity of CA versus conventional tillage (CT). Our objective is to evaluate and compare several machine-learning models for their ability in estimating the productivity of CA systems, and to analyse uncertainty in the model outputs. We consider different usages, including classification, point regression and quantile regression. Our approach covers the comparison of 12 different machine learning algorithms, model training, tuning with cross-validation, testing, and global projection of results. The performances of these algorithms are compared based on a recent global dataset including more than 4,000 pairs of crop yield data for CA vs. CT. We show that random forest has the best performance in classification and regression, while quantile regression forest performs better than quantile neural networks in quantile regression. The best algorithms are used to map crop productivity of CA vs. CT at the global scale, and results reveal that the performance of CA vs. CT is characterized by a strong spatial variability, and that the probability of yield gain with CA is highly dependent on geographical locations. This result demonstrates that our approach is much more informative than simply presenting average effect sizes produced by standard meta-analyses, and paves the way for such probabilistic, spatially-explicit approaches in many other fields of research.

In this study, conducted as a pilot test for PMFBY during the kharif season of 2018, technologies based on the Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS) were tested and implemented for estimating GP-level crop yields of bajra (pearl millet, Pennisetum glaucum) in Firozabad District of Uttar Pradesh and rice (Oryza sativa) in Kendujhar District of Odisha. A combination of Synthetic Aperture Radar and optical data was used to map crop extent. Daily 2-km grids of input weather conditions were generated using a machine learning algorithm that incorporated station observations, satellite data, and reanalysis model outputs. Required crop biophysical estimates of leaf area index (LAI) and the fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) were derived using daily cloud-screened MODIS 250-m data from the Terra and Aqua satellites and a modified MOD15 LAI/FPAR backup algorithm. A light-use-efficiency (LUE) model adapted from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) algorithm (MOD17-GPP/NPP) was then used to spatially estimate crop yields. Crop extent maps, daily climate and gap-filled FPAR and the LUE model were used to estimate above-ground biomass, which was accumulated over the growing season and converted to crop yields using a crop-specific harvest index. The estimated yields at 250 m were aggregated within each GP and compared with crop yield data from crop cutting experiments (CCEs) conducted in 142 GPs for rice and 42 GPs for bajra. Crop extent mapping was 96% accurate in rice and 80% in bajra when validated with field surveys. A comparison of modeled yields with CCE yields showed a promising performance by the model in both crops (rice: r = 0.80, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 411 kg/ha, mean absolute error (MAE) = 359 kg/ha, percent error (PE) = 7, Observed mean = 1500 kg/ha; Bajra: r = 0.84, RMSE = 309 kg/ha, MAE = 262 kg/ha, PE = −12.8, Observed mean = 1859 kg/ha). Although the approach showed promising results for both crops, further progress is needed to ensure consistent and reliable results. Some of the needed improvements include incorporating a dynamic crop calendar, improved maximum LUE estimates, and harvest index values that represent crop varietals grown in India. Routinely conducted CCEs in different crops and seasons around the country could provide a valuable resource for improving these parameters and, ultimately, crop yield estimates. © 2021, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","Crop cutting experiments (CCEs); Crop mapping; Crop yield; LUE model; MODIS; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2","aboveground biomass; agricultural land; Aqua (satellite); crop yield; cutting (process); growing season; integrated approach; leaf area index; MODIS; photosynthetically active radiation; satellite data; Terra (satellite); India; Odisha; Uttar Pradesh",Article,Scopus

Evidence suggests that “well-trained” DL models can significantly simplify and accelerate trait extraction as well as expand the suite of extractable traits. Training a DL model typically requires the availability of copious amounts of annotated data; however, creating large-scale annotated dataset requires nontrivial efforts, time, and resources. This limitation has become a major bottleneck in deploying DL tools in practice. Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods give exciting solution to this problem, as these methods use unlabeled data to produce pretrained models for subsequent fine-tuning on labeled data and have demonstrated superior transfer learning performance on down-stream classification tasks. We investigated the application of SSL methods for plant stress classification using few labels. We select a plant stress classification problem to test the effectiveness of SSL, as it is a fundamentally challenging problem due to (a) disease classification which depends on the abnormalities in a small number of pixels, (b) high data imbalance across different classes, and (c) fewer annotated and available plant stress images than in other domains. We compared seven SSL approaches spanning four broad classes of SSL methods on soybean [Glycine max L. (Merr.)] plant stress dataset and report that pretraining on unlabeled plant stress images significantly outperforms transfer learning methods using random initialization for plant stress classification. In summary, SSL-based model initialization and data curation improves annotation efficiency for plant stress classification tasks and will circumvent data annotation challenges associated with DL methods. © 2022 The Authors.

Previous published works have looked at statistical and machine learning methods to forecast the demand of agro-food such as ARIMA and SVM methods. However, ordinary least squares (OLS) and neural network (NN) methods have shown better results in modelling time series data. For that reason, the primary objective of this study is to model and forecast the consumption per capita (PCC) of several selected fresh agro-food commodities in Malaysia using the OLS and NN methods. The secondary objectives of the paper include investigating the performance of OLS against NNs with three different topologies, discussing the correlation between Malaysia GDP per capita and the agro-food commodity PCC, and finally assessing whether the PCC data are increasing over time or decreasing over time and whether the trend in either direction is statistically significant by using the Mann-Kendall statistical test. Based on the results of the agro-food consumption per capita (PCC) forecasting, several critical agro-food commodities are also identified in this work. The material of the study consists of the per capita consumption of thirty-three (33) agro-food items that can be categorized into rice, livestock, vegetables, fisheries, and fruits, total gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and the total population of Malaysia between 2010 and 2017. Based on the results obtained, the neural network (NNT1) model was found to produce the lowest total MSE of 17.95, for all 33 fresh agro-food investigated in this study. Several agro-food commodities have been identified as having significant positive (e.g., rice, spinach, cabbage, celery cabbage, eggplant, cucumber, poultry, lamb, squid, tuna, star fruit, jackfruit, durian, sweet corn, and coconut) or negative (e.g., pork, mackerel, papaya, guava, mangosteen, pineapple, banana, rambutan, and watermelon) trends using the Mann-Kendall trend test. This study also demonstrated that the production of critical agro-food commodities (e.g., rice, chili, cabbage, celery cabbage, poultry (chicken/duck), beef, lamb, crab, mango, and coconut) should be improved to ensure self-sufficiency ratios (SSRs) of more than 100% to accommodate the increased projected consumption in Malaysia by the year 2025. This paper concludes that neural network methods produce better prediction, and future works include forecasting agro-food demand based on other independent variables such as weather conditions, disease outbreak, and stock market trends. There is a need to explore further the capability of ensemble models or hybrid models based on deep learning methods using multi-source data, as these have been shown to improve the performance of the base model. With these ensemble models combined with multi-source data, a more comprehensive analysis of the PCC can be obtained. © 2022 Rayner Alfred et al.",,"Economics; Financial markets; Food supply; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Machine learning; Meats; Plants (botany); Shellfish; Time series; Agro foods; Food commodity; Gross domestic products; Malaysia; Neural network method; Ordinary least squares; Per capita; Percapita consumption; Performance; Square networks; Fruits",Article,Scopus

Although canopy temperature differences (CTD) provide important information for evaluating canopy photosynthesis, the measurement of CTD is still a labor-intensive task. Therefore, we designed this study to establish a model for predicting CTD under different field conditions using meteorological data and evaluated the environmental response of CTD using the established model. Our study collected 2,056,264 CTD data points from two rice cultivars having different photosynthetic capacities, ‘Koshihikari’ and ‘Takanari’, and then used these data to create a novel model using a neural network (NN). The input variables were limited to meteorological data, and the output variable was set to CTD. The established NN model produced a prediction accuracy of R2 = 0.792 and RMSE = 0.605°C. We then used this NN model to simulate the CTD response of the Koshihikari and Takanari cultivars in response to various environmental changes. These predictions revealed that Takanari had a lower CTD than Koshihikari when exposed to high relative humidity (RH) or low to moderate solar radiation (Rs). In contrast, the CTD of Koshihikari tended to be lower than that of Takanari under lower RH or higher Rs. This result implies that the advantages of the single-leaf gas exchange system in Takanari can be mitigated under extremely high-VPD conditions. Thus, our new method may provide a powerful tool to gain a better understanding of gas exchange, growth processes, and varietal differences in rice cultivated under field conditions. © 2022 The Author(s).

In the marrow of human bones, leukaemia is developed and is responsible for blood cell generation with leukocytes and WBC, and if any cell gets blasted, then it may become a cause of death. Therefore, the diagnosis of leukaemia in its early stages helps greatly in the treatment along with saving human lives. Subsequently, in terms of detection, image segmentation techniques play a vital role, and they turn out to be the important image processing steps for the extraction of feature patterns from the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) type of blood cancer. Moreover, the image segmentation technique focuses on the division of cells by segmenting a microscopic image into background and cancer blood cell nucleus, which is well-known as the Region Of Interest (ROI). As a result, in this article, we attempt to build a segmentation technique capable of solving blood cell nucleus segmentation issues using four distinct scenarios, including K-means, FCM (Fuzzy Cmeans), K-means with FFA (Firefly Algorithm), and FCM with FFA. Also, we determine the most effective method of blood cell nucleus segmentation, which we subsequently use for the Leukaemia classification model. Finally, using the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) as a classifier, we developed a leukaemia cancer classification model from the microscopic images. The proposed system's classification accuracy is tested using the CNN to test the model on the ALL-IDB dataset and equate it to the current state of the art. In terms of experimental analysis, we observed that the accuracy of the model is near to 99%, and it is far better than other existing models that are designed to segment and classify the types of leukaemia cancer in terms of ALL. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Remote sensing provides nondestructive and early predictions of yield and GPC, respectively. However, whether it is possible to simultaneously predict yield and GPC in one model and the accuracy and influencing factors are still unclear. In this study, we made a systematic comparison of different deep learning models in terms of data fusion, time-series feature extraction, and multitask learning. The results showed that time-series data fusion significantly improved yield and GPC prediction accuracy with R2 values of 0.817 and 0.809. Multitask learning achieved simultaneous prediction of yield and GPC with comparable accuracy to the single-task model. We further proposed a two-to-two model that combines data fusion (two kinds of data sources for input) and multitask learning (two outputs) and compared different feature extraction layers, including RNN (recurrent neural network), LSTM (long short-term memory), CNN (convolutional neural network), and attention module. The two-to-two model with the attention module achieved the best prediction accuracy for yield (R2 = 0:833) and GPC (R2 = 0:846). The temporal distribution of feature importance was visualized based on the attention feature values. Although the temporal patterns of structural traits and spectral traits were inconsistent, the overall importance of both structural traits and spectral traits at the postanthesis stage was more important than that at the preanthesis stage. This study provides new insights into the simultaneous prediction of yield and GPC using deep learning from time-series proximal sensing, which may contribute to the accurate and efficient predictions of agricultural production.

Artificial neural network (ANN) has advantage to not require priori assumptions about the relationships between inputs and the output allowing great flexibility to handle different types of complex non-additive effects, such as dominance and epistasis. Despite this advantage, the biological interpretability of ANNs is still limited. The aim of this research was to estimate the heritability and markers effects for two traits in Coffea canephora using an additive-dominance architecture ANN and to compare it with genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP). The data used consists of 51 clones of C. canephora varietal Conilon, 32 of varietal group Robusta and 82 intervarietal hybrids. From this, 165 phenotyped individuals were genotyped for 14,387 SNPs. Due to the high computational cost of ANNs, we used Bagging decision tree to reduce the dimensionality of the data, selecting the markers that accumulated 70% of the total importance. An ANN with three hidden layers was run, each varying from 1 to 40 neurons summing 64,000 neural networks. The network architectures with the best predictive ability were selected. The best architectures were composed by 4, 15, and 33 neurons in the first, second and third hidden layers, respectively, for yield, and by 13, 20, and 24 neurons, respectively for rust resistance. The predictive ability was greater when using ANN with three hidden layers than using one hidden layer and GBLUP, with 0.72 and 0.88 for yield and coffee leaf rust resistance, respectively. The concordance rate (CR) of the 10% larger markers effects among the methods varied between 10% and 13.8%, for additive effects and between 5.4% and 11.9% for dominance effects. The narrow-sense (h2 a) and dominance-only (h2 d) heritability estimates were 0.25 and 0.06, respectively, for yield, and 0.67 and 0.03, respectively for rust resistance. The ANN was able to estimate the heritabilities from an additive-dominance genomic architectures and the ANN with three hidden layers obtained best predictive ability when compared with those obtained from GBLUP and ANN with one hidden layer. © 2022 Public Library of Science.

Image preprocessing stage - applying an integrated excess green and excess red difference (ExGR) index. The classification stage is the application of the method that we choose depending on the system's operating conditions. At the final stage, a neural network trained using the Resilient Propagation method is used, which determines the rate of watering of plants in the current sector of the location of the sprinkler. The selected methods of pretreatment and classification made it possible to achieve an accuracy of plant identification up to 93%, growth stages - up to 92% (with unconsolidated maize sowing and good lighting). System performance up to 100 plants in one second, which exceeds the performance of similar systems. The neural network showed an accuracy of 92% on the training set and 87% on the test set.

The new model has a similar model structure to the existing probability distributed rainfall runoff models (PDM), such as HyMOD. However, the model utilizes a new distribution function for soil water storage capacity, which leads to the SCS (Soil Conservation Service) curve number (CN) method when the initial soil water storage is set to zero. Therefore, the developed model is a unification of the PDM and CN methods and is called the PDM–CN model in this paper. Besides runoff modeling, the calculation of daily evaporation in the model is also dependent on the distribution function, since the spatial variability of soil water storage affects the catchment-scale evaporation. The generated runoff is partitioned into direct runoff and groundwater recharge, which are then routed through quick and slow storage tanks, respectively. Total discharge is the summation of quick flow from the quick storage tank and base flow from the slow storage tank. The new model with 5 parameters is applied to 92 catchments for simulating daily streamflow and evaporation and compared with AWMB, SACRAMENTO, and SIMHYD models. The performance of the model is slightly better than HyMOD but is not better compared with the 14-parameter model (SACRAMENTO) in the calibration, and does not perform as well in the validation period as the 7-parameter model (SIMHYD) in some areas, based on the NSE values. The linkage between the PDM–CN model and long-term water balance model is also presented, and a two-parameter mean annual water balance equation is derived from the proposed PDM–CN model. © 2022 by the authors.

The YOLOv4 model was used for rice ear quick detection of rice images captured by a UAV. The Kriging interpolation algorithm was used in ArcGIS to make rice density prescription maps. Mature rice images collected by a UAV were marked manually and used to build the training and testing datasets. The resolution of the images was 300 × 300 pixels. The batch size was 2, and the initial learning rate was 0.01, and the mean average precision (mAP) of the best trained model was 98.84%. Exceptionally, the network ability to detect rice in different health states was also studied with a mAP of 95.42% in the no infection rice images set, 98.84% in the mild infection rice images set, 94.35% in the moderate infection rice images set, and 93.36% in the severe infection rice images set. According to the severity of rice sheath blight, which can cause rice leaves to wither and turn yellow, the blighted grain percentage increased and the thousand-grain weight decreased, the rice images were divided into these four infection levels. The ability of the network model (R2 = 0.844) was compared with traditional image processing segmentation methods (R2 = 0.396) based on color and morphology features and machine learning image segmentation method (Support Vector Machine, SVM R2 = 0.0817, and K-means R2 = 0.1949) for rice ear counting.

In response, the agroforestry technology intercropping of Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.)) and Maize (Zea mays L.) was developed to complement conventional soil fertility management technologies. However, diversified information on the profitability of Gliricidia‐Maize intercropping system in dryland areas is scanty. Using data from the Gliricidia and maize models of the Next Generation version of the Agriculture Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM), this study estimates the profitability of the Gliricidia‐Maize system relative to an unfertilized sole maize system. Results show significant heterogeneity in profitability indicators both in absolute and relative economic terms. Aggregated over a 20‐year cycle, Gliricidia‐Maize intercropping exhibited a higher Net Present Value (NPV = Tsh 19,238,798.43) and Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR = 4.27) than the unfertilized sole maize system. The NPV and BCR of the latter were Tsh 10,934,669.90 and 3.59, respectively. Moreover, the returns to labour per person day in the Gliricidia‐Maize system was 1.5 times those of the unfertilized sole maize system. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the profitability of the Gliricidia‐Maize system is more negatively affected by the decrease in output prices than the increase in input prices. A 30% decrease in the former leads to a decrease in NPV and BCR by 38% and 30%, respectively. Despite the higher initial costs of the agroforestry establishment, the 30% increase in input prices affects more disproportionally unfertilized sole maize than the Gliricidia‐Maize system in absolute economic terms, i.e., 11.1% versus 8.8% decrease in NPV. In relative economic terms, an equal magnitude of change in input prices exerts the same effect on the unfertilized sole maize and the Gliricidia‐maize systems. This result implies that the monetary benefits accrued after the first year of agroforestry establishment offset the initial investment costs. The Gliricidia‐Maize intercropping technology therefore is profitable with time, and it can contribute to increased household income and food security. Helping farmers to overcome initial investment costs and manage agroforestry technologies well to generate additional benefits is critical for the successful scaling of the Gliricidia‐ Maize intercropping technology in dryland areas of Dodoma, Tanzania. : © 2021 by the authors.

Phenological characteristics derived from time series of RS imagery provide a valuable information source to estimate crop yield accurately. In this study, we computed spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) from time series of Landsat 8 and PROBA-V images to extract temporal characteristics of alfalfa farms throughout the growth periods in three consecutive years in the Moghan plain, Iran. Then, several new spectral-temporal features were developed based on phenological characteristics of alfalfa during the growing season. Such features particularly describe geometry and variations of the temporal curves and are thus invaluable in describing phenological attributes. We conducted several feature selection methods due to the variety of features. Machine learning (ML) methods, including ridge, lasso, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), and Support Vector Regression (ν-SVR) were utilized to build inversion models in order to estimate alfalfa yields, where the results showed satisfactory performance of GPR using the selected features by GS (RMSE=1114.0 kg/ha), RReliefF (RMSE=1157.7 kg/ha) and Boruta (RMSE=1210.2 kg/ha) as compared to the complete feature dataset (RMSE=1237.4 kg/ha).

The main objective of this study was to determine and define those locations capable of wheat cultivation with irrigation in the municipality of N’goussa (Southern Algeria). Expert opinion (EO) method was used for selecting minimum soil data set (MDS-EO), where six influencing soil properties (sand, pH, salinity, organic matter, gypsum and lime) and other three key parameters (slope, land use/land cover, and proximity to roads and electricity network) were considered important for irrigated wheat cultivation in the study area. Indicators were weighted according to principal component analysis (PCA) loadings and summed. PCA revealed that the selected nine indicators are appropriate for accounting 73.63% of the total variance. Two maps of land suitability were created here (expressed as a soil quality index within a range from 0 to 1) from multivariate analysis and already known standard scoring functions (SSFs) by using two data sets (pure and scored). The distribution of soil quality index (IQI) showed that above 70% of the land was moderately (MS) to highly suitable (HS) for irrigated wheat. The estimation accuracy of soil quality classes has been evaluated using random forests (RF), having as a dependent variable the final class of land suitability used in each map. It was determined that estimation accuracy could reach 60% (pure data set) and 65% (scored data set) at 0.5 cut-off value for soil quality classes. Final prioritizing according to ranks of sensitivity index (SI) and efficiency ratio (ER) showed that IQI obtained from scored data set is the most suitable approach in soil quality assessment of arid areas. Therefore, it could be applied in southern Algeria for land management, integrated planning and environmental assessments. © 2021 British Society of Soil Science",,"crop yield; irrigation system; multivariate analysis; principal component analysis; soil quality; wheat; Algeria",Article,Scopus

To some extent, the prediction model for crop yields combining the crop mechanism model with statistical regression model (SRM) can improve the timeliness and robustness of the final yield prediction. In this study, the accumulated biomass (AB) simulated by the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model and multiple climate indices (e.g., climate suitability indices and extreme climate indices) were incorporated into SRM to predict the wheat yield in the North China Plain (NCP). The results showed that the prediction model based on the random forest (RF) algorithm outperformed the prediction models using other regression algorithms. The prediction for the wheat yield at SM (the period from the start of grain filling to the milky stage) based on RF can obtain a higher accuracy (r = 0.86, RMSE = 683 kg ha−1 and MAE = 498 kg ha−1). With the progression of wheat growth, the performances of yield prediction models improved gradually. The prediction of yield at FS (the period from flowering to the start of grain filling) can achieve higher precision and a longer lead time, which can be viewed as the optimum period providing the decent performance of the yield prediction and about one month’s lead time. In addition, the precision of the predicted yield for the irrigated sites was higher than that for the rainfed sites. The APSIM-simulated AB had an importance of above 30% for the last three prediction events, including FIF event (the period from floral initiation to flowering), FS event (the period from flowering to the start of grain filling) and SM event (the period from the start of grain filling to the milky stage), which ranked first in the prediction model. The climate suitability indices, with a higher rank for every prediction event, played an important role in the prediction model. The winter wheat yield in the NCP was seriously affected by the low temperature events before flowering, the high temperature events after flowering and water stress. We hope that the prediction model can be used to develop adaptation strategies to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on crop productivity and provide the data support for food security. © 2022 by the authors.","APSIM model; climate indices; machine learning; North China Plain; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

(Merr.)] roots and bacteria (Bradyrhizobium japonicum) lead to the development of nodules, important legume root structures where atmospheric nitrogen (N2) is fixed into bio-available ammonia (NH3) for plant growth and development. With the recent development of the Soybean Nodule Acquisition Pipeline (SNAP), nodules can more easily be quantified and evaluated for genetic diversity and growth patterns across unique soybean root system architectures. We explored six diverse soybean genotypes across three field year combinations in three early vegetative stages of development and report the unique relationships between soybean nodules in the taproot and non-taproot growth zones of diverse root system architectures of these genotypes. We found unique growth patterns in the nodules of taproots showing genotypic differences in how nodules grew in count, size, and total nodule area per genotype compared to non-taproot nodules. We propose that nodulation should be defined as a function of both nodule count and individual nodule area resulting in a total nodule area per root or growth regions of the root. We also report on the relationships between the nodules and total nitrogen in the seed at maturity, finding a strong correlation between the taproot nodules and final seed nitrogen at maturity. The applications of these findings could lead to an enhanced understanding of the plant-Bradyrhizobium relationship and exploring these relationships could lead to leveraging greater nitrogen use efficiency and nodulation carbon to nitrogen production efficiency across the soybean germplasm. © 2022 The Authors.

Its tremendous resistance to the environment, ease of propagation, and incredibly low infectious dosage make it an attractive organism for biowarfare. Current research on the classification of Coxiella and features influencing its presence in the soil is generally confined to statistical techniques. Machine learning other than traditional approaches can help us better predict epidemiological modeling for this soil-based pathogen of public significance. We developed a two-phase feature-ranking technique for the pathogen on a new soil feature dataset. The feature ranking applies methods such as ReliefF (RLF), OneR (ONR), and correlation (CR) for the first phase and a combination of techniques utilizing weighted scores to determine the final soil attribute ranks in the second phase. Different classification methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) have been utilized for the classification of soil attribute dataset for Coxiella positive and negative soils. The feature-ranking methods established that potassium, chromium, cadmium, nitrogen, organic matter, and soluble salts are the most significant attributes. At the same time, manganese, clay, phosphorous, copper, and lead are the least contributing soil features for the prevalence of the bacteria. However, potassium is the most influential feature, and manganese is the least significant soil feature. The attribute ranking using RLF generates the most promising results among the ranking methods by generating an accuracy of 80.85% for MLP, 79.79% for LR, and 79.8% for LDA. Overall, SVM and MLP are the best-performing classifiers, where SVM yields an accuracy of 82.98% and 81.91% for attribute ranking by CR and RLF; and MLP generates an accuracy of 76.60% for ONR. Thus, machine models can help us better understand the environment, assisting in the prevalence of bacteria and decreasing the chances of false classification. Subsequently, this can assist in controlling epidemics and alleviating the devastating effect on the socio-economics of society. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"manganese; Coxiella burnetii; human; machine learning; soil; support vector machine; Coxiella burnetii; Humans; Machine Learning; Manganese; Neural Networks, Computer; Soil; Support Vector Machine",Article,Scopus

In this paper, a coupling model of soil Cd adsorption and desorption was developed based on quantitative retention factors to explore the sensitivity of soil environmental factors for Cd pollution and quantify the spatial distribution pattern of Cd pollution vulnerability in highly heterogeneous soils in China. Results showed that: (1) The type of background electrolyte affected Cd adsorption and desorption capacity in soil solution.

The accurate estimation of GPP is critical to understanding the regional carbon cycle. With the development of machine learning (ML) theory, machine learning models are increasingly used to study complex phenomena with high variability in time and space. In this study, three machine learning models (Support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural network (ANN), and long short-term memory networks (LSTM)) were investigated for predicting GPP in northwest China and compared them with the traditional physical models. Carbon flux, various environmental factors, and maize growth indices were measured in the maize field over five years in northwest China. The rigorous analysis which included statistical comparison and cross-validation for the prediction of GPP confirmed that the machine learning models performed better than traditional physical models. And the SVR model performed the best among the considered ML models with the highest nash-efficiency coefficient and the lowest root mean squared error. The machine learning model also outperformed the traditional physical models on cloudy days and after irrigation. The SVR achieved good prediction accuracy and high stability. With different training data sets, the ANN and LSTM were relatively more sensitive to the training data set. When the training data was sufficient, SVR, ANN and LSTM could achieve similar prediction accuracy, but SVR was slightly higher. When the training data was small, the simulation accuracy of SVR was better than ANN and LSTM. The performance of ANN and LSTM was more sensitive to parameter selection, and the relationship between model performance and parameter selection had no obvious regularity. Based on this comprehensive comparison study, it was elicited that the SVR model can be successfully applied to GPP simulation of maize fields, which provided a new perspective for the application of machine learning modeling in GPP simulation. © 2022","Artificial neural network; Gross primary productivity; Long short-term memory networks; Support vector regression","Brain; Carbon dioxide; Forecasting; Irrigation; Learning systems; Mean square error; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Gross primary productivity; Long short-term memory network; Machine learning models; Maize fields; Memory network; NorthWest China; Physical modelling; Prediction accuracy; Support vector regression models; Support vector regressions; Long short-term memory; agricultural land; artificial neural network; drip irrigation; estimation method; growth; machine learning; maize; primary production; regression analysis; support vector machine; China",Article,Scopus

Extreme learning machine (ELM), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and artificial neural network (ANN) methods were used to model WP and WPe. A dataset including 200 field data was collected from five treatment and control sections in the Malekan region, located in the southeast of Lake Urmia, Iran, for the crop year 2020–2021. Six different input combinations were introduced to estimate WP and WPe.

Speech emotion recognition (SER) identifies the speaker's emotion from the speech signal. Nowadays, (SER) plays a vital role in real-time applications such as human–machine interface, lie detection, virtual reality, security, audio mining, etc. But in SER, filtering the noise content and extracting the emotional features is complex. Moreover, incorporating digital filters increases the cost and complexity of the system. Thus, a novel hybrid firefly-based recurrent neural speech recognition (FbRNSR) was developed with preprocessing and a feature analysis module to classify human emotions based on the speech input. The extracted features from the feature extraction module are trained to classify the emotions as happy, sad, or average. Moreover, the incorporation of firefly fitness improves the classification rate. The presented model is executed in Python, and the results are estimated. The performance of the presented approach is analyzed using the confusion matrix. The designed model achieved high true positive rate of 99.34%, true negative rate of 99.12%, false positive of 99.21%, and false negative rate of 99.07%. The designed model achieved 99.2% accuracy, 98.9% recall, and precision value for the speech signal dataset. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach are proved by comparing it with the existing techniques. Hence, this method is applicable in various sectors such as medicine, security, etc., to identify the state of emotions among the people. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Firefly algorithm; Recurrent neural network; Speech emotion identification; Speech recognition; Speech signal","Audio acoustics; Audio signal processing; Bioluminescence; Complex networks; Digital filters; Emotion Recognition; Feature extraction; Optimization; Python; Speech communication; Speech recognition; Virtual reality; Automatic systems; Designed models; Emotion identifications; Firefly algorithms; Network-based; Recurrent networks; Speech emotion identification; Speech emotion recognition; Speech emotions; Speech signals; Recurrent neural networks",Article,Scopus

Use of machine learning (ML) methods for fusion of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multi-sensor data can improve the prediction accuracy of crop yield. For this, five ML algorithms including Cubist, support vector machine (SVM), deep neural network (DNN), ridge regression (RR) and random forest (RF) were used for multi-sensor data fusion and ensemble learning for grain yield prediction in wheat. A set of thirty wheat cultivars and breeding lines were grown under three irrigation treatments i.e., light, moderate and high irrigation treatments to evaluate the yield prediction capabilities of a low-cost multi-sensor (RGB, multi-spectral and thermal infrared) UAV platform. Multi-sensor data fusion-based yield prediction showed higher accuracy compared to individual-sensor data in each ML model. The coefficient of determination (R2) values for Cubist, SVM, DNN and RR models regarding grain yield prediction were observed from 0.527 to 0.670. Moreover, the results of ensemble learning through integrating the above models illustrated further increase in accuracy. The predictions of ensemble learning showed high R2 values up to 0.692, which was higher as compared to individual ML models across the multi-sensor data. Root mean square error (RMSE), residual prediction deviation (RPD) and ratio of prediction performance to inter-quartile range (RPIQ) were calculated to be 0.916 t ha−1, 1.771 and 2.602, respectively. The results proved that low altitude UAV-based multi-sensor data can be used for early grain yield prediction using data fusion and an ensemble learning framework with high accuracy. This high-throughput phenotyping approach is valuable for improving the efficiency of selection in large breeding activities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Data fusion; Machine learning; Phenotyping; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Wheat","altitude; crop yield; cultivar; machine learning; unmanned vehicle; wheat",Article,Scopus

Long-term behaviors of vegetation indices were thus analyzed between 2000 and 2018. By using SAR data from Sentinel-1, an Artificial Neural Network-based algorithm was implemented for estimating soil moisture and monthly maps for 2018 have been generated to be compared with information derived from optical indices. Moreover, a novel drought severity index was developed and applied to available data. The index was obtained by combining vegetation soil difference index, derived from optical data, and soil moisture content derived from SAR data. The proposed index was found capable of complementing optical and microwave sensitivity to drought-related parameters, although ground data are missing for correctly validating the results, by capturing drought patterns and their temporal evolution better than indices based only on microwave or optical data. © 2023 The Author(s).

First, the growing neural gas (GNG) method is utilized to cluster the TWSA data to find similar patterns. The Silhouette Chou Davies (SCD) validity measure, a combination of three robust cluster validity measures, is used to evaluate the performance of the GNG method. Then, the feasibility of deep learning Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), shallow learning Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN), and Random Forest (RF) are examined in downscaling GRACE-derived TWSA using only remote sensing images. The results indicate that the deep learning method outperforms the RF and FFNN models by 7 % and 18 %, respectively. Then, the Ground Water Storage (GWS) data are isolated from TWSA, showing an agreement between the GRACE-derived GWS and ground-based measurements with R2 = 0.76. Additionally, the downscaled TWSA is used to generate annual drought frequency and change detection maps for the GWS from 2002 to 2016. Annual standardized precipitation index (SPI) drought frequency maps are also produced to gain deeper insight into the water resource scarcity of Iran. The results indicate that Iran has experienced water resource overexploitation since 2011 for agricultural activities, while meteorological drought is a trigger and intensifier for the water crisis in Iran. According to the results, Iran experienced exceptional drought in some regions, and the GWS has decreased all over the country. In addition, further analysis of Iran's water resources is provided until 2022.

In this paper, an automated detection method is proposed to extract Pedicularis and reveal the spatial distribution. Based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images, this paper adopts logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest classifiers for multi-class classification. One-class SVM (OCSVM), isolation forest, and positive and unlabeled learning (PUL) algorithms are used for one-class classification. The results are as follows: (1) The accuracy of multi-class classifiers is better than that of one-class classifiers, but it requires all classes that occur in the image to be exhaustively assigned labels. Among the one-class classifiers that only need to label positive or positive and labeled data, the PUL has the highest F score of 0.9878. (2) PUL performs the most robustly to change features in one-class classifiers. All one-class classifiers prove that the green band is essential for extracting Pedicularis. (3) The parameters of the PUL are easy to tune, and the training time is easy to control. Therefore, PUL is a promising one-class classification method for Pedicularis extraction, which can accurately identify the distribution range of Pedicularis to promote grassland administration. © 2022 by the authors.","one-class classification; Pedicularis; positive and unlabeled learning (PUL); semi-supervised learning (SSL); unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); vegetation extraction",,Article,Scopus

Our analysis reveals the extent of the deliberate arson of farmland in Iraq and Northeast Syria in 2019–2020. In comparison, only a few fires of farmland were observed in 2007–2013 in Iraq, and Al-Hassakeh, Syria, that became a stronghold of the Islamic State (IS) in 2013. In 2014–2017, we find evidence for increased farmland fires in various locations that closely tracked the military withdrawal of IS between 2015/2016 and 2017 when it lost most of its territory. We find that although the burned area in wheat-producing regions of Iraq (Ninewa and Kirkuk) and Syria have recently increased, the increase in the percentage burned area of agricultural lands in Iraq’s Ninewa and Kirkuk was not unprecedented. MODIS overestimates burned areas when in low fire activity while it underestimates it when fire activity is high, compared to a Landsat–Sentinel-2 combination. A significant positive relationship (r = 0.83) exists between the number of IS-related incidents and the percent burned agricultural area during 2019, which raises questions about the future strategy of the IS terror group and its use and targeting of the water-food complex. © 2022, The Author(s).","Conflict; dNBR; Fire; ISIS; Remote sensing; Terrorism; VIIRS",,Article,Scopus

The CNRM-CM5 was selected as an appropriate model due to the higher coefficient of determination (R2) value for future the prediction of early century (2021–2045), mid-century (2046–2070), and late century (2071–2095) with baseline period of 1991–2017.

However, the robustness in fertilizer recommendations appeared to be less responsive to extreme abiotic stress conditions, due to the lack of post-fertilization seasonal weather information. Objective or research question: This study employed four machine learning models, namely, support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting (GB), random forest (RF), and ridge regression (RR) to predict the site-specific EONR values of canola crops, based on a 22-site-year field study across eastern Canada. Methods: Model performance was assessed using the ‘leave-one-out’ approach under three scenarios, i.e., different combinations of input variables, including current seasonal weather data before N topdressing, 10-year historical weather records, and field management and crop traits. Result: Results of this study showed that including historical weather data highly improved prediction accuracy for EONR in a variety of canola growing environments. The RF model outperformed other models in predicting site-specific EONRs, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9, a standard deviation of 23 kg N ha−1 and a relative error of 2%. For 16 of the 22 test environments, the EONR predicted using RF fell within its confidence range, indicating that the prediction has a 73% chance of being an acceptable recommendation. Overall, incorporating historical weather data is essential for successfully predicting crop N requirements under normal and stressful growing conditions. Conclusions: The results indicate that with a base fertilizer of 50 kg N ha−1, the recommended topdressing application rate varied from 50 to 110 kg N ha−1 in moist seasons, but decreased to 20–50 kg N ha−1 in hot and dry years, for sustainable canola production in eastern Canada. Implications: Appropriately incorporating historical weather data and soil properties into machine learning-based algorithms can be used to precisely guide fertilizer N management on canola crops under diverse climatic stress conditions. This approach promises to optimize seed yield and reduce nitrogen losses to the environment for sustainable canola production in Canada. © 2022","Brassica napus L.; Drought stress; Machine-learning algorithms; N recommendation; Vegetation index","crop plant; fertilizer application; machine learning; NDVI; support vector machine; Canada",Article,Scopus

Wet chemical analytical methods are traditionally used to determine the precise chemical composition of manure to manage the application of animal waste to the soil. However, such methods require significant resources to carry out the processes. Affordable, rapid, and accurate methods of analyses of various chemical components present in animal manure, therefore, are valuable in managing soil and mitigating water pollution. In this study, a stacked regression ensemble approach using near-infrared spectroscopy was developed to simultaneously determine the amount of dry matter, total ammonium nitrogen, total nitrogen, phosphorus pentoxide, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, and potassium oxide contents in both cattle and poultry manure collected from livestock production areas in France and Reunion Island. The performance of the stacked regression, an ensemble learning algorithm that is formed by collating the well-performing models for prediction was then compared with that of various other machine learning techniques, including support vector regression (linear, polynomial, and radial), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, ridge regression, elastic net, partial least squares, random forests, recursive partitioning and regression trees, and boosted trees. Results show that stack regression performed optimally well in predicting the seven abovementioned chemical constituents in the testing set and may provide an alternative to the traditional partial least squares method for a more accurate and simultaneous method in determining the chemical properties of animal manure. © 2022 by the authors.","cattle manure; livestock production; machine learning; near-infrared spectroscopy; poultry manure; stacked regression",,Article,Scopus

Simulations of future crop production show that climate change is likely to reduce the yields of the major grain crops around the world, but the impacts on potato production have yet to be determined. A model ensemble consisting of five process-based and one statistical model was used to estimate the impact of climate change on fully irrigated, well-fertilized potato crop across the USA under the RCP 8.5 scenario of high emissions. Results indicate that increasing temperature will reduce potato yields, but this will be mostly compensated by elevated atmospheric CO2. Yields are predicted to decline with climate change in the current highest-yielding areas, which might experience the highest rises in growing season temperature during short hot summers. Simulated yields increase slightly elsewhere in the southern regions of the USA. Planting potatoes earlier as adaptation to avoid hot summers might improve yields in most regions. Water use by the potato crop is predicted to decline despite higher temperatures, due to a shorter growing season and increased water use efficiency under elevated atmospheric CO2. With higher yields in many regions, crop uptake for (nitrogen + phosphorus + potassium) NPK fertilizer will increase, despite the reduced concentration of nutrients in potatoes due to a growth stimulus from elevated atmospheric CO2. With earlier planting, by 2050 water use will decline by 11.7%, NPK fertilizer uptake will increase by 10.4%, and yields of slightly less nutritious potatoes will increase by 14.9% nationally. © 2022 The Author(s).

The temporal variability of crop biochemical properties and canopy structure across different growth stages has great impacts on wheat LCC estimation, known as growth stage effects. It will result in the heterogeneity of crop canopy at different growth stages, which would mask subtle spectral response of biochemistry variations. This study aims to explore spectral responses on the growth stage effects and establish LCC models suited for different growth stages. A total number of 864 pairwise samples of wheat canopy spectra and LCC values with 216 observations of each stage were sampled at the tillering, jointing, booting and heading stages in 2021. Firstly, statistical analysis of LCC and spectral response presented different distribution traits and typical spectral variations peak at 470, 520 and 680 nm. Correlation analysis between LCC and reflectance showed typical red edge shifts. Secondly, the testing model of partial least square (PLS) established by the entire datasets to validate the predictive performance at each stage yielded poor LCC estimation accuracy. The spectral wavelengths of red edge (RE) and blue edge (BE) shifts and the poor estimation capability motivated us to further explore the growth stage effects by establishing LCC models at respective growth periods. Finally, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling PLS (CARS-PLS), decision tree (DT) and random forest (RF) were used to select sensitive bands and establish LCC models at specific stages. Bayes optimisation was used to tune the hyperparameters of DT and RF regression. The modelling results indicated that CARS-PLS and DT did not extract specific wavelengths that could decrease the influences of growth stage effects. From the RF out-of-bag (OOB) evaluation, the sensitive wavelengths displayed consistent spectral shifts from BE to GP and from RE to RV from tillering to heading stages. Compared with CARS-PLS and DT, results of RF modelling yielded an estimation accuracy with deviation to performance (RPD) of 2.11, 2.02, 3.21 and 3.02, which can accommodate the growth stage effects. Thus, this study explores spectral response on growth stage effects and provides models for chlorophyll content estimation to satisfy the requirement of high-throughput phenotyping. © 2022 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS","Growth stage effects; Random forest; Sensitive wavelengths; Spectral response; Wheat chlorophyll content",,Article,Scopus

In this study, maize daytime NPP was measured by the chamber, and multispectral images of maize canopies were obtained via unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral system. We explored the potential of multispectral images for estimating maize daytime NPP at the canopy scale. Four machine learning algorithms were employed to estimate daytime NPP using ground factors and vegetation indices (VIs) × photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) independently. NPP estimation models based on the gradient boosting regression (GBR), random forest (RF), and support vector regression (SVR) using ground factors outperformed the VIs × PAR-based model, barring the ridge regression (RR) model. Among them, the GBR-based models performed better, and the model using ground factors (R2 = 0.958) outperformed those using VIs × PAR (R2 = 0.899). However, the ground factor-based GBR model was complex and contained more input parameters, thus making it highly-time and labor-intensive, and highly destructive. Moreover, ground factor-based GBR model could not reflect the variation of NPP in maize canopy. The VIs × PAR-based GBR model could explain 89.9% of the daytime NPP, and it only required two parameters, including VIs and PAR. Therefore, the VIs × PAR-based GBR model can easily obtain high resolution and long time-series NPP information nondestructively for a large range. This study reveals that maize daytime NPP can be estimated using high-resolution UAV multispectral images and provides a good reference for promoting the monitoring and upscaling of NPP observations. © 2022","Gradient boosting regression; Machine learning; Net primary productivity; UAV multispectral Remote sensing; Vegetation index","Adaptive boosting; Agriculture; Antennas; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Learning systems; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Aerial vehicle; Gradient boosting; Gradient boosting regression; Machine-learning; Multispectral remote sensing; Net primary productivity; Photosynthetic active radiations; Regression modelling; Unmanned aerial vehicle multispectral remote sensing; Vegetation index; Machine learning",Article,Scopus

Understanding how altered precipitation patterns and magnitudes, coupled with rising growing season temperatures, affect irrigation demand and crop production is a prerequisite for formulating effective water resources management strategies. This study evaluated the effects of near-term climate change (centered on 2035) on irrigation demand, green water scarcity, and row crop yields in a major agricultural watershed in southern New Jersey, USA. Downscaled precipitation and temperature from six General Circulation Models (GCMs) for two representative concentration pathways (RCP-4.5 and 8.5) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) were used to drive the Soil and Water Assessment Tool hydrological model. Temperature and precipitation increases resulted in greater surface runoff, lateral flow, groundwater recharge, and total streamflow. Seasonal ET for corn is projected to alter between −3.0 % to 0.5 %, with irrigation demand between −17 % to −1 %, and yield ranges between −4 % to +9 % depending on the GCMs in the RCP-4.5 scenario, with similar patterns projected by RCP-8.5 scenario. For soybean, the simulation also indicates a declining trend of ET and irrigation demand while increasing yield. Increasing yield for both crops is attributed to changes in agronomic management practices combined with genetically improved cultivars and higher soil fertility due to CO2 fertilization. Green water scarcity analysis under future climate change for corn and soybean display a decreased soil moisture stress due to increased water use efficiency resulting from reduced stomatal conductance under elevated CO2 concentration. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Crop yield; Green water scarcity; Hydrology; Irrigation demand; SWAT model","Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Food supply; Hydrology; Irrigation; Recharging (underground waters); Runoff; Soil moisture; Water supply; Coastal plain; Crop yield; General circulation model; Green water; Green water scarcity; Irrigation demand; New Jersey; Potential impacts; SWAT model; Water scarcity; Climate change; carbon dioxide; water; climate change; climate effect; coastal plain; crop yield; irrigation; quantitative analysis; soil and water assessment tool; agricultural management; agricultural parameters; agronomic trait; Article; basin scale; climate change; climate model; coastal plain; concentration (parameter); coupled model intercomparison project phase 5; crop rotation; cultivar; digital elevation model; environmental stress; environmental temperature; evapotranspiration; general circulation model; green water scarcity; greenhouse gas; groundwater recharge; harvest; harvest index; hydrologic response unit; hydrological model; hydrology; irrigation (agriculture); lateral flow; maize; meteorology; New Jersey; nonhuman; plant growth; plant water use; planting time; precipitation; relative humidity; representative concentration pathway; scoring system; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; Soil and Water Assessment Tool model; soil fertility; soil fertilization; soil moisture; solar radiation; soybean; stomatal conductance; streamflow; subbasin scale; surface runoff; temperature; tillage; topography; validation process; water availability; water flow; water insecurity; water stress; watershed; wind speed; soil; New Jersey; United States; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; New Jersey; Soil; Water; Water Insecurity; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Deep learning has been used to identify crop diseases at the initial stages of disease development in an effort to create effective disease management systems. However, the use of deep learning and unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery to track the spread of diseases, identify diseased regions within cornfields, and notify users with actionable information remains a research gap. Therefore, in this study, high-resolution, UAS-acquired, real-time kinematic (RTK) geotagged, RGB imagery at an altitude of 12 m above ground level (AGL) was used to develop the Geo Disease Location System (GeoDLS), a deep learning-based system for tracking diseased regions in corn fields. UAS images (resolution 8192 × 5460 pixels) were acquired in cornfields located at Purdue University’s Agronomy Center for Research and Education (ACRE), using a DJI Matrice 300 RTK UAS mounted with a 45-megapixel DJI Zenmuse P1 camera during corn stages V14 to R4. A dataset of 5076 images was created by splitting the UAS-acquired images using tile and simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) segmentation. For tile segmentation, the images were split into tiles of sizes 250 × 250 pixels, 500 × 500 pixels, and 1000 × 1000 pixels, resulting in 1804, 1112, and 570 image tiles, respectively. For SLIC segmentation, 865 and 725 superpixel images were obtained using compactness (m) values of 5 and 10, respectively. Five deep neural network architectures, VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet169, and Xception, were trained to identify diseased, healthy, and background regions in corn fields. DenseNet169 identified diseased, healthy, and background regions with the highest testing accuracy of 100.00% when trained on images of tile size 1000 × 1000 pixels. Using a sliding window approach, the trained DenseNet169 model was then used to calculate the percentage of diseased regions present within each UAS image. Finally, the RTK geolocation information for each image was used to update users with the location of diseased regions with an accuracy of within 2 cm through a web application, a smartphone application, and email notifications. The GeoDLS could be a potential tool for an automated disease management system to track the spread of crop diseases, identify diseased regions, and provide actionable information to the users. © 2022 by the authors.","deep learning; disease identification; image classification; SLIC segmentation; smartphone application; UAS; web application","Antennas; Deep neural networks; Diseases; Image classification; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Location; Network architecture; Smartphones; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Clustering segmentation; Deep learning; Disease identification; Images classification; Iterative clustering; Simple linear iterative clustering segmentation; Simplest linear; Smart-phone applications; Unmanned aerial systems; WEB application; Web applications; Pixels",Article,Scopus

This study used different vegetation indices and red-edge parameters calculated based on the canopy reflectance obtained from near-surface hyperspectral data and UAV hyperspectral data and used the partial least squares regression (PLSR) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods to estimate the yield of winter wheat at different growth stages. Verification was performed based on these two types of hyperspectral remote sensing data and the yield was estimated using vegetation indices and a combination of vegetation indices and red-edge parameters as the modeling independent variables, respectively, using PLSR and ANN regression, respectively. The results showed that, for the same data source, the optimal vegetation index for estimating the yield was the same in all of the studied growth stages; however, the optimal red-edge parameters were different for different growth stages. Compared with using only the vegetation indices as the modeling factor to estimate yield, the combination of the vegetation indices and red-edge parameters obtained superior estimation results. Additionally, the accuracy of yield estimation was shown to be improved by using the PLSR and ANN methods, with the yield estimation model constructed using the PLSR method having a better prediction effect. Moreover, the yield prediction model obtained using the near-surface hyperspectral sensors had a higher fitting and accuracy than the model obtained using the UAV hyperspectral remote sensing data (the results were based on the specific growth stressors, N and water supply). This study shows that the use of a combination of vegetation indices and red-edge parameters achieved an improved yield estimation compared to the use of vegetation indices alone. In the future, the selection of suitable sensors and methods needs to be considered when constructing models to estimate crop yield. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial neural network; near-surface hyperspectral; partial least squares regression; red-edge parameters; UAV hyperspectral; vegetation indices; yield","Crops; Food supply; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Parameter estimation; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Water supply; HyperSpectral; Near surfaces; Near-surface hyperspectral; Partial least square regression; Red edge parameters; UAV hyperspectral; Vegetation index; Yield; Yield estimation; Neural networks",Article,Scopus

Three types of parameters, including photosynthetic sensitive vegetation indices (VIs), canopy leaf area index (LAI), and crop plant nitrogen accumulation (PNA), obtained from UAV hyperspectral images were used to estimate rice GPC.

Quantifying the damage to crops caused by high temperatures can lead to more accurate estimates of crop yields. The remote sensing technique evaluates crop conditions indirectly but provides information related to crop physiology, growth, and yield. In this study, we aim to assess the crop damage caused by heat stress in paddy rice examined under elevated air temperatures in a temperature gradient field chamber from 2016 to 2019, using remote-sensed vegetation indices. A leaf-spectrometer, field-spectrometers, and a multi-spectral camera were used to monitor the conditions of paddy rice. Although, in the leaf- and canopy-scales, the values of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and photochemical reflectance index (PRI) decreased after the heading of rice under normal conditions, the decreasing sensitivity of NDVI and PRI was different depending on the degree of physiological heat stress by high temperature conditions. The NDVI after the heading under extremely high air temperature was not dropped and remained the value before heading. The PRI decreased at all air temperature conditions after the heading; the PRI of the plot exposed to the elevated air temperature was higher than that under ambient air temperature. Further, the relative change in NDVI and PRI after the heading exhibited a strong relationship with the ripening ratio of paddy rice, which is the variable related to crop yield. These remote-sensing results aid in evaluating the crop damage caused by heat stress using vegetation indices. © 2022 by the authors.","crop stress; heat stress; ripening ratio; temperature gradient field chamber; vegetation index",,Article,Scopus

Although they are more accurate than forecasted wind fields, reanalysis wind fields tend to have time latencies because they can only be released after the observations are obtained. In order to produce accurate estimates of wind fields in a more timely manner, we develop an adversarial learning approach to correcting forecasted wind fields to be close to reanalysis wind fields. The adversarial learning approach is conducted by an adversarial ConvLSTM network (ACLN) framework that consists of a corrector and a discriminator. The corrector aims at comprehensively capturing both spatial and temporal characteristics of a sequence of forecasted wind fields and producing a corrected forecast wind field for the final field in the sequence. The discriminator tries to distinguish corrected forecast wind field from its corresponding reanalysis wind field. The training of ACLN is alternate between the corrector and the discriminator in an adversarial fashion. The adversarial training mechanism enhances the corrector's representational power. Additionally, the corrector exploits a residual learning architecture that effectively learns the differences between forecasted wind fields and the corresponding reanalysis wind fields. In this scenario, the well trained corrector requires neither reanalysis wind fields nor observations such that it can correct forecasted wind fields in a timely manner. Furthermore, corrected forecast wind fields are employed for oil spill drift prediction. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed ACLN framework in forecasted wind field correction along with oil spill drift prediction. Compared with ECMWF numerical forecasts, the ACLN achieves an average reduction of 6.2%, 6.9%, and 10.6% in RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, respectively. Compared with a basic drift prediction method, the ACLN based prediction method reduces the error by about 5000 m in the Sanchi oil spill accident.

Timely and accurate estimation of crop yield at the field scale is of great significance for crop management, harvest and trade. It ultimately enables farmers to optimize inputs and economic return. We selected an irrigated wheat field in a region near Kaifeng, Henan province, for this study. The terrain in that region is undulating and spatial differences. We used a low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing platform equipped with a multi-spectral camera, thermal infrared camera, and RGB camera to simultaneously obtain different remote sensing parameters during the key growth stages of wheat. Based on the extracted spectral reflectivity, thermal infrared temperature, and digital elevation information, we calculated the spatial variability of remote sensing parameters, and growth indices under different terrain characteristics. We also analyzed the correlations between vegetation indices, temperature parameters and wheat yield. By means of four machine learning methods, including multiple linear regression method (MLR), partial least squares regression method (PLSR), support vector machine regression method (SVR), and random forest regression method (RFR), we compared the yield estimation capability of single-modal data versus multimodal data fusion frameworks. The results showed that slope was an important factor affecting crop growth and yield. We observed significant differences in remote sensing parameters under different slope grades. Soil water content, water content of plants, and above-ground biomass at the three growth stages were significantly correlated with slope. Most of the vegetation indices and temperature parameters of three growth stages were significantly correlated with yield as well. Based on the strength of their correlation with yield, seven vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, EVI2, OSAVI, SAVI, NDRE, and WDRVI) and two temperature parameters (NRCT, CTD) were selected as the final input variables for the model. For the single-modal data framework, the model constructed with the vegetation indices was better than the yield model constructed with the temperature parameters, and the highest accuracy was obtained with a RFR model based on vegetation indices at filling stage (R2 = 0.724, RMSE = 614.72 kg hm-2, MAE = 478.08 kg hm-2). For the double modal data fusion approach, the highest accuracy resulted at flowering stage, using the temperature parameters combined with the vegetation indices of RFR model (R2=0.865, RMSE=440.73 kg hm-2, MAE=374.86 kg hm-2). Even higher accuracies were obtained, using the multimodal data fusion approach with a RFR model based on vegetation indices, temperature parameters and slope information at flowering stage (R2 = 0.893, RMSE = 420.06 kg hm-2, MAE = 352.69 kg hm-2), and the highest validation model (R2 = 0.892, RMSE = 423.55 kg hm-2, MAE = 334.43 kg hm-2) for fusion of the flowering stage. The results revealed that by using a multimodal data fusion framework of terrain factors combined with RFR, we can fully exploit the complementary and synergistic roles of different remote sensing information sources. This effectively improves the accuracy and stability of the yield estimation model, and provides a reference and support for crop growth monitoring and yield estimation. © 2022, Science Press.

The main aim of this work was to develop a method of detection of Xcc infection on broccoli leaves. Such method is based on the use of imaging sensors that capture information about the optical properties of leaves and provide data that can be implemented on machine learning algorithms capable of learning patterns. Based on this knowledge, the algorithms are able to classify plants into categories (healthy and infected). To ensure the robustness of the detection method upon future alterations in climate conditions, the response of broccoli plants to Xcc infection was analyzed under a range of growing environments, taking current climate conditions as reference. Two projections for years 2081–2100 were selected, according to the Assessment Report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Thus, the response of broccoli plants to Xcc infection and climate conditions has been monitored using leaf temperature and five conventional vegetation indices (VIs) derived from hyperspectral reflectance. In addition, three novel VIs, named diseased broccoli indices (DBI1-DBI3), were defined based on the spectral reflectance signature of broccoli leaves upon Xcc infection. Finally, the nine parameters were implemented on several classifying algorithms. The detection method offering the best performance of classification was a multilayer perceptron-based artificial neural network. This model identified infected plants with accuracies of 88.1, 76.9, and 83.3%, depending on the growing conditions. In this model, the three Vis described in this work proved to be very informative parameters for the disease detection. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that future climate conditions have been taken into account to develop a robust detection model using classifying algorithms.

The time series of maize yield is generally non-stationary and contains different frequency components, such as long-and short-term oscillations. Nevertheless, there is no adequate understanding of the relative importance of climate change. In addition, human activities on maize yield at multiple timescales remain unclear, which help in further improving maize yield prediction. Based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition method (EEMD), the method of dependent variable variance decomposition (DVVD) and the Sen-slope method, the effect of climate change including growing-season precipitation and temperature (i.e., GSP, GEP, CDD, GST, GSMAT, and GSMT) and human activities including effective irrigation area (EIA) and the consumption of chemical fertilizers (CCF) on maize yield were explored at multiple timescales during 1979–2015. The Heilongjiang Province, a highly important maize production area in China, was selected as a case study. The results of this work indicate the following: (1) The original maize yield series was divided into 3.1-, 7.4-, 18.5-, and 37-year timescale oscillations and a residual series with an increasing trend, where the 3.1-year timescale (IMF1), the 18.5-year timescale (IMF3), and the increasing trend (R) were dominant; (2) the original sequence was mainly affected by human activities; (3) climate change and human activities had different effects on maize yield at different timescales: The short-term oscillation (IMF1) of maize yield was primarily affected by climate change. However, human activities dominated the mid-and long-term oscillations (IMF3 and R) of maize yield. This study sheds new insight into multiple timescale analysis of the role of climate and human activities on maize yield dynamics. © 2022 by the authors.

However, the decisions framed through the application of such models are highly affected by the model input data accuracy. On a global scale, the majority of watersheds are data-limited (DL), and model input data at required spatial and temporal resolutions are unavailable, incomplete, or low in quality. Thus, the hydrological simulations are significantly influenced by poor representation and characterization of the system, which affects the reliability of simulations in DL regions. This study quantifies the effects of global-scale dataset usage in ecohydrological simulations. The global-scale datasets are generally coarse in spatial resolution and significantly affect the hydrology and water quality simulations. The average annual flow simulations were 35.7% higher for DL scenarios as compared to the data-intensive scenario. Researchers with limited data should take special care to ensure that their simulations allow them to take informed decisions so that effective and reliable management system is planned.

Within the context of Russian agricultural history, the recent high growth in grain production is exceptional. This growth however is not fully replicated by the “weather-yield” crop models, which project only moderate yield increase in the twenty-first century and fail to predict the most recent record growth in grain yields. The difference between the projected climate-dependent yields and observations is especially high in two of the most important agricultural regions, the Central Black Earth and Northern Caucasus regions while the remaining agricultural zones show good agreement with the regression models. Similar differences were observed in the late 1960s, which we interpret in terms of the rapid changes in agricultural technology during the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR) agricultural reforms followed by periods of reversal. We also interpret the current period of high differentiation between weather-yield model results and collected yields as evidence of a higher than usual contribution of agricultural reforms in yield improvements, which, however, primarily benefit the large-scale producers located in the most productive areas of Russia. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Agriculture; Climate change; Grain export; Grain yields; Russia; Statistical models","Climate models; Earth (planet); Grain (agricultural product); Regression analysis; Agricultural zones; Caucasus; Crop modeling; Grain export; Grain production; Grain yield; High growth; Russia; Statistic modeling; Yield increase; Climate change; agricultural technology; differentiation; Earth; regression; Caucasus; Central Department; Northern Caucasus; Russian Federation; Russian Federation; USSR",Article,Scopus

At present, farmers often over-apply N fertilizer in some locations or at certain times because they do not have high-resolution crop N status data. N-use efficiency can be low, with the remaining N lost to the environment, resulting in higher production costs and environmental pollution. Accurate and timely estimation of N status in crops is crucial to improving cropping systems’ economic and environmental sustainability. Destructive approaches based on plant tissue analysis are time consuming and impractical over large fields. Recent advances in remote sensing and deep learning have shown promise in addressing the aforementioned challenges in a non-destructive way. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning framework: a self-supervised spectral–spatial attention-based vision transformer (SSVT). The proposed SSVT introduces a Spectral Attention Block (SAB) and a Spatial Interaction Block (SIB), which allows for simultaneous learning of both spatial and spectral features from UAV digital aerial imagery, for accurate N status prediction in wheat fields. Moreover, the proposed framework introduces local-to-global self-supervised learning to help train the model from unlabelled data. The proposed SSVT has been compared with five state-of-the-art models including: ResNet, RegNet, EfficientNet, EfficientNetV2, and the original vision transformer on both testing and independent datasets.

A number of previous studies that analyzed changes in precipitation across the Great Lakes and Midwest for a variety of time periods and using a range of quality-control standards and methods observed increased precipitation rates and totals, although there was considerable site-to-site variability, even for sites in close physical proximity. Biases and discontinuities in precipitation observations may contribute to this variability. This study identifies and examines changes in precipitation utilizing a unique approach to observation series screening over a region encompassing the Great Lakes and broader Midwestern region of the United States for the period 1951–2019. A multiple tier procedure was utilized to identify high quality input data series from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset. Annual and seasonal time series of precipitation indicators were calculated and subjected to breakpoint analysis as further quality control. Trends were analyzed across a broad range of related indicators, from totals and frequencies of threshold events to event duration and potential linkages with total precipitable water. Results indicate that annual precipitation has generally increased across the region in terms of totals, although there is substantial variation across the study domain in the significance and magnitude of annual trends by indicator. Annual trends were spatially most consistent across eastern areas of the study domain while relatively greater station-to-station variability in trend significance and magnitude was observed across northern and western portions. Significant trends were generally fewer in number for seasonal precipitation indicators and less spatially coherent. The greatest number of significant trends occurred in fall with the fewest in spring. Correlation of indicator trends with trends of mean total precipitable water suggests weak correlations annually and moderate correlations at the seasonal scale. The trends of the precipitation indicators in our study exhibited more coherent spatial patterns when compared with studies with different quality control criteria, illustrating the importance of quality control of observations in climatic studies and highlighting the complexity of the changing character of precipitation.

Low-cost genotyping technologies that support genome-assisted breeding have already been established. However, efficient collection of large amounts of high-quality phenotypic data is essential for the success of such breeding. Most of the fruit quality traits have been sensorily and visually evaluated by professional breeders. However, the fruit morphological features that serve as the basis for such sensory and visual judgments are unclear. This makes it difficult to collect efficient phenotypic data on fruit quality traits using image analysis. In this study, we developed a method to automatically measure the morphological features of citrus fruits by the image analysis of cross-sectional images of citrus fruits. We applied explainable machine learning methods and Bayesian networks to determine the relationship between fruit morphological features and two sensorily evaluated fruit quality traits: easiness of peeling (Peeling) and fruit hardness (FruH). In each of all the methods applied in this study, the degradation area of the central core of the fruit was significantly and directly associated with both Peeling and FruH, while the seed area was significantly and directly related to FruH alone. The degradation area of albedo and the area of flavedo were also significantly and directly related to Peeling and FruH, respectively, except in one or two methods. These results suggest that an approach that combines explainable machine learning methods, Bayesian networks, and image analysis can be effective in dissecting the experienced sense of a breeder. In breeding programs, collecting fruit images and efficiently measuring and documenting fruit morphological features that are related to fruit quality traits may increase the size of data for the analysis and improvement of the accuracy of GWAS and GS on the quality traits of the citrus fruits.

The paper proposed a county-scale cotton mapping method by using random forest (RF) feature selection algorithm and classifier based on selecting multi-features, including spectral, vegetation indices, and texture features. The contribution of texture features to cotton classification accuracy was also explored in addition to spectral features and vegetation index. In addition, the optimal classification time, feature importance, and the best classifier on the cotton extraction accuracy were evaluated. The results showed that the texture feature named the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is effective for improving classification accuracy, ranking second in contribution among all studied spectral, VI, and texture features. Among the three classifiers, the RF showed higher accuracy and better stability than support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The average overall accuracy (OA) of the classification combining multiple features was 93.36%, 7.33% higher than the average OA of the single-time spectrum, and 2.05% higher than the average OA of the multi-time spectrum. The classification accuracy after feature selection by RF can still reach 92.12%, showing high accuracy and efficiency.

In this context, remote sensing data provide valuable information on crops. This study investigates the relationship between the variables determined from both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical images and crop height. For this purpose, backscatter (σVH, σVV, σVH / σVV) and coherence (ϒVH, ϒVV) of multi-temporal dual-polarized Sentinel-1 and vegetation indices of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data are analyzed. Two indices, namely, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and NDVI with the red-edge band (NDVIred), are interpreted to identify the contribution of the red-edge band over the near-infrared band. The Zile District of Tokat province in Turkey where dominantly sunflower cultivation is carried out, was selected as the study area. In the analysis of the data, Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were used. In the results of the study, ANN showed the lowest RMSE = 3.083 cm (RMSE%= 11.284) in the stem elongation period. The CNN followed the lowest RMSE for the Inflorescence development and flowering stages 19.223 cm (RMSE%=15.458) and 8.731 cm (RMSE%=5.821), respectively. In the ripening period, XGBoost achieved the lowest RMSE = 8.731 cm (RMSE%=6.091). All the best models in four methods were created using common variables of σVH, σVV, ϒVH, ϒVV and NDVIred, except ANN which exclude coherence variables.

Fast growth in precision agriculture helps farmers to increase their yields by extending the era of machine-learning techniques. However, in organic and inorganic farming, predicting yield is an open issue that dominantly depends on the presence of soil nutrients. The lack of knowledge about the richness of land nutrients deals with the crop selection problem. Therefore, the proposed work extended the idea of a dynamic ensemble model for imbalanced multi-class nutrient data. In this work, an attempt is being made to include a novel customized voting strategy for deciding the final class output from the ensemble model. As an initial step, a well-known ranking technique, VIKOR, is applied over land nutrients to extract the most informative land samples. The rationale is to reduce the complexity of the ensemble model by determining only informative land samples for further classification. Furthermore, the meta-learning approach of dynamic ensemble selection accounts for multi-criterion-based competent classifier selection as meta-classifiers. These meta-classifiers decide on ensemble formation with the customized voting strategy to classify the right crop for the test land. To investigate nutrient richness, real-time soil and water nutrient data are collected from the soil testing laboratory, which covers different spatial data. Our experiments on six popular DES algorithms over nutrient data reveal the proposed algorithm’s outperformance in specificity, sensitivity, BCA, Multi-Area under Curve, and precision. Moreover, the lesser computational time of the proposed work indicates the model’s efficiency toward suitable crop selection. © 2022 The Author(s).

One popular category of SSL are distillation networks, such as Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL). This work proposes RS-BYOL, which builds on BYOL in the remote sensing (RS) domain where data are nontrivially different from natural RGB images. Since multispectral (MS) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors provide varied spectral and spatial resolution information, we utilize them as an implicit augmentation to learn invariant feature embeddings. In order to learn RS-based invariant features with SSL, we trained RS-BYOL in two ways, i.e., single channel feature learning and three channel feature learning. This work explores the usefulness of single channel feature learning from random 10 MS bands of 10-20 m resolution and VV-VH of SAR bands compared to the common notion of using three or more bands. In our linear probing evaluation, these single channel features reached a 0.92 F1 score on the EuroSAT classification task and 59.6 mIoU on the IEEE Data Fusion Contest segmentation task for certain single bands. We also compare our results with ImageNet weights and show that the RS-based SSL model outperforms the supervised ImageNet-based model. We further explore the usefulness of multimodal data compared to single modality data, and it is shown that utilizing MS and SAR data allows better invariant representations to be learnt than utilizing only MS data. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Optical-synthetic aperture radar (SAR) fusion; satellite images; self-supervised learning (SSL); unsupervised learning","Data fusion; Distillation; Image segmentation; Modal analysis; Optical remote sensing; Radar imaging; Supervised learning; Learn+; Multi-spectral; Optical imaging; Optical synthetic aperture radar; Optical-synthetic aperture radar fusion; Remote-sensing; Representation learning; Satellite images; Self-supervised learning; Task analysis; Synthetic aperture radar; classification; image processing; multispectral image; remote sensing; segmentation; supervised learning; synthetic aperture radar",Article,Scopus

The present study presents multiple crop yield estimation and forecasting efficiently and precisely using MERRA-2 model, satellite-gauge and MODIS-Terra satellite data by regression and time series models. Rice, wheat, maize, rapeseed &amp; mustard, and millet crops yield data of India was used for crop yield estimation and forecasting using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Decomposition, Holt, Winters and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. Models were developed using crops yield historical data, weather variables (temperature, precipitation, surface radiation) and pollutants (O3, CO) data of 1982–83 to 2014–15. Overall best correlation (R = 0.96) and poor correlation (R = 0.56) was found between observed and estimated rice and rapeseed &amp; mustard crops using Decomposition and MLR models, respectively. After rigorous skill assessment and out of more than 20 combinations of ARIMA models, the ARIMA (0, 1, 1) time series model performed the best with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 4.59%) for wheat crop estimation. Forecasted crop yields were successfully cross-validated using four years’ data (2015–16, 2016–17, 2017–18 and 2018–19) for regression and time series models by comparing Relative Error (RE%) between observed and forecasted crops yields. Results were statistically analyzed using correlation coefficient (R), Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), RMSE%, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE%), t-value and p-value. The crop yield estimation and forecasting results showed reasonably quantifiable information with the actual datasets. The outcomes of the present study have policy level implications for compensation to farming communities for the loss of crops. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","crop yield; estimation; forecasting; regression; Satellite data; time series",,Article,Scopus

The termination of the hepatitis B virus is mandatory and can be done by taking precautions as well as a suitable cure in its introductory stage; otherwise, it will become a severe problem and make a human liver suffer from the most dangerous diseases, such as liver cancer. In this paper, two medical diagnostic systems are developed for the diagnosis of this life-threatening virus. The methodologies used to develop these models are fuzzy logic and the neuro-fuzzy technique. The diverse parameters that assist in the evaluation of performance are also determined by using the observed values from the proposed system for both developed models. The classification accuracy of a multilayered fuzzy inference system is 94%. The accuracy with which the developed medical diagnostic system by using Adaptive Network based Fuzzy Interference System (ANFIS) classifies the result corresponding to the given input is 95.55%. The comparison of both developed models on the basis of their performance parameters has been made. It is observed that the neuro-fuzzy technique-based diagnostic system has better accuracy in classifying the infected and non-infected patients as compared to the fuzzy diagnostic system. Furthermore, the performance evaluation concluded that the outcome given by the developed medical diagnostic system by using ANFIS is accurate and correct as compared to the developed fuzzy inference system and also can be used in hospitals for the diagnosis of Hepatitis B disease. In other words, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system has more capability to classify the provided inputs adequately than the fuzzy inference system. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

The aim of Smart Farming is to provide tools for various agricultural and farming operations to improve yield by reducing cost, waste, and required manpower. SF is a data-driven approach that can mitigate losses that occur due to extreme weather conditions and calamities. The influx of data from various sensors, and the introduction of information communication technologies (ICTs) in the field of farming has accelerated the implementation of disruptive technologies (DTs) such as machine learning and big data. Application of these predictive and innovative tools in agriculture is crucial for handling unprecedented conditions such as climate change and the increasing global population. In this study, we review the recent advancements in the field of Smart Farming, which include novel use cases and projects around the globe. An overview of the challenges associated with the adoption of such technologies in their respective regions is also provided. A brief analysis of the general sentiment towards Smart Farming technologies is also performed by manually annotating YouTube comments and making use of the pattern library.

They constitute primary staple crops in drylands, where their production is known to date back over 5000 years ago. Compared to other crops, millets and sorghum have received less attention until very recently, and their production has been progressively reduced in the last 50 years. Here, we present new models that focus on the ecological factors driving finger millet, pearl millet and sorghum traditional cultivation, with a global perspective. The interaction between environment and traditional agrosystems was investigated by Redundancy Analysis of published literature and tested against novel ethnographic data. Contrary to earlier beliefs, our models show that the total annual precipitation is not the most determinant factor in shaping millet and sorghum agriculture. Instead, our results point to the importance of other variables such as the duration of the plant growing cycle, soil water-holding capacity or soil nutrient availability. This highlights the potential of finger millet, pearl millet and sorghum traditional cultivation practices as a response to recent increase of aridity levels worldwide. Ultimately, these practices can play a pivotal role for resilience and sustainability of dryland agriculture. Copyright: © 2023 Ruiz-Giralt et al.

Here 100 elite breeding hybrids of maize (Zea mays L.) were evaluated in two environment trials-one with optimal planting and irrigation (IHOT), and one dryland with delayed planting (DHOT). RGB (Red-Green-Blue) based canopy height measurement (CHM) and vegetation indices (VIs) were estimated from a UAS platform. Time series and cumulative VIs, by both summation (ΣVI-SUMs) and area under the curve (ΣVI-AUCs), were fit via machine learning regression modeling (random forest, linear, ridge, lasso, elastic net regressions) to estimate grain yield. VIs were more valuable predictors of yield to combine different environments than CHM. Time series VIs and CHM produced high accuracies (~68-72%), but inconsistent models. A little sacrifice in accuracy (~60-65%) produced consistent models using ΣVI-SUMs and CHM during pre-reproductive vegetative growth. Absence of VIs produced poorer accuracies (by about ~5-10%). Normalized difference type VIs produced maximum accuracies, and flowering times were the best times for UAS data acquisition. This study suggests that the best yielding varieties can be accurately predicted in new environments at or before flowering when combining multiple temporal flights and predictors.

A fast and reliable estimation of SOM is important to predict the soil carbon stock in cropland. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential of combining multitemporal Sentinel-2A imagery and random forest (RF) to improve the accuracy of SOM estimates in the plough layer for cultivated land at a regional scale. The field data of SOM content were utilized along with multitemporal Sentinel-2A images acquired over three years during the bare soil period to develop spectral indices. The best bands and spectral indices were selected as prediction variables by using the RF algorithm. Partial least squares (PLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR), and RF were employed to calibrate spectral indices for the SOM content, and the optimal calibration model was used for the mapping of the SOM content in arable land at a regional scale. The results showed the following. (1) The multitemporal image estimation model outperformed the single-temporal image estimation model. The estimation model that utilized the optimal bands and spectral indices as prediction variables usually had better accuracy than the models based on full spectral data. (2) For the SOM content estimates, the performance was better with RF than with PLS and GWR in almost all cases. (3) The most accurate SOM estimation in the case area was achieved by using multitemporal images from 2018 and the RF calibration model based on the optimal bands and spectral indices as prediction variables, with R2val (coefficient of determination of the validation data set) = 0.67, RMSEval (root mean square error of the validation dataset) = 2.05, and RPIQval (ratio of performance to interquartile range of the validation dataset) = 3.36. (4) The estimated SOM content in the plough layer for cultivated land throughout the study area ranged from 16.17 to 36.98 g kg−1 and exhibited an increasing trend from north to south. In the current study, we developed a framework that combines multitemporal remote sensing imagery and RF for the SOM estimation, which can improve the accuracy of quantitative SOM estimations, provide a dynamic, rapid, and low-cost technique for understanding soil fertility, and offer an early warning of changes in soil quality. © 2022 by the authors.","cultivated land; random forest; Sentinel-2A; soil organic matter; spectral indices",,Article,Scopus

For this purpose, flotation experiments in the presence and absence of MNBs were performed on coarse quartz particles, and the results were statistically analyzed. Methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC) was employed as a frother for generating MNBs through hydrodynamic cavitation. The significance of the operating variables, including impeller speed, air flow rate, together with the bubble size, and particle size on the flotation recovery was assessed using historical data (HD) design and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The correlation between the flotation parameters and process response in the presence and absence of MNBs was modeled using hybrid convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as the deep learning (DL) frameworks to automatically extract features from input data using a CNN as the base layer. The ANOVA results indicated that all variables affect process responses statistically and meaningfully. Significant interactions were found between air flow rate and particle size as well as impeller speed and MNB size. It was found that a CNN-RNN model could finally be used to model the process based on the intelligent simulation results. Based on Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs), it was evident that particle size had a strong linear relationship with recovery. However, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) was considerably more accurate in predicting relationships than Pearson correlations, even though the model outputs agreed well. © 2023 by the authors.","convolutional neural networks; deep learning; micro-nanobubbles (MNBs); operating variables; quartz flotation; recurrent neural networks",,Article,Scopus

The dataset contains demographics, socioeconomic, and clinical factors with lab reports. Data preprocessing techniques (missing values imputation, outlier removal, data normalisation, and data transformation) have also been employed for better results. Feature selection techniques, including correlation-based feature selection, Information gain, gain ratio, ReliefF, and OneR, have been utilised to minimise a large number of features.

Reliable and robust hydrological drought predictions are critical for water and food security and ecosystem health under anthropogenic warming. However, the prevalent statistical prediction methods, for example, the meta-Gaussian (MG) model, usually do not lead to accurate drought predictions. We therefore developed a new drought prediction model utilizing the Bayesian Model Averaging coupled with Vine Copula, called Bayesian Model Averaging Ensemble Vine Copula (BMAViC) model, in which previous meteorological drought, antecedent evaporative drought, and preceding hydrological drought were selected as three predictors. The BMAViC model was applied to the Upper Yellow River basin and showed robust skills during calibration and validation periods for 1- to 3-month lead hydrological drought predictions. In comparison with the MG model (reference model), the skills of the proposed model were relatively stable and superior under diverse lead times. Good performances under the 1- to 3-month lead times strongly implied that the BMAViC model yielded robust and accurate hydrological drought predictions.

The cumulative results showed that the reciprocal ratio vegetation index (repRVI) had a high potential for yield assessment throughout the growing season, and the late grain-filling stage was deemed as the optimal single stage with R2, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.85, 793.96 kg/ha, and 656.31 kg/ha, respectively. MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI) performed better in the vegetative period and provided the best prediction results for the N partial factor productivity (NPFP) at the jointing stage, with R2, RMSE, and MAE of 0.65, 10.53 kg yield/kg N, and 8.90 kg yield/kg N, respectively. At the same time, the modified normalized difference blue index (mNDblue) was more accurate during the reproductive period, providing the best accuracy for agronomical NUE (aNUE) assessment at the late grain-filling stage, with R2, RMSE, and MAE of 0.61, 7.48 kg yield/kg N, and 6.05 kg yield/kg N, respectively. Furthermore, the findings indicated that model accuracy cannot be improved by increasing the number of input features. Overall, these results indicate that the consumer-grade P4M camera is suitable for early and efficient monitoring of important crop traits, providing a cost-effective choice for the development of the precision agricultural system.

However, the contributions of proximal sensing data characteristics (spectral, temporal, and spatial) to yield estimation have not been systematically evaluated. We collected long-term, hyper-temporal, and large-volume light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and multispectral data to (i) identify the best machine learning method and prediction stage for wheat yield estimation, (ii) characterize the contribution of multisource data fusion and the dynamic importance of structural and spectral traits to yield estimation, and (iii) elucidate the contribution of time-series data fusion and 3D spatial information to yield estimation. Wheat yield could be accurately (R2 = 0.891) and timely (approximately-two months before harvest) estimated from fused LiDAR and multispectral data. The artificial neural network model and the flowering stage were always the best method and prediction stage, respectively. Spectral traits (such as CIgreen) dominated yield estimation, especially in the early stage, whereas the contribution of structural traits (such as height) was more stable in the late stage. Fusing spectral and structural traits increased estimation accuracy at all growth stages. Better yield estimation was realized from traits derived from complete 3D points than from canopy surface points and from integrated multi-stage (especially from jointing to heading and flowering stages) data than from single-stage data. We suggest that this study offers a novel perspective on deciphering the contributions of spectral, structural, and time-series information to wheat yield estimation and can guide accurate, efficient, and timely estimation of wheat yield. © 2022 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS","Hyper-temporal; LiDAR; Multispectral; Phenotype; Yield",,Article,Scopus

Pests and diseases are a major obstacle to achieving this productivity outcome. Therefore, it is very important to develop efficient methods for the automatic detection, identification, and prediction of pests and diseases in agricultural crops. To perform such automation, Machine Learning (ML) techniques can be used to derive knowledge and relationships from the data that is being worked on. This paper presents a literature review on ML techniques used in the agricultural sector, focusing on the tasks of classification, detection, and prediction of diseases and pests, with an emphasis on tomato crops.

However, two open and interesting issues remain unknown: 1) whether hydrometeorological situations under droughts can be reproduced directly utilizing variability of atmospheric dynamics and 2) what specific roles atmospheric dynamics play in drought reconstruction. To explore these questions, this study employs three kinds of dynamic features (i.e., vertical velocity, relative vorticity, and horizontal divergence) for hydrometeorological reconstruction (e.g., precipitation and near-surface air temperature) under drought situations through a so-called XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) ensemble learning method. The study adopts two different reconstruction schemes (i.e., statistically preexisting dynamic–hydrometeorological relationships and interannual variability) and finds dynamically based reconstruction feasible. The three main achievements are as follows. 1) Regarding different hydrometeorological situations reconstructed with preexisting dynamic–hydrometeorological relationships, good reconstruction performance can be captured with the same or different lead times, depending on whether the evolution of dynamic anomalies (e.g., vertical motion and relative vorticity) is temporally asynchronous. 2) Reconstruction on the interannual scale performs relatively well, seemingly regardless of seasonality and drought-inducing mechanisms. 3) More importantly, from interpretable perspectives, global-scale analysis of dynamic contributions helps discover unexpected dynamic drought-inducing roles and associated latitudinal modulation. That is, low-level cyclonic/anticyclonic anomalies contribute to drought development in the northern middle and high latitudes, while upper-level vertical subsidence contributes significantly to tropical near-surface temperature anomalies concurrent with droughts. These achievements could provide guidance for dynamically based drought monitoring and prediction in different geographic regions. © 2022 American Meteorological Society.","Atmospheric circulation; Drought; Hydrologic cycle; Machine learning","air temperature; annual variation; anticyclone; atmospheric circulation; atmospheric dynamics; cyclone; drought; hydrological cycle; hydrometeorology; machine learning; precipitation (chemistry); subsidence; surface temperature; temperature anomaly; vorticity",Article,Scopus

To date, very little attention has been paid to mapping the seasonal leaf C, N, and P of mangrove forests with remote sensing techniques. Based on Sentinel-2 images taken in spring, summer, and winter, this study aimed to compare three machine learning models (XGBoost, extreme gradient boosting; RF, random forest; LightGBM, light gradient boosting machine) in estimating the three leaf nutrients and further to apply the best-performing model to map the leaf nutrients of 15 seasons from 2017 to 2021. The results showed that there were significant differences in leaf nutrients (p &lt; 0.05) across the three seasons. Among the three machine learning models, XGBoost with sensitive spectral features of Sentinel-2 images was optimal for estimating the leaf C (R2 = 0.655, 0.799, and 0.829 in spring, summer, and winter, respectively), N (R2 = 0.668, 0.743, and 0.704) and P (R2 = 0.539, 0.622, and 0.596) over the three seasons. Moreover, the red-edge (especially B6) and near-infrared bands (B8 and B8a) of Sentinel-2 images were efficient estimators of mangrove leaf nutrients. The information of species, elevation, and canopy structure (leaf area index [LAI] and canopy height) would be incorporated into the present model to improve the model accuracy and transferability in future studies. © 2022 by the authors.","mangrove; red edge; seasonal leaf nutrients; Sentinel-2 image; XGBoost","Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Infrared devices; Machine learning; Nutrients; Remote sensing; C sequestration; Gradient boosting; Leaf nutrients; Machine learning models; Mangrove; Mangrove forest; Red edge; Seasonal leaf nutrient; Sentinel-2 image; Xgboost; Mapping",Article,Scopus

A particular challenge is monitoring and evaluation in regions with smallholder agricultural systems (∼1 ha) that are often subsistence focused, vulnerable to food insecurity and data scarce. Using multi-day moderate resolution Sentinel-2 and Random Forest models, this study shows that crop type and rice yields in Burkina Faso can be predicted with greater than ∼80% accuracy in the rainy season. Model optimization using varying spectral and vegetation index inputs can increase crop type and yield prediction accuracy in the dry season where denser cultivation is a challenge for the 10–20 m resolution of Sentinel-2. However, there is a trade-off between opting for very high-resolution imagery (<2 m) or the number of bands offered by Sentinel-2 as the bands that occupy and vegetation indices that utilize the red through NIR ranges were most important across all models. In addition, model type, linear Regression or nonlinear Random Forest, matters little when estimating yield in these landscapes, unless Harmonic regression is utilized for the linear model. This study also showed that a model trained with high quality 2019 dry season crop cut data can predict the subsequent dry season's interannual crop type with overall accuracy as high as 60%, comparable to crop type models trained with 2020 survey data and used to estimate crop type in the concurrent season, as the survey collection. This indicates some utility in leveraging the calibrated Random Forest models to make skillful predictions of interannual crop type and ultimately food availability of nearby communities for years with no training data.

However, the assessment on the performance using available RS data, possible RS data combinations, and existing methods is needed to regularly monitor the BA extent. This study aims to assess the performance from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar polarization (Pol.) and gray-level of co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textural features and the integration with Sentinel-2 spectral data (Spec.) for the monthly mapping of BA extent using machine learning algorithms, such as random forests (RFs) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB).

Nowadays, satellite remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) can enable the estimation of these crop production parameters over large geographic areas. The present work aims to estimate the wheat (Triticum aestivum) acreage and yield of Maharajganj, Uttar Pradesh, India, using satellite-based data products and the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model. Uttar Pradesh is the largest wheat-producing state in India, and this district is well known for its quality organic wheat. India is the leader in wheat grain export, and, hence, its monitoring of growth and yield is one of the top economic priorities of the country. For the calculation of wheat acreage, we performed supervised classification using the Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine classifiers and compared their classification accuracy based on ground-truthing. We found that RF performed a significantly accurate acreage assessment (kappa coefficient 0.84) compared to SVM (0.68). The CASA model was then used to calculate the winter crop (Rabi, winter-sown, and summer harvested) wheat net primary productivity (NPP) in the study area for the 2020–2021 growth season using the RF-based acreage product. The model used for wheat NPP-yield conversion (CASA) showed 3100.27 to 5000.44 kg/ha over 148,866 ha of the total wheat area. The results showed that in the 2020–2021 growing season, all the districts of Uttar Pradesh had similar wheat growth trends. A total of 30 observational data points were used to verify the CASA model-based estimates of wheat yield. Field-based verification shows that the estimated yield correlates well with the observed yield (R2 = 0.554, RMSE = 3.36 Q/ha, MAE −0.56 t ha−1, and MRE = −4.61%). Such an accuracy for assessing regional wheat yield can prove to be one of the promising methods for calculating the whole region’s agricultural yield. The study concludes that RF classifier-based yield estimation has shown more accurate results and can meet the requirements of a regional-scale wheat grain yield estimation and, thus, can prove highly beneficial in policy and decision making. © 2022 by the authors.

In this study, we proposed two different approaches using mono-temporal and multi-temporal Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to detect burnt areas in Rokan Hilir Regency, Indonesia. The multi-temporal approaches utilized two different ensemble machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and XGBoost) and used six composite spectral indices of the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), differenced Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (dNBR2), differenced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (dNDVI), differenced Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (dSAVI), differenced Char Soil Index (dCSI), differenced Burnt area Index for Sentinel-2 (dBAIS2), and differenced Mid-infrared Burn Index (dMIRBI) as model inputs. The burnt areas are labeled by combining hotspots with confidence intervals above 95%, fire spots, and change detection methods. The XGBoost model achieved the best performance with an F1 score of 0.97 and an accuracy of 96%. Furthermore, we use the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to quantify the contribution of each feature as well as its correlation with the target class.

ANN and ML algorithms are powerful tools to evaluate the results and make more precise and high accuracy predictions in the field of plant tissue culture, especially for industrial purposes. Keeping in view, the study was designed to investigate the possible response of variable concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on germination and morphological traits of in vitro-grown hemp seedlings by using ML algorithms. Five different ML algorithms used in this study to evaluate the prediction of the output variables were: Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Gaussian Process (GP), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF) models, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network utilizing accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall values. Among the tested models, the RF model exhibited better prediction of output variables with a high F1 score in the range of 0.98–1.00. The F1 scores of the other models ranged between 0.69 and 0.86. Response surface methodology (RSM) used to compute the optimum concentration of H2O2 revealed the statistically significant effect of H2O2 on in vitro germination and seedling growth. The optimum value of H2O2 for the maximum germination and seedling was optimized to about ~2.2% by using RSM.

Glass-fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars are a durable alternative to conventional steel rebars; however, they are susceptible to degradation in a harsh alkaline concrete environment.

The sensitivity of production parameters of GFRP rebars and environmental factors in estimating TSR is also discussed. Statistical analyses, e.g. root mean square error (RMSE) and determination coefficient (R2), are used to assess the proposed models' accuracy. The predictions from the developed models manifested a reliable agreement to the experimental results. In comparison, the developed DNN and hybrid ANFIS-GA algorithms outperformed MPMR.

This study aims at investigating to what extent that rainfall, temperature and runoff could ably transmit significant information needed for analyzing and predicting crop yields under extreme unmitigated climate change conditions (RCP 8.5) in the Nile basin, using mutual information and stepwise regression models. Monthly climate change outputs (2040–2079) were derived from the fifth phase of the coupled inter-comparison project (CMIP5) and six regional climate models of the CORDEX-Africa. Yield time series (1970–2016) of selected crops (sorghum, groundnut, wheat, potato, and sugarcane) were retrieved from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The analysis was carried out using the R package, QGIS, and Excel sheets. The MI results stated the significant interdependency of crop yields on weather variables, especially temperature. Developed stepwise crop yield models managed to explain 9–97% of inter-annual variability in crop yields, depending on location and crop concerned. Unlike predominating results, most crop yields in the Nile basin will be benefited from climate change by 2079. Generally, the crop farming would remain more resilient to global warming in Egypt and vice versa holds for the basin’s tropical countries, especially Rwanda and Burundi. Yields of sugarcane, groundnut, and sorghum, respectively, showed the highest sensitivity to global warming. There is a compelling need to analysis of uncertainty in crop yields and climate change using finer spatial and temporal datasets in the Nile basin. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate; Crop yields; Mutual information; Nile basin; Prediction; Regression","climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; CMIP; crop yield; regression analysis; Nile Basin",Article,Scopus

Remotely sensed evapotranspiration products (RS-ET) have been adopted as an additional constraint on watershed modeling to enhance the accuracy of water cycling predictions while reducing uncertainty. However, plant parameters affecting evapotranspiration (ET) in watershed models are poorly calibrated without the use of appropriate constraints. The goal of this study is to assess the predictive uncertainty of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), depending on the inclusion or exclusion of annual crop yield as an additional constraint for an agricultural watershed. We analyzed the simulated results with acceptable performance measures depending on a varying degree of model constraints: one constraint (streamflow), two constraints (streamflow and RS-ET) and three constraints (streamflow, RS-ET, and crop yield). The three performance measures used were Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Percent bias (P-bias), and Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE). As the number of model's constraints increased, the number of acceptable parameter sets were substantially reduced from 180 (acceptable for streamflow) to 116 (acceptable for streamflow and RS-ET) and 2 (acceptable for streamflow, RS-ET, and crop yield). In addition, overall model performance measures for ET were greatest in the simulation results with three constraints representing 0.02–0.2 and 0.04–0.05 greater NSE and KGE values than those of one constraint and two constraints, respectively. The parameter set with the best ET performance measures was also acceptable for predicting crop yield. Based on these results, we conclude that this crop yield data can be adopted as a model constraint for agricultural watersheds to reduce model uncertainty in ET simulations and to increase model prediction accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additional constraint; Predictive uncertainty; Remotely sensed evapotranspiration; Watershed modeling","Crops; Cultivation; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Remote sensing; Stream flow; Uncertainty analysis; Watersheds; Additional constraint; Agricultural watersheds; Crop yield; Model constraints; Performance measure; Predictive uncertainty; Remotely sensed evapotranspirations; Uncertainty; Water cycling; Watershed modelling; Efficiency; crop yield; cultivation; evapotranspiration; remote sensing; streamflow; watershed",Article,Scopus

The existing area-yield crop insurance scheme guarantees a certain per cent of normal green biomass yield of the crop over an insured area. Lack of reliable yield data has diminished the effectiveness of this scheme. Therefore, an alternate basis for jute yield loss assessment using satellite-derived crop performance index called ‘Crop Health Factor (CHF)’ was developed and implemented as documented in this paper. Both optical and microwave data of Sentinels along with weather and field data sets were analysed to map the jute crop fields and to generate crop condition indices such as NDVI, LSWI, VH backscatter, FAPAR and rainfall derivatives for the current (2020) and past years (2017, 2018 and 2019). The metrics derived from these indices were subjected to entropy analysis to produce the CHF values for different insurance units, which were found to be well correlated with yield. CHF data was used in place of yield for assessing crop loss and insurance pay-outs.

However, such water accounting tools and models have dependencies to the choice of precipitation data used to drive the model, as the input bias propagate into simulated streamflow through interaction with different hydrological processes. This study performs a holistic investigation of sensitivity of water accounting fractions like blue water flow (BWF), green water flow (GWF), green water storage (GWS), and their dependencies on secondary precipitation datasets (SPDs) choices using a lumped conceptual rainfall-runoff model [Hydrological Simulation model (HYSIM)] and a physically based semi-distributed hydrological model [Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)] in the Damodar River basin, India. These models were driven by seven gridded precipitation datasets, including India Meteorological Department (IMD) data, Indian Monsoon Data Assimilation and Analysis (IMDAA) data, Asian Precipitation-Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation (APHRODITE) data, Watch forcing ERA-Interim data, Climate Hazard Group Infrared Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), PRINCETON precipitation data and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Network-Climate Data Records (PERSIANN-CDR) data. The reference IMD based multimodel results revealed that the annual average blue and green water components of the Damoder River were in the range of 558–656 mm/year, 574–728 mm/year and 34–112 mm/year for BWF, GWF, and GWS respectively during 1994–2010 period. The results obtained after applying parameter transferability approach across the input space have revealed exact quantification of choice dependent annual variations in spatial and temporal characteristics of BWF, GWF, and GWS. A further evaluation based on error propagation ratios (γCC, γrRMSE, γB) has revealed a quantification of input choice induced dampening/magnification effects on flow estimations of both the HYSIM and SWAT and these quantifications were free from the compensation effects of recalibration. The findings in this study demonstrate that the change in annual average BWF varies between −46.97% to +41.38% in comparison to benchmark IMD simulations, and the corresponding changes for GWF is between −19.63% and +17.06% and for GWS is between −29.97% to +35.5% with different choices of SPD scenarios.

The study objectives were to (i) calibrate and validate a simple crop model (Hybrid-Maize) using in-situ measured data from sixteen uniquely managed treatments as part of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Testing Ag Performance Solutions (TAPS) program in North Platte, NE, and (ii) carry out sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation using a multi-parameter optimization approach. Sixteen Arable Mark 1 sensors and thirty two Mark 2 sensors (Arable Labs Inc., San Francisco, CA) collecting hourly and daily weather and crop information in 2019 and 2020 respectively, were installed in the TAPS subsurface drip irrigation experimental plots which were planted with maize and subjected to different irrigation and nitrogen practices. Hybrid-Maize was used for simulating maize yield on the sixteen treatments in 2019 and 2020. Sensitivity analysis showed that initial light use efficiency (LUE), potential kernel filling rate (G5), potential number of kernels per ear (G2), growth respiration coefficient of grain (GRG), empirical parameter determining the relative contribution of a soil layer to water uptake (SLW), and maximum photosynthetic rate (MPR) were the most sensitive parameters to yield. A novel multi-parameter optimization (MPO) approach based on kriging was used for calibrating these six parameters, and the best parameter sets which were later used for model validation. Calibration results showed that there seemed to be strong linear relationships between total water received (WR) and some of the parameters. By using each year's MPO averages of the six parameters instead of default values, ME, MAE, RMSE, uRMSE, and nRMSE were all reduced by about 69%, 66%, 60%, 27%, and 61% respectively for validation treatments. The advantage of using in-situ sensors, coupled with the suitability of the calibrated model for simulating maize yield under different irrigation management, will make the model more useful in future field-scale research with focus on developing decision support tools for in-season crop management and yield forecasts. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Hybrid-Maize; In-situ sensors; Irrigation; Multi-parameter estimation; Yield prediction","Crops; Decision support systems; Irrigation; Parameter estimation; Software testing; Soils; Crop modeling; Hybrid-maize; In-situ sensors; Irrigation management; Maize yield; Multi-parameter estimation; Multi-parameter optimizations; Multiparameters; Parameters estimation; Yield prediction; Sensitivity analysis; drip irrigation; kriging; light use efficiency; maize; modeling; yield response; Canterbury [South Island]; Lincoln; Marcq; Nebraska; New Zealand; North Platte; San Francisco [California]; South Island; United States",Article,Scopus

The present study attempts to understand the consequences of existing changing patterns of climate and LULC on the hydrology of the Usri watershed. Different water balance components were simulated using a semi-distributed Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Sixteen scenarios were generated using combinations of four periods of climatic data (1974–84; 1985–1995; 1996–2006 and 2007–2016) and four sets of land use maps (1976; 1989; 2000 and 2014). The SWAT model performed well for monthly stream flows during calibration and validation. The study finds that the individual impact of LULC change contributes to increase in the streamflow and decrease in evapotranspiration (ET) primarily due to increase in urbanization and decrease in water bodies, forest cover and barren land of Usri watershed. The combined impact of climatic variations and land use change reveals complex interactions. The study provides insight into hydrological response to variations in climate and land use changes in Usri watershed in recent decades.

These factors were evaluated by using stepwise linear regression (LR) and random forest (RF). Robust field data sets from 2016 to 2018 with weighed yields from three regions in southern Germany in the range of 49 dt ha−1 to 102 dt ha−1 were used for calibration and validation.

A new approach using all raw bands of Sentinel-2 in combination with evapotranspiration and precipitation, delivered a reduced number of features and explained 84% of the yield variance with a RMSE of 5.6 dt ha−1. Alternatively, the NDWI-based CWR merged all significant parameters into one feature and explained 79% of the variance with a RMSE of 6.46 dt ha−1.

To address these issues, we develop a multilevel LC contextual (MLCC) framework that can adaptively integrate the effective global context with the local context for LC classification. The MLCC framework comprises two modules: a DCNN-based LC classification network (DLCN) and a multilevel context integration module (MCIM). By a well-defined deep network, DLCN could enhance the effective global context feature while weakening the ambiguous representation. Besides, MCIM enables adaptive combinate the global and local context under the guidance of uncertainty map in an efficient way. This collaboratively global–local contextual information further boosts the discriminate feature representation for effective and efficient LC classification. The experiments on LC datasets demonstrate that the proposed MLCC has superior capability in capturing contextual features and thus outperforms the existing methods. © 2022","Contextual information; Deep convolutional neural networks(DCNNs); Feature fusion; Land cover(LC) classification","artificial neural network; image processing; land classification; land cover; remote sensing",Article,Scopus

Added water also cools crop plants through transpiration; irrigation might thus play an important role in a warmer climate by simultaneously moderating water and high temperature stresses. Here we used satellite-derived evapotranspiration estimates, land surface temperature (LST) measurements, and crop phenological stage information from Nebraska maize to quantify how irrigation relieves both water and temperature stresses. Unlike air temperature metrics, satellite-derived LST revealed a significant irrigation-induced cooling effect, especially during the grain filling period (GFP) of crop growth. This cooling appeared to extend the maize growing season, especially for GFP, likely due to the stronger temperature sensitivity of phenological development during this stage. Our analysis also revealed that irrigation not only reduced water and temperature stress but also weakened the response of yield to these stresses. Specifically, temperature stress was significantly weakened for reproductive processes in irrigated maize. Attribution analysis further suggested that water and high temperature stress alleviation was responsible for 65±10% and 35±5.3% of the irrigation yield benefit, respectively. Our study underlines the relative importance of high temperature stress alleviation in yield improvement and the necessity of simulating crop surface temperature to better quantify heat stress effects in crop yield models.

The silvopastoral system is an efficient alternative to full sun pastures that could be used to sustainably intensify animal and crop production. However, the adoption of this system is being held back by a lack of knowledge on how the trees in such a system should be arranged in order to avoid detrimental effects on pasture growth. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test different arrangements of trees in the Eucalyptus-Marandu palisade grass silvopastoral system and to evaluate its performance in different regions of Brazil. METHODS: A functional-structural plant model was developed to simulate radiation interception by trees and was then coupled to the CROPGRO-Perennial Forage model to simulate the production of forage biomass. Considering solar radiation as the main resource under competition, water interactions that occur under-ground between Eucalyptus and Maranu palisade grass were not considered. The models were calibrated with experimental data collected in silvopastoral systems in Brazil. The silvopastoral systems were selected according to a combination of tree row spacing (15, 30, and 45 m), two row orientations (north-south and east-west), and single or triple rows. Simulations were replicated for different tree ages (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 years) representing different levels of shading. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our simulations show that the tree arrangement has a significant effect on the incidence of radiation on the pasture, resulting in different levels of forage production. Row spacing of 30 and 45 m is suitable for providing forage for the animals for several years. In contrast, tree arrangements with a row spacing of 15 m or triple lines demand more careful planning and management, taking into account the soil and climatic characteristics of each region. Lower declines in the forage production were observed in arrangements of 45 m, varying from 1000 and 3000 kg ha−1 after 6 years of system establishment. In this period, the annual production level was lower than 14,000 kg ha−1 for arrangments with row spacing of 15 and 30 m, being recommend pruning and thinning practices aiming to increase the radiation incidence within the system.

In each phenological period, the vegetation indices and meteorological factors were optimized. Then the accuracy and spatiotemporal transferability of the phenological piecewise modelling was compared with that of the whole-season modelling based on four regression methods (i.e. multiple linear regression, artificial neural network, support vector regression and random forest). The results showed that the optimal combinations of variables for the whole-season modelling and the phenological piecewise modelling were different.

In addition, compared with the whole-season models, the spatiotemporal transferability for the phenological piecewise models was generally better. The accuracies after spatiotemporal transfer for the phenological piecewise models were still higher than that for the whole-season models. © 2022 The Author(s).

Several analytical models using artificial intelligence (AI) have been developed to resolve challenges facing the banana supply chain. The number of publications in this field has steadily increased each year. However, a literature review regarding the trends of recent AI developments is not available. Thus, this study reviews the current scenario of scientific research involving AI in the stages of the banana supply chain (pre-harvest, harvest, post-harvest, processing and retail). This review covers literature published between 2015 and 2020 from online databases. Fifty-two relevant studies were retrieved from 23 countries. Consequently, we propose an AI-performance framework based on real applications implemented for bananas: the application domain, learning algorithms, performance metrics, and reported impacts. This paper discovers 11 AI-application areas for bananas, such as ripeness, leaf diseases, quality grading, crop type, crop yield, and soil control. Moreover, this review summarizes the main functionality of learning algorithms found in the literature (ANN, CNN, SVM, and K-NN). Finally, the future challenges are discussed. This comprehensive review will help researchers understand AI applications in the banana sector and analyze the knowledge gap for future studies. © 2022.

The main objective of this research is to develop an operational methodology for predicting rice yield that is utilized to assess the impacts of drought and flood disasters on agricultural productivity taking Jiangxi, China as an example. For this purpose, we first calculated the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) using monthly rainfall data of 83 stations from 1960 to 2020 to identify the disastrous years and their spatial extent of impact. Then, time-series MODIS data from 2000 to 2020, Landsat images, digital elevation model (DEM) were obtained and utilized for rice plantation mapping using decision-tree algorithm and yield estimation. The identified 3-cropping rice plantations were converted into rice masks for calculating the county-level cumulative NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) to match the reported county-level annual rice yield for building remote sensing-based rice yield models taking the averages of 2016–2019 as test. By comparing the determination coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and prediction accuracy of the models, we found that the best model for rice yield estimation is Y D = 4.899 × 10−6×NDVI 2 + 2.891 × NDVI + 98511.218 (R2 = 0.898). This model was applied to estimate the county-level annual rice production of 2014 and 2015, and provincial annual rice production of 2010–2019 for validation and prediction. The agreement with the government-reported yield reaches 97–98% at provincial level and the models were hence considered reliable. After verification, the models were applied to other remained years after 2010 for estimating the provincial annual rice production. Then, a new disaster indicator, that is, the disaster composite index (DCI) was developed for assessing the disaster impact on annual rice production in a pilot area around Nanchang City. Results show that developed models are capable of achieving rice yield estimation using both MODIS data for regional and Landsat data for local scale. In comparison with the normal or least affected year, impacts of drought and flood were successfully evaluated using DCI for pilot area and their relationship was created. We hence believe the developed methodology is extendable to South China and other rice plantation area in the world. © 2022 The Author(s).

Big data and data analysis methods and models are important tools in food security (FS) studies for gap analysis and preparation of appropriate analytical frameworks. These innovations necessitate the development of novel methods for collecting, storing, processing, and extracting data. Methodology. The primary goal of this study was to conduct a critical review of agricultural big data and methods and models used for FS studies published in peer-reviewed journals since 2010. Approximately 130 articles were selected for full content review after the pre-screening process. Results. There are different sources of data collection, including but not limited to online databases, the internet, omics, Internet of Things, social media, survey rounds, remote sensing, and the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database. The collected data require analysis (i.e., mining, neural networks, Bayesian networks, and other ML algorithms) before data visualization using Python, R, Circos, Gephi, Tableau, or Cytoscape. Approximately 122 models, all of which were used in FS studies worldwide, were selected from 130 articles. However, most of these models addressed only one or two dimensions of FS (i.e., availability and access) and ignored the other dimensions (i.e., stability and utilization), creating a gap in the global context. Conclusions. There are certain FS gaps both worldwide and in the United Arab Emirates that need to be addressed by scientists and policymakers. Following the identification of the drivers, policies, and indicators, the findings of this review could be used to develop an appropriate analytical framework for FS and nutrition.

In agricultural systems, the growing demand for stable crop production requires the adoption of useful tools for the sustainable intensification of agriculture. While organic farming systems face various drawbacks, which affect crop yield. Among the limiting factors, weed management is one of the most difficult aspects of organic farming. Objective: The aim of the study was (i) to evaluate the effect of weed pressure on yield spatial variability (ii) to analyze the spatial variability of yield and yield components based on hand-sampled yield data (iii) to evaluate the ability of the most commonly used vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Sentinel-2 satellite platforms to understand within-field spatial and temporal variability during the crop cycle (iv) to evaluate the ability of the cluster analysis procedures on NDVI satellite data to identify, discriminate and map sub-areas with different yield, yield components, and weed pressure at the farm level in an organic farming system. Methods: Remote sensing techniques (Sentinel-2 images), vegetation index (NDVI), cluster analysis (Hierarchical clustering Ward's minimum variance approach) and hand-sampled data (georeferenced yield and yield components field data) were used for understanding the spatio-temporal behavior of crops. Results and conclusions: The cluster analysis of NDVI data from Sentinel-2 collected at eight different stages detected the crop spatial and temporal variability at an early stage. In an open field of 24 ha, an area of about 9 ha, showed a high weed level with a yield average value 78 % lower than the most productive cluster area. The yield components, especially the spike number per square meter, also recorded very low values, mainly due to the negative effect of the high presence of weeds (in particular oats), which reached average values of 250 g m-2. An area of 7.3 ha showed the highest yield at harvest with a yield value 45 % higher than the mean harvest data. The study highlights that from the early tillering stage to the booting stage the NDVI maps derived from the Satellite Sentinel-2 and clustered by Ward's method represent the weeds distribution impact on crop yield and yield components and an early warning for the assessment of one of the most important limiting factors in organic farming. Significance: Sentinel-2 data and cluster analysis can improve an efficient assessment and management strategies in an organic farming agricultural system. Furthermore, the use of precision agriculture tools in organic farming can lead to a site‐specific management at the farm level and therefore a sustainable intensification of agriculture systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","NDVI; Remote sensing; Spatio-temporal; Sustainable yield; Weed; Wheat",,Article,Scopus

Canopy spectral response in visible near-infrared (VNIR, 400–979 nm) has been widely used to estimate CNC and AGB of canopies but is often confounded by the soil background, crop type, phenological changes and environmental conditions. Machine (ML) and deep learning (DL) have emerged as promising techniques for mapping CNC and AGB using canopy spectral reflectance in VNIR. However, ML and DL models’ performance relies on extensive labelled training datasets, which are often limited due to being expensive and labour intensive. We estimated CNC and AGB using state-of-the-art hyperspectral (HS) modeling approaches using partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), and one- and two-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D and 2D CNN). These models, together with multispectral (MS) approaches, were evaluated in the context of a small (422) dataset for model development collected from diverse fertilization and contrasting growth conditions. A handheld field spectroradiometer was used to collect spectral reflectance samples across a wide range (more than ten-fold difference in AGB) of canopy development stages in two seasons (winter and summer) in ryegrass, and across phenological stages (from GS-25 to GS-60) in barley. Results can be summarized in four components: (1) the median values of performance metrics in 1D CNN (R2test=0.83, NRMSEtest=0.15 for CNC; R2test=0.79 (ryegrass), 0.61 (barley), NRMSEtest= 0.29 (ryegrass), 0.30 (barley) for AGB) and PLSR (R2test=0.71, NRMSEtest= 0.20 for CNC; R2test=0.62 (ryegrass), 0.70 (barley), NRMSEtest= 0.38 (ryegrass), 0.27 (barley) for AGB) showed the best performance for CNC and AGB prediction in the test data; (2) when evaluated with the independent measurements, 1D CNN demonstrated the best (up to 56% decrease in NRMSE) performance for AGB and was comparable to PLSR for CNC (up to 25% decrease in NRMSE than their HS and MS counterparts); (3) predictive models underperformed at low canopy cover for CNC estimation and were adversely affected by the high biomass saturation effects for AGB prediction; and (4) visible spectrum is relatively more informative to CNC models whereas the red edge to NIR spectrum is more informative to AGB models.

Multi-temporal Landsat images were used within the Python module for the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land model to calculate rice ETa and CWP during the dry seasons of 2013 and 2014. Results showed noticeable spatial variations in PySEBAL-derived ETa and CWP in farmers’ fields during the study period. The distance between plot and irrigation scheme inlet (DPSI), plot elevation, sand and silt contents, soil total nitrogen, soil extractable potassium and zinc were the main factors affecting variabilities in ETa and CWP in the farmers’ fields, with DPSI being the top explanatory variable. There was generally a positive association, up to a given threshold, between ETa and DPSI, sand and silt contents and soil extractable zinc. For CWP the association patterns for the top six predictors were all non-monotonic; that is a mix of increasing and decreasing associations of a given predictor to either an increase or a decrease in CWP. Our results indicate that improving irrigated rice performance in the Kou Valley irrigation scheme would require growing more rice at lower altitudes (e.g. &lt; 300 m above sea level) and closer to the scheme inlet, in conjunction with a good management of nutrients such as nitrogen and potassium through fertilization. © 2023 The Authors","Irrigation performance; Machine learning; Soil property; Sub-Sahara Africa; Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL); Sustainable agriculture","Crops; Cultivation; Forestry; Interfacial energy; Irrigation; Nitrogen; Potassium; Remote sensing; Sea level; Zinc; Biophysical factors; Crop water productivity; Irrigation performance; Machine-learning; Soil property; Sub-Sahara Africa; Surface energy balance algorithm for land; Surface energy balance algorithm for lands; Sustainable agriculture; Machine learning; alternative agriculture; altitude; assessment method; climate conditions; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; Landsat; remote sensing; rice; satellite imagery; seasonal variation; semiarid region; soil property; Burkina Faso",Article,Scopus

RF successfully predicted Pcoll content (R2 = 0.98). Results showed that colloidal- organic carbon (OCcoll) and minerals were the major determinants of total Pcoll content (1–450 nm); their critical values for increasing Pcoll release were 87.0 mg L−1 for OCcoll, 11.0 mg L−1 for iron (Fecoll) or aluminium (Alcoll), 2.6 mg L−1 for calcium (Cacoll), 9.0 mg L−1 for magnesium (Mgcoll), 2.5 mg L−1 for silicon (Sicoll), and 1.4 mg L−1 for manganese (Mncoll). Among three colloidal subfractions, the major factors determining Pcoll were soil Olsen-P (POlsen; 125.0 mg kg−1), Cacoll (2.5 mg L−1), and colloidal P saturation (21.0%) in NC; Mncoll (1.5 mg L−1), Mgcoll (6.8 mg L−1), and POlsen (135.0 mg kg−1) in FC; while Mncoll (1.5 mg L−1), Alcoll (2.5 mg L−1), and Fecoll (3.8 mg L−1) in MC, respectively. OCcoll had a considerable effect in the three fractions, with critical values of 80.0 mg L−1 in NC or FC, and 50.0 mg L−1 in MC.

Identifying phenological events assists growers in determining plant maturity, and harvest timing and guides the application of time-specific crop inputs. Currently, phenological monitoring requires repeated manual observations of individual plants’ growth stages, which is highly laborious, time-inefficient, and requires the handling and integration of large field-based data sets. The ability of growers to accurately forecast yield is also compounded by the asynchronous growth of banana plants. Satellite remote sensing has proved effective in monitoring spatial and temporal crop phenology in many broadacre crops. However, for banana crops, very high spatial and temporal resolution imagery is required to enable individual plant level monitoring. Unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV)-based sensing technologies provide a cost-effective solution, with the potential to derive information on health, yield, and growth in a timely, consistent, and quantifiable manner. Our research explores the ability of UAV-derived data to track temporal phenological changes of individual banana plants from follower establishment to harvest. Individual plant crowns were delineated using object-based image analysis, with calculations of canopy height and canopy area producing strong correlations against corresponding ground-based measures of these parameters (R2 of 0.77 and 0.69 respectively). A temporal profile of canopy reflectance and plant morphology for 15 selected banana plants were derived from UAV-captured multispectral data over 21 UAV campaigns. The temporal profile was validated against ground-based determinations of key phenological growth stages. Derived measures of minimum plant height provided the strongest correlations to plant establishment and harvest, whilst interpolated maxima of normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) best indicated flower emergence. For pre-harvest yield forecasting, the Enhanced Vegetation Index 2 provided the strongest relationship (R2 = 0.77) from imagery captured near flower emergence. These findings demonstrate that UAV-based multitemporal crop monitoring of individual banana plants can be used to determine key growing stages of banana plants and offer pre-harvest yield forecasts. © 2023 by the authors.","banana plant; geographic object-based image analysis; multispectral; multitemporal; phenology; UAV; unoccupied aerial vehicle; yield","Antennas; Cost effectiveness; Forecasting; Fruits; Harvesting; Image analysis; Image enhancement; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation mapping; Aerial vehicle; Banana plant; Geographic object-based image analysis; Multi-spectral; Multi-temporal; Phenology; Unoccupied aerial vehicle; Yield; Crops",Article,Scopus

Best management practices (BMPs) were run through the model to simulate the effects of watershed intervention scenarios on sediment yield and runoff. Simulation results of BMP intervention were compared with the reference and worst-case scenarios. The simulation of sediment production indicates a clear growing trend. Temporally, the maximum amount of sediment transported out of the watershed is experiential from June to September, and the minimum is in February. A plainly defined similar orientation is observed between precipitation, surface runoff, and sediment load in the landscape. Spatially, the maximum sediment transported out of the watershed is from agricultural landscape units with a slope of over 50%, annual precipitation above 1592 mm, and surface runoff over 151 mm. This signifies that the watershed is under serious threat from erosion due to vegetation loss, steep slope farming, and high surface runoff. Gibe III is a 243-m high roller compacted gravity dam built on the Omo-Gibe River basin in Ethiopia for hydroelectric power and downstream flood control. It is one of Africa’s tallest dams, with an annual electric output of 1870 MW that began operation in 2016. Thus, Gibe III could see a loss of storage capacity due to higher-than-expected sedimentation resulting from worsening environmental degradation, which implies that the beneficial uses that depend on this dam — electricity production, regulated irrigation water supply, and flood control — will decline with significant economic losses. Despite that, selected sustainable land management interventions and the application of BMPs to critical erosion-prone hotspot areas can support the overall reduction in total sediment yield and surface runoff. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","BMP intervention; Gojeb; Hydrosediment; Management scenario; Runoff discharge; Watershed","water; agriculture; Ethiopia; procedures; soil; water supply; Agriculture; Ethiopia; Soil; Water; Water Supply",Article,Scopus

This study aims to improve the quantification of yield, grain protein concentration (GPC), and nitrogen (N) output in winter wheat with RS imagery. Ground-truth wheat traits were measured at flowering and harvest in a field experiment combining four N and two water levels in central Spain over 2 years. Hyperspectral and thermal airborne images coincident with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 were acquired at flowering. A parametric linear model using all hyperspectral normalized difference spectral indices (NDSI) and two non-parametric models (artificial neural network and random forest) were used to assess their estimation ability combining NDSIs and other RS indicators. The feasibility of using freely available multispectral satellite was tested by applying the same methodology but using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 bands. Yield estimation obtained the highest R2 value, showing that the visible and short-wave infrared region (VSWIR) had similar accuracy to the hyperspectral and Sentinel-2 imagery (R2 ≈ 0.84). The SWIR bands were important in the GPC estimation with both sensors, whereas N output was better estimated using red-edge-based NDSIs, obtaining satisfactory results with the hyperspectral sensor (R2 = 0.74) and with the Sentinel-2 (R2 = 0.62). When including the Sentinel-2 SWIR index, the NDSI (B11, B3) improved the estimation of N output (R2 = 0.71).

Thus, the mapping of cropland irrigation plays a significant role in agricultural water management and estimating food production. However, current spaceborne irrigated cropland mapping is highly reliant upon its spectral behavior, which often has high uncertainty and lacks information about the method of irrigation. Deep learning (DL) allows for the classification of irrigated cropland according to unique spatial patterns, such as the central pivot irrigation system (CPIS). But convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are usually biased toward color and texture features, a spatial transferable and accurate CPIS identification model is lacking owing to previous model seldom involves the round shapes of CPIS, which is usually key to distinguishing CPIS. To address this lack, we proposed a shape attention neural network by integrating spatial-attention gate, residual block, and multi-task learning, Pivot-Net, to incorporate shape information identify CPIS in satellite imagery. Specifically, we employed CPIS in Kansas to train our model using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical images. We found that Pivot-Net is superior to seven state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models on second-stage validation. We also evaluated the performance of Pivot-Net at three validation sites, which had an average F1-score and mean IOU of 90.68% and 90.45%, respectively, which further demonstrated the high accuracy of the proposed model. Moreover, to show that the proposed Pivot-Net can map CPIS at the country scale, we generated the first CPIS map at 30 m for the contiguous US using a cloud computing platform and our Pivot-Net model. The total CPIS area for the contiguous US was 61,094 km2 in 2018, which comprised 26.22% of all irrigated lands. Our results can be accessed at https://tianfyou.users.earthengine.app/view/cpisus. Therefore, the proposed shape-attention Pivot-Net demonstrates the ability to classify CPIS at large spatial scales and are feasible to map CPIS at national scales. © 2023 The Author(s).

Defining agricultural marginal land is a task that involves more than just considering the land's quality, its definition changed a lot during the last two centuries. OBJECTIVE: Development of new technologies and policy trends require the concepts of prime land and marginal land to be renewed from time to time. Although much research has been done on the concept of marginal land, it is currently limited by the lack of a clear, globally accepted definition. METHOD: There are four major sources of criteria of marginal lands: economic (e.g., rent cost, land value), geographical (e.g., temperature, slope, precipitation), ecosystem-based (e.g., protected areas, recreation, ecosystem services), soil suitability (e.g., yield capability, physical and chemical soil properties). The categorisation of agricultural land into groups like productive, marginal or unproductive often depends on the cultivation or management type. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Since conceptions of marginal land are dynamic both in time and space, flexible policy and practical solutions are needed for their non-degrading use, which in any case shall support nature-based socioeconomic development. To maintain the socioeconomic value of these areas, it is crucial to develop rural areas that are economically or biophysically marginalised. High nature value farming, bioenergy crops by sustainable land management and afforestation are highly recommended. Choosing the right management can transform marginal land into an optimal soil condition or incorrect management can degrade prime land into marginal land (unproductive land). SIGNIFICANCE: This paper provides a review and categorisation of the historical and new developments of marginal land concepts especially those which are working with agricultural aspects, including land management and reclamation. It could give a strong basis for further research in topic of marginal land. © 2022","Agriculture; Concept; Land management; Marginal land; Marginal land review","afforestation; agricultural land; bioenergy; crop yield; cultivation; land management",Review,Scopus

Grain production in China has remarkably improved since its founding in 1949, but the growth remains uneven across regions. The goal of this research was to assess the determinants of the yields of three major food crops (maize, rice, and wheat) in China and the mechanism of their responses to increased crop yields. Boosted regression tree models were created to capture the linked complex predictor-response relationships between crop yields and individual explanatory variables using prefecture-level agricultural statistics in China coupled with geographic data during the period from 1952 to 2017. The results showed that technological inputs (e.g., fertilizers, electricity consumption, and power of agricultural machinery) played a key role in the increase of crop yields, which explained 47%, 39%, and 62% of the variances in the yields of maize, rice, and wheat during the period 1952–2017, respectively. However, the contribution of technology became weaker over time, while the contribution of agro-environmental conditions and structural characteristics of administrative regions became stronger. Partial dependence plots indicated that encouraging higher technological inputs, accelerating large-scale grain production, shortening the urban-rural income gap, and improving the education of farmers were conductive to increasing crop yields. Overall, our results suggest that grain production policies aimed at increasing crop yields should better reflect the spatial heterogeneity of yield gaps; low-yield-gap regions should improve the utilization efficiency of water and fertilizer and formulate measures to inhibit non-grain production on cultivated land, while high-yield-gap regions should focus on improving technological inputs and promoting agricultural restructuring. This study provides deep insights into the processes of how individual explanatory variables affect crop yields, which is essential to develop differentiated grain production policies and provide valuable references for shortening yield gaps in high-yield-gap regions. © 2022","Boosted regression trees; China; Crop yields; Grain production policies; Sustainable agriculture","education; growth rate; China",Article,Scopus

Traditional landform modeling approaches are labor-intensive and time-consuming. In recent years, landform mapping has increasingly been digitized. This study conducted an in-depth analysis of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in combination with geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA), for mapping volcanic and glacial landforms. Sentinel-2 image, as well as predisposing variables (DEM and its derivatives, e.g., slope, aspect, curvature and flow accumulation), were segmented using a multi-resolution segmentation algorithm, and relevant features were selected to define segmentation scales for each landform category. A set of object-based features was developed based on spectral (e.g., brightness), geometrical (e.g., shape index), and textural (grey level co-occurrence matrix) information. The landform modelling networks were then trained and tested based on labelled objects generated using GEOBIA and ground control points. Our results show that an integrated approach of GEOBIA and CNN achieved an ACC of 0.9685, 0.9780, 0.9614, 0.9767, 0.9675, 0.9718, 0.9600, and 0.9778 for dacite lava, caldera, andesite lava, volcanic cone, volcanic tuff, glacial circus, glacial valley, and suspended valley, respectively. The quantitative evaluation shows the highest performance (Accuracy > 0.9600 and cross-validation accuracy > 0.9400) for volcanic and glacial landforms and; therefore, is recommended for regional and large-scale landform mapping. Our results and the provided automatic workflow emphasize the potential of integrated GEOBIA and CNN for fast and efficient landform mapping as a first step in the earth’s surface management. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"article; brightness; convolutional neural network; cross validation; image analysis; plant cone; quantitative analysis; segmentation algorithm; workflow; algorithm; image processing; procedures; Algorithms; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neural Networks, Computer; Workflow",Article,Scopus

However, regression accuracy depends highly on the data available to train the model and the model's generalization ability. Adversely, the prediction error may increase severely if unknown data patterns test the model; such a model is known to be overfitted. In medicine-related applications, such as Non-Invasive Blood Pressure (NIBP) estimation, the high error renders the estimation model useless and dangerous. Methods: This paper presents a novel algorithm to handle overfitting by editing the training data to achieve generalization for subject-wise models. The pooling and patching (PaP) algorithms use a relatively short record segment of a subject as a Key-Segment (KS) to search through a larger dataset for similar subjects. Then samples taken from the matched subjects’ pool records are used to patch the original subject's KS. Due to the significance of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the complexity of its variability, non-invasive estimation of SBP from electrocardiography (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) is introduced as an application to assess the algorithm. The study was performed on 2051 subjects with a wide range of age, height, weight, length, and health status. The subjects’ records were taken from a large public dataset, VitalDB, which is acquired from subjects undergoing different surgeries. Finally, all the results are obtained without using other model generalization techniques. Results: The generalization effect of the proposed algorithm, PaP, significantly outperformed cross-validation, which is widely used in regression model generalization. Moreover, the testing results show that a KS of 200 to 2000 samples is sufficient for providing high accuracy for much longer testing data of about 12000 to 24000 samples long, which is less than %10 of the record length on average. Furthermore, compared to other works based on the same dataset, PaP provides a significantly lower mean error of -0.75 ± 5.51 mmHg, with a small training data portion of 15% over 2051 subjects. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Electrocardiography; Generalization; Machine learning; Overfitting; Photoplethysmography; Regression; Systolic blood pressure","Blood; Blood pressure; Errors; Large dataset; Machine learning; Mercury compounds; Photoplethysmography; Regression analysis; Blood pressure estimation; Generalisation; Key-segment; Machine-learning; Model generalization; Overfitting; Regression; Regression applications; Systolic blood pressure; Training data; Electrocardiography; adult; algorithm; article; blood pressure; controlled study; cross validation; electrocardiography; female; health status; human; human experiment; machine learning; major clinical study; male; photoelectric plethysmography; regression model; systolic blood pressure; algorithm; electrocardiography; medicine; Algorithms; Blood Pressure; Electrocardiography; Humans; Medicine; Photoplethysmography",Article,Scopus

As droughts play a key factor regulating vegetation growth, they inevitably have social and economic effects. Understanding vegetation dynamics and its response to climate change is therefor highly important to reveal the behavior mechanism of terrestrial ecosystems and to guide environmental management. In this investigation, Solar-induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were applied as vegetation indicators to describe vegetation dynamics and meteorological drought was described using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). Bias correction of precipitation and crop yield data of major crop producing areas was also used. By employing correlation coefficient of the maximum absolute value, a drought impact degree and propagation time to vegetation were defined. Dimensions of SIF and NDVI were unified by normalization. Results indicated that: (1) SIF and NDVI generally had a high level of consistency over China, and NDVI had a higher normalized value distribution level than SIF for different vegetation types. (2) Drought generally had a negative impact on vegetation in northern China and a positive impact in southern China. (3) Drought propagation time based on NDVI was larger than that based on SIF. (4) SIF had some advantages when monitoring crop yields among different crop producing areas.

They consider spatial and temporal variability in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum to modulate N applications to the actual crop nutrient status and requirements. However, deriving fertilizer N recommendations exclusively from remote proximal and remote sensing data can lead to substantial inaccuracies and new, more complex approaches are needed. Therefore, this study presents an improved approach that integrates crop modelling, proximal sensing and forecasts weather data to manage site-specific N fertilization in winter wheat. This improved approach is based on four successive steps: (1) optimal N supply is estimated through the DSSAT crop model informed with a combination of observed and forecast weather data; (2) actual crop N uptake is estimated using proximal sensing; (3) N prescription maps are created merging crop model and proximal sensing information, considering also the contribution of the soil N mineralisation; (4) N-Variable Rate Application (N-VRA) is implemented in the field. A VRA method based on DSSAT fed with historical weather data and a business-as- usual uniform fertilization were also compared. The methods were implemented in a 23.4 ha field in Northern Italy, cropped to wheat and characterized by large soil variability in texture and organic matter content. Results indicated that the model-based approaches consistently led to higher yields, agronomic efficiencies and gross margins than the uniform N application rate. Furthermore, the proximal sensing-based approach allowed capturing of the spatial variability in crop N uptake and led to a substantial reduction of the spatial variability in yield and protein content. This study grounds the development of web-based software as a friendly tool to optimize the N variable rate application in winter cereals. © 2022, The Author(s).","DSSAT; Nitrogen Fertilization; Proximal sensing; Variable rate; Winter wheat","crop yield; fertilizer; nitrogen; numerical model; remote sensing; wheat; winter",Article,Scopus

The increasing interest in this crop requires accelerated selection and the development of new screening techniques. New analytical methods that are more accurate and less labor-intensive are needed to better characterize the effects of genetics and the environment on key traits under field conditions. We used persistent multispectral and photogrammetric UAV time-series imagery collected 10 times over the season, together with ground-truth data for thousands of Miscanthus genotypes, to determine the flowering time, culm length, and biomass yield traits. We compared the performance of convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures that used image data from single dates (2D-spatial) versus the integration of multiple dates by 3D-spatiotemporal architectures. The ability of UAV-based remote sensing to rapidly and non-destructively assess large-scale genetic variation in flowering time, height, and biomass production was improved through the use of 3D-spatiotemporal CNN architectures versus 2D-spatial CNN architectures. The performance gains of the best 3D-spatiotemporal analyses compared to the best 2D-spatial architectures manifested in up to 23% improvements in R2, 17% reductions in RMSE, and 20% reductions in MAE. The integration of photogrammetric and spectral features with 3D architectures was crucial to the improved assessment of all traits. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the integration of high-spatiotemporal-resolution UAV imagery with 3D-CNNs enables more accurate monitoring of the dynamics of key phenological and yield-related crop traits. This is especially valuable in highly productive, perennial grass crops such as Miscanthus, where in-field phenotyping is especially challenging and traditionally limits the rate of crop improvement through breeding. © 2022 by the authors.","biomass; convolutional neural networks; culm length; flowering time; Miscanthus; time series","Aerial photography; Antennas; Biomass; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Deep neural networks; Genes; Image enhancement; Integration; Network architecture; Photogrammetry; Remote sensing; Time series; % reductions; Aerial imagery; Convolutional neural network; Culm length; Flowering-time; Miscanthus; Neural network architecture; Perennial crops; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Times series; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)",Article,Scopus

Previous research has indicated that in situ fluorescence sensor measurements can be used as a proxy for nitrogen (N) status in plants in greenhouse conditions employing static sensor measurements. Practitioners of precision N management require determination of in-season plant N status in real-time in the field to enable the most efficient N fertilizer management system. The objective of this study was to assess if mobile in-field fluorescence sensor measurements can accurately quantify the variability of nitrogen indicators in maize canopy early in the crop growing season. A Multiplex®3 fluorescence sensor was used to collect crop canopy data at the V6 and V9 maize growth stages. Multiplex fluorescence indices were successful in discriminating variability among N treatments with moderate accuracies at V6, and higher at the V9 stage. Fluorescence-based indices were further utilized with a machine learning (ML) model to estimate canopy nitrogen indicators i.e., N concentration and above-ground biomass at the V6 and V9 growth stages independently. Parameter estimation using the Support Vector Regression (SVR)-based ML mode indicated a promising accuracy in estimation of N concentration and above-ground biomass at the V6 stage of maize with the moderate range of correlation coefficient (r = 0.72 ± 0.03) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The retrieval accuracies (r = 0.90 ± 0.06) at the V9 stage were better than those of the V6 growth stage with a reasonable range of error estimates and yielding the lowest RMSE (0.23 (%N) and 12.37 g (biomass)) for all canopy N indicators. Mobile fluorescence sensing can be used with reasonable accuracies for determining canopy N variability at early growth stages of maize, which would help farmers in optimal management of nitrogen. © 2022 by the authors.","fluorescence sensor; nitrogen management; precision agriculture; vegetation indices","Biomass; Crops; Cultivation; Fluorescence; Precision agriculture; Aboveground biomass; Fluorescence sensing; Fluorescence sensors; Greenhouse conditions; Growth stages; Nitrogen management; Precision Agriculture; Root mean square errors; Sensor measurements; Vegetation index; Mean square error",Article,Scopus

In this paper, the predictability of models established using UAV multispectral images with different spatial resolutions for nitrogen content of winter wheat was evaluated during the critical growth stages of winter wheat over the period 2021–2022. Feature selection based on UAV image reflectance, vegetation indices, and texture was conducted using the competitive adaptive reweighted sampling, and the random forest machine learning method was used to construct the prediction model with the optimized features. Results showed that model performance increased with decreasing image spatial resolution with a R2, a RMSE, a MAE and a RPD of 0.84, 4.57 g m−2, 2.50 g m−2 and 2.34 (0.01 m spatial resolution image), 0.86, 4.15 g m−2, 2.82 g m−2 and 2.65 (0.02 m), and 0.92, 3.17 g m−2, 2.45 g m−2 and 2.86 (0.05 m), respectively. Further, the transferability of models differed when applied to images with coarser (upscaling) or finer (downscaling) resolutions. For upscaling, the model established with the 0.01 m images had a R2 of 0.84 and 0.89 when applied to images with 0.02 m and 0.05 m resolutions, respectively. For downscaling, the model established with the 0.05 m image features had a R2 of 0.86 and 0.83 when applied to images of 0.01 m and 0.02 m resolutions. Though the image spatial resolution affects image texture features more than the spectral features and the effects of image spatial resolution on model performance and transferability decrease with increasing plant wetness under irrigation treatment, it can be concluded that all the UAV images acquired in this study with different resolutions could achieve good predictions and transferability of the nitrogen content of winter wheat plants. © 2022 by the authors.","model transferability; nitrogen content; random forest; spectral features; texture features; UAV",,Article,Scopus

The results showed that annual maximum GOSIF steadily increased across the whole basin (slope = 0.0031 W m-2μm-1sr-1a-1, P &lt; 0.001). The maximum increasing trend was found in the semi-arid region (0.0034 W m-2μm-1sr-1a-1, P &lt; 0.001). The highest value of annual maximum GOSIF was found in the Qinling-Daba Mountains along with Hengduan Mountain. The lowest GOSIF was found in the western portions of the Loess Plateau and the source region of Yangtze River and Yellow River. Positive correlations between satellite GOSIF and water availability were particularly strong in the Loess Plateaus; in contrast, negative correlations were found in the Hengduan Mountains. The area of water deficit displayed a significant trend towards expansion (slope = 1.539 % a-1 and 0.898 % a-1, P &lt; 0.05), while water surplus areas significantly shrank (slope = 0.847 % a-1 and 0.584 % a-1, P &lt; 0.05) in the Yangtze River and Yellow River basin.

Machine learning algorithms were evaluated to determine Arabica coffee yield. The Classification and Regression Tree (CART) rpart1SE algorithm used for classification and regression provided crucial nutrient thresholds to obtain high yield and minimise yield variability, by increasing vigour in well-nourished plants, with fertiliser management in the field. The use of the random forest model enabled to detect the most important variables for predicting coffee yield, as well as to identify how the nutritional status of the plants, such as Mg, Fe and Ca contents can be balanced to maximise yield. Variables related to the coffee nutritional status were more important than remote sensing variables for estimating coffee yield in the field.

To obtain grants, farmers have to apply every year according to the national/regional procedure that, presently, relies on the Geo‐Spatial Aid Application (GSAA). To ensure the properness of applications, national/regional payment agencies (PA) operate random controls through in‐field surveys. EU regulation n. 809/2014 has introduced a new approach to CAP controls based on Copernicus Sentinel‐2 (S2) data. These are expected to better address PA checks on the field, suggesting eventual inconsistencies between satellite‐based deductions and farmers’ declarations. Within this framework, this work proposed a hierarchical (HI) approach to the classification of crops (soya, corn, wheat, rice, and meadow) explicitly aimed at supporting CAP controls in agriculture, with special concerns about the Piemonte Region (NW Italy) agricultural situation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a comparison is made between HI and other, more ordinary approaches. In particular, two algorithms were considered as references: the minimum distance (MD) and the random forest (RF). Tests were operated in a study area located in the southern part of the Vercelli province (Piemonte), which is mainly devoted to agriculture. Training and validation steps were performed for all the classification approaches (HI, MD, RF) using the same ground data. MD and RF were based on S2‐derived NDVI image time series (TS) for the 2020 year. Differently, HI was built according to a rule‐based approach developing according to the following steps: (a) TS standard deviation analysis in the time domain for meadows mapping; (b) MD classification of winter part of TS in the time domain for wheat detection; (c) MD classification of summer part of TS in the time domain for corn classification; (d) selection of a proper summer multi‐spectral image (SMSI) useful for separating rice from soya with MD operated in the spectral domain. To separate crops of interest from other classes, MD‐based classifications belonging to HI were thresholded by Otsu’s method. Overall accuracy for MD, RF, and HI were found to be 63%, 80%, and 89%, respectively. It is worth remarking that thanks to the SMSI‐based approach of HI, a significant improvement was obtained in soya and rice classification. © 2022 by the authors.

Sentinel-2 images were acquired in this study at six key phenological stages (rejuvenation stage, rising stage, jointing stage, heading stage, filling stage, filling-maturity stage) of winter wheat growth, and various vegetation indexes (VIs) at different fertility stages were calculated. Based on the characteristics of yield data continuity, the RReliefF algorithm was introduced to filter the optimal vegetation index combinations suitable for the yield estimation of winter wheat for all fertility stages. The Absolutely Objective Improved Analytic Hierarchy Process (AOIAHP) was innovatively proposed to determine the proportional contribution of crop growth to yield formation in six different phenological stages. The selected VIs consisting of MTCI(RE2), EVI, REP, MTCI(RE1), RECI(RE1), NDVI(RE1), NDVI(RE3), NDVI(RE2), NDVI, and MSAVI were then fused with the weights of different fertility periods to obtain time-series weighted data. For the characteristics of short time length and a small number of sequences of RS time-series data in yield estimation, this study applied the multiplexed delayed embedding transformation (MDT) technique to realize the data augmentation of the original short time series. Tucker decomposition was performed on the block Hankel tensor (BHT) obtained after MDT enhancement, and the core tensor was extracted while preserving the intrinsic connection of the time-series data. Finally, the resulting multidimensional core tensor was trained with the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to obtain the BHT-ARIMA model for wheat yield estimation. Compared to the performance of the BHT-ARIMA model with unweighted time-series data as input, the weighted time-series input significantly improves yield estimation accuracy. The coefficients of determination (R2) were improved from 0.325 to 0.583. The root mean square error (RMSE) decreased from 492.990 to 323.637 kg/ha, the mean absolute error (MAE) dropped from 350.625 to 255.954, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) decreased from 4.332% to 3.186%. Besides, BHT-ARMA and BHT-CNN models were also used to compare with BHT-ARIMA. The results indicated that the BHT-ARIMA model still had the best yield prediction accuracy.

It plays an important role in guiding policy makers to plan and implement adaptation practices to mitigate potential climate risks to crop. However, due to the diversity in the methodology of vulnerability assessment, there are still knowledge gaps in assessing and comparing crop vulnerability to climate in different regions of the world, including Australia. OBJECTIVE: Our main objectives were to: (1) present a vulnerability analytical method for wheat yield, which can be applied to different areas where long-term crop yield and climate data are available. (2) quantify temporal changes of the vulnerability of wheat yield to historical climate. (3) identify the most vulnerable region in study area to provide guidance for climate mitigation. METHODS: Our study developed an indicator-based method using exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to assess the vulnerability of crop yield. We used the long-term recorded wheat yield data, combining with comprehensive exposure index to assess climate vulnerability of historical yield with a case study area of south-eastern Australia's wheat belt. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that from the 1930s to the 1990s, both climate exposure and sensitivity had large inter-annual variations with no significant trends detected. However, adaptive capacity increased by 34% from 1930s to 1950s, 54% from 1950s to 1970s, and 54% from 1970s to 1990s. By contrast, climate vulnerability across the wheat belt decreased by 13% from 1930s to 1950s, 15% from 1950s to 1970s, and 33% from 1970s to 1990s. This is mainly due to increased adaptive capacity with the improvement of agronomic management practices, technological and socio-economic progress. We identified the areas with the highest vulnerability were in the northwestern parts of wheat belt while the least vulnerable areas located in the southeast. SIGNIFICANCE: We expect that these identified vulnerable hotspots can be used by different landholders to allocate natural resources and policymakers to plan the priority mitigation to adapt to climate change in the local scale. Moreover, the method of vulnerability assessment used in this study can be applied to other regions around the world where long-term crop yield and climate data are available. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive capacity; Climate vulnerability; Exposure index; South-eastern Australia; Wheat belt; Wheat yield","agricultural management; analytical method; assessment method; climate change; crop yield; farmers knowledge; vulnerability; wheat; Australia; Indicator indicator",Article,Scopus

However, early mapping of winter wheat using remotely sensed data is challenging because remote sensing observations can only be used for a part of the growth period. In this study, a framework was proposed for early season mapping of winter wheat using spectral and temporal information of Sentinel-2 images. First, time series of temporal and spectral features were derived using Whittaker smoothing. Subsequently, sensitivities of different parameters (i.e. input features, time interval, and length of time-series data) to early mapping were analyzed. Finally, early maps of winter wheat were generated based on optimal parameters. Results show that the earliest identifiable timing was delayed as the time interval of the time series increased. Winter wheat can be mapped in the early overwintering period (5 months before harvest) with an overall accuracy of 0.91, which is comparable to that of post-season mapping (0.94). In addition, the misclassification in early mapping was caused by uneven sample spatial patterns, natural conditions, and planting management; however, most errors can be gradually amended during the green-up and jointing periods, and the overall accuracy remained stable after the jointing stage. This study demonstrates that it is feasible to implement large-scale early mapping of winter wheat using satellite observations. The proposed approach potentially provides a reference for early mapping of other crop types in agricultural regions worldwide. © 2022 The Author(s).

The conventional practice of using a single variable to calibrate a hydrological model can lead to equifinality, which can result in substantial uncertainty in capturing the internal processes. Since multi-objective calibration process can be a way to solve this problem, a novel stepwise series of calibration experiments are employed by integrating (i) spatiotemporal remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration (AET) data in multi objective calibration process, (ii) Leaf area index (LAI) data, and (iii) AET and LAI data together in multi-objective calibration with Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). This calibration process aims for reducing the equifinality by improving the connected hydrologic internal processes rather than improvement in the assessment metrics at the catchment outlet. The results suggest that the integration of remotely sensed AET and LAI data in multi-objective calibration tend to increase model accuracy and reduce the prediction uncertainty, including significant improvement in simulated evapotranspiration and streamflow. In comparison with the traditional SWAT model, which is based on user input and semiempirical equations to simulate hydrologic processes, AET and LAI integration in multi-objective calibration notably captured the improved evapotranspiration and actual vegetation dynamics estimations, which resulted improvement in streamflow calibration. The findings showed the necessity of integrating remotely sensed AET and LAI data to improve the calibration and reduce the equifinality of hydrologic model simulations. The presented methodology can be replicated through other hydrological models and remote sensing data sources in diverse hydrological systems in the world. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University.","Evapotranspiration; Leaf area index; Multi-variable calibration; SWAT; Uncertainty analysis; Vegetation dynamics","Catchments; Data integration; Evapotranspiration; Remote sensing; Runoff; Stream flow; Uncertainty analysis; Vegetation; Actual evapotranspiration; Calibration process; Equifinality; Leaf Area Index; Multi variables; Multi-objective calibration; Multi-variable calibration; Soil and Water assessment tools; Tool models; Vegetation dynamics; Calibration",Article,Scopus

Thus, it is of great importance to carry out spatiotemporal assessments of the dynamic of potential cultivated land in China, especially in dryland sensitive to climate change. Considering that previous assessments conducted at large scales were often dependent on abundant indicators, which are not easy to obtain or map at high spatiotemporal resolutions, this study combined remote-sensing images and support vector machine (SVM) model to identify the dynamics of potential cultivated land and non-cultivated land in the dryland of China. First, among several vegetation indicators during the growing season, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) in August was the most highly correlated with the yield (R2 =0.72). Second, the potential cultivated land that has not been cultivated was mainly distributed in the northwest and the northeast of the dryland of China, while the potential non-cultivated land that has been cultivated was mainly distributed in the Loess Plateau. According to different models, the area of potential non-cultivated land was 2.78 – 15.68 times that of potential cultivated land. Last, benefitting from the wetting trend, the potential cultivated land in the dryland of China expanded from 2001 to 2015. The area of potential cultivated in 2011–2015 was 34.39% more than that in 2001–2005.

As a large but also weak agricultural country, China must take corresponding adaptation measures in regard to climate change. As C3 and C4 crops have different carbon sequestration pathways, the responses of their growth to climate change are different. This study comprehensively compared the impacts of climate change on the growth of C3 and C4 crops in China by considering several key variables, such as solar radiation, temperature, precipitation, CO2 concentration, and agro–climatic constraints. The WOFOST (WOrld FOod STudies) model was used to quantitatively simulate and analyze the impacts of these variables on crop yield under four different scenarios. The results show that 1) during the growth period, solar radiation had the most significant change, followed by temperature difference between day and night, daily minimum temperature, daily maximum temperature, and precipitation; 2) the growth indicators of both C3 and C4 crops were more strongly correlated with solar radiation and temperature; and 3) under the four scenarios, changes in temperature and solar radiation had negative effects on both C3 and C4 crops in most regions, and changes in CO2 concentration had greater impacts on crop yields than other factors.

In this study, a 3.93 ha agricultural field in Denmark was separated into two parts of well-drained (WD) and poorly-drained (PD) based on the installation depth of the tile drains. The field was continuously monitored for drainage, soil water dynamics, nitrogen leaching through the drains, and grain dry matter and nitrogen yields in a 4-year period (2017–2020). Furthermore, denitrification potential of the top 1 m of the soil at both parts of the field was measured through the denitrifying enzyme activity assay, and a 1D Daisy model was utilized to capture the differences between water and nitrogen balances at WD and PD. Results indicated that on average over the 4 years, annual harvested nitrogen in the crops at PD was 14% lower compared to WD, with a significant reduction of 33% in 2017–2018, that coincided with the longest period of waterlogging at PD. Moreover, greater losses of nitrogen through leaching from drainage and other pathways were measured at the PD (109 kg N ha−1 ya−1) compared to the WD (95 kg N ha−1 ya−1). Based on the simulations, losses through preferential flow pathways to the drains dominated at PD and most of the denitrification is expected to occur within the topsoil.

In this study, a geostatistical approach for bias correction of daily precipitation at ungauged locations is presented. The method utilizes a double quantile mapping with dry day correction for future periods. The transfer function of the bias correction for the ungauged locations is established using distribution functions estimated by ordinary kriging with anisotropic variograms. The methodology was applied to the daily precipitation simulations of the entire CORDEX-Africa ensemble for a study region located in the West African Sudanian Savanna. This ensemble consists of 23 regional climate models (RCM) that were run for three different future scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5). The evaluation of the approach for a historical 50-year period (1950–2005) showed that the method can reduce the inherent strong precipitation bias of RCM simulations, thereby reproducing the main climatological features of the observed data. Moreover, the bias correction technique preserves the climate change signal of the uncorrected RCM simulations. However, the ensemble spread is increased due to an overestimation of the rainfall probability of uncorrected RCM simulations. The application of the bias correction method to the future period (2006–2100) revealed that annual precipitation increases for most models in the near (2020–2049) and far future (2070–2099) with a mean increase of up to a-1 (18%).

Although the crop model has been widely used in yield estimation, its applicability in large-scale yield prediction is limited due to the large amount of data required for parameterization. We took the main winter wheat growing areas in China and developed an ensemble learning framework based on seven machine learning algorithms, such as extreme gradient boosting, random forest, and support vector regression. The model used satellite vegetation index time series, climate, soil properties, and elevation data to provide county-level winter wheat yield forecasts from 2001 to 2015. The results showed that the ensemble explained 86% of the yield variability, which outperformed all base learners. By calculating the correlation between the prediction results of the base learners, we believed that the prediction performance of ensemble learning still has the potential for improvement. Soil properties and elevation data effectively improved the performance of the model because they contained information about yield prediction that could not be fully captured by vegetation index and climate data. As the growing season went on, the unique contribution of increasing climate data to yield forecasts was always more than that of vegetation index, especially in the early growing season. Furthermore, we evaluated the model’s ability to perform within-season prediction, and the model achieved satisfactory prediction accuracy 2 months before harvest (R2 = 0.85, RMSE = 480 kg/ha, MAPE = 7.52%). The framework of yield forecast established in this research can be applied to other crop varieties and regions and provide stakeholders with sufficiently accurate yield predictions. © The Author(s) 2022.","county level; ensemble learning; multi-source data; winter wheat yield","computer aided design; computer simulation; crop yield; ensemble forecasting; numerical model; performance assessment; satellite data; yield response; China",Article,Scopus

To inform decisions, it is also crucial to quantify the forecasting uncertainty and prove its relevance for food security. Yet, in previous studies both these aspects have been largely overlooked. This paper develops a methodology to anticipate the agricultural Vegetation Health Index (VHI) while making the underlying prediction uncertainty explicit. To achieve this aim, a probabilistic machine learning framework modelling weather and climate determinants is introduced and implemented through Quantile Random Forests. In a second step, a statistical link between VHI forecasts and monthly food price variations is established. As a pilot implementation, the framework is applied to nine countries of South-East Asia (SEA) with consideration of national monthly rice prices. Model benchmarks show satisfactory accuracy metrics, suggesting that the probabilistic VHI predictions can provide decision-makers with reliable information about future cropland health and its impact on food price variation weeks or even months ahead, albeit with increasing uncertainty as the forecasting horizon grows.

An experimental trial was conducted in 2020 and 2021, involving two fertility conditions and five japonica rice cultivars (Aichinokaori, Asahi, Hatsushimo, Nakate Shinsenbon, and Nikomaru). Multi-temporal VIs were used to estimate AGB and LAI throughout the growth period with the extreme gradient boosting model and Gompertz model. The optimum time windows for predicting yield for each cultivar were determined using a single-day linear regression model. The results show that AGB and LAI could be estimated from VIs (R2: 0.56–0.83 and 0.57–0.73), and the optimum time window for UAV flights differed between cultivars, ranging from 4 to 31 days between the tillering stage and the initial heading stage.

In the case of agriculture, forecasting is an essential element of effective and efficient farm management. Factors affecting crop yields, such as soil, weather, and farm management, are complex and investigations into the relation between these variables are crucial for agricultural studies and decision-making related to crop monitoring, with special emphasis for climate change. Because of this, the aim of this study was to create a spring barley yield prediction model, as a part of the Advisory Support platform in the form of application for Polish agriculture under a moderate input management system. As a representative sample, 20 barley varieties, evaluated under 13 environments representative for Polish conditions, were used. To create yield potential model data for the genotype (G), environment (E), and management (M) were collected over 3 years. The model developed using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) simulated barley yields with high goodness of fit to the measured data across three years of evaluation. On average, the precision of the cultivar yielding forecast (expressed as a percentage), based on the independent traits, was 78.60% (Model F-statistic: 102.55***) and the range, depending of the variety, was 89.10% (Model F-statistic: 19.26***)–74.60% (Model F-statistic: 6.88***). The model developed using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) simulated barley yields with high goodness of fit to the measured data across three years of evaluation. It was possible to observe a large differentiation for the response to agroclimatic or soil factors. Under Polish conditions, ten traits have a similar effect (in the prediction model, they have the same sign: + or -) on the yield of almost all varieties (from 17 to 20). Traits that negatively affected final yield were: lodging tendency for 18 varieties (18-), sum of rainfall in January for 19 varieties (19-), and April for 17 varieties (17-). However, the sum of rainfall in February positively affected the final yield for 20 varieties (20+). Average monthly ground temperature in March positively affected final yield for 17 varieties (17+). The average air temperature in March negatively affected final yield for 18 varieties (18-) and for 17 varieties in June (17-). In total, the level of N + P + K fertilization negatively affected the final yield for 15 varieties (15-), but N sum fertilization significantly positively affected final yield for 15 varieties (15+).

We evaluated the potential of the new PRISMA hyperspectral sensor for mapping soil organic matter (SOM), available soil phosphorus (P2O5), and potassium (K2O) content over a cultivated area in Khouribga, northern Morocco. These soil nutrients were estimated using (i) the random forest (RF) algorithm based on feature selection methods, including feature subset evaluation and feature ranking methods belonging to three categories (i.e., filter, wrapper, and embedded techniques), and (ii) 107 soil samples taken from the study area. The results show that the RF-embedded method produced better predictive accuracy compared with the filter and wrapper methods. The model for SOM showed moderate accuracy ((Formula presented.) = 0.5, RMSEP = 0.43%, and RPIQ = 2.02), whereas that for soil P2O5 and K2O exhibited low efficiency ((Formula presented.) = 0.26 and 0.36, RMSEP = 51.07 and 182.31 ppm, RPIQ = 0.65 and 1.16, respectively). The interpolation of RF-residuals by ordinary kriging (OK) methods reached the highest predictive results for SOM ((Formula presented.) = 0.69, RMSEP = 0.34%, and RPIQ = 2.56), soil P2O5 ((Formula presented.) = 0.44, RMSEP = 44.10 ppm, and RPIQ = 0.75), and soil K2O ((Formula presented.) = 0.51, RMSEP = 159.29 ppm, and RPIQ = 1.34), representing the best fitting ability between the hyperspectral data and soil nutrients. The result maps provide a spatially continuous surface mapping of the soil landscape, conforming to the pedological substratum. Finally, the hyperspectral remote sensing imagery can provide a new way for modeling and mapping soil fertility, as well as the ability to diagnose nutrient deficiencies. © 2022 by the authors.","feature selection; GIS approaches; hyperspectral image; PRISMA; random forest; soil fertility mapping","Agriculture; Decision trees; Feature Selection; Food supply; Geographic information systems; Interpolation; Nutrients; Random forests; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Soils; Spectroscopy; Features selection; GIS approach; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral image; PRISMA; Random forests; Soil fertility; Soil fertility mapping; Soil nutrients; Soil organic matters; Mapping",Article,Scopus

Under rain-fed conditions, crop yields are sensitive to weather and its variations and are thus affected by climate change. Previous research regarding climate change impacts on crop yields in AC has been limited to a regional-scale assessment, mostly focusing on climate without considering real-world field conditions (e.g., soil and topography). In this study, an enhanced Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to estimate crop yields at the watershed scale under climate change conditions projected for the period of 2020–2099 using global climate models with three different greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios from the Representative Concentration Pathways (i.e., RCP2.6, 4.5, and 8.5). Results suggest that climate change will negatively impact potato and barley yields under all three RCP scenarios. In particular, under the RCP8.5 scenario, there will be significant reductions (13–23%) in crop yields between 2060 and 2099. The leading cause of crop yield reductions is attributed to the soil water stress resulting from increased temperature and evapotranspiration during the growing season due to climate change. Elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations could potentially increase crop yields due to the CO2 fertilization effect. However, it is not enough to offset the negative impacts of soil water stress. Our results suggest that on top of controlling GHG emissions to below the RCP4.5 level, it is critical to develop and adapt crop, soil, and water management practices such as new crop-rotation systems, early planting dates, and supplemental irrigation to maintain future crop yields in AC. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Atlantic Canada; Climate Change; CO2 fertilization; Crop Yield; SWAT","Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Rain; Soil moisture; Topography; Water management; Watersheds; Atlantic canada; Climate change impact; CO2 fertilization; Crop yield; Fertilisation; Greenhouse gas emissions; Soil and Water assessment tools; Soil water; Water stress; Watershed scale; Carbon dioxide; agricultural management; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; evapotranspiration; fertilizer application; global climate; growing season; soil and water assessment tool; water management; watershed; Canada",Article,Scopus

Current understanding of drought across extensive spatial measures, around the world, is considerably limited. As case studies to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing space-based solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) across extensive spatial measures, here, we have used data from 2007 to 2017 in Heilongjiang and Jiangsu provinces of China. The onset of the 2015 drought was accompanied by a substantial response of SIF from vegetation in both the provinces; these data were associated with changes in soil moisture, standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index, and emissivity. Our findings suggest that SIF can effectively provide the spatial and temporal progress of drought, as inferred through substantial associations with SIF normalized by absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (related to φF) and by photosynthetically active radiation (SIFpar). For the depiction of onset to drought, SIF, φF, and SIFpar provide a significant association and a quicker response than the leaf area index and the normalized difference vegetation index. Furthermore, we found that the correlation between gross primary productivity and SIF is highly substantial in both Heilongjiang (R2 = 0.85, p < 0.001) and Jiangsu (R2 = 0.75, p < 0.001) during the drought period. Our results indicate that continuing evaluation from space-based SIF can indeed provide an understanding of the seasonal differences in vegetation for evaluating the impact of drought across extensive spatial measures. © Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.","drought; gross primary production; leaf area index; normalized difference vegetation index; solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; vegetation","Chlorophyll; Drought; Fluorescence; Soil moisture; Spatial variables measurement; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Gross primary production; Heilongjiang; Leaf Area Index; Normalized difference vegetation index; Photosynthetically active radiation; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Space-based; Spatial measures; Summer droughts; Vegetation; chlorophyll; drought; fluorescence; season; sunlight; Chlorophyll; Droughts; Fluorescence; Seasons; Sunlight",Article,Scopus

Among these impacts, mass loads with a high concentration of phosphorus (P) have a significant potential for point and diffuse pollution of freshwater. The objective of this work was to model P spatially in the Paraopeba River basin, namely in the main water course and 67 sub-basins, and temporally in the years of 2019, 2020, and 2021, after the rupture of B1 tailings dam of Vale, SA company in Brumadinho (Minas Gerais Brazil). The distribution of total phosphorus concentrations (Pt) in relation to environmental attributes (terrain slope, soil class, and land use) and stream flow was assessed with the help of SWAT, the well-known Soil and Water Assessment Tool, coupled with box-plot and cluster analyses. The Pt were obtained from 33 sampling points monitored on a weekly basis. Mean values varied from 0.02 to 1.1 mg/L and maximum from 0.2 to 15.9 mg/L across the basin. The modeling results exposed an impact on the quality of Paraopeba River water in a stretch extending 8.8–155.3 km from the B1 dam, related with the rupture. In this sector, if the contribution from the rupture could be isolated from the other sources, the average Pt would be 0.1 mg/L. The highest Pt (15.9 mg/L) was directly proportional to the urban area of a sub-basin intersecting the limits of Betim town and Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Region. In general, urban sprawl as well as forest-agriculture and forest-mining conversions showed a close relationship with increased Pt, as did sub-basins with a predominance of argisols and an accentuated slope (>20%). There were various moments presenting Pt above legal thresholds (e.g., >0.15 mg/L), mainly in the rainy season. © 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, we first show how WUSNs can operate reliably under field conditions year-round and at the same time be used for determining and mapping soil conditions from the buried sensor nodes. We demonstrate the design and deployment of a 23-node WUSN installed at an agricultural field site that covers an area with a 530 m radius. The WUSN has continuously operated since September 2019, enabling real-time monitoring of soil volumetric water content (VWC), soil temperature (ST), and soil electrical conductivity. Secondly, we present data collected over a nine-month period across three seasons. We evaluate the performance of a deep learning algorithm in predicting soil VWC using various combinations of the received signal strength (RSSI) from each buried wireless node, aboveground pathloss, the distance between wireless node and receive antenna (D), ST, air temperature (AT), relative humidity (RH), and precipitation as input parameters to the model. The AT, RH, and precipitation were obtained from a nearby weather station. We find that a model with RSSI, D, AT, ST, and RH as inputs was able to predict soil VWC with an R2 of 0.82 for test datasets, with a Root Mean Square Error of ±0.012 (m3/m3). Hence, a combination of deep learning and other easily available soil and climatic parameters can be a viable candidate for replacing expensive soil VWC sensors in WUSNs. © 2022 by the authors.

In this study, we developed a python-based framework that simplifies the process of building and training machine-learning-based hydrological models and automates the process of pre-processing hydrological data and post-processing model results. Pre-processing utilities assist in incorporating domain knowledge of hydrology in the machine learning model, such as the distribution of weather data into hydrologic response units (HRUs) based on different HRU discretization definitions. The post-processing utilities help in interpreting the model's results from a hydrological point of view.

However, traditional methods for AGB measurement are time-consuming and only provide a low number of spatiotemporal measurements. Newly developed remote sensing platforms such as UAVs and new generation satellites allow unprecedented large-scale and frequent monitoring of rangeland vegetation that is typically produced in marginal lands characterized by high surface heterogeneity. This study used high-resolution UAV data and the new multi-spectral VENμS satellite to monitor AGB production for two consecutive years in a Mediterranean and semiarid grassland rangeland in Israel. We then studied the effects of grazing intensity and precipitation along the growing season on AGB. Data were collected from two long-term ecological research sites with plots under controlled grazing pressures (i.e., no grazing, moderate, and intensive grazing). We used high-spatial-resolution UAV imagery for land cover classification in order to mask different levels of mixed pixels in the VENμS satellite images along the growing season. A support vector regression model (SVM) for satellite-based AGB estimation was developed using more than 600 ground-truth AGB measurements collected during 2019–2020. The effect of the percentage cover for mixed pixel removal was examined. The results showed an improvement in the prediction model by 35% and reduced the RMSE by half for the support vector machine regression model's best prediction. The best AGB prediction results were achieved by including satellite pixels with over 50% vegetation cover. For the first time in Eastern Mediterranean rangelands, our study illustrates the benefits of high-integrated remote sensing data (i.e., satellite and UAV) for generating more accurate AGB estimations even in highly heterogeneous ecosystems in terms of surface cover. Such an approach can provide crucial and better information for sustainable rangeland management under varying spatiotemporal and climatic conditions. © 2022","Aboveground biomass estimation; Grazing; Landscape heterogeneity; Machine learning; Mixed pixel; Sensor combination",,Article,Scopus

Relative studies have been carried out extensively in recent years. However, the intricate relationship has yet to be fully investigated. To assess the relative importance and interdependent effects of urban characteristics on LST, we chose the central part of Shanghai as the study area and used the random forest (RF) regression model to quantify 19 different variables on 3 different grid scales. Our results suggest that Building density (BD), percentage of water area (P_Water), percentage of vegetation area (P_Veg), building height (BH), distance to the Yangtze River (DIST), and mean patch area of green space (AREA_MN) are the 6 most important influencing factors, whereas socioeconomic factors such as point of interest (POI) and nighttime light data (NTL) are the least correlated to LST changes. Meanwhile, most of these 6 variables showed non-linear correlations with LST. In particular, the Yangtze River has a steady cooling effect up to 20 km, after which it declines rapidly and loses its effect at 25 km, and BH shows a fluctuated correlation with LST.

The purpose of this study was to develop a new and simple semi-physical sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) yield model, called the SiPAR model (intercepted photosynthetically active radiation partitioned to stem), with less data requirement than the process-based models and strong robustness. The SiPAR model was developed using the normalized difference vegetation index, the leaf area index, and solar radiation data. A 3-yr field experiment was used to evaluate model performance. The SiPAR model was also compared with three traditional statistical models. The results showed that (a) the SiPAR model obtained the highest accuracy among the compared methods and reproduced the spatial pattern of yield well (RMSE = 5.88–8.65 t ha–1; R2=.44–.87; normalized RMSE (Ry) = 7.22–11.77%) and (b) the SiPAR model had better spatial and temporal stability than the other three statistical models through cross-validation because the SiPAR model considered the stem biomass accumulation features of sugarcane by introducing a weighting factor to reflect the stem potential growth rate and using intercepted photosynthetically active radiation to represent the energy available for photosynthesis.

However, higher-dimensional inputs contain more correlated variables that can detrimentally affect model performance. In this study, a hybrid feature selection approach was developed for TNC estimation in Aquilaria sinensis. A low-cost modified digital camera with external filters was used to capture canopy images. Three feature selection methods, namely, random forest (RF), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC)-based feature selection, and sequential backward selection (SBS), were combined into two hybrid feature selection algorithms (RF_SBS and PCC_SBS). In addition, three regression algorithms were used in hybrid feature selection process: random forest regression (RFR), support vector regression (SVR), and partial least squares regression (PLSR). The hybrid feature selection process consists of two steps. First, the lowest number of dimensions is sought based on the feature ranking. Then, SBS is used to find the best feature combinations. Compared with the original models, the R2 values of the RF-SBS-based models are improved by 0.094 (RF_SBS_RFR), 0.190 (RF_SBS_SVR), and 0.116 (RF_SBS_PLSR), while the R2 values of the PCC-SBS-based models are improved by 0.055 (PCC_SBS_RFR), 0.092 (PCC_SBS_SVR) and 0.128 (PCC_SBS_PLSR). Finally, the two best TNC estimation models are found to be PCC_SBS_PLSR, with an R2 of 0.863, and RF_SBS_SVR, with an R2 of 0.872.

However, the rapidly growing acreage of these crops, new legislations, the necessity of minimizing the environmental footprint, and a cost-effective production demand certain managerial practices based on precision agriculture and remote sensing, which have shown promising results in food production. Scope and approach: This paper presents a comprehensive review of remote sensing platforms, sensors, applications, and analytic pipelines with a focus on nut crops, even though the materials are applicable for other specialty crops. In this regard, the paper is divided into five main sections: First, the problems and potential solutions are elaborated in the introduction. Second, the available platforms: satellites, manned aircraft, and UASs are discussed. Then the sensors used for remote sensing, their working principle, and the pros and cons of each are presented. Next, practiced and suggested applications of remote sensing data are reviewed. Finally, data processing and analytics needed to produce and interpret reliable results are highlighted. Key findings and conclusions: Key findings are listed as: 1) The acreage of the nut orchards and the purpose of the studies determine the fitting sensor and platform. 2) Although various sensors are available and reported to have promising results in other crops, they have not been used for nut crops. 3) Accurate sensor calibration is crucial for repeatable results as well as temporal and inter-field comparisons. 4) Except for water management, most remote sensing applications are limitedly studied in nut orchards, creating some research opportunities. 5) Finally, increasing data size requires new machine learning techniques and data fusion frameworks to handle all variables and fill the knowledge gap. © 2022 The Authors","Nut crops; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial systems (UAS)","Antennas; Cost effectiveness; Data handling; Learning systems; Orchards; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Water management; Nut crop; Platform sensors; Precision Agriculture; Protein contents; Remote sensing applications; Remote sensing platforms; Remote sensing sensors; Remote-sensing; Unmanned aerial system; Unmanned aerial systems; Crops; calibration; data processing; machine learning; nut; precision agriculture; remote sensing; sensor; unmanned vehicle; United States",Review,Scopus

However, plant stress may also be profitable since it behaves hormetically; at low doses, it stimulates positive traits in crops, such as the synthesis of specialized metabolites and additional stress tolerance. The controlled exposure of crops to low doses of stressors is therefore called hormesis management, and it is a promising method to increase crop productivity and quality. Nevertheless, hormesis management has severe limitations derived from the complexity of plant physiological responses to stress. Many technological advances assist plant stress science in overcoming such limitations, which results in extensive datasets originating from the multiple layers of the plant defensive response. For that reason, artificial intelligence tools, particularly Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), have become crucial for processing and interpreting data to accurately model plant stress responses such as genomic variation, gene and protein expression, and metabolite biosynthesis.

Determining and monitoring leaf parameters can facilitate the detection and estimation of crop yield, which is essential for food security. Crop monitoring by remote sensing technology is critical to support crop production, especially over large scales. In this study, we developed a methodology to estimate leaf parameters based entirely on vegetation indices (VIs) from remotely sensed imagery in wheat under different management practices. Therefore, the current study aimed to examine the utility of VIs calculated from the sentinel-2 data in estimating the Leaf area index (LAI) and leaf parameters at wheat farms using machine learning algorithms. Leaf parameters included leaf dry weight (LDW), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf specific weight (SLW), and machine learning algorithms were SVM (support vector machine), ANN (artificial neural network) and DNN (deep neural network). Leaf parameters were measured at several developmental stages of wheat in two contrasting environments in the southern Iran. The results demonstrated that the DNN algorithm could efficiently predict leaf parameters in the southern Iran with an overall precision of >72%, which assessed the potential of employing DNN to achieve the temporal and spatial distribution data of wheat based on the Sentinel-2 imagery. The validation of the DNN model generally showed high accuracy (R = 0.80, RMSE = 1.19, and MAE = 0.98) between observed and estimated LAI values when this model was used. NDVI was also highly sensitive to wheat LDW and SLA parameters, with a good correlation between field measurements and those predicted by the DNN model from sentinel-2 imagery, with the R values of 0.66 and 0.85, respectively. Further, NDVI and PVI (Perpendicular Vegetation Index) were linearly correlated with SLW across both temporal and spatial scales (R = 0.79). Among VIs considered from sentinel-2 imagery to predict wheat leaf parameters, NDVI was more sensitive than other VIs. This research, thus, indicated that using sentinel-2 data within a DNN model could provide a comparatively precise and robust prediction of leaf parameters and yield valuable insights into crop management with high temporal and spatial accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial neural network; Deep neural network; Leaf parameters; Sentinel-2; Support vector machine; Vegetation indices","algorithm; artificial neural network; biomonitoring; leaf area index; machine learning; model validation; NDVI; parameter estimation; satellite imagery; spatial distribution; support vector machine; vegetation index; wheat; Iran",Article,Scopus

High-resolution remote sensing imageries have emerged as an innovative solution to investigate the spatial variation in agricultural soils with machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, the predictive power of the individual and combined effects of Sentinel-1 (S1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral images for mapping soil properties, especially STN, STP, and STK, have rarely been investigated. Moreover, single ML model may achieve unstable performance for predicting multiple soil properties due to strong spatial heterogeneity. This study explored the combine use of S1, S2, and DEM derivatives to map SOM, STN, STP, and STK content of a sloped cropland of northeastern China. A two-step method with a weighted sum of four ML models was proposed to improve the accuracy and robustness in predicting multiple soil properties. Our results showed that single ML model has various performance in predicting the four soil properties. The optimal ML models could explain approximately 56 %, 53 %, 56 % and 37 % of the variability of SOM, STN, STP, and STK, respectively. Using the weights estimated through a 10-fold cross-validation procedure, the two-step ensemble learning model was retrained and showed more robust performance than the four ML models, in which the prediction accuracy was improved by 2.38 %, 1.40 %, 3.52 %, and 3.29 % for SOM, STN, STP, and STK, respectively. Our results also showed that the optical S2 derived features, especially the two S2 short-wave infrared bands, enhanced vegetation index, and soil adjusted vegetation index, were more important for soil property prediction than S1 data and DEM derivatives. Compared with individual sensor, a combination of S1 and S2 data yielded more accurate predictions of STN and STP but not for SOM and STK.

Forecast performance needs to be investigated over space and time before practical applications. We assess seasonal forecast performance (skill, probability and accuracy) in predicting flowering and veraison stages of two representative varieties in Portugal over 1993–2017. The state-of-the-art forecast system ECMWF-SEAS5 provides 7-month seasonal forecasts and is coupled with a locally adapted phenology model. Overall, findings illustrate the dependence of forecast performance on initialization timings, regions and predicting subjects (stages and varieties). Forecast performance improves by delaying the initialization timing and only forecasts initialized on April 1st show better skills than climatology on predicting phenology terciles (early/normal/late). The considerable bias of daily values of seasonal climate predictions can represent the main barrier to accurate forecasts. Better prediction performance is consistently found in Central-Southern regions compared to Northern regions, attributing to an earlier phenology occurrence with a shorter forecast length. Comparable predictive skills between flowering and veraison for both varieties imply better predictability in summer. Consequently, promising seasonal phenology predictions are foreseen in Central-Southern wine regions using forecasts initialized on April 1st with approximately 1–2/3–4 months lead time for flowering/veraison: potential prediction errors are ∼2 weeks, along with an overall moderate forecast skill on categorical events. However, considerable inter-annual variability of forecast performance over the same classified phenology years reflects the substantial influence of climate variability. This may represent the main challenge for reliable forecasts in Mediterranean regions. Recommendations are suggested for methodological innovations and practical applications towards reliable regional phenology forecasts. © 2023 The Author(s)","Climate risk; Forecast performance; Mediterranean climate; Phenology forecast; Phenology modelling; Seasonal climate forecast","climatology; flowering; forecasting method; phenology; seasonal variation; viticulture; Portugal",Article,Scopus

Existing disease severity assessment methods have poor accuracy under field conditions. To overcome this limitation, this study used thermal and visible imaging with machine learning (ML) and model combination (MC) techniques to estimate plant disease severity under field conditions. Field experiments were conducted during 2017–18, 2018–19 and 2021–22 to obtain RGB and thermal images of chickpea cultivars with different levels of wilt resistance grown in wilt sick plots. ML models were constructed using four different datasets created using the wilt severity and image derived indices. ML models were also combined using MC techniques to assess the best predictor of the disease severity. Results indicated that the Cubist was the best ML model, while the KNN model was the poorest predictor of chickpea wilt severity under field conditions. MC techniques improved the prediction accuracy of wilt severity over individual ML models. Combining ML models using the least absolute deviation technique gave the best predictions of wilt severity. The results obtained in the present study showed the MC techniques coupled with ML models improved the prediction accuracies of plant disease severity under field conditions. © 2022","Chickpea wilt; Machine learning; Model combination; standardized Ranking Performance Index","cultivar; disease resistance; disease severity; fungal disease; index method",Article,Scopus

So far, climate change impacts on agriculture for the basin have mostly been assessed for single-cropping systems, which may bias the results considering that the basin is dominated by different cropping systems, with about one-third of the crop area under double cropping. In this study, we simulate single- and double-cropping systems in the Nile basin and assess the climate change impacts on different cropping systems under two scenarios, i.e. “no adaptation” and “adaptation to a late-maturing cultivar”. We find that the mean crop yields of maize, soybean and wheat decrease with future warming without cultivar adaptation. We attribute this to the shortening of the growing season due to increased temperature. The decrease is stronger in all single-cropping systems (12.6–45.5%) than in double-cropping systems (5.9–26.6%). The relative magnitude of yield reduction varies spatially with the greatest reduction in the northern part of the basin experiencing the strongest warming. In a scenario with cultivar adaptation, mean crop yields show a stronger increase in double-cropping systems (14.4–35.2%) than single-cropping systems (8.3–13.7%). In this scenario, farmers could possibly benefit from increasing cropping intensities while adapting to late-maturing cultivars. This study underscores the importance of accounting for multiple-cropping systems in agricultural assessments under climate change within the Nile basin. © 2022, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Agriculture; Climate change; Multiple cropping; Nile basin",,Article,Scopus

Vegetation forecasting research has been accelerated using several deep learning (DL) algorithms through remote sensing (RS) data. In this context, we used artificial intelligence (AI) and the long-short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) method to explore and forecast future urban–rural vegetation disparities (ΔEVI, where EVI is the enhanced vegetation index) in Pakistan's six megacities using MODIS EVI data. The forecast results revealed that ΔEVI is decreasing in all cities. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) were used to evaluate LSTM-RNN. RSME values were recorded as 0.03, 0.07, 0.02, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.06 for Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Multan, and Sialkot, respectively.

Determining optimal N fertilizer rates that reach both economic and environmental objectives is a key challenge in cotton systems because of the inherent within-field variability and relatively low N fertilizer use efficiency (NFUE). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to model optimal N fertilizer rates by accounting for within-field variability through management zone (MZ) delineation across a cotton field in Queensland, Australia. METHODS: MZs were delineated using satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the crop simulation model, Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), was automatically calibrated with a grid-search optimization algorithm and validated across two cotton seasons. A total of 336 different N fertilizer scenarios were subsequently evaluated at pre-planting and top-dressing to observe the effect on profit margin and NFUE. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The MZ delineation analysis determined that within-field variability could be best represented by two MZs, one of which displaying subsoil constraints due to high carbonate concentrations. The use of the auto-calibration algorithm led to a successful validation of the model with a Wilmott d-index of agreement ranging between 0.75 (soil nitrate) and 0.96 (aboveground biomass and plant N), respectively. The subsequent N scenario simulations indicated that by reducing N fertilizer rates by 80 and 30 kg N ha−1 across the two MZs, respectively, compared to the current industry average, profits could be maximized through maintaining yields while reducing N inputs. SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, these results demonstrate the potential of combining remote sensing-derived MZs and crop model auto-calibration techniques to support the cotton industry in achieving improved resource efficiency and profit margins. © 2022","Auto-calibration; Cotton; DSSAT; Management zones; Nitrogen; Remote sensing","cotton; fertilizer; management practice; NDVI; nitrogen; numerical model; remote sensing; Australia; Queensland",Article,Scopus

Water markets can play an important role in reducing the economic losses attributed to droughts by increasing flexibility in responding to water scarcity. Climate change has increased the scarcity and uncertainty of the agricultural water supply in the Mobile River Basin, mainly in Alabama, USA, which has imposed a huge risk to crop production in the region. In this study, agricultural water productivity is used to evaluate the value of irrigation water, and an analytical framework is developed to quantify potential economic efficiency gains within the river basin if water markets were to be implemented under future hydroclimate conditions. This approach circumvents the caveats of the traditional methods of estimating irrigation water demand. The results show that agricultural water markets can reduce the adverse impacts of climate change on the overall catchment-scale agricultural output in economic terms. The scenario approach presented in this study can provide preliminary estimates of the benefits of water trading, particularly in periods of drought and under future conditions of decreasing precipitation.

The present chapter demonstrates the state-of-the-art DL methodologies used by the researchers from different laboratories under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India to solve important research activities across several sectors like Medical, Healthcare, Agriculture, Energy, etc. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques are utilized for Tumor diagnosis, classifying molecular subtypes of glioma tissues, and predicting driver gene mutations in glioma. Similarly, the Long short-term memory (LSTM) model is applied for the assessment of crop production, and transfer learning is used for the classification of tea leaves. Further, the ensemble LSTM methodology is implemented for short-term prediction of wind speed to enhance the renewable energy sectors.

Recent advances in big data analytics and computing power have popularized the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms to upscale site measurements of ecosystem processes, and in some cases forecast the response of these processes to climate change. Due to data limitations, however, ML model predictions of these processes are almost never validated with independent datasets. To better understand and characterize the limitations of these methods, we develop an approach to independently evaluate ML upscaling and forecasting. We mimic data-driven upscaling and forecasting efforts by applying ML algorithms to different subsets of regional process-model simulation gridcells, and then test ML performance using the remaining gridcells. In this study, we simulate C fluxes and environmental data across Alaska using ecosys, a process-rich terrestrial ecosystem model, and then apply boosted regression tree ML algorithms to training data configurations that mirror and expand upon existing AmeriFLUX eddy-covariance data availability. We first show that a ML model trained using ecosys outputs from currently-available Alaska AmeriFLUX sites incorrectly predicts that Alaska is presently a modeled net C source. Increased spatial coverage of the training dataset improves ML predictions, halving the bias when 240 modeled sites are used instead of 15. However, even this more accurate ML model incorrectly predicts Alaska C fluxes under 21st century climate change because of changes in atmospheric CO2, litter inputs, and vegetation composition that have impacts on C fluxes which cannot be inferred from the training data. Our results provide key insights to future C flux upscaling efforts and expose the potential for inaccurate ML upscaling and forecasting of high-latitude C cycle dynamics. © 2023 The Author(s).

However, due to the variability of the reflectance data obtained from different active crop sensors and complexity of the environmental and management conditions for regional applications, accurate determination of crop N status and topdressing N rate only using active canopy sensor data is very challenging. The objectives of this study were to (1) develop an in-season N status diagnosis and recommendation model based on NNI prediction using multi-source data fusion with machine learning, and (2) evaluate the accuracy of N diagnosis and recommendation in terms of rice yield and NUE under diverse on-farm conditions. Thirty plot experiments and thirteen on-farm experiments were conducted in Qixing Farm, Jiansanjiang, Northeast China from 2008 to 2018, and the dataset was used for the model calibration, validation, and evaluation. Two indirect and one direct NNI prediction methods using simple regression, stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) and random forest regression (RFR) were compared for N diagnosis and then integrated into N recommendation model. The results indicated that combining environmental and agronomic variables with crop sensor data improved the SMLR and RFR model performance by 1–16% and 9–40% over the corresponding models only using crop sensor data, respectively. The direct NNI prediction approach achieved slightly better N status diagnostic accuracy (areal agreement = 84% and Kappa statistics = 0.71) than indirect NNI prediction strategies based on plant N uptake and ΔN estimation (areal agreement = 81% and Kappa statistics = 0.67) or aboveground biomass and plant N uptake estimation (areal agreement = 77% and Kappa statistics = 0.58) across plot experiments and diverse on-farm conditions, based on multi-source data fusion with random forest regression models.

In this study, proline content and the expression levels of proline-related genes (TaPTF1, TaDHN, TaSRG, TaSC, TaPIMP1, TaMIP, TaHKT1;4, TaGSK, TaP5CS, and TaMYB) were examined in sensitive, moderate, and tolerant genotypes under salt stress (0, 50, 150, and 250 mM NaCl) for 0, 12, and 24 h. Our results show that salt stress increased the proline content in all genotypes, but it was found higher in salt-tolerant genotypes than in moderate and sensitive genotypes. The salinity stress increased gene expression levels in salt-tolerant and moderate genotypes. While salt-stress exposure for 12 and 24 h had a substantial effect on gene expression in wheat, TaPTF1, TaPIMP1, TaMIP, TaHKT1;4, and TaMYB genes were considerably upregulated in 24 h. The salt-tolerant genotypes showed a higher positive interaction than a negative interaction. The TaPTF1, TaP5CS, TaGSK1, and TaSRG genes were found to be more selective than the other analyzed genes under salt-stress conditions. Despite each gene’s specific function, increasing proline biosynthesis functioned as a common mechanism for separating salt tolerance from sensitivity. © 2022 by the authors.","correlation network analysis; gene expression; proline-related genes; qRT-PCR; salt stress",,Article,Scopus

Landsat 9, the latest launched Landsat satellite, is the successor and continuation of Landsat 8, providing a highly promising data resource for land cover change, forest surveys, and terrestrial ecosystem monitoring. Regression kriging was developed in the study to improve the AGB estimation and mapping using the Landsat 9 image in Wangyedian forest farm, northern China. Multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine (SVM), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and random forest (RF) were used as the original models to predict the AGB trends, and the optimal model was used to overlay the results of kriging interpolation based on the residuals to obtain the new AGB predictions. In addition, Landsat 8 images in Wangyedian were used for comparison and verification with Landsat 9. The results showed that all bands of Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 maintained a high degree of uniformity, with positive correlation coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.89 (p &lt; 0.01). RF achieved the highest estimation accuracy among all the original models based on the two data sources. However, kriging regression can significantly reduce the estimation error, with the root mean square error (RMSE) decreasing by 55.4% and 51.1%, for Landsat 8 and Landsat 9, respectively, compared to the original RF. Further, the R2 and the lowest RMSE for Landsat 8 were 0.88 and 16.83 t/ha, while, for Landsat 9, they were 0.87 and 17.91 t/ha. The use of regression kriging combined with Landsat 9 imagery has great potential for achieving efficient and highly accurate forest AGB estimates, providing a new reference for long-term monitoring of forest resource dynamics. © 2022 by the authors.","above-ground biomass; coniferous plantations; Landsat 9; machine learning; regression kriging","Backpropagation; Biomass; Carbon; Decision trees; Image enhancement; Interpolation; Linear regression; Mapping; Mean square error; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Aboveground biomass; Biomass estimation; Coniferous plantations; LANDSAT; Landsat 9; Machine-learning; Northern China; Original model; Random forests; Regression-kriging; Landsat",Article,Scopus

With the increasing demand for food and forage, intensive agricultural practices have been adopted in the maize production systems. In this direction, considerable research efforts have been made to examine the effects of different types of cover crops as a green manure on maize productivity; however, no consistent conclusions have been reached so far. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to examine the possibility of predicting the effects of winter cover crops (CC) integrated with different management practices on the morphological traits, yield, and yield components of maize. The experiment was carried out on chernozem soil from 2016 to 2020 as a randomized complete block design arranged as a split-split-plot with three replicates. The pea as a sole crop (P) and the mixture of pea and triticale (PT) are sown as winter CC with the following subplots: (i) CC used as green manure, and (ii) CC used as forage and removed before maize sowing. The artificial neural network is used for exploring nonlinear functions of the tested parameters and 13 categorical input variables for modeling according to the following factors: CC, way of using CC, N fertilization, and year. The computed maximums of plant height, number of leaves, number of internodes, plant density, number of ears, grain yield, 1000-grain weight, hectolitre weight, dry matter harvest residue, harvest index, leaves percentage, stems percentage, and ears percentage are as follows: 232.3 cm; 9.7; 10.2; 54,340 plants ha−1; 0.9; 9.8 t ha−1; 272.4 g; 67.0 kg HL−1; 9.2 t ha−1; 0.52; 18.9%; 36.0%, and 45.1%, respectively. The optimal result is obtained with peas used as green manure, with 50 kg N ha−1 and in the climatic conditions of 2018. Consequently, maize production under subsequent sowing periods can be successfully optimized by adapting selected management options for higher yield accomplishment. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial neural network; cover crops; crop performance; green manure; maize; yield",,Article,Scopus

Three global climate models (GCMs; HadGEM2-ES, NorESM1 and MPI-ESM) were dynamically downscaled using three high resolution (0. 22 ∘) regional climate models (RCMs; RegCM4, REMO2015 and CCLM5-0-15). These simulations were from the Coordinated Output for Regional Evaluations within the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment framework (CORDEX-CORE) publicly available through the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) web portals. The capabilities of the RCMs in the representation of maximum consecutive wet day (CWD), maximum consecutive dry days (CDD), number of dry days (NDD), and number of wet days (NWD) were compared with observation/satellites datasets obtained from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Tropical Applications of Meteorology using SATellite data and ground-based observations (TAMSAT). The reference datasets showed similar spatial pattern and magnitude of analyzed precipitation extremes but models exhibit different pronounced discrepancies relative to them. All RCMs consistently captured the spatial patterns of the indices but with some pronounced biases along the Guinean coast and northern parts of Niger. There exists little or no biases in the representation of annual cycle along the Guinea and Sahel for all the indices based on each of the RCMs ensemble, with the exception of RegCM4 which has a more pronounced bias in CWD. Statistical evaluation of the performance of the models over the entire West Africa with respect to the 4 indices revealed that REMO2015 models and its ensemble have overall lowest root mean square error followed by the choice of MPI-ESM GCM downscaled with either of the RCMs. REMO-HAD was found to have the best performance in the representation of consecutive dry days and number of wet days with RMSE values of 25.74 and 18.91 respectively. REMO-MPI has superior performance in the estimation of consecutive wet days and number of dry days with RMSE values of 5.38 and 20.51 respectively. Generally, REMO RCMs ensemble was found to be the best ensemble in all indices except consecutive dry days where REG4 ensembles had better performance. Operational use of these 3 RCMs are recommended with compensation for over-and underestimations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change; CORDEX-CORE; Dry spell; Extreme precipitation; West Africa; Wet spell","annual variation; climate modeling; data set; downscaling; extreme event; precipitation assessment; regional climate",Article,Scopus

However, their locations are rarely known and the explicit incorporation of tile drains in hydrological models requires refined meshes around the drains, which can significantly increase computational times. Although seepage nodes have been used to represent tile drains with satisfactory performance, they have never been applied to represent all tile drainage systems in a catchment. The goal of this study is to compare different conceptual models for tile drains and soil heterogeneity for the numerical simulation of tile drainage in an agricultural catchment in Denmark. The first conceptual model for tile drains uses seepage nodes to represent only the main collector drains in the catchment and the second model uses seepage nodes distributed over all the agricultural areas, without considering the specific locations of tile drains. A third conceptual model, labelled the Benchmark Model, represent all tile drains at their known locations with seepage nodes and a fourth conceptual model implicitly represents tile drains as a high-permeability layer. The four models performed satisfactorily to simulate the observed outlet stream discharge and could be recommended almost interchangeably. The simulation of the water table depth was very satisfactory compared to modeling studies with similar mesh resolution (∼50 m). Results indicated that the three models using seepage nodes i) simulated similar monthly discharges and cumulative discharge volumes for most of the studied tile-drained areas, and ii) simulated surface water flow in tile-drained fields without runoff or ponding water. The shorter simulation times (around 35% faster) of the model representing the main drains and the distributed seepage node model suggest that they are suitable for model calibration, compared to the Benchmark Model. Whenever the location of tile drains is unavailable, using seepage node to represent drains in agricultural areas may satisfactorily simulate catchment-scale stream and drainage discharges. Four alternative soil models were developed to evaluate the effect of soil heterogeneity on the simulations. Our results suggest that at smaller scales (drainage area) soil heterogeneity is more relevant than the drainage conceptualization to improve model results. However, at the subcatchment scale, the opposite was observed and, at the catchment scale, both criteria had a comparable effect. © 2022","Catchment scale; Coupled surface water and groundwater flow model; HydroGeoSphere; Hydrological modelling; Soil heterogeneity; Tile drainage","Cultivation; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Location; Runoff; Seepage; Soils; Surface discharges; Catchment scale; Coupled surface water and groundwater flow model; Groundwater Flow Model; Hydrogeosphere; Hydrological models; Soil heterogeneity; Surface water and groundwaters; Tile drainage; Tile drains; Water flow model; Catchments; agricultural catchment; drainage; heterogeneity; hydrological modeling; seepage; Denmark",Article,Scopus

In the reviewed papers, machine learning models (also called data-driven models) are used to improve the prediction or speed process of existing numerical modelling. When long runtimes inhibit the use of numerical models, machine learning models can be a valid alternative, capable of reducing the time for model development and calibration without sacrificing accuracy of detail in groundwater level forecasting. The results of this review highlight that machine learning models do not offer a complete representation of the physical system, such as flux estimates or total water balance and, thus, cannot be used to substitute numerical models in large study areas; however, they are affordable tools to improve predictions at specific observation wells. Numerical and machine learning models can be successfully used as complementary to each other as a powerful groundwater management tool. The machine learning techniques can be used to improve calibration of numerical models, whereas results of numerical models allow us to understand the physical system and select proper input variables for machine learning models. Machine learning models can be integrated in decision-making processes when rapid and effective solutions for groundwater management need to be considered. Finally, machine learning models are computationally efficient tools to correct head error prediction of numerical models. © 2022 by the author.","artificial neural network; groundwater; machine learning models; physically-based models; random forest; support vector machine","Calibration; Decision trees; Forecasting; Groundwater; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Water management; Ground water level; Groundwater management; Groundwater numerical models; Machine learning methods; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Physical systems; Physically based models; Random forests; Support vectors machine; Support vector machines; artificial neural network; groundwater; machine learning; numerical model; support vector machine; water budget",Review,Scopus

These indicators are used to validate the spatial impacts of climate change on grain production. Air pollution data are used as instrumental variables to address the causality between climate and grain production. The regression results show that: First, climatic variables all have a non-linear “increasing then decreasing” effect on food production. Second, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5 have a negative impact on grain production. Based on the model, changes in the climatic production potential of grain crops can be calculated, and the future spatial layout of climate production can also be predicted by using random forests.

Efficient monitoring of ratoon rice aboveground biomass (AGB) over large areas is valuable for precision agriculture, as AGB is closely related to crop grain yield and quality. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing has opened an unprecedented opportunity to efficiently monitor crop AGB instead of labor-intensive ground measurements. Vegetation indices (VIs)-based approach for estimating AGB is easily affected by background materials and often suffers saturation problems at high AGB levels. Although the combined use of UAV-collected structural and spectral features can alleviate these problems to some extent, uncertainties on the AGB estimation still exist for crop with significant difference in canopy architecture and AGB composition throughout the growing season (e.g., ratoon rice). There is a hypothesis that the combination of spectral, textural and structural features can improve ratoon rice AGB estimations across different developmental stages. Therefore, the utility of UAV-based spectral, textural and structural features were quantified in estimating ratoon rice AGB at field level with contrasting agronomic treatments (i.e., nitrogen fertilizer and stubble height), in which multiple linear regression (MLR) and gaussian process regression (GPR) methods were applied and compared. Results showed that (1) each feature had its own respective limitation: specifically, spectral and textural features exhibited insufficient sensitivity to AGB variability of remaining stubbles or stem at early stage and suffered saturation problem at grain filling stage; structural features were difficult to detect the emergence of panicles from panicle initiation to heading stages; (2) the combination of three types of features can complement each other and achieved the highest accuracy using GPR method: the combination of spectral, structural and textural features achieved the best estimation accuracy for estimating ratoon rice AGB with an R2 of 0.94 and RMSE of 81.4 g m−2 across different developmental stages, which significantly improved the model performance compared to the combination of spectral and textural features (R2 = 0.56, RMSE = 170.2 g m−2) and the combination of spectral and structural features (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 138.8 g m−2). In summary, this study provides a novel approach for efficiently estimating ratoon rice AGB at field level, which is critical for timely decision making (e.g., determine when and where to apply fertilizer or pesticide) in precision agriculture. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Aboveground biomass measurement; Data fusion; Ratoon rice; Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","aboveground biomass; canopy architecture; cropping practice; decision making; emergence; fertilizer; food quality; ground penetrating radar; remote sensing; rice; unmanned vehicle",Article,Scopus

Their socioeconomic impacts are significant and widespread, affecting the sustainable development of human societies. This study investigates the influence of different forcing precipitation data in driving Land Surface Models (LSMs) and characterizing drought conditions. Here, we utilize our recently developed LSM data assimilation system for probabilistically monitoring drought over the Contiguous United States (CONUS). The Noah-MP LSM model is forced with two widely used precipitation data including IMERG (Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM) and NLDAS (North American Land Data Assimilation System). Soil moisture and evapotranspiration are known to have a strong relationship in the land-atmospheric interaction processes. Unlike other studies that attempted the individual assimilation of these variables, here we propose a multivariate data assimilation framework. Therefore, in both modeling scenarios, the data assimilation approach is used to integrate remotely sensed MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) evapotranspiration and SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) soil moisture observations into the Noah-MP LSM. The results of this study indicate that the source of precipitation data has a significant impact on the performance of LSM data assimilation system for drought monitoring. The findings revealed that NLDAS and IMERG precipitation can result in a significant difference in identifying drought severity depending on the region and time of the year. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that regardless of the precipitation forcing data product used in the land surface data assimilation system, our modeling framework can effectively detect the drought impacts on crop yield. Additionally, we calculated the drought probability based on the ensemble of soil moisture percentiles and found that there exist temporal and spatial discrepancies in drought probability maps generated from the NLDAS and IMERG precipitation forcings. © 2022","Bayesian methods; Data assimilation; Ensembles; Land surface model; Precipitation","Bayesian networks; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Monitoring; Radiometers; Soil surveys; Surface measurement; Bayesian methods; Data assimilation; Drought monitoring; Ensemble; Forcings; Land surface models; Modeling data; North american land data assimilation systems; Precipitation data; Satellite retrieval; Soil moisture; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; Bayesian analysis; data assimilation; drought; environmental monitoring; evapotranspiration; land surface; precipitation (climatology); soil moisture; article; drought; evapotranspiration; harvest; human; information retrieval; precipitation; probability; soil moisture; United States; satellite imagery; soil; Droughts; Humans; Satellite Imagery; Soil",Article,Scopus

Multiple ML models to predict all-cause mortality were tested on a cohort of 2393 patients (training, n = 1795; internal validation, n = 598) undergoing bifurcation PCI with contemporary stents from the real-world RAIN registry. Twenty-five commonly available patient-/lesion-related features were selected to train ML models. The best model was validated in an external cohort of 1701 patients undergoing bifurcation PCI from the DUTCH PEERS and BIO-RESORT trial cohorts. At ROC curves, the AUC for the prediction of 2-year mortality was 0.79 (0.74–0.83) in the overall population, 0.74 (0.62–0.85) at internal validation and 0.71 (0.62–0.79) at external validation.

However, due to several constraints, achieving an effective vision-driven hand gesture recognition system in real time has remained a challenge. This paper aims to uncover the limitations faced in image acquisition through the use of cameras, image segmentation and tracking, feature extraction, and gesture classification stages of vision-driven hand gesture recognition in various camera orientations. This paper looked at research on vision-based hand gesture recognition systems from 2012 to 2022. Its goal is to find areas that are getting better and those that need more work. We used specific keywords to find 108 articles in well-known online databases. In this article, we put together a collection of the most notable research works related to gesture recognition. We suggest different categories for gesture recognition-related research with subcategories to create a valuable resource in this domain. We summarize and analyze the methodologies in tabular form. After comparing similar types of methodologies in the gesture recognition field, we have drawn conclusions based on our findings. Our research also looked at how well the vision-based system recognized hand gestures in terms of recognition accuracy. There is a wide variation in identification accuracy, from 68% to 97%, with the average being 86.6 percent. The limitations considered comprise multiple text and interpretations of gestures and complex non-rigid hand characteristics. In comparison to current research, this paper is unique in that it discusses all types of gesture recognition techniques. © 2022 by the authors.

However, during droughts, the water resources are limited and determining the exact irrigation amount and its response to crop yields are crucial. Existing crop yield simulation models are data-intensive and a majority of these are point-based. Therefore, this study presents a novel integrated modeling framework by using two parsimonious models (CROPWAT, an irrigation water requirement simulation model; and AquaCrop-GIS, a spatial crop yield simulation model) to simulate corn and soybean yields under different irrigation application rates during drought years at a spatial scale in the Mobile River Basin (MRB), Southeast U.S. To simulate crop yields for drought years, first agricultural drought years are identified using an integrated drought index called the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Soil Moisture Index (SPESMI). The results indicate that a majority of the basin was affected by mild to extreme droughts during the years 2008, 2011, 2012, 2016. The results of the integrated modeling framework illustrate the potential corn and soybean yields can be increased from 10% to 259% and 20% to 229% respectively under different irrigation water application rates (50%, 75%, and 100% of irrigation water requirement) relative to rainfed crop yields at the counties in the MRB during drought years. These findings demonstrate the importance of overall irrigation and the integrated modeling framework in devising robust irrigation water management plans in drought-affected areas at a spatial scale. Failure in integrating irrigation water requirement models in crop yield simulations will result in erroneous yield simulations, especially during droughts – this is salient given projections for frequent and intense droughts globally. Although the study is focused on MRB, the framework developed is applicable for irrigation planners and water managers in any region that experiences mild to extreme droughts, as long as the farmers have the ability to adapt the irrigation in their practice given socio-economic constraints. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","AquaCrop-GIS; Corn; CROPWAT; Droughts; Mobile River Basin; Soybean","Crops; Drought; Irrigation; Soil moisture; Water management; Aquacrop-GIS; Corn; Crop yield; Crop yield simulations; CROPWAT; Integrated modeling framework; Mobile river basin; River basins; Simulation model; Soybean; Watersheds; agricultural modeling; assessment method; crop yield; drought; irrigation system; spatiotemporal analysis; water management; Alabama; Mobile Basin; United States",Article,Scopus

The present study applies a model cascade capable of simultaneously considering the interactions between agricultural and hydrological droughts. The study area covers all river basins in the Czech Republic and includes the periods of 1956–2015 (baseline) and 2021–2080 (future). The model cascade was shown to explain 91% of the variability in the seasonal and annual accumulated runoff and allows for the analysis of increasing/maintaining/decreasing available water capacity (AWC) across the 133 defined basins with a total area of c. 78,000 km2. The study reports that the probability and extent of agricultural drought increased over the entire period with higher AWC scenario showing slower pace of such increase especially from April to June. The trends in the extent or severity of hydrological droughts were of low magnitude. The future climate has been projected through the use of ensembles of five global (CMIP5) and five regional (EURO-CORDEX) climate models. The results showed a significant increase in the duration of agricultural drought stress and in the area affected throughout the year, particularly in July–September. The hydrological drought response showed a marked difference between areas with a negative and positive climatic water balance, i.e., areas where long-term reference evapotranspiration exceeds long-term precipitation (negative climatic water balance) and where it does not (positive climatic water balance). The overall results indicate that increasing soil AWC would decrease the frequency and likely also impact of future agricultural droughts, especially during spring. This result would be especially true if the wetter winters predicted by some of the models materialized. Hydrological droughts at the country level are estimated to become more pronounced with increasing AWC, particularly in catchments with a negative climatic water balance. © 2022","Agricultural drought; Available water capacity; Climate change; Climate models; Hydrological drought; Soil water retention","Agriculture; Catchments; Climate change; Drought; Soil moisture; Water resources; Agricultural drought; Available water capacities; Climate condition; Climatic water balance; Future climate; Hydrological droughts; Over water; Potential conflict; Soil water retention; Waters resources; Climate models; adaptive management; available water capacity; climate conditions; drought; drought stress; evapotranspiration; runoff; water resource; Czech Republic",Article,Scopus

We use limited reported yield (13 years) along cumulative precipitation, cumulative heat units, two meteorologically-based drought indices (Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)), and three remotely-sensed vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI)) as ANN inputs. Results indicate that, when EVI is combined with the preceding 12-month SPEI, it has better sensitivity to cotton yield than other indicators. The ANN model predicted cotton yield four months before harvest with R2 &gt;0.80, showing potential as a yield prediction tool.

The increasing temperatures and decreasing precipitation in many parts of the world have enhanced the frequency and severity of drought events. Therefore, a detailed analysis is required in order to determine the drought frequency and take the necessary precautions. In this study, the climatic conditions in the agricultural region of Çukurova (Turkey) were analysed. Meteorological data for the three provinces of Adana, Mersin, and Osmaniye were used. The aim was to calculate the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for each of the three provinces analysed, and to use these values to detect drought during the different growth periods of maize. We also investigated whether the SPI values for the last 30 years differ significantly between the provinces. Furthermore, indicators such as the duration, magnitude, severity, recurrence, and drought frequency were also calculated. Using linear regression analysis, we determined whether there were trends in the multi-year data for the total precipitation and mean temperature. In addition, the water deficiency was determined by examining the amount of water required by maize and the adequacy of the precipitation in each development period. As a result, it was found that the Çukurova region is prone to droughts, but they follow a mild course in most cases. However, no statistically significant differences were observed between the SPI values in the three provinces. The calculated average approximate drought recurrences (Tr) and expected intensities (Iave) were Tr ~ 1.036 years and Iave ~ 5.634 mm year−1 in 3 years for Adana, Tr ~ 1.031 years and Iave ~ −0.312 mm year−1 in 3 years for Mersin, and Tr ~ 1.052 years and Iave ~ −0.084 mm year−1 in 3 years Osmaniye. The research carried out in this paper confirmed that maize cultivation in the Çukurova region is vulnerable to drought, and adaptation actions should be taken immediately. © 2022 by the authors.

This study examines the influence of urbanization on the FWLE nexus. Toward this end, land was deemed as an entry point. Therefore, the impact of urbanization on the nexus was explored based on changes in land use. We selected Shenzhen, a city in China, as the study area. First, a land change modeler was employed to analyze historical land-use changes from 2000 to 2010, to build transition potential submodels, and to project future land-use patterns for 2030 under a business-as-usual scenario. Second, based on land-use maps, we assessed habitat quality, water yield, and water supply from 2000 to 2030 using Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs. Moreover, crop production was estimated according to statistical materials. Finally, the study presents the analyses and discussion of the impacts of urbanization on ecosystem services related to the FWLE nexus. The results of land-use changes indicated that a significant expansion of artificial surfaces occurred in Shenzhen with varying degrees of decrease in cultivated land, forest, and grassland. Furthermore, habitat quality, water supply, and crop production decreased evidently due to rapid urbanization. In contrast, the total water yield indicated an upward trend owing to the increased water yield from increasing artificial surfaces, whereas water yield from other land-use areas declined, such as the forest and grassland. The results demonstrated a significant positive correlation between artificial surfaces and total water yield. However, negative correlations were observed in the interaction among habitat quality, water supply, and crop production. The study presented temporal and spatial assessments to provide an effective and convenient means of exploring the interactions and tradeoffs within the FWLE nexus, which, thus, contributed to the sustainable transformation of urbanization. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem services; Food–water–land–ecosystem nexus; InVEST; Land-use changes; Urbanization","Commerce; Crops; Cultivation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Land use; Artificial surfaces; Crop production; Ecosystem services; Food–water–land–ecosystem nexus; Forest and grassland; Habitat quality; InVEST; Landuse change; Urbanization; Water yield; Water supply; ecosystem service; land use change; trade-off; urban development; urban planning; urbanization; Article; China; crop production; cultivated land; ecosystem; ecosystem monitoring; environmental impact; environmental planning; food; forest; geographic distribution; grassland; habitat quality; land use; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; urbanization; water supply; China; ecosystem; environmental protection; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen; water; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Urbanization; Water",Article,Scopus

This is especially true in the U.S. Corn Belt, which has been recognized as the primary region contributing nutrient loads to the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. A SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model simulation was set up in an agricultural watershed with about 50% tile drainage area in the U.S. Corn Belt to study the water and nutrient balance components for the whole watershed and the corn-soybean rotation system. The SWAT model was improved to consider additional nitrogen and phosphorus loss paths from the soil. The model was comprehensively calibrated and validated for simulating monthly stream flow, total suspended solids (TSS), nutrient loads (including total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), nitrate and nitrite nitrogen (NOx-N), total phosphorus (TP) and orthophosphate phosphorus (orthoP)), actual evapotranspiration (ETa), leaf area index (LAI) and annual crop yields in the watershed from 2011 to 2019. Results showed the model performance was very good for simulating the stream flow, TSS and ETa, and acceptable for nutrient loads, LAI and crop yields. ETa, surface runoff, lateral soil flow, tile drainage and percolation respectively accounted for 65%, 15%, 2%, 8% and 9% of the precipitation. Fertilizer was the main source of nitrogen and phosphorus input to the watershed, and harvested crops were the main paths removing nutrients. Surface runoff, tile drainage and percolation each contributed about 30% of total nitrogen losses to water, with surface runoff being dominated by organic nitrogen while tile drainage and percolation were dominated by nitrate nitrogen. Phosphorus losses were mainly through surface runoff, which resulted in 66% of the total losses and was dominated by organic phosphorus and soluble phosphorus. Representing about 49% of the watershed area, the corn-soybean rotation system contributed 83% and 88% of the total nitrogen and phosphorus inputs, respectively, to the watershed, as well as 64% and 46% of the nitrogen and phosphorus losses to the water system, respectively. The non-growing season (October to the next April) was identified as the critical period resulting in water and nutrient losses due to low evapotranspiration and plant uptake.

This study explores usefulness of the nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NARNN) and NARNN with exogenous inputs (NARNN–X) for forecasting issues in data sets of daily prices over periods of greater than fifty years for soybeans and soybean oil. The exogenous input in the NARNN–X for prices of soybeans (soybean oil) are prices of soybean oil (soybeans). Through investigating various model settings across the algorithm, delay, hidden neuron, and data splitting ratio, models resulting in accurate and stable performance for these two commodities are arrived at. The overall relative root mean square errors based on the chosen NARNNs (NARNN–Xs) are 1.701% (1.695%) and 1.777% (1.775%) for soybeans and soybean oil, respectively. Usefulness of the machine learning approach for price forecasting issues of the two commodities is demonstrated, as well as potential usefulness of prices of closely related commodities for providing predictive content. Results here could be used on a standalone basis as technical forecasts or combined with fundamental forecasts for forming perspectives of price trends and conducting policy analysis.

The advances in precision agriculture over the past few years have substantially enhanced the efficiency of applying spatially variable agronomic inputs for irrigation, such as fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, and water, and we can attribute them to the increasing number of innovations that utilize new technologies that are capable of monitoring field crops for varying spatial and temporal changes. Remote sensing technology is the primary driver of success in precision agriculture, along with other technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), robotic systems, weather forecasting technology, and global positioning systems (GPSs). More specifically, multispectral imaging (MSI) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) have made the monitoring of the field crop health to aid decision making and the application of spatially and temporally variable agronomic inputs possible. Furthermore, the fusion of remotely sensed multisource data—for instance, HSI and LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data fusion—has even made it possible to monitor the changes in different parts of an individual plant. To the best of our knowledge, in most reviews on this topic, the authors focus on specific methods and/or technologies, with few or no comprehensive reviews that expose researchers, and especially students, to the vast possible range of remote sensing technologies used in agriculture.

We evaluated the efficacy of creating high-resolution, broad-scale indicators of yield from simple models that combine yield mapping data, a precision agriculture tool, with the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Landsat 5 and 7 ETM+ imagery. These models were then generalised to test its potential operationalisation across a large agricultural region (>1/2 million hectares) and the state of South Australia (>8 million hectares). Annual models were the best predictors of yield across both areas. Moderate discrimination accuracy in the regional analysis meant that models could be extrapolated with reasonable spatial precision, whereas the accuracy across the state-wide analysis was poor. Generalisation of these models to further operationalise the methodology by removing the need for crop type discrimination and the continual access to annual yield data showed some benefit.

In this study, we generated a 1km soil moisture dataset for dryland wheat and maize in China (ChinaCropSM1 km) over 1993-2018 through a random forest (RF) algorithm based on numerous in situ daily observations of soil moisture. We independently used in situ observations (181327 samples) from the agricultural meteorological stations (AMSs) across China for training (164202 samples) and others for testing (17125 samples). An irrigation module was first developed according to crop type (i.e., wheat, maize), soil depth (0-10, 10-20cm) and phenology. We produced four daily datasets separately by crop type and soil depth, and their accuracies were all satisfactory (wheat r 0.93, ubRMSE 0.033m3m-3; maize r 0.93, ubRMSE 0.035m3m-3).

Methods: This study developed a new method for differentiating maize from other summer crops based on the revised time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) method, a phenology-based classification method, by combining the phenological information of multiple spectral bands and indexes instead of one single index. First, we compared the phenological characteristics of four main summer crops in Henan Province of China in terms of multiple spectral bands and indexes. The key phenological periods of each band and index were determined by comparing the identification accuracy based on the county-level statistical areas of maize. Second, we improved the TWDTW distance calculation for multiple bands and indexes by summing the rank maps of a single band or index. Third, we evaluated the performance of a multi-band and multi-period TWDTW method using Sentinel-2 time series of all spectral bands and some synthetic indexes for maize classification in Henan Province. Results and Discussion: The results showed that the combination of red edge (740.2 nm) and short-wave infrared (2202.4 nm) outperformed all others and its overall accuracy of maize planting area was about 91.77% based on 2431 field samples. At the county level, the planting area of maize matched the statistical area closely. The results of this study demonstrate that the revised TWDTW makes effective use of crop phenological information and improves the extraction accuracy of summer crops’ planting areas over a large scale. Additionally, multiple band combinations are more effective for summer crops mapping than a single band or index input.

To this aim, SWAT+ was applied on digital terrain models (DTMs) from close-range photogrammetry, land-cover mapping, real crop rotations and a detailed calendar of farming practices. NBSs behaviour was investigated in two test areas, namely the Studiati and the Gioia areas, with uniform geomorphological settings but different soil types and annual crop rotations. NBS effects were compared with a baseline control scenario (without NBSs) and assessed under future climate conditions (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). Specifically, VBSs and CCs showed different capabilities in mitigating runoff and sediment losses, and their combination provided maximum effectiveness. For the current climate scenarios, the implementation of VBSs produced a reduction of runoff depth of about 41% and 64% in the Studiati and Gioia areas, respectively, whereas showing a limited with the CCs implementation. Under the future climate conditions, similar patterns were observed, even if predicting significantly lower runoff depths. The sediment loss reduction was in the order of 79% and 64% in Studiati and Gioia areas, respectively. Concerning soil and water dynamics, the study remarked that slight topographic irregularities on flat morphologies can trigger concentrated flows responsible for high runoff and sediment losses. Furthermore, the differences in soil texture and organic matter content affected soil erodability rate on a local scale, driving the consistency of NBS mitigating effects. Future climate changes scenarios, exhibiting higher temperature and rarer but more concentrated rainfall events, emphasize the impact of different soil types.

The results showed that salinity had a negative effect on all morphological and biochemical traits of both varieties. At all salinity levels, especially at higher levels of salinity (80 and 160 mM NaCl), the effect of bacterial strains on the growth indices of Narin variety was better than Qods variety.

An average summer temperature (avS) estimating model was developed with deep neural network (DNN) and random forest (RF) in detailed spatial units within a city (1 km spatial resolution) using eight mobility sector and four static sector indicators as input variables. The feasibility of introducing mobility indicators was verified by performing a correlation analysis between temperature and traffic flows. Mobility exhibited a higher correlation with the climate sector than with static road indicators.

Gross primary production (GPP) is a major photosynthetic flux that is directly linked to crop grain yield. To better understand the potential of GPP for regional crop yield estimation, in this study, a novel crop data-model assimilation (CDMA) framework was proposed that assimilates accumulative GPP estimates from the satellite-based vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM) into the WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) model using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) algorithm to estimate winter wheat GPP and grain yield. Results showed that the WOFOST simulated GPP agreed with the GPPEC derived from eddy flux tower (R2 = 0.74 and 0.47 in 2015 and 2016, respectively). Assimilating GPPVPM into the WOFOST model improved site-scale GPP estimation (R2 = 0.87 and 0.67 in 2015 and 2016, respectively), and also improved regional-scale winter wheat yield estimates (R2 = 0.36 and 0.29; RMSE= 479 and 572 kg/ha in 2015 and 2016, respectively) compared with the open loop simulations (R2 = 0.14 and 0.10; RMSE= 801 and 788 kg/ha in 2015 and 2016, respectively).

Dimensionless passive remotely sensed data may lead to the asymptotic saturation problem when extracting W, whereas commercial lidar systems employing only one wavelength band have limited capacity in N retrieval. Combining the advantages of passive remote sensing and traditional lidar, hyperspectral lidar (HSL) has the ability to simultaneously extract structural and spectral information for plants. The objectives of this research were to evaluate the ability of HSL to estimate maize N concentration and W at the organ level, and to test whether HSL can characterize maize N distribution at different growth stages and under different N fertilizer conditions. A wide range of HSL performance for leaf and stem N extraction (R2 = 0.71 – 0.91) was observed based on the partial least squares regression (PLSR) method with spectral indices as inputs. Close relationships (R2 ≥ 0.75) were established between extracted height metrics (stem height and plant height) and organ-level W. The W portioning, dynamics of N concentration, and the variations in N with W accumulation were successfully monitored based on the estimated N concentration and W, thus demonstrating the capacity of HSL to characterize the N distribution pattern within maize plants.

Study focus: Several studies have shown a relationship between climate change and changes in sediment yield. However, there are limited modeling applications that study this relationship at regional scales mainly due to data availability and computational cost. This study proposes a methodological framework using the SWAT+ model to predict and project sediment yield at a regional scale in data-scarce regions using global datasets. We implement a framework that (a) incorporates topographic factors from high/medium resolution DEMs (b) incorporates crop phenology data (c) introduces an areal threshold to linearize sediment yield in large model units and (d) apply a hydrological mass balance calibration. We test this methodology in the Nile Basin using a model application with (revised) and without (default) the framework under historical and future climate projections. New hydrological insights for the region: Results show improved sediment yield estimates in the revised model, both in absolute values and spatial distribution when compared to measured and reported estimates. The contemporary long term (1989 – 2019) annual mean sediment yield in the revised model was 1.79 t ha−1 yr−1 and projected to increase by 61 % (44 % more than the default estimates) in the future period (2071 – 2100), with the greatest sediment yield increase in the eastern part of the basin.

While modelers and water managers rely on stand-alone ET estimation model application in their planning and management, several uncertainties including model structure, parameter set, and initial condition exist, cascading in ET calculation leading to inaccurate results. In this study, an ensemble data assimilation approach is employed to explore the benefit of remotely sensed actual ET to improve the simulations of the widely used Priestley-Taylor ET model while accounting for uncertainties. The study is conducted at farm-scale for three different crops (corn, cotton, and soybean) in the Mobile River basin in Deep South United States, which has experienced severe droughts during the cropping seasons in the past. Prior to employing data assimilation, the Priestley-Taylor model is modified for each crop to simulate actual ET instead of reference ET. Following which the model is calibrated over 320,000 farms in the river basin for identifying the optimal parameters. The calibrated model is later used for the Open-Loop simulation, as well as in the development and implementation of data assimilation. The simulated and observed actual ET is used to calculate the Kalman gain and update the model initialization every time step during the assimilation period. The findings of the study showed that assimilating the actual ET observation into the Priestley-Taylor model results in more accurate and reliable model initialization and also posterior ET estimates at farm-scale compared to open-loop simulation. These results highlight, the importance of digital agricultural tools in robust agricultural planning and management and open door for further research. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Alabama; Data assimilation; Evapotranspiration; Mobile river basin; Particle filter; Priestley-Taylor model","cropping practice; data assimilation; evapotranspiration; river basin; water demand; Alabama; Alabama; Deep South; Mobile River; United States",Article,Scopus

Previous studies have reported that conventional ML models fail to accurately simulate extreme flows which are crucial for design flood estimation and associated risk analysis in the context of climate change. Therefore, this study proposes a joint probabilistic rainfall-runoff model (JPRR) for improving high-to-extreme flow projection. With the aid of paired copula constructions, bootstrap aggregation, and multi-model ensemble approaches, the proposed model is able to effectively characterize the dependence relationships of predictors (i.e., precipitation time series with different moving sums) with various probability distributions. JPRR has been applied to four pristine basins in China, representing different climate zones and landscapes. The results reveal that JPRR significantly outperforms three well-known ML models (i.e., random forest, artificial neural networks, and long short-term memory) in high-to-extreme flow simulations. In JPRR, the copulas exhibiting the right tail dependence play a more important role in streamflow simulations at mountainous basins. Moreover, a significant difference in streamflow projections (from 2030 to 2099) derived from JPRR and benchmark models imply that flood risks from conventional ML models may be underestimated under changing climatic conditions. © 2022.

To this end, the study employed a quantitative research methodology and obtained data from 345 farmers from the northern districts of Bangladesh. Using a cross-sectional survey design and convenience sampling method, a study of premium fruit growers was undertaken to assess IoT use in agriculture, and the primary survey data were analyzed using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach via AMOS 26. The study confirmed that effort expectancy, performance expectancy, facilitating condition, hedonic motivation, government support, price value, personal innovativeness, and trust influence the willingness of Bangladeshi farmers to adopt the IoT. Additionally, predictors such as trust and willingness to adopt were observed to influence the willingness to pay for the IoT, while the construct ‘performance expectancy’ produced no effect. The study also revealed that the willingness to adopt moderates the association between performance expectancy, price value, and willingness to pay for the IoT. This research has novel implications because it investigates the behavior of rural customers with respect to innovation adoption, which in this case is the IoT in agriculture. It outlines precise reasons for the willing adoption of the IoT in agriculture, which will, in turn, assist marketers of IoT technology in the design of appropriate marketing strategies to increase acceptance in rural areas. Using the proposed model that incorporates farmers’ willingness to pay, this empirical study takes the first step in examining whether farmers in a developing economy such as Bangladesh will adopt and pay for the IoT. © 2022 by the authors.

This research aimed at evaluating ML algorithms to predict spatial distribution of soil biological properties and wheat yield in the Southwest of Iran. Topsoil samples (0–30 cm) were collected from a total of 60 sampling locations and wheat grain yield (plot 1 × 1 m) was recorded at each location. Soil properties including urease (Ur), alkaline phosphatase (AP), basal respiration (BR), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), soil organic carbon (SOC), MBC:SOC ratio, and metabolic quotient (qCO2) were measured. At the first step, Random Forest (RF) model was employed to predict soil biological properties by using terrain attributes, remote sensing indices and soil properties as covariates. In this step, both Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and Pearson regression were applied to select the most important covariates in predicting soil biological properties and to decrease the dimension of the input space with considering no reduction in prediction accuracy. Secondly, wheat grain yield was modeled using six ML algorithms; they were optimized and evaluated in Caret package with 10-fold cross validation. Results showed the highest prediction accuracy for qCO2 (R2adj = 0.80) and the lowest for BR (R2adj = 0.23). Compared to environmental predictors, soil covariates had a greater effect in modeling Ur, qCO2, MBC and MBC:SOC ratio, while, for AP and BR, bands 6 and Chanel Network Base Level were the most important factors, respectively. In prediction of wheat grain yield, both Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) and RF models outperformed with R2adj of 0.89 and 0.88, respectively. Results indicated that the Ur and AP played the major roles in predicting wheat grain yield and explaining its spatial variability. Our modeling results suggested that soil biological properties and yield can be estimated easily with reasonable accuracy.

A total of 27 Global Climate Models (GCMs) from the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) and two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5) were used to drive the SWAT-MAD model to simulate crop growth and water balance components for two future periods of 2041–2070 (2050s) and 2071–2100 (2080s). Data from almost all GCMs showed an increase in annual mean maximum air temperature, minimum air temperature, total precipitation, and solar radiation across the Haihe River Basin. Winter wheat yields increased by 15.6% (SSP245) and 16.3% (SSP585) by 2050s, and by 17.1% (SSP245) and 10.0% (SSP585) by 2080s, respectively.

It is therefore critical that forest dynamics are adequately represented in watershed models, such as the widely applied Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). SWAT's default parameterization generally produces unrealistic forest growth predictions, which we address here through an improved representation of forest dynamics using species-specific re-parameterizations. We applied this methodology to the two dominant pine species in the southeastern U.S., loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) and slash pine (Pinus elliotti). Specifically, we replaced unrealistic parameter values related to tree growth with physically meaningful parameters derived from publicly available remote-sensing products, field measurements, published literature, and expert knowledge. Outputs of the default and re-parameterized models were compared at four pine plantation sites across a range of management, soil, and climate conditions. Results were validated against MODIS-derived leaf area index (LAI) and evapotranspiration (ET), as well as field observations of total biomass. The re-parameterized model outperformed the default model in simulating LAI, biomass accumulation, and ET at all sites. The two parametrizations also resulted in substantially different mean annual water budgets for all sites, with reductions in water yield ranging from 13 to 45% under the new parameterization, highlighting the importance of properly parameterizing forest dynamics in watershed models. Importantly, our re-parameterization methodology does not require alteration to the SWAT code, allowing it to be readily adapted and applied in ongoing and future watershed modeling studies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass; Evapotranspiration; Leaf area index; MODIS; Southern pines; SWAT; Water balance","Atmospheric boundary layer; Biomass; Budget control; Climate models; Forestry; Groundwater; Parameterization; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Watersheds; Forest dynamics; Hydrologic cycles; Leaf Area Index; Parameterized model; Reparameterization; Soil and Water assessment tools; Southern pines; Surface dynamics; Water balance; Watershed modelling; Evapotranspiration; water; biomass; coniferous forest; evapotranspiration; forest dynamics; hydrological modeling; leaf area index; MODIS; soil and water assessment tool; water budget; Article; biomass; climate; controlled study; environmental management; evapotranspiration; geographic distribution; hydrological model; leaf area; loblolly pine; pine; Pinus elliotti; prediction; re parameterized Soil and Water Assessment Tool model; remote sensing; simulation; slash pine; soil; Soil and Water Assessment Tool model; surface runoff; United States; water supply; forest; hydrology; loblolly pine; tree; United States; Forests; Hydrology; Pinus taeda; Soil; Trees",Article,Scopus

The study area was Icheon City, South Korea, for which an accurate landslide inventory dataset was available. The landslide inventory map was prepared and randomly divided into datasets of 70% for training and 30% for validation. Additionally, 18 landslide-related factors, including geo-environmental and topo-hydrological factors, were considered as predictive variables. The models were compared using area under the curve (AUC) values in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The validation results showed that optimized models based on CNN-GWO (AUC = 0.876, RMSE = 0.08) and CNN-ICA (AUC = 0.852, RMSE = 0.09) outperformed the standalone CNN model (AUC = 0.847, RMSE = 0.12).

The advantages of image-based phenotyping are related to the high spatial and temporal resolution of the retrieved data and the non-destructive and rapid method of data acquisition. This study trains parametric and nonparametric regression models to retrieve leaf area index (LAI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), fractional vegetation cover (fCover), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), canopy chlorophyll content (CCC), and grain yield (GY) of winter durum wheat breeding experiment from four-bands UAV images. A ground dataset, collected during two field campaigns and complemented with data from a previous study, is used for model development. The dataset is split at random into two parts, one for training and one for testing the models. The tested parametric models use the vegetation index formula and parametric functions. The tested nonparametric models are partial least square regression (PLSR), random forest regression (RFR), support vector regression (SVR), kernel ridge regression (KRR), and Gaussian processes regression (GPR). The retrieved biophysical variables along with traditional phenotypic traits (plant height, yield, and tillering) are analysed for detection of genetic diversity, proximity, and similarity in the studied genotypes. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), Duncan’s multiple range test, correlation analysis, and principal component analysis (PCA) are performed with the phenotypic traits. The parametric and nonparametric models show close results for GY retrieval, with parametric models indicating slightly higher accuracy (R2 = 0.49; MRSE = 0.58kg/plot; rRMSE = 6.1%). However, the nonparametric model, GPR, computes per pixel uncertainty estimation, making it more appealing for operational use. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that grain filling was better than flowering phenological stage to predict GY. The nonparametric models show better results for biophysical variables retrieval, with GPR presenting the highest prediction performance. Nonetheless, robust models are found only for LAI (R2 = 0.48; MRSE = 0.64; rRMSE = 13.5%) and LCC (R2 = 0.49; MRSE = 31.57 mg m−2; rRMSE = 6.4%) and therefore these are the only remotely sensed phenotypic traits included in the statistical analysis for preliminary assessment of wheat productivity. The results from ANOVA and PCA illustrate that the retrieved remotely sensed phenotypic traits are a valuable addition to the traditional phenotypic traits for plant breeding studies. We believe that these preliminary results could speed up crop improvement programs; however, stronger interdisciplinary research is still needed, as well as uncertainty estimation of the remotely sensed phenotypic traits. © 2022 by the authors.

Herein we calibrated and applied the CMRSET (CSIRO MODIS Reflectance-based Scaling EvapoTranspiration) model at the continental scale in Australia using five remotely sensed data products with spatial resolutions ranging from 500 m (MODIS, VIIRS), 30 m (Landsat) to 20 m (Sentinel-2), and temporal frequencies ranging from daily (MODIS, VIIRS) to multi-days (Landsat and Sentinel-2). The five remotely sensed data products were used to compute a crop factor (kc) based on two vegetation indices which modify Priestley-Taylor potential evapotranspiration estimates (ETp; calculated from nation-wide daily meteorological grids) to obtain ETa. CMRSET was calibrated using daily latent heat observations from 30 eddy covariance flux towers located across Australia, representing a wide variety of land covers and climates. To ensure that CMRSET adequately estimated open water evaporation, daily ETp estimates at six water sites were also added in the calibration network. The calibrated CMRSET model was able to estimate daily ETa observed at the flux towers with a relative Root Mean Squared Error (rRMSE)/coefficient of determination (R2) ranging between 0.15/0.96 (with Sentinel-2) to 0.26/0.93 (VIIRS). Additionally, we independently evaluated the performance of CMRSET by comparing the long-term (5 years or more) differences between mean annual precipitation and ETa with measured streamflow at 638 unimpaired catchments across Australia. The comparison showed a RMSE of 0.50 mm·d-1 (rRMSE of 0.26) and a R2 of 0.70. The CMRSET model performed better than or similarly when compared against two global ETa products based on MODIS optical and thermal data. Extending the suite of remotely sensed data products that CMRSET is calibrated with and using a network of sites located across vast climate and geographic ranges, means that CMRSET can now be used to estimate ETa at continental scales with multiple spatial resolutions and temporal frequencies. Compared to other available ETa products, CMRSET is more straightforward to operationalise, requires less data inputs, can capture ETa dynamics in areas with significant direct evaporation such as floodplains and lakes and does not require manual calibration to detect wet and dry pixels. © 2021","Eddy Covariance; Evapotranspiration; Google Earth Engine; Landsat; MODIS; Remote Sensing; Sentinel-2; VIIRS","Catchments; Evapotranspiration; Mean square error; Meteorology; Remote sensing; Australia; Eddy covariance; Evapotranspiration models; Google earth engine; Google earths; LANDSAT; Remote-sensing; Scalings; Sentinel-2; VIIRS; Radiometers; algorithm; calibration; error analysis; evapotranspiration; Landsat; MODIS; observational method; remote sensing; satellite data; Sentinel; spatial resolution; VIIRS; Australia",Article,Scopus

The advantage of remote sensing data-crop model assimilation for yield estimates has been well recognized, however its potential for early-season crop yield forecasting has not yet been investigated. In this study, combining a crop model, remote sensing leaf area index (LAI) assimilation and weather forecasts, we conducted yield forecasting for winter wheat in the central North China Plain during 2008–2015. Sequential forecasting was conducted to assess the yield forecasting potential and the effects of LAI assimilation and multiple weather forecasts with different lead times. Results showed that forecasting skill increased with shortening of lead time. Assimilating remote sensing LAI into crop model was valuable and critical to improve yield forecasting skills. The uncertainties from weather forecasts could weaken the forecasting skills; and using historical weather observations performed better than using weather forecasts outputted by climate models. In general, winter wheat yield in the central North China Plain could be reliably forecasted with a lead time from five weeks (mean MAPE < 10%, ROC score > 0.8, ACC> 0.65) to two months (mean MAPE <12%, ROC score> 0.75, ACC > 0.55) before harvest.

Yet, the water balance of cultivated areas is strongly influenced by applied management practices (e.g. planting, irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting). The SWAT+ (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model represents agricultural land by default in a generic way, where the start of the cropping season is driven by accumulated heat units. However, this approach does not work for tropical and subtropical regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, where crop growth dynamics are mainly controlled by rainfall rather than temperature. In this study, we present an approach on how to incorporate crop phenology using decision tables and global datasets of rainfed and irrigated croplands with the associated cropping calendar and fertilizer applications in a regional SWAT+ model for northeastern Africa. We evaluate the influence of the crop phenology representation on simulations of leaf area index (LAI) and evapotranspiration (ET) using LAI remote sensing data from Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) and WaPOR (Water Productivity through Open access of Remotely sensed derived data) ET data, respectively. Results show that a representation of crop phenology using global datasets leads to improved temporal patterns of LAI and ET simulations, especially for regions with a single cropping cycle. However, for regions with multiple cropping seasons, global phenology datasets need to be complemented with local data or remote sensing data to capture additional cropping seasons. In addition, the improvement of the cropping season also helps to improve soil erosion estimates, as the timing of crop cover controls erosion rates in the model. With more realistic growing seasons, soil erosion is largely reduced for most agricultural hydrologic response units (HRUs), which can be considered as a move towards substantial improvements over previous estimates. We conclude that regional and global hydrological models can benefit from improved representations of crop phenology and the associated management practices. Future work regarding the incorporation of multiple cropping seasons in global phenology data is needed to better represent cropping cycles in areas where they occur using regional to global hydrological models. © Copyright:",,"Biology; Cultivation; Decision tables; Erosion; Hydrology; Land use; Remote sensing; Soils; Tropics; Agricultural land use; Crop phenology; Cropping seasons; Global datasets; Leaf Area Index; Management practises; Remote sensing data; Soil and Water assessment tools; Soil erosion; Tool models; Crops; agricultural land; agricultural management; hydrological change; land use; soil and water assessment tool",Article,Scopus

AI has already demonstrated its game-changing capabilities in many fields such as the banking sector, healthcare, e-commerce, among others. Recent advances in both computer hardware and large-scale generation of biological data have created room for the applicability of AI in agriculture by employing methods like machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, artificial or convoluted neural networks either independently or in combination thereof. Currently, AI is being utilized in multiple domains of agriculture and contributing toward increasing crop yield as well as minimizing the risk associated with crop cultivation. Data generated from different agricultural domains such as weather, soil, temperature, humidity, irrigation, sowing requirements, and other crop-related criterion are being analyzed and integrated for agriculture-related predictions. An increase in crop yield is being achieved not only by predicting the best time for sowing, harvesting, and monitoring crop health but also by reducing the cost of agricultural inputs like chemicals, fertilizers, irrigation, etc., through precision farming. Correspondingly, agricultural risks are also being minimized by addressing issues such as poor rainfall, weed growth, pest attacks, and postharvest losses. Besides, AI is also being used for crop/commodity price forecasting and agricultural automation via robots. The predictive agricultural analytics and chatbots are used to disseminate information to farmers as a part of advisory services by these agribusinesses.

A range of approaches have been assessed to improve the effectiveness of the connection between seasonal forecast information and mechanistic crop models, which include GCMs, analogue, stochastic disaggregation, and statistical prediction through converting seasonal weather summaries into the daily weather. GCM outputs are produced in a format compatible with mechanistic crop models. Such outputs are critical for researchers to have information on the merits and demerits of tools and approaches on integrating seasonal forecast and crop models.

The predicted traits showed medium to high heritability and genome-wide association studies using the predicted values identified four QTL for Vcmax and two QTL for Jmax. Candidate genes within 200 kb of the Vcmax QTL were involved in nitrogen storage, which is closely associated with Rubisco, while not directly associated with Rubisco activity per se.

As soil salinization is often heavily affected by regional environments, difficulties arise when constructing an adaptive multi-regional soil salinity estimation model. In this study, we proposed an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model based on the Tree-structure Parzen Estimator (TPE) optimization algorithm to apply to four study areas with different environments (TPE-XGBoost). The four areas are the Weigan-Kuqa Oasis (Weiku), the Sangong River Basin (Sgr) and the Qitai Oasis in Xinjiang, China, and the middle and lower reaches of the Syr Darya Basin in Kazakhstan. Most previous soil salinity studies did not pay much attention to the impact of feature selection and hyper-parameter tuning on the performance of machine learning models, and the complex dependence and interaction between input features and hyper-parameters. In order to improve the performance of XGBoost model in estimating soil salinity, we proposed for the first time to use TPE algorithm to jointly optimize feature selection and hyper-parameter tuning, and verified it in four areas. Coefficient of determination (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the model performance. First, we calculated 55 environmental features from Landsat and terrain data. Then, in order to reduce the computational complexity of the TPE-XGBoost model, we used Pearson correlation analysis between surface soil salinity content (SSC) and features to initially filter out the features that were not significantly related (P &gt; 0.05). Finally, the TPE algorithm was used to jointly optimize the parameter space composed of features and hyper-parameters. The results showed that (1) TPE joint optimization algorithm significantly improved the performance of the XGBoost model, achieving high accuracy in the four areas, and had powerful generalization. R2 values of test sets for Weiku Oasis, Qitai Oasis, Sgr Basin, and the Syr Basin were 0.95, 0.95, 0.80, and 0.81, respectively. (2) There is no universal feature can be applied to soil salinity inversion in different environments. TPE algorithm adaptively selected different types and numbers of features for four areas, 19, 11, 25, and 15 features were selected in Weiku Oasis, Qitai Oasis, Sgr Basin, and the Syr Basin, respectively. This showed that the optimal model parameters should not be fixed parameters, but should be re-determined locally according to different environmental conditions. The TPE algorithm can capture the features that reflect environmental differences. (3) The XGBoost model can provide feature importance ranking, which improves the interpretability of machine learning model. The importance analysis results showed that the features had different contributions in different areas. The TPE-XGBoost model proposed in this study has great potential in multi-regional soil salt estimation research. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","feature selection; hyper-parameter tuning; multi-regions; Soil salinization; TPE optimization; XGBoost","Correlation methods; Feature extraction; Mean square error; Parameter estimation; Soils; Trees (mathematics); Features selection; Hyper-parameter; Hyper-parameter tuning; Multi-region; Optimisations; Parameters tuning; Parzen estimators; Soil salinization; Tree structures; Tree-structure parzen estimator optimization; Xgboost; Optimization; algorithm; Bayesian analysis; estimation method; machine learning; optimization; saline soil; salinization; China; Sangong Basin; Syr Darya Basin; Xinjiang Uygur; Xinjiang Uygur",Article,Scopus

Therefore, proper irrigation management is critical in achieving sustainable agriculture by increasing crop yield while conserving water resources. Remote sensing has demonstrated a great promise in monitoring crop status including crop water status based on the spectral vegetation index (VI). Therefore, the vegetation growth (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI), vegetation water status (shortwave crop reflectance index, SCRI), and vegetation drought stress (moisture stress index, MSI) indices were calculated to assess the impact of irrigation management on canopy water status in a cluster of winter wheat fields in a semi-arid area in three non-consecutive growing seasons with different seasonal rainfall amounts and distributions. The winter wheat fields were typically irrigated six times in each growing season according to a fixed phenological-based irrigation scheduling. Results showed that NDVI, SCRI, and MSI had a high correlation with the remotely sensed locally calibrated leaf area index (LAI), among which NDVI had the strongest correlation (r = 0.9). The analysis revealed that the combined use of VIs succeeded in detecting spatial and temporal crop drought stress levels during the growing seasons. Furthermore, the normalized difference water index (NDWI) was interpreted to quantitatively classify the level and extent of drought stress in the winter wheat fields. The results of the NDWI analysis revealed that 62%, 100%, and 72% of the irrigated winter wheat fields have experienced some levels of drought stress during the normal growing season with wet spring, normal growing season with wet autumn, and dry growing season, respectively. The drought stress was basically due to the lack of effective rainfall during spring in March and April when crops have the highest vegetative growth, irrespective of the rainfall amount during autumn and winter. This revealed the importance of timely irrigation management during spring time. In addition, paired anomaly analysis of the NDVI, MSI, and SCRI with the wheat grain yields could identify good and poor wheat fields and recognize proper management zones of the wheat fields in terms of potential grain production. The findings of this study demonstrated that remote sensing is a strong and reliable tool in irrigation management to help sustain food production in arid or semi-arid areas with limited water resources. © 2023 The Authors","Anomaly analysis; Drought stress; Irrigation management; Leaf area index; Spectral vegetation indices; Wheat grain yield","Arid regions; Cultivation; Drought; Grain (agricultural product); Irrigation; Rain; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Water resources; Anomaly analysis; Drought stress; Grain yield; Growing season; Irrigation management; Leaf Area Index; Spectral vegetation indices; Wheat grain yield; Wheat grains; Winter wheat field; Crops",Article,Scopus

Against the background of human beings actively responding to climate change, quantitatively revealing the change and migration laws of green biomass loss (GBL) caused by drought in historical and future periods is insufficient. In this regard, we innovatively constructed a joint kNDVI-SPEI (kernel normalized difference vegetation index and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index) distribution based on copula theory to accurately capture GBL dynamic under various drought scenarios unlike previous studies conducted in a deterministic way. Taking the drought-sensitive and ecologically vulnerable Central Asia (CA) as a typical region, we verified that an average 94.4 % of region showed greater vegetation vulnerability in times of water shortage from May to October, which exhibited the greatest probability of GBL under different drought scenarios, mainly in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Significantly intensified drought due to high emissions will cause an 18.16 percentage-point increase in GBL probability in the far future (FFP, 2061–2100) compared to the near future (NFP, 2019–2060), which is much higher than in the lower-emission (0.38 %) and moderate-emission scenarios (9.82 %).

Under this scenario, the question that arises is how to address the demand for agricultural products given that the pressures on land use have already increased. In addition, it is obvious that climate change will have a serious negative impact and threaten the productivity and sustainability of food production systems. Therefore, understanding and predicting the outcome of crop production, while considering adaptation and sustainability, is essential. The need for information on decision making at all levels, from crop management to adaptation strategies, is constantly increasing and methods for providing such information are urgently needed in a relatively short period of time. Thus arises the need to use effective data, such as satellite and meteorological data, but also operational tools, to assess crop yields over local, regional, national, and global scales. In this work, three modeling approaches built on a fusion of satellite-derived vegetation indices, agro-meteorological indicators, and crop phenology are tested and evaluated in terms of data intensiveness for the prediction of wheat yields in large scale applications. The obtained results indicated that medium input data intensity methods are effective tools for yield assessments. The methods, namely, a semi-empirical regression model, a machine learning regression model, and a process-based model, provided high to moderate accuracies by fully relying on freely available datasets as sources of input data. The findings are comparable with those reported in the literature for detailed field experiments, thereby introducing a promising framework that can support operational platforms for dynamic yield forecasting, operating at the administrative or regional unit scale. © 2022 by the authors.","AquaCrop; data fusion; machine learning; publicly available datasets; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

Despite surmounting evidence of the field and landscape scale benefits of diversifying agricultural systems, path dependencies of US agriculture present barriers to such diversification pathways. This study aims to elucidate path dependencies of agricultural landscapes that (dis)incentivize crop diversification at the regional scale through two main research questions: 1) what are the biophysical and socioecological factors most predictive of agricultural diversity across the US; and 2) how do these factors vary regionally? Using a novel panel dataset constructed from several open-source databases, we use random forest (RF) permutation variable importance measures to identify and compare the factors most predictive of county-level crop diversity across nine US regions. Our results show that climate, land use norms, and farm inputs are consistently the most important categories for predicting agricultural diversity across regions; however, variability exists in the relative regional importance of variables within these categories. Thus, factors most strongly predictive of agricultural diversity across US landscapes operate distinctly at a regional level, emphasizing the need to consider multiple scales of influence. These distinct regional relationships contribute to path dependencies that present resistance to enhancing agricultural diversity. By more appropriately addressing the regional factors of US agricultural landscapes the constrain agricultural diversification, with an eye towards future cropscapes, we can shift current path dependencies toward a more resilient and adaptive US agricultural future. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Diversification; Path dependency; Region; United States","agricultural land; agriculture; crop plant; data set; factor analysis; land use; land use change; landscape ecology; United States",Article,Scopus

The growing demands of smart farming for extracting meaningful information from field data to support irrigation decisions may be facilitated using field monitoring technology along with advanced modeling algorithms. This research took place in a Vitis Vinifera cv. “Sauvignon Blanc” experimental plot within a commercial vineyard. The main objective was to generate a water stress estimation model for wine grapevines based on data fusion from multiple sensors. Data were collected using sensors from five monitored grapevines, each treated with a different water stress regime. The sensors provided measurements of trunk and fruit growth, leaf temperature, and soil water content (SWC) at depths of 20 and 40 cm. Additionally, meteorological station in the vineyard recorded the temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation. A daily-scale multivariate time series was composed using the data derived from the sensors. Stem water potential (SWP) values were measured for the monitored vines and analyzed against the multivariate time series of factors to define their interrelations and interactions. Finally, a prediction model for SWP estimation was defined using boosted regression trees (BRT) algorithm, with an optimized set of factors. Validation was conducted using comparative statistics between a randomly selected test set and a predicted set of SWP values achieved using the trained BRT model. After processing the data and eliminating most of the factors due to multicollinearity, the model was composed of daily maximum leaf temperature (LT), SWC at noon at 40 cm, tree water deficit (TWD), SWC daily amplitude at 20 cm, water input, vapor pressure deficit, and phenological stages. The highest contributor to the BRT model was maximum LT (44.5%), followed by SWC at noon at 40 cm (16.9%) and TWD (16%). The model performance was estimated using various measures and resulted in a correlation of 0.9 between the estimated SWP values and the test set. No significant differences were found between their means (t = -0.31, p-value = 0.76) and distributions (D = 0.13, p-value = 0.77). The RMSE was 0.16 MPa which corresponds to a 12% error when normalized to the range of the test set. The suggested sensor fusion approach for estimating SWP is a promising technique that integrates representative factors of the soil–water-plant-atmosphere continuum; it should be further examined in different climate regimes and vine varieties. © 2022","Deficit irrigation; Machine learning; Smart irrigation; Vitis vinifera; Water stress","Data fusion; Data handling; Forestry; Fruits; Machine learning; Mean square error; Plants (botany); Regression analysis; Soil moisture; Time series; Trees (mathematics); Wind; Wine; Boosted regression trees; Deficit irrigation; Leaf temperature; Potential values; Smart irrigation; Soil water content; Stem water potentials; Test sets; Vitis vinifera; Water stress; Irrigation; irrigation; machine learning; sensor; soil water potential; vine; water stress",Article,Scopus

Wheat quality is primarily determined by the grain protein content (GPC) and composition, and both of these are affected by nitrogen (N) levels in the plant as it develops during the growing season. Hyperspectral remote sensing is gradually becoming recognized as an economical alternative to traditional destructive field sampling methods and laboratory testing as a means of determining the N status within wheat. Currently, hyperspectral vegetation indices (VIs) and linear nonparametric regression are the primary tools for monitoring the N status of wheat. Machine learning algorithms have been increasingly applied to model the nonlinear relationship between spectral data and wheat N status. This study is a comprehensive review of available N-related hyperspectral VIs and aims to inform the selection of VIs under field conditions. The combination of feature mining and machine learning algorithms is discussed as an application of hyperspectral imaging systems. We discuss the major challenges and future directions for evaluating and assessing wheat N status. Finally, we suggest that the underlying mechanism of protein formation in wheat grains as determined by using hyperspectral imaging systems needs to be further investigated. This overview provides theoretical and technical support to promote applications of hyperspectral imaging systems in wheat N status assessments; in addition, it can be applied to help monitor and evaluate food and nutrition security.

A finer resolution crop type map can potentially reduce errors related to crop area estimation, field size characterization, and precision agriculture activities that requires crop growth information at scales finer than crop field. This study is to develop a method for crop type mapping using Sentinel-2 10 m bands (i.e., red, green, blue, and near-infrared) and to examine the benefit of the derived 10 m crop type map. The crop type mapping was conducted for two study areas with significantly different field sizes and crop types in South Dakota and California, respectively. The Sentinel-2 10 m surface reflectance and the derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) acquired in the 2019 growing season were used to generate monthly median composites as classification input. The training and evaluation samples were derived from CDL by (i) finding good quality 30 m CDL pixels and (ii) identifying a single representative Sentinel-2 10 m pixel time series for each 30 m good quality CDL pixel. The random forest algorithm was trained using 80% of the samples and evaluated using the 20% remaining samples, and the results showed high overall accuracies of 94% and 83% for South Dakota and California study areas, respectively. The major crops in both study areas obtained high user's and producer's accuracies (&gt;87%). There is a good agreement between the class proportions in the 10 m crop type map and 30 m CDL for both study areas with R2 ≥ 0.94 and root mean square error (RMSE) ≤ 3%. More importantly, compared to the 30 m CDL, the 10 m crop type map has much less salt-pepper and crop boundary-aliasing effects and defines better the small surface features (e.g., small fields, roads, and rivers).

This research aims to present the application of both conventional and modern prediction methods in precision fertilization by integrating agronomic components with the spatial component of interpolation and machine learning. While conventional methods were a cornerstone of soil prediction in the past decades, new challenges to process larger and more complex data have reduced their viability in the present. Their disadvantages of lower prediction accuracy, lack of robustness regarding the properties of input soil sample values and requirements for extensive cost-and time-expensive soil sampling were addressed. Specific conventional (ordinary kriging, inverse distance weighted) and modern machine learning methods (random forest, support vector machine, artificial neural networks, decision trees) were evaluated according to their popularity in relevant studies indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection over the past decade. As a shift towards increased prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, an overview of state-of-the-art remote sensing methods for improving precise fertilization was completed, with the accent on open-data and global satellite missions. State-of-the-art remote sensing techniques allowed hybrid interpolation to predict the sampled data supported by remote sensing data such as high-resolution multispectral, thermal and radar satellite or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based imagery in the analyzed studies. The representative overview of conventional and modern approaches to precision fertilization was performed based on 121 samples with phosphorous pentoxide (P2 O5 ) and potassium oxide (K2 O) in a common agricultural parcel in Croatia. It visually and quantitatively confirmed the superior prediction accuracy and retained local heterogeneity of the modern approach. The research concludes that remote sensing data and methods have a significant role in improving fertilization in precision agriculture today and will be increasingly important in the future. © 2022 by the authors.

This study provides a comprehensive review of DNFS dividing it into two essential parts. The first part aims to provide a thorough understanding of DNFS and its architectural representation, whereas the second part reviews DNFS optimization methods. This study aims to assist researchers in understanding the various ways DNFS models are developed by hybridizing DNN and FIS, as well as gradient (derivative)-based methods and metaheuristics (derivative-free) optimization, as discussed in the literature. This study revealed that the proposed DNFS architectures performed 11.6% better than non-fuzzy models, with an overall accuracy of 81.4%. The investigation based on optimization methods revealed that DNFS with metaheuristics optimization methods has shown an overall accuracy of 93.56%, which is 21.10% higher than the DNFS models using gradient-based methods. Additionally, this study showed that DNFS networks presented in the literature have integrated DNN with typical FIS, although more satisfactory results can be obtained using a new generation of FIS termed fractional FIS (FFIS) and Mamdani complex FIS (M-CFIS). Besides, dynamic neural networks are suggested in the replacement of static DNNs to facilitate dynamic learning. Some studies have also demonstrated the optimization of DNFS using classical gradient-based approaches that can affect network performance when solving highly nonlinear problems.

The current study focused on a basin in the Brazilian Amazon and had the following three objectives: (1) to perform an effective diagnosis of flow and sediment yield, (2) to evaluate the impacts of LULC changes over the last 40 years on the hydro-sedimentological variables, and (3) to investigate the impacts of the possible trends or breaking points in the flow, surface runoff, and sediment yield series. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model validation showed that the simulated results were consistent with the data measured in the dynamic reproduction of flow seasonality. Furthermore, changes in LULC altered surface runoff, sediment yield, and flow according to the Mann-Kendall and Pettitt non-parametric tests. It was also observed that the sub-basins in which pastureland is predominant are more susceptible to increased surface runoff and sediment yield. According to trend and homogeneity tests, these sub-basins had break points in the time series of these variables. On the other hand, in the sub-basins whose land cover is predominantly forest, the time series is homogeneous and trendless. The current study highlighted the impacts that 40 years of LULC changes in an Amazonian basin had on hydro-sedimentological variables, which, in turn, can play an important role in changing the hydrological cycle, consequently these changes can also impact diverse human activities in the region, such as agribusiness, livestock, energy production, food security, and public water supply.

Current LAI estimation methods at subfield scale are limited not only by the characteristics of the spatial data (pixel size and spectral information) but also by the empiricity of developed models, mostly based on vegetation indices, which do not necessarily scale spatiality (among different varieties or planting characteristics) or temporally (need for different LAI models for different phenological stages). Widely used machine learning (ML) algorithms and high-resolution small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) information provide an opportunity for spatial and temporal LAI estimation addressing the spatial and temporal limitations. In this study, considering both accuracy and efficiency, a point-cloud-based feature-extraction approach (Full Approach) and a raster-based feature-extraction approach (Fast Approach) using sUAS information were developed based on multiple growing seasons (2014–2019) to extract and generate vine-scale information for LAI estimation in commercial vineyards across California. Three known ML algorithms, Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), were considered, along with hybrid ML schemes based on those three algorithms, coupled with different feature-extraction approaches. Results showed that the hybrid ML technique using RF and RVM and the Fast Approach with 9 input variables, called RVM-RFFast model, performs better than others in a visual and statistical assessments of the generated LAI being also computationally efficient. Furthermore, using the generated LAI products in the quantification of energy balance using the two-source energy balance Priestley-Taylor version (TSEB-PT) model and EC tower data, the results indicated excellent estimation of net radiation (Rn) and latent heat flux (LE), good estimation of surface heat flux (G), and poor estimation of sensible heat flux (H). Additionally, TSEB-PT sensitivity analysis performed by regenerating LAI maps based on the generated LAI map (from − 15% of the original LAI map to + 15% with a 5% gap) showed that LAI uncertainty had a major impact on G, followed by evapotranspiration partitioning (T/ET), H, LE, and Rn.

Using growth-stage information to estimate winter wheat yields in a timely manner is essential for accurate crop management and rapid decision-making in sustainable agriculture, and to increase productivity while reducing environmental impact. UAV remote sensing is widely used in precision agriculture due to its flex-ibility and increased spatial and spectral resolution. Hyperspectral data are used to model crop traits because of their ability to provide continuous rich spectral information and higher spectral fidelity. In this study, hyperspectral image data of the winter wheat crop canopy at the flowering and grain-filling stages was acquired by a low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and machine learning was used to predict winter wheat yields. Specifically, a large number of spectral indices were extracted from the spectral data, and three feature selection methods, recursive feature elimination (RFE), Boruta feature selection, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), were used to filter high spectral indices in order to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Four major basic learner models, (1) support vector machine (SVM), (2) Gaussian process (GP), (3) linear ridge regression (LRR), and (4) random forest (RF), were also constructed, and an ensemble machine learning model was developed by combining the four base learner models. The results showed that the SVM yield prediction model, constructed on the basis of the preferred features, performed the best among the base learner models, with an R2 between 0.62 and 0.73. The accuracy of the proposed ensemble learner model was higher than that of each base learner model; moreover, the R2 (0.78) for the yield prediction model based on Boruta’s preferred characteristics was the highest at the grain-filling stage. © 2022 by the authors.

It seems to have the potential to partially replace Norway spruce, as it is less sensitive to expected warmer and drier conditions. It is, however, not well known in which regions these new plantings would be particularly favourable and if specific provenances may be better adapted to the new conditions than others. Therefore, we estimated the potential early height growth under climate conditions in 2040–2060 for 20 beech provenances across a region covering the Czech Republic and Slovakia. This Central European region is expected to experience considerably drier and warmer conditions in the future. For this exercise, we implemented a new neural network model developed from height growth information obtained from the open-access BeechCOSTe52 database. The simulations are driven by past and future climate data obtained from the WorldClim database of historical climate data and future climate projections. Simulations revealed that provenances originating from drier regions performed on average significantly better than those from regions with good water supply. Moreover, provenances originating from drier regions had a particularly large advantage in the relatively arid regions of Central Czechia and Southern Slovakia. We can also confirm that all provenances showed a high phenotypic plasticity of height growth across the whole investigated region. © 2022 by the authors.","common garden; eco distance; Fagus sylvatica; local adaptation; neural network model; phenotypic plasticity","Climate change; Climate models; Driers (materials); Forestry; Water supply; Common garden; Dry condition; Eco distance; European beech; Fagus sylvatica; Height growth; Local adaptation; Neural network model; Phenotypic plasticity; Warmer conditions; Neural network models; Driers; Fagus Sylvatica; Forestry; Growth; Height; Slovakia; Water Supply",Article,Scopus

The influence of species diversity and sensor specifications on the performances of various classification approaches are discussed. Based on the limitations of previous approaches, we propose a novel framework to map mangrove species at medium, high, and very-high spatial resolution using multispectral and hyperspectral images. The framework relies on a multitask convolutional neural network to achieve accurate classification at pixel and object (i.e. individual tree crown) level. It was successfully applied to the most comprehensive dataset of optical imagery ever collected over a mangrove forest, achieving accurate mapping of species on airborne (OA = 95 %, Kappa = 0.93) and spaceborne imagery (OA and Kappa up to 97 % and 0.95, respectively), including the newly-operating hyperspectral DESIS and PRISMA instruments. This study brings new insights into the role of spatial and spectral resolutions in mangrove species classification, particularly the importance of short-wave infrared bands. Multispectral imagery performs well at very-high to high resolutions (up to 10–20 m) but suffers from the lack of spectral information at medium resolution (30 m). Hyperspectral imagery provided the best results at sub-metric resolution (0.5 m) and satisfactory results at 30-m resolution (OA ≥ 85), and could benefit from implementing spectral unmixing in the latter case. Given the increasing attention accorded to mangroves, remote sensing will undoubtedly become an essential tool to monitor the diversity of these endangered ecosystems in the future. In that respect, efforts should concentrate on evaluating the capabilities of new and upcoming instruments and multisource data combination to improve mangrove species mapping and, more broadly, to meet conservation goals. © 2022 The Author(s)","Deep learning; Mangrove forest; Object-oriented classification; Optical imagery; Pixel-oriented classification; Species mapping","Conservation; Deep learning; Ecosystems; Forestry; Infrared radiation; Optical remote sensing; Pixels; Vegetation mapping; Deep learning; Mangrove forest; Mangrove species; Multispectral imagery; Object oriented classification; Optical imagery; Pixel-oriented; Pixel-oriented classification; Space-borne; Species mapping; Image classification; conservation status; mangrove; mapping method; pixel; satellite imagery; species diversity",Article,Scopus

Soil carbon credit is the additional change in soil carbon stock under certain farming practices compared with the business-as-usual practices. Accurately calculating cropland carbon budget and soil carbon credit is critical to assessing climate change mitigation potential in agroecosystems. The calculation of cropland carbon budget and soil carbon credit is sensitive to local soil and climatic conditions, especially initial soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, which is determined by both SOC concentration (SOC%) and bulk density (Bulk_Density). SOC stock data are either from soil sampling or gridded public survey data. In agroecosystem models, SOC stock data are a key model input for quantifying cropland carbon budget and soil carbon credit. However, various types and degrees of uncertainties exist in SOC stock datasets, which propagate to the quantification of SOC stock change. In particular, a large discrepancy is found in two widely used SOC stock datasets — Rapid Carbon Assessment dataset (RaCA) and Gridded Soil Survey Geographic Database (gSSURGO) — in the U.S. Midwest, with a relative difference (quantified using Normalized Root Mean Square Error, NRMSE) of 48.0% for 0–30 cm SOC stock between the two datasets. It remains largely unclear how uncertainty in SOC stocks affects the calculation of cropland carbon budget and soil carbon credit. To address this question, we used a well-validated process-based agroecosystem model, ecosys, to assess the impacts of SOC stock uncertainty on carbon budget and soil carbon credit calculation in the U.S. Midwestern corn-soybean rotation systems. Our results reveal the following findings: (1) A sizable discrepancy exists in simulated cropland carbon budget between using gSSURGO and using RaCA for their SOC% and Bulk_Density as model inputs, with a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of only 0.4 for simulated change of SOC stock (ΔSOC) using these two different soil datasets. (2) Simulated cropland carbon budget components were more sensitive to initial SOC% than to Bulk_Density. For example, the upper and lower quartiles of multi-year averaged ΔSOC were −29.8 and 4.8 gC/m2/year for the selected counties respectively, with an uncertainty of 13.7 and 0.7 gC/m2/year induced by uncertainties in initial SOC% and Bulk_Density, respectively. (3) Both simulated ΔSOC and its uncertainty were negatively correlated with initial SOC%, whereas ΔSOC was negatively correlated with air temperature, and ΔSOC uncertainty was positively correlated with air temperature. (4) The uncertainty of calculated soil carbon credits was much smaller compared with the uncertainty of calculated absolute carbon budgets assuming the same SOC stock uncertainty level in the inputs. Specifically, in our assessment comparing planting cover crops vs no cover crop, the uncertainty of calculated soil carbon credits induced by initial SOC% uncertainty was less than 4% (relative to the quantified value of the soil carbon credits) for 90% of the cases. Our analysis highlights that high accuracy measurement of SOC% as inputs is needed for the calculation of cropland carbon budgets; however, soil carbon credit quantification is much less sensitive to the initial SOC% inputs, and the current publicly available soil datasets (e.g., gSSURGO) are largely suitable for the calculation of soil carbon credits. © 2022 The Author(s)","Agroecosystem; Carbon budgets; Process-based model; Soil carbon credits; Soil organic carbon; Uncertainty","Budget control; Climate change; Correlation methods; Ecosystems; Large dataset; Mean square error; Organic carbon; Soils; Uncertainty analysis; Agro-ecosystems; Carbon budgets; Carbon credits; Initial soils; Process-based modeling; Soil carbon; Soil carbon credit; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic Carbon stocks; Uncertainty; Soil surveys; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural land; bulk density; carbon budget; climate change; organic carbon; Midwest; United States",Article,Scopus

Information about the proximity of the reconstructed SIF (SIFr) datasets to GPP across land cover types and climatic conditions provides important support for a better application of these products for modelling applications. We conducted a multiscale analysis of four different long-term (12 years, 2007–2018) high-resolution global SIFr datasets (0.05° × 0.05°), namely – CSIF (Contiguous SIF), GOSIF (Global OCO-2 SIF), LUE-SIF (Light Use Efficiency SIF), and HSIF (Harmonized SIF) - at 4-day, 8-day, and monthly time scales and found that for the majority of sites, the SIFr is linearly related to ground-based GPP measurements with the eddy covariance method. While the relationship between SIFr and GPP (i.e., the slope - GPP/SIFr) varied significantly across the SIFr datasets, sites, and land cover types, all four SIFr datasets were unequivocally a better predictor of GPP compared to remotely sensed vegetation indices – NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and EVI (enhanced vegetation index), sensed by the MODIS satellite. Furthermore, we also analyzed SIF-GPP relationships during drought vs non-drought conditions and found that for about 30% of the sites, comprising mostly non-forests site, the SIF-GPP relationship became weaker (decreased R2) with a lower slope during drought conditions compared to non-drought conditions. Among the four different products, the CSIF (at 4-day timescale) and GOSIF (at 8-day timescale) predicted GPP better compared to LUE-SIF and HSIF across all land cover types. Owing to their long-term availability (since 2000 for CSIF and GOSIF), these SIFr datasets combined with proxies of ecosystem properties can be used to appropriately capture vegetation dynamics and the interannual variabilities across a wide range of climatic conditions. © 2022 The Authors","CSIF; Eddy-covariance; GOME-2; GOSIF; HSIF; MODIS; OCO-2","Fluorescence; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Radiometers; Vegetation; Contiguous SIF; Eddy covariance; Global OCO-2 SIF; GOME-2; Gross primary productivity; Harmonized SIF; Land-cover types; MODIS; OCO-2; Solar-induced fluorescences; Drought; eddy covariance; land cover; MODIS",Article,Scopus

This paper presents for the first time the potential of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-based high-resolution hyperspectral and LiDAR data acquired from in-season stand crops for estimating seed protein and oil compositions of soybean and corn using multisensory data fusion and automated machine learning. UAV-based hyperspectral and LiDAR data was collected during the growing season (reproductive stage five (R5)) of 2020 over a soybean test site near Columbia, Missouri and a cornfield at Urbana, Illinois, USA. Canopy spectral and texture features were extracted from hyperspectral imagery, and canopy structure features were derived from LiDAR point clouds. The extracted features were then used as input variables for automated machine-learning methods available with the H2O Automated Machine-Learning framework (H2O-AutoML). The results presented that: (1) UAV hyperspectral imagery can successfully predict both the protein and oil of soybean and corn with moderate accuracies; (2) canopy structure features derived from LiDAR point clouds yielded slightly poorer estimates of crop-seed composition compared to the hyperspectral data; (3) regardless of machine-learning methods, the combination of hyperspectral and LiDAR data outperformed the predictions using a single sensor alone, with an R2 of 0.79 and 0.67 for corn protein and oil and R2 of 0.64 and 0.56 for soybean protein and oil; and (4) the H2O-AutoML framework was found to be an efficient strategy for machine-learning-based data-driven model building.

This research has developed deep learning hybrid model (i.e., CNN-LSTM) to factor in role of cloud effects integrating the merits of convolutional neural networks with long short-term memory networks to forecast near real-time (i.e., 5-min) PPFD in a sub-tropical region Queensland, Australia. The prescribed CLSTM model is trained with real-time sky images that depict stochastic cloud movements captured through a total sky imager (TSI-440) utilising advanced sky image segmentation to reveal cloud chromatic features into their statistical values, and to purposely factor in the cloud variation to optimise the CLSTM model. The model, with its competing algorithms (i.e., CNN, LSTM, deep neural network, extreme learning machine and multivariate adaptive regression spline), are trained with 17 distinct cloud cover inputs considering the chromaticity of red, blue, thin, and opaque cloud statistics, supplemented by solar zenith angle (SZA) to predict short-term PPFD. The models developed with cloud inputs yield accurate results, outperforming the SZA-based models while the best testing performance is recorded by the objective method (i.e., CLSTM) tested over a 7-day measurement period. Specifically, CLSTM yields a testing performance with correlation coefficient r = 0.92, root mean square error RMSE = 210.31 μ mol of photons m−2 s−1, mean absolute error MAE = 150.24 μ mol of photons m−2 s−1, including a relative error of RRMSE = 24.92% MAPE = 38.01%, and Nash Sutcliffe’s coefficient ENS = 0.85, and Legate and McCabe’s Index LM = 0.68 using cloud cover in addition to the SZA as an input. The study shows the importance of cloud inclusion in forecasting solar radiation and evaluating the risk with practical implications in monitoring solar energy, greenhouses and high-value agricultural operations affected by stochastic behaviour of clouds.

They are mainly designed at a specific spatial scale, the field. But with the new spatial data being made available in modern agriculture, they are being more and more applied at multiple and changing scales. These applications range from typically at broader scales, to perform regional or national studies, or at finer scales to develop modern site-specific management approaches. These new approaches to the application of crop models raise new questions concerning the evaluation of their performance, particularly for downscaled applications. This article first reviews the reasons why practitioners decide to spatialize crop models and the main methods they have used to do this, which questions the best place of the spatialization process in the modelling framework. A strong focus is then given to the evaluation of these spatialized crop models. Evaluation metrics, including the consideration of dedicated sensitivity indices are reviewed from the published studies. Using a simple example of a spatialized crop model being used to define management zones in precision viticulture, it is shown that classical model evaluation involving aspatial indices (e.g. the RMSE) is not sufficient to characterize the model performance in this context. A focus is made at the end of the review on potentialities that a complementary evaluation could bring in a precision agriculture context. © 2022, The Author(s).","Crop model uncertainty; Scaling methods; Sensitivity analysis; Spatial pattern; Spatialization","numerical model; precision agriculture; spatial data; viticulture",Review,Scopus

Of late, the arrival of big data, high computational speed, cloud computing and artificial intelligence techniques (like machine learning and deep learning) has reformed how many engineering and manufacturing professionals approach their work. These technologies offer thrilling innovative ways for engineers and manufacturers to tackle real-life challenges. On the other hand, the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is extensive. Several diverse theories, algorithms, and methods are available, which presents a challenge and a barrier in choosing the right AI technique for the appropriate engineering process or manufacturing process and environments. Besides, the pertinent literature is disseminated over various journals, conference proceedings, and research communities. Hence, conducting a systematic survey to scrutinise and classify the existing literature is worthwhile. However, it is challenging, but previous review studies have not adequately addressed AI’s use and advancement in engineering and manufacturing (EM). Besides, some concentrated on single AI models, and others focused on a specific area in EM. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of studies on AI and its application in EM. To limit the scope of the current study, we conducted a keyword search in official publisher websites and academic databases, such as Springer, Elsevier, Scopus, Science Publication, Taylor & Francis, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Wiley online library, Inderscience and Google scholar. The search results (173 articles) were filtered according to a proposed framework, which resulted in ninety-one (91) relevant research articles. We reviewed the articles based on a proposed taxonomy (the year of publication, the AI algorithm and machine learning task adopted, the application area in EM, the train and test split of data, the error, and accuracy metrics used, the potential benefits).

Effective management requires data collection over large spatio-temporal scales, readily accessible and integrated information from monitoring, and tools to support decision-making. However, there are many roadblocks to achieving adequate and timely information on both the effectiveness, and long-term success of conservation efforts, including limited funding, inadequate sampling, and data processing bottlenecks. These factors can result in ineffective, or even detrimental, management decisions in already impacted ecosystems. An automated approach facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) provides conservation managers with a toolkit that can help alleviate a number of these issues by reducing the monitoring bottlenecks and long-term costs of monitoring. Automating the collection, transfer, and processing of data provides managers access to greater information, thereby facilitating timely and effective management. Incorporating automation and big data availability into a decision support system with a user-friendly interface also enables effective adaptive management. We summarise the current state of artificial intelligence and automation techniques used in marine science and use examples in other disciplines to identify existing and potentially transferable methods that can enable automated monitoring and improve predictive modelling capabilities to support decision making. We also discuss emerging technologies that are likely to be useful as research in computer science and associated technologies continues to develop and become more accessible. Our perspective highlights the potential of AI and big data analytics for supporting decision-making, but also points to important knowledge gaps in multiple areas of the automation processes. These current challenges should be prioritised in conservation research to move toward implementing AI and automation in conservation management for a more informed understanding of impacted ecosystems to result in successful outcomes for conservation managers. We conclude that the current research and emphasis on automated and AI assisted tools in several scientific disciplines may mean the future of monitoring and management in marine science is facilitated and improved by the implementation of automation.

Existing spatial interpolation methods have relatively low accuracy, and the resolution of available long-term gridded products of air temperature for China is coarse. Point observations from meteorological stations can provide long-term air temperature data series but cannot represent spatially continuous information. Here, we devised a method for spatial interpolation of air temperature data from meteorological stations based on powerful machine learning tools. First, to determine the optimal method for interpolation of air temperature data, we employed three machine learning models: random forest, support vector machine, and Gaussian process regression. A comparison of the mean absolute error, root mean square error, coefficient of determination, and residuals revealed that a Gaussian process regression had high accuracy and clearly outperformed the other two models regarding the interpolation of monthly maximum, minimum, and mean air temperatures. The machine learning methods were compared with three traditional methods used frequently for spatial interpolation: inverse distance weighting, ordinary kriging, and ANUSPLIN (Australian National University Spline). Results showed that the Gaussian process regression model had higher accuracy and greater robustness than the traditional methods regarding interpolation of monthly maximum, minimum, and mean air temperatures in each month. A comparison with the TerraClimate (Monthly Climate and Climatic Water Balance for Global Terrestrial Surfaces), FLDAS (Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System), and ERA5 (ECMWF, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, Climate Reanalysis) data sets revealed that the accuracy of the temperature data generated using the Gaussian process regression model was higher. Finally, using the Gaussian process regression method, we produced a long-term (January 1951 to December 2020) gridded monthly air temperature data set, with 1 km resolution and high accuracy for China, which we named GPRChinaTemp1km. The data set consists of three variables: monthly mean air temperature, monthly maximum air temperature, and monthly minimum air temperature. The obtained GPRChinaTemp1km data were used to analyse the spatiotemporal variations of air temperature using Theil-Sen median trend analysis in combination with the Mann-Kendall test. It was found that the monthly mean and minimum air temperatures across China were characterised by a significant trend of increase in each month, whereas monthly maximum air temperatures showed a more spatially heterogeneous pattern, with significant increase, non-significant increase, and non-significant decrease. The GPRChinaTemp1km data set is publicly available at 10.5281/zenodo.5112122 (He et al., 2021a) for monthly maximum air temperature, at 10.5281/zenodo.5111989 (He et al., 2021b) for monthly mean air temperature, and at 10.5281/zenodo.5112232 (He et al., 2021c) for monthly minimum air temperature. © 2022 Copernicus GmbH.

Based on the observationally constrained crop models, future changes in yield average and yield variability for the period 2080-2099 are investigated for the globe and top ten producing countries. Results show that the uncertainties of crop models for projecting future changes in yield average and yield variability can be largely reduced by 62% and 52% by the RF-based constraint, respectively, while only 4% and 16% of uncertainty reduction is achieved by traditional linear regression-based constraint. Compared to the raw simulations of future change in yield average (-5.13 ± 18.19%) and yield variability (-0.24 ± 1.47%), the constrained crop models project a much higher yield loss (-34.58 ± 6.93%) and an increase in yield variability (3.15 ± 0.71%) for the globe. Regionally, the constrained models show the largest increase in yield loss magnitude in Brazil, India and Indonesia. Our results suggest more agricultural risks under climate change than previously expected after observationally constraining crop models. The results obtained in this study point to the importance for observationally constraining process crop models for robust yield projections, and highlight the added value of using Machine Learning for reducing the associated uncertainties. © 2022 The Author(s).

This review focusses on the epistemic uncertainty associated with the use of crop models. It firstly identifies the main sources of uncertainties from the perspectives of crop model inputs, methods for estimating crop parameters, crop model structure/complexity/process scale, and the underpinning experimental datasets. Pathways for managing those uncertainties are identified and future research directions are discussed. The conclusion is that strengthening experimental studies on the effects of extreme temperatures including their interaction with enhanced atmospheric CO2 concentration on crop production and further improvement, evaluation, and inter-comparison of crop models based on new experimental datasets will contribute to the reduction of uncertainties in projected climate change impacts and evaluated adaptation options. It is envisaged that crop models will continue to serve as an important research tool in addressing climate change in the agricultural sector specifically and in general with respect to global food security. Therefore, this review will provide the agroclimate impact modelling community with information on the sources of uncertainties and the ways forward to tackle this critical issue. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Crop model structure; Crop model uncertainties; Experimental datasets; Impact and adaptation; Inputs; Parameterization","adaptive management; agrometeorology; climate change; climate effect; complexity; crop production; data set; environmental assessment; parameterization; stakeholder; uncertainty analysis; wheat",Article,Scopus

This paper explores the connections between AI and climate change research as a whole and its usefulness in climate change adaptation efforts in particular. Using a systematic review of the literature on applications of AI for climate change adaptation and a questionnaire survey of a multinational and interdisciplinary team of climate change researchers, this paper shows the various means via which AI can support research on climate change in diverse regions, and contribute to efforts towards climate change adaptation. The surveyed articles are classified under nine areas, e.g., Global/Earth Related; Water-related Issues and agriculture, 95% of which are related to adaptation. The areas that have attracted the most studies about AI applications are water-related management issues (38%). In terms of the survey results, the most robust agreements were noted concerning the capacity of digitisation and AI to strengthen governance practices and afford policy coherence in climate change.

However, in semi-arid regions, remotely sensed discrimination of tree species is difficult primarily due to the tree similarities, small and sparse canopy cover, but may also be due to overlapping woody canopies as well as seasonal leaf retention (deciduous versus evergreen) characteristics. Similar studies in different biomes have achieved low accuracies using coarse spatial resolution image data. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of multi-temporal, airborne hyperspectral imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) derived data for tree species classification in a semi-arid desert region. This study produces highly accurate classifications by combining multi-temporal fine spatial resolution hyperspectral and LiDAR data (~1 m) through a reproducible scripting and machine learning approach that can be applied to larger areas and similar datasets. Combining multi-temporal vegetation indices and canopy height models led to an overall accuracy of 95.28% and kappa of 94.17%. Five woody species were discriminated resulting in producer accuracies ranging from 86.12% to 98.38%. The influence of fusing spectral and structural information in a random forest classifier for tree identification is evident. Additionally, a multi-temporal dataset slightly increases classification accuracies over a single data collection.

To fill this knowledge gap, we created a systems understanding of agroecosystem N dynamics and quantified the impact of controllable (management) and uncontrollable (weather, climate) factors on N fluxes and soybean yields. We performed a simulation experiment across 10 soybean production environments in the United States using the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model and future climate projections from five global circulation models. Climate change (2020–2080) increased N mineralization (24%) and N2O emissions (19%) but decreased N fixation (32%), seed N (20%), and yields (19%). Soil and crop management practices altered N fluxes at a similar magnitude as climate change but in many different directions, revealing opportunities to improve soybean systems’ performance. Among many practices explored, we identified two solutions with great potential: improved residue management (short-term) and water management (long-term). Inter-annual weather variability and management practices affected soybean yield less than N fluxes, which creates opportunities to manage N fluxes without compromising yields, especially in regions with adequate to excess soil moisture. This work provides actionable results (tradeoffs, synergies, directions) to inform decision-making for adapting crop management in a changing climate to improve soybean production systems.

Accurately estimating phenotyping traits of breeding maize at plot scale helps to promote gene mining for specific traits and provides a guarantee for accelerating the breeding of superior varieties. Constructing an efficient and accurate estimation model is the key to the application of UAV-based multiple sensors data. This study aims to apply the ensemble learning model to improve the feasibility and accuracy of estimating maize phenotypic traits using UAV-based red-green-blue (RGB) and multispectral sensors. The UAV images of four growth stages were obtained, respectively. The reflectance of visible light bands, canopy coverage, plant height (PH), and texture information were extracted from RGB images, and the vegetation indices were calculated from multispectral images. We compared and analyzed the estimation accuracy of single-type feature and multiple features for LAI (leaf area index), fresh weight (FW), and dry weight (DW) of maize. The basic models included ridge regression (RR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Gaussian process (GP), and K-neighbor network (K-NN). The ensemble learning models included stacking and Bayesian model averaging (BMA). The results showed that the ensemble learning model improved the accuracy and stability of maize phenotypic traits estimation. Among the features extracted from UAV RGB images, the highest accuracy was obtained by the combination of spectrum, structure, and texture features. The model had the best accuracy constructed using all features of two sensors. The estimation accuracies of ensemble learning models, including stacking and BMA, were higher than those of the basic models. The coefficient of determination (R2) of the optimal validation results were 0.852, 0.888, and 0.929 for LAI, FW, and DW, respectively. Therefore, the combination of UAV-based multisource data and ensemble learning model could accurately estimate phenotyping traits of breeding maize at plot scale.

Agricultural modernization will be made possible by the Internet of Things (IoT), a technology with a great promise for revolutionizing the industry. Agricultural products will be in high demand by 2050 due to a 30% increase in the global population, so there is a need to devise new mechanisms for agriculture, and smart agriculture is one of those mechanisms; however, smart agriculture needs to be explored further to realize its potential fully. So, to explore the potential of this field, the researchers have used a corpus that is extracted from the Scopus database from the year 2008 to the year 2022 and applied the LDA technique. A corpus of 4309 articles was selected from the Scopus database to apply the latent Dirichlet analysis (LDA) model to predict research areas for smart agriculture. Using IoT technology, farmers and producers may better manage their resources, such as fertilizer consumption and the number of trips made by farm vehicles, while minimizing waste and maximizing productivity, including water, electricity, and other inputs. This data-driven experimental study identifies smart agriculture research trends by implementing a topic modeling technique previously used in smart agriculture. The authors have created seventeen research themes in smart agriculture based on the LDA topic modeling.

To provide comprehensive insights into the complexity of plant biological systems, it is important to integrate different omics datasets. Although recent advances in computational analytical pipelines have enabled efficient and high-quality exploration and exploitation of single omics data, the integration of multidimensional, heterogenous, and large datasets (i.e., multi-omics) remains a challenge. In this regard, machine learning (ML) offers promising approaches to integrate large datasets and to recognize fine-grained patterns and relationships. Nevertheless, they require rigorous optimizations to process multi-omics-derived datasets. In this review, we discuss the main concepts of machine learning as well as the key challenges and solutions related to the big data derived from plant system biology. We also provide in-depth insight into the principles of data integration using ML, as well as challenges and opportunities in different contexts including multi-omics, single-cell omics, protein function, and protein–protein interaction.

Growing interest in food traceability has led to the development of a wide range of chemical, biomolecular, isotopic, chromatographic, and spectroscopic methods with varied performance and success rates. This review will give an update on the application of Traceability 4.0 in the fruits and vegetables sector, focusing on relevant Industry 4.0 enablers, especially Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, blockchain, and Big Data. The results show that the Traceability 4.0 has significant potential to improve quality and safety of many fruits and vegetables, enhance transparency, reduce the costs of food recalls, and decrease waste and loss. However, due to their high implementation costs and lack of adaptability to industrial environments, most of these advanced technologies have not yet gone beyond the laboratory scale. Therefore, further research is anticipated to overcome current limitations for large-scale applications. © 2022 The Authors","Artificial Intelligence; Authenticity; Big Data; Blockchain; Food fraud; Food quality; Industry 4.0; Internet of Things; Safety","Accident prevention; Artificial intelligence; Authentication; Big data; Blockchain; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Fruits; Internet of things; Spectroscopic analysis; Supply chains; Vegetables; Authenticity; Bio-molecular; Block-chain; Chemical method; Food authenticity; Food fraud; Food quality; Food traceabilitys; Fruit and vegetables; Industrial revolutions; Industry 4.0; article; artificial intelligence; big data; blockchain; food quality; fraud; fruit; internet of things; recall; vegetable; artificial intelligence; food safety; industry; Artificial Intelligence; Food Safety; Fruit; Industry; Vegetables",Article,Scopus

However, the expansion of plantations to supply international markets threatens biodiversity. Therefore, monitoring the plantations is important not only for the food industry but also for evaluating and mitigating environmental impacts of the industry. However, the detection of coconut trees from space is challenging because the palms' crowns hold only limited pixels of high-resolution optical imagery. Here, we present an accurate and real-time COCOnut tree DETection method (COCODET) which uses satellite imagery to detect individual palms, comprising three components. First, an Adaptive Feature Enhancement (AFE) module is designed to improve both the capacity of representation at the highest level of the feature map and feature representation ability and help distinguish between coconut trees and other vegetation. Secondly, we modify a region proposal network to produce a Tree-shape Region Proposal Network (T-RPN) for producing coconut tree candidates. Finally, we create a Cross Scale Fusion (CSF) module for integrating multi-scale information to improve small tree detection; this fuses features of coconut crowns from different levels, connecting shallow and deep-level semantic features. We applied COCODET to detect coconut trees in four remote atolls from the Acteon Group in French Polynesia. The natural habitats on the islands were previously cleared for coconut plantations, many of which have since been abandoned. COCODET achieved an average F1 score of 86.5% using its real-time inference process, considerably outperforming other cutting-edge object detection algorithms (4.3 ∼ 12.0% more accurate). We detected 688 ha of coconuts and 182 ha of natural habitat on the islands, and within the coconut groves we detected 120,237 individuals. Our analyses indicate that deep learning approaches can be successfully applied to coconut palm detection, aiding efforts to understand human impacts on natural ecosystems and biodiversity. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Coconut palm; Deep learning; High-resolution satellite images; Individual tree detection; The Acteon Group","Deep learning; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Inference engines; International trade; Object detection; Palmprint recognition; Satellite imagery; Semantics; Coconut palm; Coconut trees; Deep learning; High resolution satellite imagery; High resolution satellite images; Individual tree detections; Natural habitat; Pacific ocean; The acteon group; Tree detections; Biodiversity; atoll; detection method; evergreen tree; food industry; machine learning; satellite imagery; French Polynesia",Article,Scopus

Recently, machine learning (ML) models have received increasing attention for GESM due to their vast capabilities. In this context, this paper sought to review the modeling procedure of GESM using ML models, including the required datasets and model development and validation. The results showed that elevation, slope, plan curvature, rainfall and land use/cover were the most important factors for GESM. It is also concluded that although ML models predict the locations of zones prone to gullying reasonably well, performance ranking of such methods is difficult because they yield different results based on the quality of the training dataset, the structure of the models, and the performance indicators. Among the ML techniques, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) are the most widely used models for GESM, which show promising results. Overall, to improve the prediction performance of ML models, the use of data-mining techniques to improve the quality of the dataset and of an ensemble estimation approach is recommended. Furthermore, evaluation of ML models for the prediction of other types of gully erosion, such as rill–interill and ephemeral gully should be the subject of more studies in the future. The employment of a combination of topographic indices and ML models is recommended for the accurate extraction of gully trajectories that are the main input of some process-based models. © 2022 by the authors.","gully erosion susceptibility mapping (GESM); machine learning; random forest; support vector machine",,Review,Scopus

Bibliometrics is a useful method of analyzing scientific literature that has been widely used in many disciplines; however, it has not yet been applied to comprehensively analyze NDVI research. Therefore, we used bibliometrics and scientific mapping methods to analyze citation data retrieved from the Web of Science during 1985–2021 with NDVI as the topic. According to the analysis results, the amount of NDVI research increased exponentially during the study period, and the related research fields became increasingly varied. Moreover, a greater number of satellite and aerial remote sensing platforms resulted in more diverse NDVI data sources.

Calculation of crop N uptake and offtake requires estimates of yield of crop product (e.g. grain or beans) and crop residues (e.g. straw or stover) and the N concentration of both components. Yields of crop products are often reasonably well known, but those of crop residues are not. While the harvest index (HI) can be used to interpolate the quantity of crop residue from available data on crop product yields, harvest indices are known to vary across locations, as do N concentrations of residues and crop products. The increasing availability of crop data and advanced statistical and machine learning methods present us with an opportunity to move towards more locally relevant estimates of crop harvest index and N concentrations using more readily available data. The aim of this study was to investigate whether improved estimates of maize crop HI and N concentrations of crop products and crop residues can be based on crop data available at the global scale, such as crop yield, fertilizer application rates and estimates of yield potential. Experiments from 1487 different locations conducted across 31 countries were used to test various prediction models. Predictions from mixed-effects models and random forest machine learning models provided reasonable levels of prediction accuracy (R2 of between 0.33 and 0.68), with the random forest method having greater accuracy. Although the mixed-effects prediction models had lower prediction accuracy than random forest, they did provide better interpretability. Selection of which method to use will depend on the objective of the user. Here, the random forest and mixed-effects methods were applied to N in maize, but could equally be applied to other crops and other nutrients, if data becomes available. This will enable obtaining more locally relevant estimates of crop nutrient offtake to improve estimates of nutrient balances and nutrient use efficiency at national, regional or global levels, as part of strategies towards more sustainable nutrient management. © 2022 The Authors","Budget; Harvest index; Maize; Mixed-effect model; Nutrient; Nutrient removal; Nutrient use efficiency; Random forest","crop residue; fertilizer application; machine learning; nitrogen; nutrient use efficiency",Article,Scopus

The number of cases is increasing at a high pace each year that subsequently leads to the advancement in different diagnosis tools and technologies to handle this pandemic. Significant increase in the mortality rate worldwide leads tremendous scope to device and implement latest computer aided diagnostic systems for its early detection. The one among such techniques is machine learning coupled with medical imaging modalities. This combination has proven to be efficient in diagnosing various medical conditions in cancer diagnosis. Current study presents a review of different machine learning techniques applied on imaging modalities for cancer diagnosis from 2008 to 2019. This study focuses on diagnosis of five most prevalent and deadly cancers i.e., cervical cancer, oral cancer, breast cancer, brain cancer and skin cancer. Extensive and exhaustive review was carried out after going through different research papers, research articles and book chapters published by reputed international and national publishers such as Springer Link, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore Digital library and PubMed. A number of conference proceedings have also been included subject to the fulfilling of our quality evaluation criteria. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of machine learning approaches using image modalities for cancer detection and diagnosis with main focus on challenges being faced during their research. Majority of the challenges are identified based on the use of potential machine learning based approaches, image modalities, features and evaluation metrics. This review not only identified challenges but also ear mark and present the new research opportunities for researchers working in this field. It has been widely observed that traditional machine learning algorithms Like SVM, GMM performed excellent in classification whereas the deep learning has dominated the field of medical image analysis to a greater extent. It is evident from the literature survey that the researchers have achieved the accuracies of 100% in classification of cancerous and normal tissue images using different machine learning techniques. This article will provide an insight to the researchers working in this domain to identify which machine learning technique work best on what type of data set, selection of features, various challenges and their proposed solutions in solving this complex problem.

Unfortunately, using traditional microbiological methods, most microorganisms remain unculturable. The emergence of metagenomics has resolved the challenge of capturing the entire microbial community in an environmental sample by enabling the analysis of whole genomes without requiring culturing. Metagenomics as a non-culture approach encompasses a greater amount of genetic information than traditional approaches. The plant root-associated microbial community is essential for plant growth and development, hence the interactions between microorganisms, soil, and plants is essential to understand and improve crop yields in rural and urban agriculture. Although some of these microorganisms are currently unculturable in the laboratory, metagenomic techniques may nevertheless be used to identify the microorganisms and their functional traits. A detailed understanding of these organisms and their interactions should facilitate an improvement of plant growth and sustainable crop production in soil and soilless agriculture. Therefore, the objective of this review is to provide insights into metagenomic techniques to study plant root-associated microbiota and microbial ecology. In addition, the different DNA-based techniques and their role in elaborating plant microbiomes are discussed. As an understanding of these microorganisms and their biotechnological potentials are unlocked through metagenomics, they can be used to develop new, useful and unique bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides that are not harmful to the environment.

In this work, we investigate the fusion of multiple probability density functions (pdfs) of a continuous random variable or vector. Although the case of continuous random variables and the problem of pdf fusion frequently arise in multisensor signal processing, statistical inference, and machine learning, a universally accepted method for pdf fusion does not exist. The diversity of approaches, perspectives, and solutions related to pdf fusion motivates a unified presentation of the theory and methodology of the field. We discuss three different approaches to fusing pdfs. In the axiomatic approach, the fusion rule is defined indirectly by a set of properties (axioms). In the optimization approach, it is the result of minimizing an objective function that involves an information-theoretic divergence or a distance measure. In the supra-Bayesian approach, the fusion center interprets the pdfs to be fused as random observations. Our work is partly a survey, reviewing in a structured and coherent fashion many of the concepts and methods that have been developed in the literature.

However, the degree to which incoming solar radiation and the structure of the canopy rather than leaf physiology contribute to SIF variations is still not well characterized. Therefore, we investigated relationships between SIF and variables that at least partly capture the canopy structure component of SIF. For this, we relied on high-quality SIF observations from ground-based instruments, high-resolution airborne SIF imagery and the most recent satellite SIF products to cover large ranges in spatial and temporal resolution and diverse ecosystems. We found that the canopy structure-related near-infrared reflectance of vegetation multiplied by incoming sunlight (NIRVP) is a robust proxy for far-red SIF across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Our findings indicate that contributions from leaf physiology to SIF variability are small compared to the structure and radiation components. Also, NIRVP captured spatio-temporal patterns of canopy photosynthesis better than SIF, which seems to be mostly due to the greater retrieval noise of SIF. Compared to other relevant structural SIF proxies, NIRVP showed more robust relationships to SIF, especially at the global scale. Our results highlight the promise of using widely available NIRVP data for vegetation monitoring and also indicate the potential of using SIF and NIRVP in combination to extract physiological information from SIF. © 2021 The Authors","GPP; Gross primary productivity; Near-infrared reflectance of vegetation; NIRv; Photosynthesis; Remote sensing; SIF; Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence","Chlorophyll; Fluorescence; Infrared devices; Photosynthesis; Physiology; Reflection; Satellite imagery; Vegetation; Chlorophyll fluorescence; GPP; Gross primary productivity; Near infra-red reflectances; Near infrared reflectance; Near-infrared reflectance of vegetation; NIRv; Remote-sensing; Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Remote sensing; chlorophyll; ecophysiology; fluorescence; photosynthesis; physiology; satellite imagery; solar radiation",Article,Scopus

In order to meet a variety of demands, suitable cultivars and innovative breeding methods need to be developed. Breeding methods have changed over time following the advance of genetics. With the advent of new sequencing technology in the early 21st century, predictive breeding, such as genomic selection (GS), emerged when large-scale genomic information became available. GS shows good predictive ability for the selection of individuals with traits of interest even for quantitative traits by using various types of the whole genome-scanning markers, breaking away from the limitations of marker-assisted selection (MAS). In the current review, we briefly describe the history of breeding techniques, each breeding method, various statistical models applied to GS and methods to increase the GS efficiency. Consequently, we intend to propose and define the term digital breeding through this review article. Digital breeding is to develop a predictive breeding methods such as GS at a higher level, aiming to minimize human intervention by automatically proceeding breeding design, propagating breeding populations, and to make selections in consideration of various environments, climates, and topography during the breeding process. We also classified the phases of digital breeding based on the technologies and methods applied to each phase.

Here, we propose a simple framework to combine SIF and NIRvP data from different data sources to generate an enhanced SIF product (eSIF). The original SIF data comes from the TROPOMI instrument onboard the Sentinel-5P mission, whereas NIRvP data are derived from MODIS spectral reflectance and ERA5 reanalysis data. The resulting eSIF product has a spatial resolution of 0.05° and a temporal resolution of 8 days, as well as a higher signal-to-noise ratio and a lower angular dependency than the original TROPOMI SIF data. Our results demonstrate that eSIF has similar spatial patterns to the original SIF but is more spatially continuous and less noisy. Comparisons with the FLUXCOM global GPP product show that eSIF has a more universal relationship with GPP than NIRvP for different grass/crop plant functional types (the coefficients of variation are 18.9% for slopes of GPP to eSIF and 27.3% for slopes of GPP to NIRvP), but NIRvP outperforms eSIF for tracking GPP for forest PFTs exclude BoENF. Moreover, eSIF is able to better track the seasonal variations in GPP related to environmental stresses. This study highlights that our methodology based on the combination of SIF and NIRvP is a promising approach for better monitoring of GPP. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Gross primary productivity (GPP); Multi-source data combination; Near-infrared radiation reflected by vegetation (NIRvP); Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF)","Chlorophyll; Fluorescence; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Signal to noise ratio; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Data combination; Gross primary productivity; Multi-source data combination; Multisource data; Near-infrared radiation reflected by vegetation (NIRvP); Near-infrared radiations; Simple approach; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Vegetation; canopy; data quality; fluorescence; MODIS; primary production",Article,Scopus

Studies conducted at tree or plot scales on the supply of ecosystem services (ES) suggest that agroforestry practices are a promising way to build multifunctional agricultural landscapes. However, the current characterization and understanding of how multiple ES are associated across such heterogeneous agricultural landscapes are still limited. This study provides the first characterization of the multiple ESs supplied by a Sahelian Faidherbia albida agroforestry parkland and their relationships. Relying on field data for 11 ES indicators, recent advances in remote sensing-derived information, and blending different ES mapping approaches, we first assessed the spatial heterogeneity of the supply of each ES. We found that the majority of ES indicators remained below ES potential values over the study area by 25 % to 50 %, revealing that there is a considerable scope for increasing the ES supply in the F. albida parkland. Then, using a scoring approach, we analyzed the supply of multiple ESs. We observed a large number of hotspots and a clear effect of the proximity of F. albida trees fostering the supply of multiple ESs in their vicinity. Finally, we mapped and analyzed the dominant relationships – trade-offs, synergies or losses – between ESs from a cooccurrence spatial approach. We showed that significant trade-offs and losses (58 % of the area) between ESs can exist in the F. albida parkland. Interestingly, we also showed that synergies occurred mainly up to 10 m from the F. albida trees, suggesting that synergies need to be increased beyond this threshold. By adopting an original ES valuation framework, we provided basic insights into ESs and their relationships. The different maps and information generated can support public debates and target new policies fostering the multifunctionality of F. albida parklands as well as in various other parklands of West Africa. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem services mapping; F. albida parkland; Remote sensing; Spatial co-occurrence; Synergies; Trade-offs","Blending; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Forestry; Remote sensing; Agricultural landscapes; Agroforestry; Co-occurrence; Ecosystem service mapping; Ecosystem services; F albidum parkland; Remote-sensing; Spatial co-occurrence; Synergy; Trade off; Mapping; agricultural land; agroforestry; ecosystem service; mapping method; remote sensing; spatial analysis; trade-off; agroforestry; article; ecosystem service; landscape; remote sensing; Senegal; Africa; agriculture; ecosystem; environmental protection; Senegal; Senegal; Africa, Western; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Senegal",Article,Scopus

Climate change projections for the near future (2017–2044), medium (2045–2072), and long-term (2073–2100) using a multi-model set average of fifteen regional climate models under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. Water availability, allocation, and demand for irrigation and hydropower generation were predicted using the coupled Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) hydrological models. New hydrological insights for the region: The projected annual average temperature increase range is 2.10–3.6 °C under RCP 4.5 emission scenarios while 2.7–4.8 °C under RCP 8.5. Under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 emissions scenarios, projected annual average precipitation declines ranged from 10.7–13.6 % and 11.1–13.8 %, respectively. Projected annual average declines in streamflow ranged from 7.0 % to 10.9 % under PCR 4.5 emissions scenarios, while 10.9–2.8 % under PCR 8.5. As a consequence, water shortages for irrigation may decrease by 15.5–25.4 % and hydroelectricity by 10.5–20.2 % during study periods. Due to the combined effect of climate change and rising water demand, the increase in water scarcity ranges from 7.9–30.6 %. The projected results showed that future water availability for irrigation and hydropower generation will decline in the future.

U.S. soybean yields, which comprise 32 % of the total soybeans planted in the world, continue to experience unprecedented grain loss due to the soybean cyst nematode (SCN) plant pathogen. SCN remains one of the primary disruptive pests despite the existence of advanced management techniques such as crop rotation and SCN-resistant varieties. SCN detection is a key step in managing this disease; however, early detection is challenging because soybeans do not show any above ground symptoms unless they are significantly damaged. Direct soil sampling remains the most common method for SCN detection, however, this method has several problems. For example, the threshold damage methods—adopted by most of the laboratories to make recommendations—is not reliable as it does not consider soil pH, N, P, and K values and relies solely on the egg count instead of assessment of the root infection. To overcome the challenges of manual soil sampling methods, deep learning and hyperspectral imaging are important current topics in precision agriculture for plant disease detection and have been proposed as cost-effective and efficient detection methods that can work at scale. We have reviewed more than 150 research papers focusing on soybean cyst nematodes with an emphasis on deep learning techniques for detection and management. First: we describe soybean vegetation and reproduction stages, SCN life cycles, and factors influencing this disease. Second: we highlight the impact of SCN on soybean yield loss and the challenges associated with its detection. Third: we describe direct sampling methods in which the soil samples are procured and analyzed to evaluate SCN egg counts. Fourth: we highlight the advantages and limitations of these direct methods, then review computer vision- and remote sensing-based detection methods: data collection using ground, aerial, and satellite approaches followed by a review of machine learning methods for image analysis-based soybean cyst nematode detection. We highlight the evaluation approaches and the advantages of overall detection workflow in high-performance and big data environments. Lastly, we discuss various management approaches, such as crop rotation, fertilization, SCN resistant varieties such as PI 88788, and SCN’s increasing resistance to these strategies. We review machine learning approaches for soybean crop yield forecasting as well as the influence of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers on SCN infestation reduction. We provide recommendations for soybean research using deep learning and hyperspectral imaging to accommodate the lack of the ground truth data and training and testing methodologies, such as data augmentation and transfer learning, to achieve a high level of detection accuracy while keeping costs as low as possible. © 2022, The Author(s).","Convolutional neural networks; Data augmentation; Deep learning; Heterodera glycines; Hyperspectral imaging; Machine learning; Multispectral imaging; Soybean; Soybean cyst nematode; Vegetation indices",,Review,Scopus

However, how physiological (ΦF, canopy SIF emission efficiency) and non-physiological (e.g., structure and illumination) dynamics regulate canopy SIF, and the coupling between SIF and gross primary production (GPP) under herbicide stress remains unclear. Here, we conducted continuous eddy covariance flux and far-red SIF measurements during the early stage of maize in an herbicide-resistant maize field, where herbicide exclusively affects weeds. We investigated the performance of SIF, GPP, and vegetation indices (VIs) in capturing herbicide stress and then explored the sensitivity of SIF to the effects of herbicide treatments by disentangling canopy SIF into the physiological (ΦF) and non-physiological components (NIRvP). We found that SIF rapidly increased in response to the herbicide and that GPP decreased, and that both were more responsive than VIs in capturing the early effects of herbicides. Thus, the opposing responses in SIF and GPP disrupted their otherwise linear relationship during herbicide treatment. More importantly, we found that the increased ΦF dominated the variation of SIF during the early stages of herbicide stress, while the influence of NIRvP was prominent in the variability of SIF in the absence of herbicide. By unraveling its physiological and non-physiological contributions, our findings advance our understanding of how SIF responds to herbicide stress in heterogeneous cropland and will improve our interpretation of SIF as a tool for monitoring photosynthesis. © 2022","Canopy SIF emission efficiency (ΦF); Gross primary production (GPP); Herbicides; NIRvP; Photosynthesis; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF)","fluorescence; herbicide; photosynthesis; physiological phenomena; primary production",Article,Scopus

This may prohibit the acceleration of development efforts and, consequently, may result in delays in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) set for 2030. Taking this concern as a starting point, this paper provides the results of a survey on the status of analytics research in developing countries. Through a thorough review and classification of 142 articles published during 2009–2019, we characterize analytics in developing countries along three dimensions. First, we explore the mainstream methodologies appearing in the literature, which range from classic optimization techniques to more recent statistical and machine learning methods. Second, we identify 11 application areas that cover a broad range. Third, we focus on the linkages between the reviewed papers and the 17 UNSDGs.

Despite these challenges, as technologies evolve and prices drop, a surge of new data are being collected. Although a wealth of data are being collected at different scales (i.e., proximal, aerial, satellite, ancillary data), this has been geographically unequal, causing certain areas to be virtually devoid of useful data to help face their specific challenges. However, even in areas with available resources and good infrastructure, data and knowledge gaps are still prevalent, because agricultural environments are mostly uncontrolled and there are vast numbers of factors that need to be taken into account and properly measured for a full characterization of a given area. As a result, data from a single sensor type are frequently unable to provide unambiguous answers, even with very effective algorithms, and even if the problem at hand is well defined and limited in scope. Fusing the information contained in different sensors and in data from different types is one possible solution that has been explored for some decades. The idea behind data fusion involves exploring complementarities and synergies of different kinds of data in order to extract more reliable and useful information about the areas being analyzed. While some success has been achieved, there are still many challenges that prevent a more widespread adoption of this type of approach. This is particularly true for the highly complex environments found in agricultural areas. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview on the data fusion applied to agricultural problems; we present the main successes, highlight the main challenges that remain, and suggest possible directions for future research. © 2022 by the author.

The application of ANN to food process engineering is relatively novel. ANN had been employed in diverse applications like food safety and quality analyses, food image analysis, and modeling of various thermal and non-thermal food-processing operations. ANN has the ability to map nonlinear relationships without any prior knowledge and predicts responses even with incomplete information. Every neural network possesses data in the form of connection weights interconnecting lines between the input to hidden layer neurons and weights of hidden to output layer neurons, which has a significant role in predicting the output data. The applications of ANN in different unit operations in food processing were described that includes theoretical developments using intelligent characteristics for adaptability, automatic learning, classification, and prediction. The parallel architecture of ANN resulted in a fast response and low computational time making it suitable for application in real-time systems of different food process operations. The predicted responses obtained by the ANN model exhibited high accuracy due to lower relative deviation and root mean squared error and higher correlation coefficient. This paper presented the various applications of ANN for modeling nonlinear food engineering problems. The application of ANN in the modeling of the processes such as extraction, extrusion, drying, filtration, canning, fermentation, baking, dairy processing, and quality evaluation was reviewed.

However, little is known on the effects of combined change in temperature, CO2 concentration, and extreme events on barley grain quality and how capable are the current process-based crop models capture the signal of climate change on quality traits. Here in this review, we initially explored the response of quality traits of barley to heat, drought, and CO2 concentration from experiential studies. Next, we reviewed the state of the art of some of the current modeling approaches to capture grain quality. Lastly, we suggested possible opportunities to improve current models for tracking the detailed quality traits of barley. Heat and drought stress increase the protein concentration which has a negative effect on malting quality. The rise of CO2 concentration significantly reduces the grain protein, again resulting in a decline of the malting and brewing quality since the nitrogen concentration of grains needs to be kept at a specific level. The current crop models that simulate barley grain quality are limited to simulation of grain nitrogen concentration, size, and number in response to climate extremes and CO2. Nevertheless, crop models fail to account for the complex interactions between the conflicting effects of rising temperatures and droughts as well as increasing CO2 concentrations on grain protein. They have mainly adapted wheat models that cannot capture barley's protein composition and whole grain malting quality. Implementation of experiments from gene to canopy scales which are explicitly designed to detect the interactions among environmental variables on detailed quality traits and couple the remote sensing plus data-driven approaches to crop models are possible opportunities to improve modeling of barley grain quality. The development of modeling routines can capture the detailed grain quality provide valuable tools for forming climate adaptive strategies. Equally important, they can guide breeding programs to develop climate-resilient but high-quality barley genotypes. © 2022 The Authors","Barley; Climate warming; Extreme events; Process-bases modeling; Quality traits","agricultural modeling; barley; climate change; drought stress; extreme event; remote sensing",Review,Scopus

Mathematical models are crucial for strategic and forecasting applications; however, models related to the banana crop are less common, and reviews on previous modelling efforts are scarce, emphasizing the need for evidence-based studies on this topic. Therefore, we reviewed 75 full-text articles published between 1985 and 2021 for information on mathematical models related to banana growth and, fruit and fibre yield. We analysed results in order to provide a descriptive synthesis of selected studies. According to the co-occurrence analysis, most studies were conducted on the mathematical modelling of banana fruit production. Modellers often used multiple linear regression models to estimate banana plant growth and fruit yield. Existing models incorporate a range of predictor variables, growth conditions, varieties, modelling approaches and evaluation methods, which limits comparative evaluation and selection of the best model. However, the banana process-based simulation model 'SIMBA' and artificial neural network have proven their robust applicability to estimate banana plant growth. This review shows that there is insufficient information on mathematical models related to banana fibre yield. This review could aid stakeholders in identifying the strengths and limitations of existing models, as well as providing insight on how to build novel and reliable banana crop-related mathematical models.

Today, New Zealand and other nations need integrated modelling tools at the national scale to help industries and stakeholders plan for future disruptive changes. In this paper, following a scoping review process, we analyse modelling approaches and available agricultural systems’ model examples per thematic applications at the regional to national scale to define the best options for the national policy development. Each modelling approach has specificities, such as stakeholder engagement capacity, complex systems reproduction, predictive or prospective scenario testing, and users should consider coupling approaches for greater added value.

Taking a case of a multifunctional landscape in the central HKH region, we aimed to assess the biophysical production possibilities of major ES, their relationships and co-occurrence, and dynamic interactions at different spatial scales. We quantified and mapped six major ES (crop production, timber production, carbon sequestration, soil conservation, water yield, and habitat quality) at two spatial scales: landscape level (functional unit) and watershed level (management unit). Further, we analysed the relationship and interactions among all the possible pairs of the considered ES. All six ES were found to have a positive correlation, except crop production which showed a significant negative correlation with soil conservation. Moreover, we delineated 186 watersheds in the landscape and clustered them based on their biophysical potentials for the supply of ES. Gap statistics from K-means clustering identified three main clusters of watersheds (i.e., agriculture-dominated, poor-performing uplands, and multifunctional). The supply of ES from downstream watersheds was substantially higher than that of the upstream watersheds. We then discussed the interrelationships among ES at various spatial scales and suggested policy instruments for ecosystem management. The relationship among ES shows dynamic forms of spatial distribution, which need to be sustainably managed for minimizing trade-offs and maximizing synergies through the consideration of an integrated watershed management approach, improved agronomy practices, and global climate actions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Co-occurrence; Mapping and quantification; Multifunctional watersheds, mountain landscapes; Trade-offs in ecosystem services",,Article,Scopus

Deep learning is a type of machine learning method inspired by the structure of the human brain and based on artificial neural network concepts. Through training phases that can label a massive amount of data and connect them up with their corresponding characteristics, deep learning can conclude unlabeled data in image processing. For complicated and ambiguous situations, deep learning technology provides accurate predictions. This technology strives to improve productivity, quality and economy and minimize deficiency rates in the agriculture industry. As a result, this article discusses the application of image annotation in the agriculture industry utilizing several deep learning approaches. Various types of annotations that were used to train the images are presented. Recent publications have been reviewed on the basis of their application of deep learning with current advancement technology. Plant recognition, disease detection, counting, classification and yield estimation are among the many advancements of deep learning architecture employed in many applications in agriculture that are thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, this review helps to assist researchers to gain a deeper understanding and future application of deep learning in agriculture. According to all of the articles, the deep learning technique has successfully created significant accuracy and prediction in the model utilized. Finally, the existing challenges and future promises of deep learning in agriculture are discussed. © 2022 by the authors.","agriculture; classification; counting; deep learning; disease detection; image annotation; plant recognition; yield estimation",,Review,Scopus

In total, 151 studies were identified and categorised. Seventy-six percent of N recommendation systems are empirical and based on spatialised vegetation indices (73% of them); 21% are based on mechanistic crop simulation models with limited use of spatialized data (26% of them); 3% are based on machine learning techniques with the integration of spatialised and non-spatialised data. Recommendation systems appeared worldwide in 2000; they were often applied in the exact location where calibration had been carried out. Thirty percent of the studies use advanced recommendation techniques, such as sensor/approach fusion (44%), algorithm add-ons (30%), estimation of environmental benefits (13%), and omme multi-objective decisions (13%). However, some limitations have been identified. For example, empirical systems need specific calibrations for each site, species, and sensor, rarely using soil, veg-etation, and weather data together, while mechanistic systems need large input data sets, often non-spatialised. We conclude that N recommendation systems can be improved by better data and the integration of algorithms. l use only. © the Author(s), 2022.","data fusion; empirical models; Fertilisation; fertiliser amount; mechanistic models; sensors","algorithm; calibration; fertilization (reproduction); machine learning; precision agriculture; vegetation",Article,Scopus

Of late, biochar has turned out to be the most promising option to address these issues. The present review takes stock of the research work accrued under varied agro-pedological conditions, highlighting the response of biochar in a soil-plant-environment continuum. The properties of biochar depended hugely on the source of feedstock and pyrolysis conditions, with its uniqueness resting with high specific surface area and stable carbon source, pre-disposing to better soil health associated crop responses. However, the current biochar recommendations for different crops are high, unless evaluated in combination with fertilizers or organic manures to address both short-term and long-term benefits through soil carbon mediated nutrient supply chain for sustainable crop performance. The role of biochar in scavenging the soil pollutants and pesticide residues, and reducing the emission of greenhouse gases has perched this carbon source with an added advantage over other conventionally used carbon sources.

Quantifying these benefits is challenging in agroforestry systems, largely due to landscape complexity and the diversity of management approaches. Digital tools designed for agroforestry typically focus on timber and crop production, and not the broader range of benefits usually considered in assessments of ecosystem services and natural capital. The objectives of this review were to identify and evaluate digital tools that quantify natural capital benefits across eight themes applicable to agroforestry systems: timber production and carbon sequestration, agricultural production, microclimate, air quality, water management, biodiversity, pollination, and amenity. We identified and evaluated 63 tools, 9 of which were assessed in further detail using Australia as a case study. No single tool was best suited to quantify benefits across each theme, suggesting that multiple tools or models could be combined to address capability gaps. We find that model complexity, incorporation of spatial processes, accessibility, regional applicability, development speed and interoperability present significant challenges for the tools that were evaluated. We recommend that these challenges be considered as opportunities to develop new, and build upon existing, tools to enhance decision support in agroforestry systems. © 2022 by the authors.","agroforestry; decision support tools; ecosystem services; natural capital benefits; nature-based solutions",,Review,Scopus

The driving mechanisms of drought operate on a wide range of spatial scales, from the movement of soil water on a hillslope to global atmospheric circulation. Additionally, drought impacts vary across spatial scales, from drought induced crop stress on a specific agricultural field to widespread continental water shortages. As a result, multiscalar drought monitoring and early warning systems are needed to utilize observational data sets obtained at different spatial scales and to communicate drought impacts to various levels of decision-makers in government and industry. However, scaling must be employed to translate information across scales, either to fix incongruencies in the spatial scale of input data sets or to modify the model output scale. These scaling techniques have several challenges and limitations that hinder drought accuracy and interpretability, such as the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) and increased model uncertainty. This paper reviews the role of spatial scale in drought monitoring and early warning systems, the associated challenges, and techniques to minimize their impact.

The impact of bias-correction on the historical (1980–2005) period, the inter-variable relationships, and the measures of spatio-temporal consistency are investigated. The focus is on the discrepancies between the original and the bias-corrected results over five agro-ecological zones.

Results show that MBCn successfully corrects the seasonal biases in spatial patterns and intensities for all variables, their intervariable correlation, and the distributions of most of the analyzed variables. Relatively large bias reductions during the historical period give indication of possible benefits of MBCn when applied to future scenarios.

To date, limited field scale AFs models are available to simulate all possible ESS and BD together. We conducted an extensive systematic review of available agroforestry (AF), BD, and soil erosion models for the simulation potential of seven most desirable ESS in AFS. Simple to complex AF models have an inherent limitation of being objective-specific. A few complex and dynamic AF models did not meet the recent interest and demands for the simulation of ESS under AFS. Further, many ESS modules especially soil erosion, GHGs emission, groundwater recharge, onsite water retention, nutrients and pesticide leaching, and BD are often missing in available AF models, while some existing soil erosion models can be used in combination with AF models. Likewise mechanistic and process-based BD diversity models are lacking or found limited simulation potential for ESS under AFS. However, further efforts of model development and improvement (integration and coupling) are needed for the better simulation of complex interactive processes belonging to ESS under AFS. There are different possibilities but a proficient modeling approach for better reliability, flexibility, and durability is to integrate and couple them into a process-based dynamic modular structure. Findings of the study further suggested that crop modeling frameworks (MFW) like SIMPLACE and APSIM could be potential ones for the integration and coupling of different suitable modeling approaches (AF, soil protection, GHGs emission, flood prevention, carbon sequestration, onsite water retention, ground recharge, nutrient leaching, and BD modules) in one platform for dynamic process based ESS estimation on daily basis at the field scale.

Research has been conducted to estimate crop biophysical parameters by destructive and non-destructive approaches. In particular, researchers have investigated the potential of various analytical methods to determine a range of crop parameters using remote sensing data and methods. To this end, they have investigated diverse sources of Earth observations, including radar and optical images with various spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions.

Remote sensing has gradually replaced traditional destructive methods such as field surveys and laboratory testing for crop N diagnosis. With the rapid advancement of remote sensing, a review on crop N monitoring is badly in need of better summary and discussion. The purpose of this study was to identify current research trends and key issues related to N monitoring. It begins with a comprehensive statistical analysis of the literature on remote sensing monitoring of N in rice and wheat over the past 20 years. The study then elucidates the physiological mechanisms and spectral response characteristics of remote sensing monitoring of canopy N. The following section summarizes the techniques and methods applied in remote sensing monitoring of canopy N from three aspects: remote sensing platforms for N monitoring; correlation between remotely sensed data and N status; and the retrieval methods of N status. The influential factors of N retrieval were then discussed with detailed classification. However, there remain challenges and problems that need to be addressed in the future studies, including the fusion of multisource data from different platforms, and the uncertainty of canopy N inversion in the presence of background factors. The newly developed hybrid model integrates the flexibility of machine learning with the mechanism of physical models. It could be problem solving, which has the advantages of processing multi-source data and reducing the interference of confounding factors.

The emergence of high-density genome-wide markers has led to the development of two parallel series of approaches inspired by BLUP and MAS, which are collectively referred to as Genomic Selection (GS). The first series of GS methods alters pedigree-based BLUP by replacing pedigree-based kinship with marker-based kinship in a variety of ways, including weighting markers by their effects in genome-wide association study (GWAS), joining both pedigree-and marker-based kinship together in a single-step BLUP, and substituting individuals with groups in a compressed BLUP. The second series of GS methods estimates the effects for all genetic markers simultaneously. For the second series methods, the marker effects are summed together regardless of their individual signifi-cance. Instead of fitting individuals as random effects like in the BLUP se-ries, the second series fits markers as random effects. Differing assumptions regarding the underlying distribution of these marker effects has resulted in the development of many Bayesian-based GS methods. This review highlights critical concept developments for both of these series and explores ongoing GS developments in machine learning, multiple trait selection, and adaptation for hybrid breeding. Furthermore, considering the increasing use and variety of GS methods in plant breeding programs, this review addresses important concerns for future GS development and application, such as the use of GWAS-assisted GS, the long-term effectiveness of GS methods, and the valid assessment of prediction accuracy. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

However, precision navigation of agricultural robots is still a challenging issue due to the complex and unstructured nature of the agricultural environment. With the development of electronics and information technology, machine vision technology has become a promising tool for real-time and accurate navigation of agricultural robots. Due to low hardware cost and rich visual information, machine vision technology has been intensively studied and widely used in the field of autonomous navigation agricultural robots. Aiming at the special complexity of agricultural environment, this paper reviews the research advances of agricultural autonomous vehicle and robot navigation and guidance based on machine vision. A detailed summary of the development and characteristics of various vision sensors and systems is given. Key visual navigation information processing technologies such as filtering-based data computation, segmentation-based data computation and line-detection-based data computation for agricultural robots are discussed. Special attention is paid to the application of vision-based navigation technology for agricultural robots, i.e., environment perception and mapping, robot localization, and path planning.

Numerous vegetation indices (VIs) based on satellite data have participated in the construction of GPP models. However, the relative performance of various VIs in predicting GPP and what additional factors should be combined with them to reveal the photosynthetic capacity of vegetation mechanistically better are still poorly understood. We constructed two types of models (universal and plant functional type [PFT]-specific) for solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and Leaf Area Index (LAI) based on two widely used machine learning algorithms, i.e., the random forest (RF) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) algorithms. A total of thirty plant traits and environmental factors with legacy effects are considered in the model. We then systematically investigated the ancillary variables that best match each vegetation index in estimating global GPP. Four types of models (universal and PFT-specific, RF and BPNN) consistently show that SIF performs best when modeled using a single vegetation index (R2 = 0.67, RMSE = 2.24 g C·m−2·d−1); however, NIRv combined with CO2, plant traits, and climatic factors can achieve the highest prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 1.40 g C·m−2·d−1). Plant traits effectively enhance all prediction models’ accuracy, and climatic variables are essential factors in improving the accuracy of NIRv- or LAI-based GPP models, but not the accuracy of SIF-based models. Our findings provide valuable information for the configuration of the data-driven models to improve the accuracy of predicting GPP and provide insights into the physiological and ecological mechanisms underpinning GPP prediction. © 2022 by the authors.","gross primary productivity; leaf area index; machine learning; NIRv; solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence","Budget control; Carbon; Chlorophyll; Climate change; Ecosystems; Fluorescence; Forestry; Infrared devices; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Neural networks; Photosynthesis; Physiological models; Vegetation; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Environmental factors; Gross primary productivity; Leaf Area Index; Machine-learning; NIRv; Plant traits; Productivity model; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Vegetation index; Forecasting",Article,Scopus

Climate change-driven global warming can trigger higher insect pest pressures and plant diseases thus affecting crop production sternly. The traits controlling genes for stress or disease tolerance are economically imperative in crop plants. In this scenario, the extensive exploration of available wild, resistant or susceptible germplasms and unraveling the genetic diversity remains vital for breeding programs. The dawn of next-generation sequencing technologies and omics approaches has accelerated plant breeding by providing the genome sequences and transcriptomes of several plants. The availability of decoded plant genomes offers an opportunity at a glance to identify candidate genes, quantitative trait loci (QTLs), molecular markers, and genome-wide association studies that can potentially aid in high throughput marker-assisted breeding. In recent years genomics is coupled with marker-assisted breeding to unravel the mechanisms to harness better better crop yield and quality. In this review, we discuss the aspects of marker-assisted breeding and recent perspectives of breeding approaches in the era of genomics, bioinformatics, high-tech phonemics, genome editing, and new plant breeding technologies for crop improvement. In nutshell, the smart breeding toolkit in the post-genomics era can steadily help in developing climate-smart future food crops.

In terms of phenotyping, it is necessary to determined which selection traits are relevant in each situation, and which phenotyping tools/methods are available to assess such traits. Remote sensing methodologies are currently the most popular approaches, even when lab-based analyses are still relevant in many circumstances.

However, plant performance or phenotype (P) is determined by the combined effects of genotype (G), envirotype (E), and genotype by environment interaction (GEI). Phenotypes can be predicted more precisely by training a model using data collected from multiple sources, including spatiotemporal omics (genomics, phenomics, and enviromics across time and space). Integration of 3D information profiles (G-P-E), each with multidimensionality, provides predictive breeding with both tremendous opportunities and great challenges. Here, we first review innovative technologies for predictive breeding. We then evaluate multidimensional information profiles that can be integrated with a predictive breeding strategy, particularly envirotypic data, which have largely been neglected in data collection and are nearly untouched in model construction. We propose a smart breeding scheme, integrated genomic-enviromic prediction (iGEP), as an extension of genomic prediction, using integrated multiomics information, big data technology, and artificial intelligence (mainly focused on machine and deep learning). We discuss how to implement iGEP, including spatiotemporal models, environmental indices, factorial and spatiotemporal structure of plant breeding data, and cross-species prediction. A strategy is then proposed for prediction-based crop redesign at both the macro (individual, population, and species) and micro (gene, metabolism, and network) scales.

Wireless communication protocols constitute a critical part of smart agriculture systems because the fields, in general, cover a large area requiring system components to be placed at distant locations. There are various communication protocols with different features that can be utilized in smart agriculture applications. When designing a smart agriculture system, it is required to carefully consider the features of possible protocols to make a suitable and optimal selection. Therefore, this review paper aims to underline the specifications of the wireless communication protocols that are widely used in smart agriculture applications. Furthermore, application-specific requirements, which may be useful during the design stage of the smart agriculture systems, are highlighted. To accomplish these aims, this paper compares the technical properties and investigates the practical applications of five different wireless communication protocols that are commonly used in IoT applications: ZigBee, Wi-Fi, Sigfox, NB-IoT, and LoRaWAN. In particular, the inconsistencies in the technical properties of these protocols reported in different resources have been highlighted and the reason for this situation has been discussed. Considering the features offered by the protocols and the requirements of smart agriculture applications, the appropriateness of a particular protocol to a particular smart agriculture application is examined. In addition, issues about cost, communication quality, and hardware of the five protocols have been mentioned. The trending technologies with high potential for the future applications of smart agriculture have been introduced. In this context, the relation of the technologies like aerial systems, cellular communication, and big data analytics with wireless have been specified. Finally, the leading protocol and the smart agriculture application area have been highlighted through observing the year-based distribution of the recent publications.

The atmospheric CO2 growth rates would have been much larger if natural sinks in the land biosphere and ocean had not removed over half of this anthropogenic CO2. As these CO2 emissions grew, uptake by the ocean increased in response to increases in atmospheric CO2 partial pressure (pCO2). On land, gross primary production also increased, but the dynamics of other key aspects of the land carbon cycle varied regionally. Over the past three decades, CO2 uptake by intact tropical humid forests declined, but these changes are offset by increased uptake across mid- and high-latitudes. While there have been substantial improvements in our ability to study the carbon cycle, measurement and modeling gaps still limit our understanding of the processes driving its evolution. Continued ship-based observations combined with expanded deployments of autonomous platforms are needed to quantify ocean-atmosphere fluxes and interior ocean carbon storage on policy-relevant spatial and temporal scales. There is also an urgent need for more comprehensive measurements of stocks, fluxes and atmospheric CO2 in humid tropical forests and across the Arctic and boreal regions, which are experiencing rapid change.
