Towards this end many techniques came into existence. Data mining techniques are can be used towards precision agriculture. Numerous efforts have been made to exploit remote sensing data to build various indices for assessing productivity of crops. They include Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Crop yield prediction can help agriculture related departments and organizations to make strategic decisions. In this paper a novel framework named eXtensible Crop Yield Prediction Framework (XCYPF) is proposed that is flexible and extensible. It has provision for selection of crop, dependent and independent variables, datasets for crop yield prediction towards precision agriculture. The available indices are used along with rainfall data and surface temperature for crop yield prediction for rice and sugarcane crops. © 2015 IEEE.","Crop yield prediction; Data mining techniques; Precision agriculture; Spatial Data Mining","Atmospheric temperature; Crops; Data mining; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Crop yield; Extensible framework; Independent variables; Normalized difference vegetation index; Precision Agriculture; Spatial data mining; Temperature conditions; Vegetation condition indices; Agriculture",Conference Paper,Scopus

Soil classification is used to maintain and enhance its productivity, to avoid soil degradation and to overcome environmental damage. Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (Ripper) was used for crop yield prediction. Though the computational cost of this method is very much decreased, the accuracy is not much increased for prediction of crop yield. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was widely used technique for yield prediction of crop. But with a large number of hidden layers and nodes, the training time will increase and leads to over fitting of networks. Sometimes, it comes out with hardly interpretation results. Counter Propagation ANN (CP-ANN) was a technique which combining features of both supervised and unsupervised learning technique which effectively predicted the crop yield. However, the prediction accuracy of this method is still poor. In order to overcome the above problems and to improve the crop yield prediction accuracy, a Neupper rule based algorithm is proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithm combines ANN and Ripper classifier algorithms. The soil parameters such as phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sulphur (S), calcium (C), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) are given as input to ANN which returns weight of each soil parameter. Then, a decision tree is constructed based on weight values. After this, rules are generated based on the building and optimization stage of Ripper algorithm. The proposed Neupper rule based algorithm improves the accuracy of crop yield prediction by combining ANN and Ripper. Finally, the experiments are carried out in terms of accuracy, precision and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to prove the effectiveness of the proposed crop yield prediction method. © 2018 Authors.","Agriculture; Classification; Crop yield prediction; Feature selection",,Article,Scopus

Agriculture is a major source of economy of the country. It is also one of the country which suffer from major natural calamities like drought or flood which damages the crop. This leads to huge financial loss for the farmers thus leading to the suicide. Predicting the crop yield well in advance prior to its harvest can help the farmers and Government organizations to make appropriate planning like storing, selling, fixing minimum support price, importing/exporting etc. Predicting a crop well in advance requires a systematic study of huge data coming from various variables like soil quality, pH, EC, N, P, K etc. As Prediction of crop deals with large set of database thus making this prediction system a perfect candidate for application of data mining. Through data mining we extract the knowledge from the huge size of data. This paper presents the study about the various data mining techniques used for predicting the crop yield. The success of any crop yield prediction system heavily relies on how accurately the features have been extracted and how appropriately classifiers have been employed.

The need for an integrated crop growth control with accurate predictive yield management methodology is highly felt among farming community. The complexity of predicting the crop yield is highly due to multi dimensional variable metrics and unavailability of predictive modeling approach, which leads to loss in crop yield. This research paper suggests a crop yield prediction model (CRY) which works on an adaptive cluster approach over dynamically updated historical crop data set to predict the crop yield and improve the decision making in precision agriculture. CRY uses bee hive modeling approach to analyze and classify the crop based on crop growth pattern, yield. CRY classified dataset had been tested using Clementine over existing crop domain knowledge.

Its production is reliant on favorable climatic conditions. Improving the ability of farmers to predict crop productivity under different climatic scenarios, can assist farmers and other stakeholders in making important decisions in terms of agronomy and crop choice. This paper proposes a decision support system prototype for rice crop yield prediction for Maharashtra state, India. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been created in Java using NetBeans tool and Microsoft Office Access database for the ease of farmers and decision makers. The interface allows for the selection of the range of precipitation, minimum temperature, average temperature, maximum temperature and reference crop evapotranspiration and predicts the expected class of yield viz., low, moderate or high. The ranges of the parameters were calculated by using historic data from the study area. The classes for the yield were defined as low with 0.15 to 0.60 tonnes/hectare; moderate with 0.61 to 1.10 tonnes/hectare and high with 1.11 to 3.16 tonnes/hectare. The proposed prototype could be used for a bigger dataset and wider study area to predict the crop yield. This will provide a guide to the farmer to assist in decision making on potential crop yield for particular climatic scenario. © 2016 IEEE.","crop yield prediction; decision support systems; DSS; graphical user interface; prototype","Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Crops; Cultivation; Decision making; Food supply; Forecasting; Graphical user interfaces; Regional planning; User interfaces; Climatic conditions; Crop yield; Decision support system (dss); Graphical user interfaces (GUI); Maximum temperature; Minimum temperatures; prototype; Reference crop evapotranspirations; Decision support systems",Conference Paper,Scopus

Vegetation indices (VIs) sensitive to leaf area index (LAI), such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), have been widely used for crop yield prediction. However, chlorophyll content is the key component for crops to convert light energy to organics in the process of photosynthesis, and crop yield may be more accurately predicted by remote sensing models based on a spectral index sensitive to chlorophyll content, such as the medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS) Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI). In this study, we investigated the potential of MTCI for crop yield prediction. Firstly, the MTCI and the NDVI products in Henan Province, China, from 2003 to 2011 with a temporal resolution of half a month were calculated from the daily level-2 reduced resolution ENVISAT MERIS reflectance product (MER-RR-2P) using a Maximum Value Composite algorithm. Secondly, we established winter wheat prediction models based on MTCI and NDVI. Then, the accuracy of MTCI for winter wheat yield prediction was examined and compared to the NDVI through a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. The results show that (1) the correlation coefficient between yield and MTCI is significantly higher than that of models based on NDVI and the errors of models based on MTCI are lower than those of models based on NDVI except for milking stages. Moreover, the crop yield prediction model based on accumulated MTCI through the reviving stage to milking is most significantly correlated to crop yield with a coefficient of determination of 0.849 for MTCI; (2) the optimum phase for crop yield prediction based on MTCI is the heading stage, about 30 days earlier than that of NDVI (milking stage), which is another advantage of MTCI in crop yield prediction; and (3) the validation error of the crop yield model based on the accumulated MTCI is half of that based on the accumulated NDVI. The study indicates that MTCI is potentially a better VI for crop yield prediction compared to NDVI. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",,"Chlorophyll; Crops; Food supply; Forecasting; Remote sensing; Statistical methods; Vegetation; Chlorophyll contents; Correlation coefficient; Leave-one-out cross validations; Medium resolution imaging spectrometers; Normalized difference vegetation index; Remote sensing models; Temporal resolution; Winter wheat yields; Predictive analytics; bioaccumulation; chlorophyll; crop yield; food security; MERIS; NDVI; numerical model; prediction; remote sensing; resolution; China; Henan",Article,Scopus

However, their utility is limited by unrealistic time structure of daily rainfall and biases in rainfall frequency and intensity distributions. Crop growth is very sensitive to daily variations of rainfall; thus any mismatch in daily rainfall statistics could impact crop yield simulations. Here, we present an improved methodology to correct GCM rainfall biases and time structure mismatches for maize yield prediction in Katumani, Kenya. This includes GCM bias correction (BC), to correct over- or under-predictions of rainfall frequency and intensity, and nesting corrected GCM information with a stochastic weather generator, to generate daily rainfall realizations conditioned on a given monthly target. Bias-corrected daily GCM rainfall and generated rainfall realizations were used to evaluate crop response. Results showed that corrections of GCM rainfall frequency and intensity could improve crop yield prediction but yields remain under-predicted. This is strongly attributed to the time structure mismatch in daily GCM rainfall leading to excessively long dry spells. To address this, we tested several ways of improving daily structure of GCM rainfall. First, we tested calibrating thresholds in BC but were found not very effective for improving dry spell lengths. Second, we tested BC-stochastic disaggregation (BC-DisAg) and appeared to simulate more realistic dry spell lengths using bias-corrected GCM rainfall information (e.g., frequency, totals) as monthly targets. Using rainfall frequency alone to condition the weather generator removed biases in dry spell lengths, improved predicted yields, but under-predicted yield variability. Combining rainfall frequency and totals, however, not only produced more realistic yield variability but also corrected under-prediction of yields. We envisaged that the presented method would enhance the utility of daily GCM rainfall in crop yield prediction. © 2010 Royal Meteorological Society.","Bias correction; Crop models; GCM; Stochastic disaggregation; Weather generator","Bias correction; Crop models; GCM; Stochastic disaggregation; Weather generator; Climate models; Crops; Drought; Forecasting; Stochastic systems; Rain; climate modeling; computer simulation; correction; crop yield; global climate; maize; precipitation assessment; precipitation intensity; prediction; rainfall; stochasticity; Eastern Province [Kenya]; Katumani; Kenya; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The algorithm is based on existing crop yield models but has been modified to assimilate satellite derived global solar radiation and actual evaporation information. The algorithm simulates crop biomass. A statistical method is utilized to relate crop biomass to crop yield and to correct for regional differences in yields that are not the result of radiation or water limitation.

In particular, approaches that ignore this dependence suffer in their ability to capture (and predict) the underlying phenomena. By judiciously selecting biophysically based explanatory variables and using spatially-determined prior probability distributions, a Bayesian model for crop yield is created that not only allows for increased modelling flexibility but also for improved prediction over existing least-squares methods. The model is focused on providing efficient predictions which stabilize the effects of noisy data. Prior distributions are developed to accommodate the spatial non-stationarity arising from distinct between-region differences in agricultural policy and practice. In addition, a range of possible dimension-reduction schemes and basis expansions are examined in the pursuit of improved prediction. As a result, the model developed has improved prediction performance relative to existing models, and allows for straightforward interpretation of climatic effects on the model's output. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian; Canadian Prairies; Crop water stress index; Crop yield prediction; Smoothing; Spatial correlation","agricultural policy; agrometeorology; Bayesian analysis; biophysics; climate effect; crop yield; least squares method; prediction; smoothing; spatial distribution; stabilization; water stress; Canada",Article,Scopus

Many comparisons of ML methods for yield prediction have been made, seeking for the most accurate technique. Generally, the number of evaluated crops and techniques is too low and does not provide enough information for agricultural planning purposes. This paper compares the predictive accuracy of ML and linear regression techniques for crop yield prediction in ten crop datasets. Multiple linear regression, M5-Prime regression trees, perceptron multilayer neural networks, support vector regression and k-nearest neighbor methods were ranked. Four accuracy metrics were used to validate the models: the root mean square error (RMS), root relative square error (RRSE), normalized mean absolute error (MAE), and correlation factor (R). Real data of an irrigation zone of Mexico were used for building the models. Models were tested with samples of two consecutive years. The results show that M5- Prime and k-nearest neighbor techniques obtain the lowest average RMSE errors (5.14 and 4.91), the lowest RRSE errors (79.46% and 79.78%), the lowest average MAE errors (18.12% and 19.42%), and the highest average correlation factors (0.41 and 0.42).

Remote sensing (RS) systems are being more widely used in building decision support tools for contemporary farming systems to improve yield production and nitrogen management while reducing operating costs and environmental impact. However, RS based approaches require processing of enormous amounts of remotely sensed data from different platforms and, therefore, greater attention is currently being devoted to machine learning (ML) methods. This is due to the capability of machine learning based systems to process a large number of inputs and handle non-linear tasks. This paper discusses research developments conducted within the last 15 years on machine learning based techniques for accurate crop yield prediction and nitrogen status estimation. The paper concludes that the rapid advances in sensing technologies and ML techniques will provide cost-effective and comprehensive solutions for better crop and environment state estimation and decision making. More targeted application of the sensor platforms and ML techniques, the fusion of different sensor modalities and expert knowledge, and the development of hybrid systems combining different ML and signal processing techniques are all likely to be part of precision agriculture (PA) in the near future. © 2018","Decision making; Features extraction; Information fusion; Predictive modelling; Vegetation indices","Artificial intelligence; Cost effectiveness; Crops; Decision making; Decision support systems; Environmental impact; Hybrid systems; Information fusion; Nitrogen; Operating costs; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Signal processing; Decision support tools; Estimation and decisions; Features extraction; Machine learning approaches; Predictive modelling; Remotely sensed data; Signal processing technique; Vegetation index; Learning systems",Review,Scopus

Economical and rapid means of identifying spatial variability is obtained through the use of geotechnology (remotely sensed images of the crop field, image processing, GIS modeling approach, and GPS usage) and data mining techniques for model development. Higher-end image processing techniques are followed to establish more precision. The goal of this paper was to investigate the strength of key spectral vegetation indices for agricultural crop yield prediction using neural network techniques. Four widely used spectral indices were investigated in a study of irrigated corn crop yields in the Oakes Irrigation Test Area research site of North Dakota, USA. These indices were: (a) red and near-infrared (NIR) based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), (b) green and NIR based green vegetation index (GVI), (c) red and NIR based soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and (d) red and NIR based perpendicular vegetation index (PVI). These four indices were investigated for corn yield during 3 years (1998, 1999, and 2001) and for the pooled data of these 3 years. Initially, Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN) models were developed, including 16 models (4 indices * 4 years including the data from the pooled years) to test for the efficiency determination of those four vegetation indices in corn crop yield prediction. The corn yield was best predicted using BPNN models that used the means and standard deviations of PVI grid images. In all three years, it provided higher prediction accuracies, coefficient of determination (r2), and lower standard error of prediction than the models involving GVI, NDVI, and SAVI image information. The GVI, NDVI, and SAVI models for all three years provided average testing prediction accuracies of 24.26% to 94.85%, 19.36% to 95.04%, and 19.24% to 95.04%, respectively while the PVI models for all three years provided average testing prediction accuracies of 83.50% to 96.04%. The PVI pool model provided better average testing prediction accuracy of 94% with respect to other vegetation models, for which it ranged from 89-93%. Similarly, the PVI pool model provided coefficient of determination (r2) value of 0.45 as compared to 0.31-0.37 for other index models. Log10 data transformation technique was used to enhance the prediction ability of the PVI models of years 1998, 1999, and 2001 as it was chosen as the preferred index. Another model (Transformed PVI (Pool)) was developed using the log10 transformed PVI image information to show its global application. The transformed PVI models provided average corn yield prediction accuracies of 90%, 97%, and 98% for years 1998, 1999, and 2001, respectively. The pool PVI transformed model provided as average testing accuracy of 93% along with r2 value of 0.72 and standard error of prediction of 0.05 t/ha. © 2010 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International, Basel, Switzerland.","Back propagation neural network (BPNN); Data mining; Green vegetation index (GVI); Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); Perpendicular vegetation index (PVI); Soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI); Yield estimation","Back-propagation neural networks; Green vegetation index (GVI); Normalized difference vegetation index; Perpendicular vegetation index; Yield estimation; Backpropagation; Crops; Data mining; Forecasting; Image processing; Imaging systems; Infrared devices; Investments; Lakes; Metadata; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Standards; Vegetation",Article,Scopus

Recent developments in spatial information technologies enabled cost and energy saving in crop yield prediction. The aim of this paper was to predict yield of the three major crops and yield loss under soil salinity effect which is one of the most important limitation in many Mediterranean countries. Crop yields were estimated using vegetation indices and Stepwise Linear Regression (SLR) derived from Landsat (Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper) TM/ETM satellite images.

It contributes to 18% of India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and gives employment to 50% of the population of India. People of India are practicing Agriculture for years but the results are never satisfying due to various factors that affect the crop yield. To fulfill the needs of around 1.2 billion people, it is very important to have a good yield of crops. Due to factors like soil type, precipitation, seed quality, lack of technical facilities etc the crop yield is directly influenced. Hence, new technologies are necessary for satisfying the growing need and farmers must work smartly by opting new technologies rather than going for trivial methods. This paper focuses on implementing crop yield prediction system by using Data Mining techniques by doing analysis on agriculture dataset. Different classifiers are used namely J48, LWL, LAD Tree and IBK for prediction and then the performance of each is compared using WEKA tool. For evaluating performance Accuracy is used as one of the factors. The classifiers are further compared with the values of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Relative Absolute Error (RAE).

The sustainability and productivity of rice growing areas is dependent on suitable climatic conditions. Variability in seasonal climate conditions can have detrimental effect, with incidents of drought reducing production. Developing better techniques to predict crop productivity in different climatic conditions can assist farmer and other stakeholders in better decision making in terms of agronomy and crop choice. Machine learning techniques can be used to improve prediction of crop yield under different climatic scenarios. This paper presents the review on use of such machine learning technique for Indian rice cropping areas. This paper discusses the experimental results obtained by applying SMO classifier using the WEKA tool on the dataset of 27 districts of Maharashtra state, India. The dataset considered for the rice crop yield prediction was sourced from publicly available Indian Government records. The parameters considered for the study were precipitation, minimum temperature, average temperature, maximum temperature and reference crop evapotranspiration, area, production and yield for the Kharif season (June to November) for the years 1998 to 2002.

We evaluated a machine-learning method, Random Forests (RF), for its ability to predict crop yield responses to climate and biophysical variables at global and regional scales in wheat, maize, and potato in comparison with multiple linear regressions (MLR) serving as a benchmark. We used crop yield data from various sources and regions for model training and testing: 1) gridded global wheat grain yield, 2) maize grain yield from US counties over thirty years, and 3) potato tuber and maize silage yield from the northeastern seaboard region. RF was found highly capable of predicting crop yields and outperformed MLR benchmarks in all performance statistics that were compared. For example, the root mean square errors (RMSE) ranged between 6 and 14% of the average observed yield with RF models in all test cases whereas these values ranged from 14% to 49% for MLR models. Our results show that RF is an effective and versatile machine-learning method for crop yield predictions at regional and global scales for its high accuracy and precision, ease of use, and utility in data analysis.

Several parameters such as weather, pests, biophysical and physio morphological features merit their consideration while determining the yield. However, these parameters are uncertain in their nature, thus making the determined amount of yield to be approximate. It is exactly here that the fuzzy logic comes into play. This paper elaborates an attempt to develop fuzzy inference systems for crop yield prediction. Physio morphological features of Sorghum were considered. A huge database (around 1000 records) of physio morphological features such as days of 50 percent flowering, dead heart percentage, plant height, panicle length, panicle weight and number of primaries and the corresponding yield were considered for the development of the model. In order to find out the sensitivity of parameters, one-to-one, two-to-one and three-to-one combinations of input and output were considered. The results have clearly shown that panicle length contributes for the yield as the lone parameter with almost one-to-one matching between predicted yield and actual value while panicle length and panicle weight in combination seemed to play a decisive role in contributing for the yield with the prediction accuracy reflected by very low RMS value. © de Gruyter 2012.","Approximate Reasoning; Crop Yield; Fuzzy Logic; Fuzzy Rule Base; Membership Functions; Physio-Morphological Features","Agricultural activities; Approximate reasoning; Crop yield; Fuzzy inference systems; Fuzzy rule base; Input and outputs; Market requirements; Morphological features; Panicle length; Physio-Morphological Features; Plant height; Predicted yield; Prediction accuracy; Sensitivity of parameters; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy systems; Membership functions; Uncertainty analysis; Agriculture",Article,Scopus

A set of nine regional configurations with eight regional models from the ENSEMBLES project is evaluated. Although they are all based on similar large-scale conditions, the performances of regional models in reproducing the most crucial variables for crop production are extremely variable. This therefore leads to a large dispersion in crop yield prediction when using regional models in a climate/crop modelling system. This dispersion comes from the different physics in each regional model and also the choice of parametrizations for a single regional model. Indeed, two configurations of the same regional model are sometimes more distinct than two different regional models. Promising results are obtained when applying a bias correction technique to climate model outputs. Simulated yields with bias corrected climate variables show much more realistic means and standard deviations. However, such a bias correction technique is not able to improve the reproduction of the year-to-year variations of simulated yields. This study confirms the importance of the multi-model approach for quantifying uncertainties for impact studies and also stresses the benefits of combining both regional and statistical downscaling techniques.

Crop selection is influenced by many factors like the weather, nature of soil, market, etc. Weather and soil type are the major factors which affect the crop yield. Crop yield prediction helps the farmers in the selection of the crop for plantation. Crop yield can be accurately predicted by considering the parameters like nature of the soil, amount of rain, crop characteristics, etc. Methodology: There are couple of methods which can be used to predict crop yield. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) are two well-known prediction techniques. In this study prediction of the wheat crop yield is done by considering parameters like amount of rainfall, crop biomass, soil evaporation, transpiration, Extractable Soil Water (ESW) and amount of fertilizer applied (NO3). Default-Artificial Neural Networks (D-ANN) is a ANN with only one hidden layer. In this study Customized ANN (C-ANN) is developed by varying the number of hidden layers, number of neurons in the hidden layer and the Learning Rate (LR). Experiments are conducted to compare the C-ANN with MLR and D-ANN models on the same dataset using R2 statistic and percentage prediction error. Results: Results show that the C-ANN model performs better with a higher R2 statistic and a lower percentage prediction error than the MLR and D-ANN models on the test dataset. Conclusion: Prediction of crop yield is very important in the community of agriculture. In this study wheat yield was predicted by considering its different parameters. Better wheat yield was predicted by using C-ANN model. © 2016 K. Aditya Shastry et al.","Artificial neural networks; Customized ANN; Multiple linear regression; Parameters; Yield",,Article,Scopus

Current approaches for site-specific fertilizer distribution are based on patterns of soil properties and yield maps obtained from previous years. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of crop yield prediction in an arable field using two sets of variables in autoregressive (AR) state-space models. One set included detailed soil information (texture, organic carbon content) and yield data from the previous year at a high spatial resolution. In the other set, remotely sensed soil and crop information (vegetation index, crop nitrogen status, land surface elevation) was assembled, which is available under farm conditions without intensive soil sampling campaigns. Soil and remotely sensed variables were evaluated in bi- and multivariate autoregressive state-space analysis to predict spring barley grain yield. Remotely sensed variables showed to be better predictors for spatial grain yield estimation than soil variables. Transition coefficients determined from state-space analysis were applied in AR-equations with soil and remotely sensed information, but yet given only the initial value of the spatial yield series.

Among those techniques, Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) based crop yield prediction has better efficiency, flexibility and ability to predict yield productivity. However, the performance of FCM was degraded due to some missing input data. Hence in this article, Intuitionistic Fuzzy Cognitive Map (IFCM) is initially used to improve the groundnut yield prediction with the aid of weather and soil parameters. The IFCM is built by considering the expert's hesitancy in the computation of the causal relations between the concepts of a groundnut yield. On the other hand, the learning rate and stability of the IFCM are less due to fixed parameter based weight adaptation. As a result, a supervised multistep learning using the gradient method is proposed for enhancing weight adaptation of IFCM. The enhanced IFCM (EIFCM) estimate the current value of the weight matrix elements from the previous estimation history. Moreover, the learning parameters of the gradient method utilized in EIFCM are optimized by using Self-Organizing Migration Algorithm (SOMA) to reduce the iteration of the weight update. The experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed OEIFCM in crop yield prediction in terms of accuracy, precision and recall. © 2018 Malarkodi. K. P, Dr. Arthi.

A non-linear iterative multivariate optimization approach (quasi-Newton method with least square loss function) has been used to derive an empirical piecewise linear crop yield prediction equation (with a break point). The derived empirical equation (based on 1984 to 1998 data) has been used to predict 1999 crop yield with R2≥0.90. The model has been validated for the three years 1997, 1998 and 1999. A crop yield prediction equation has been obtained for each province in India (for wheat and rice) that accounts for ≥90% of the variance in the dataset.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Linear equations; Newton-Raphson method; Optimization; Rain; Soil moisture; Vegetation; Crop yield; Crop yield prediction equation; Cultivation; crop yield; data set; empirical analysis; least squares method; multivariate analysis; NDVI; optimization; precipitation intensity; prediction; rainfall; soil moisture; surface temperature; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

A growing empirical literature models this relationship in order to project climate change impacts on the sector. We describe an approach to yield modeling that uses a semiparametric variant of a deep neural network, which can simultaneously account for complex nonlinear relationships in high-dimensional datasets, as well as known parametric structure and unobserved cross-sectional heterogeneity. Using data on corn yield from the US Midwest, we show that this approach outperforms both classical statistical methods and fully-nonparametric neural networks in predicting yields of years withheld during model training. Using scenarios from a suite of climate models, we show large negative impacts of climate change on corn yield, but less severe than impacts projected using classical statistical methods. In particular, our approach is less pessimistic in the warmest regions and the warmest scenarios. © 2018 The Author(s).

Optimal management strategies however rely on early estimates of climate and yield. These estimates are usually derived from the historic range of climate variations applied to current crop conditions. Early in the season these predictions are wide ranging as they incorporate all past historic climate variability and hence a large range of possible yields. Dynamical seasonal climate models offer the opportunity to narrow this range contingent on the models having adequate predictive skill. This study explores the benefits of using a climate model over historical climate to predict wheat yield in the Australian cropping zone throughout the cropping season. We take an ensemble of daily outputs of temperature, radiation and rainfall from a seasonal climate model (POAMA) and apply a simple downscaling and calibration to align with 57 stations across the Australian cropping zone. These data are then used as an input to a crop model (APSIM) to translate seasonal conditions into a yield prediction. Simulations deploy historic weather data up to a date on which forecast data replace measured data. Here we used a range of dates (April to October) through the cropping season for the period 1981 to 2015, to determine where and when the forecast is skilful compared to using the full weather record up to harvest. The forecasts are categorised in three yield categories low (decile 1–3), average (4–7) and high (8–10) and determined to be ‘misleading’ if they predict low instead of high or vice versa. In the west and south of Australia less than 3 years in 20 give a misleading forecast in April, and less than 1 in 20 years by August. The forecast for east of Australia has less skill primarily due to a strong rainfall bias with the climate model not being able to simulate the correct daily rainfall patterns. Compared to the predictions gained from using the full range of historical climate, POAMA derived forecasts have a narrower prediction range than the climatology driven ones, however this comes at the expense of a higher number of misleading forecasts. Nevertheless, in June (August) the POAMA driven simulations have a greater than 65% (80%) chance of being in the correct or one category out, which was higher than using climatology in each region at the same lead time. The baseline set by this study demonstrates the potential utility of dynamic climate models to predict yield, which should only improve with on-going advances in climate modelling and techniques in downscaling. © 2018","APSIM; GCM; Grain yield forecast; Seasonal climate forecast","climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; crop yield; ensemble forecasting; rainfall; seasonality; solar radiation; temperature; wheat; Australia; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Forecasting or predicting the crop yield well ahead of its harvest time would assist the strategists and farmers for taking suitable measures for selling and storage. Accurate prediction of crop development stages plays an important role in crop production management. Such predictions will also support the allied industries for strategizing the logistics of their business. Several means and approaches of predicting and demonstrating crop yields have been developed earlier with changing rate of success, as these don't take into considerations the weather and its characteristics and are mostly empirical. For this a combined constructional and methodological approach is proposed like variety inception, pesticide & fertilizer management, integrated cropping, rainwater harvesting, efficient irrigation techniques etc. would also be needed. The neural network algorithm is less prone to error than other machine learning and data mining techniques, making it an effective machine learning tool for predicting crop yields. The ANN back propagation algorithm is used to determine the appropriate weight value to calculate the error derivative. The accuracy of the crop yield estimation for the diverse crops involved in strategizing and planning is deliberated to be one of the utmost significant issues for agronomic production purposes. The yield prediction is still considered to be a major issue that remains to be explained based on available data for some agricultural areas. Crop monitoring and forecasting of crop yields for the proposed system will be carried out via satellite images with low resolution. The combination of extensive and extended topographical coverage and its high temporal frequency make these images an appropriate choice for the prediction of crop yields. To ease the training, the dimensionality of the data is reduced by supposing that the position of pixels doesn't influence the typical crop yield. The prototype distinguishes between crops, the infrared and temperature bands of images taken during apex growing season contribute the most to the crop prediction. Using Satellite Imagery and CNN algorithm to forecast crops in all states produces better efficiency than only using ANN algorithm.

From a modelling perspective, agroforestry has received much less attention than monocultures. However, for the potential of agroforestry to impact food security in Africa to be fully evaluated, models are required that accurately predict crop yields in the presence of trees. The positive effects of the fertiliser tree gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) on maize (Zea mays) are well documented and use of this tree-crop combination to increase crop production is expanding in several African countries. Simulation of gliricidia-maize interactions can complement field trials by predicting crop response across a broader range of contexts than can be achieved by experimentation alone. We tested a model developed within the APSIM framework. APSIM models are widely used for one dimensional (1D), process-based simulation of crops such as maize and wheat in monoculture. The Next Generation version of APSIM was used here to test a 2D agroforestry model where maize growth and yield varied spatially in response to interactions with gliricidia. The simulations were done using data for gliricidia-maize interactions over two years (short-term) in Kenya and 11 years (long-term) in Malawi, with differing proportions of trees and crops and contrasting management. Predictions were compared with observations for maize grain yield, and soil water content. Simulations in Kenya were in agreement with observed yields reflecting lower observed maize germination in rows close to gliricidia. Soil water content was also adequately simulated, except for a tendency for slower simulated drying of the soil profile each season. Simulated maize yields in Malawi were also in agreement with observations. Trends in soil carbon over a decade were similar to those measured, but could not be statistically evaluated. These results show that the agroforestry model in APSIM Next Generation adequately represented tree-crop interactions in these two contrasting agro-ecological conditions and agroforestry practices. Further testing of the model is warranted to explore tree-crop interactions under a wider range of environmental conditions. © 2017","Alley cropping; Competition; Hedgerow; Intercropping; Nitrogen; Water","agricultural management; agricultural modeling; agroforestry; alley cropping; competition (ecology); crop production; crop yield; growth; hedgerow; intercropping; interspecific interaction; maize; monoculture; nitrogen; one-dimensional modeling; prediction; tree; two-dimensional modeling; water uptake; Africa; Gliricidia; Gliricidia sepium; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

First, we forego hand-crafted features traditionally used in the remote sensing community and propose an approach based on modern representation learning ideas. We also introduce a novel dimensionality reduction technique that allows us to train a Convolutional Neural Network or Long-short Term Memory network and automatically learn useful features even when labeled training data are scarce. Finally, we incorporate a Gaussian Process component to explicitly model the spatio-temporal structure of the data and further improve accuracy.

Scarcity of water resources in arid and semi-arid areas poses a serious threat to their agricultural productivity and hence their food security. In this study, we examine whether crop yields can be predicted from remotely sensed vegetation indices and remotely sensed estimates of primary productivity. Spatial relationships between remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI), net photosynthesis (PNet), and gross and net primary production (GPP and NPP, respectively) in irrigated semi-arid and arid agro-ecosystems since the beginning of the century are analysed. The conflict-affected country of Syria is selected as the case study. Relationships between EVI and crop yield are investigated in an effort to enhance food production estimates in affected areas outside governmental jurisdictions. Estimates of NPP derived from reported irrigated agriculture crop data in a semi-arid and an arid zone are compared to remotely sensed NPP in a geospatial environment. Results show that winter crop yields are correlated with spring GPP in semi-arid zones of the study area (R2 = 0.85). Summer crop yield can be predicted from either cumulative summer EVI (R2 = 0.77) or PNet in most zones. Where fully irrigated fields are surrounded by hyper-arid landscape, summer PNet was negative in all instances and EVI was inversely correlated with yield. NPP from crops was much higher (290 gC m−2 year−1) in those regions than MOD17 NPP (70 gC m–2), where 1.0 g of carbon is equivalent to 2.2 g of oven-dry organic matter (= 45% carbon by weight). The gap was less in semi-arid zones (2–39% difference). Overall crop-derived NPP for the period 2000–2013 was 322 versus 300 gC m–2 for that remotely sensed within the cropped zones of the political units.

Management combinations simulated were three transplanting dates (1st, 15th &amp; 30th July) for rice cultivar Rmansuri under rainfed conditions. The results indicated that both the early and late sowing dates result in lower yields as compared to optimum sowing date of 15th July. The simulated phenology and yield were found to be in agreement with observed data suggesting that the calibrated model may be operationally used with routinely observed soil, crop management and weather parameters for Rice yield estimation from these two regions of Bihar. The analysis also brought out that the yield differences under potential and rainfed condition during the study period, was influenced by variations in thermal, radiation regime as well as moisture regimes. The results showed that phenological stage of panicle initiation to grain filling is sensitive to water and Nitrogen availability status in the Rice Crop.

However, estimating the yield (i.e., yield prediction) is a critical part of pricing the premium for this insurance instrument. Because of the importance of predicting crop yield, the purpose of this study is to apply several forecasting methods for evaluating crop yield estimates in Ghana. Crop yield forecasting, which provides information for decision makers, is important in many ways to Ghana's economy. We compare yield forecasts using Simple Exponential Smoothing, Double Exponential Smoothing, Damped-Trend Linear Exponential Smoothing, and ARMA models applied separately to each district. The ARMA models proved to be more robust time-series models than the smoothing techniques for predicting crop yield in this study. This predictive power of ARMA models even with the presence of crop yield ""cycle"" does not depend on the length of cycle.

In this context, crop and soil parameters along with NDVI index which are valuable sources of information have been elaborated statistically to test if a) Durum wheat yield can be predicted and b) when is the actual time-window to predict the yield in the district of Paphos, where Durum wheat is the basic cultivation and supports the rural economy of the area. 15 plots cultivated with Durum wheat from the Agricultural Research Institute of Cyprus for research purposes, in the area of interest, have been under observation for three years to derive the necessary data. Statistical and remote sensing techniques were then applied to derive and map a model that can predict yield of Durum wheat in this area. Indeed the semi-empirical model developed for this purpose, with very high correlation coefficient R2=0.886, has shown in practice that can predict yields very good. Students T test has revealed that predicted values and real values of yield have no statistically significant difference.

In recent years, some data-driven modeling technique comparisons have been made, looking for the best model to yield prediction. However, attributes are usually selected based on expertise assessment or in dimensionality reduction algorithms. A fairer comparison should include the best subset of features for each regression technique; an evaluation including several crops is preferred. This paper evaluates the most common data-driven modeling techniques applied to yield prediction, using a complete method to define the best attribute subset for each model. Multiple linear regression, stepwise linear regression, M5′ regression trees, and artificial neural networks (ANN) were ranked. The models were built using real data of eight crops sowed in an irrigation module of Mexico. To validate the models, three accuracy metrics were used: the root relative square error (RRSE), relative mean absolute error (RMAE), and correlation factor (R). The results show that ANNs are more consistent in the best attribute subset composition between the learning and the training stages, obtaining the lowest average RRSE (86.04%), lowest average RMAE (8.75%), and the highest average correlation factor (0.63). © 2014 Alberto Gonzalez-Sanchez et al.",,"accuracy; analytical error; artificial neural network; controlled study; harvest; irrigation (agriculture); linear regression analysis; Mexico; multiple linear regression analysis; nonhuman; nonlinear regression analysis; prediction; review; statistical model; agriculture; algorithm; artificial neural network; classification; crop; growth, development and aging; nonlinear system; procedures; regression analysis; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; weather; Agricultural Irrigation; Agriculture; Algorithms; Crops, Agricultural; Linear Models; Neural Networks (Computer); Nonlinear Dynamics; Regression Analysis; Weather",Review,Scopus

Both methods provide prior distributions in the Bayesian framework for data assimilation. CPF is sequentially used to update state and parameter estimates in order to improve model prediction and to assess the predictive uncertainty. The predictive performances of the two methods are evaluated by an application to the LNAS sugar beet growth model with three sets of real measurements, one used for parameter estimation and the two others used to test the model predictive capacity, both with and without data assimilation.

Model performance evaluation in ungauged basins is an important research topic. In this study, we propose a framework for developing Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) input data, including hydrography, terrain, land use, soil, tile, weather, and management practices, for the Upper Mississippi River basin (UMRB). We also present a performance evaluation of SWAT hydrologic budget and crop yield simulations in the UMRB without calibration. The uncalibrated SWAT model ably predicts annual streamflow at 11 USGS gauges and crop yield at a four-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) scale. For monthly streamflow simulation, the performance of SWAT is marginally poor compared with that of annual flow, which may be due to incomplete information about reservoirs and dams within the UMRB. Further validation shows that SWAT can predict base flow contribution ratio reasonably well. Compared with three calibrated SWAT models developed in previous studies of the entire UMRB, the uncalibrated SWAT model presented here can provide similar results. Overall, the SWAT model can provide satisfactory predictions on hydrologic budget and crop yield in the UMRB without calibration. The results emphasize the importance and prospects of using accurate spatial input data for the physically based SWAT model.

This is particularly significant with respect to gradually developing anomalies such as droughts. The impact of the 1995-1996 drought on the Oklahoma wheat crop, and the possibility that predictive information might have reduced some of the losses, is examined through a combined modeling approach using climatological data and a crop growth model that takes into account an extensive range of soil, climatic, and plant variables. The results show potential outcomes and also illustrate the point at which all possible climatic outcomes were predicting a significantly low wheat yield. Based on anecdotal evidence of the 1995-1996 drought, which suggested that farmers who planted at different times experienced different yields, the model was run assuming a variety of different planting dates. Results indicate that there is indeed a noticeable difference in the modeled wheat yields given different planting dates. The information regarding effectiveness of planting date can be used in conjunction with current long-range forecasts to develop improved predictions for the current growing season. This approach produces information regarding the likelihood of extreme precipitation events and the impact on crop yield, which can provide a powerful tool to farmers and others during periods of drought or other climatic extremes. © 2007 ISB.","Climatic impacts on agriculture; Drought; Wheat yield forecast","acclimatization; article; biological model; computer simulation; environment; growth, development and aging; physiology; season; United States; wheat; Acclimatization; Computer Simulation; Environment; Models, Biological; Oklahoma; Seasons; Triticum; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

The model was tested using the remaining field data for the 5, 10, and 20 m drain spacings for drain flow and the additional 40 m spacing for yield predictions. Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (EF) for daily drain flow simulations for the calibration years and drain spacing ranged from 0.62 to 0.79. The daily EF for model testing ranged from -0.66 to 0.81, with the average deviations of 0.01 to 0.07 cm/day and standard errors of 0.03-0.17 cm/day. On a monthly basis, 91% of plot years had EF values over 0.5 and 76% over 0.6 for years with on-site rainfall data. The total yearly drain flow was predicted within ±25% in 71% of plot years, and within ±50% in 93% of plot years with on-site rainfall data.

This study reports the analysis of intensive sampling of light interception, leaf and nut nutrient concentration and yield of 768 almond trees subjected to fertilization and irrigation treatments within a mid-age commercial orchard. Nitrogen fertilization had a significant effect on individual tree fPAR, LAI, leaf nitrogen content and nut yield.

The grey system theory and neural network have individually been applied to the prediction problem of various fields, and have shown good results. However, few studies have dealt with the integration of Grey system theory and neural network for the nit crop yield prediction, though there is a great potential for useful applications in this area. In this paper, based on related concept of information entropy, which is applied to determine the weights of grey system forecasting model and RBF (radial basis function) neural network forecasting model, an entropy-based combining prediction model of unit crop yield time series is proposed. This study proposes a novel combination forecasting model for improving those traditional analyzing and forecasting models as following: with respective merits of both grey forecasting model and RBF neural network forecasting model, the conjunction forecasting model is a comprehensive reflection of both social production levels and environmental factors, and it is less risky in practice, as well as relative more intuitive and feasible. © 2009 IEEE.","Combining prediction; Grey system theory; Information entropy; RBF network; Unit crop yield forecasting","Combination forecasting; Crop yield; Crop yield forecasting; Environmental factors; Forecasting models; Grey forecasting model; Grey system theory; Grey systems; Information entropy; Prediction model; Prediction problem; Production level; RBF Network; RBF Neural Network; RBF(radial basis function); Significant impacts; Computer science; Crops; Cybernetics; Entropy; Forecasting; Intelligent computing; Mathematical models; Radial basis function networks; System theory; Time series; Neural networks",Conference Paper,Scopus

In this paper a hybrid genetic programing model integrated with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based Copula technique is developed to incorporate climate-based inputs as the predictors of cotton yield, for selected study regions: Faisalabad (31.4504 °N, 73.1350 °E), Multan (30.1984 °N, 71.4687 °E) and Nawabshah (26.2442 °N, 68.4100 °E), as important cotton growing hubs in the developing nation of Pakistan. Several different types of GP-MCMC-copula models were developed, each with the well-known copula families (i.e., Gaussian, student t, Clayton, Gumble Frank and Fischer-Hinzmann functions) to screen and utilize an optimal cotton yield forecast model for the present study region. The results of the GP-MCMC based hybrid copula model were evaluated with a standalone GP and the MCMC based copula model in accordance with statistical analysis of the predicted yield based on correlation coefficient (r), Willmott's index (WI), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE), root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) in the independent test phase. Further performance preciseness was evaluated by the Akiake Information Criterion (AIC), the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the Maximum Likelihood (MaxL) for the GP-MCMC based copula as well as the MCMC based copula model. GP-MCMC-Clayton copula model generated the most accurate result for the Multan station. For the optimal GP-MCMC-Clayton copula model, the acquired model evaluation metrics for Multan were: (LM≈0.952; RRMSE≈2.107%; RRMAE≈1.771%) followed by the MCMC based Gaussian copula model (LM≈0.895; RRMSE≈4.541%; RRMAE≈0.3.214%) and the standalone GP model (LM≈0.132; RRMSE≈23.638%; RRMAE≈22.652%), indicating the superiority of the GP-MCMC-Clayton copula model in respect to the other benchmark models. The performance of GP-MCMC based copula model was also found to be superior in the case of Faisalabad and Nawabshah station as confirmed by AIC, BIC, MaxL metrics, including a larger value of the Legates-McCabe's (LM) index, utilized in conjunction with the relative percentage RRMSE and the relative mean absolute error (RMAE). Accordingly, it is averred that the developed GP-MCMC copula model can be considered as a pertinent data-intelligent tool used for accurate prediction of cotton yield, utilizing the readily available climate datasets in agricultural regions and is of relevance to agricultural yield simulation and sectoral decision-making. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Climate data; Cotton yield; Crop yield prediction; Genetic programming; Markov Chain Monte Carlo based copula model","agricultural technology; benchmarking; climate change; cotton; crop yield; decision making; genetic algorithm; integrated approach; linear programing; Markov chain; Monte Carlo analysis; numerical model; prediction; simulation; Faisalabad; Nawabshah; Pakistan; Punjab [Pakistan]; Sind; Gossypium hirsutum",Article,Scopus

However, these methods have been investigated less for yield prediction of some crops, such as silage maize, which can be cultivated at various times in different fields of an area. Inconsistency between fields for satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) temporal profiles can lead to some difficulties in yield prediction methods using time series of remotely sensed data. Therefore, this research has investigated silage maize yield prediction based on time series of NDVI dataset derived from Landsat 8 OLI. This paper employed advanced ML techniques including boosted regression tree (BRT), random forest regression (RFR), support vector regression, and Gaussian process regression (GPR) approaches and compared their performance with some proposed conventional regression methods. For this purpose, the NDVI values of all silage maize fields were averaged and integrated to produce a two-dimensional dataset for each year. The ML techniques were employed 100 times and their evaluation metrics were used to evaluate their performances and also analyze their stability. Finally, all the results of each ML technique were averaged to produce silage maize yields. The comparisons between the results of these methods indicate that the BRT technique, with the average R value higher than 0.87, outperforms other ones for all years. It was followed by RFR with almost same performance as GPR technique. This research demonstrated that some advanced ML approaches can predict the silage maize yield and they are less sensitive to inconsistency of NDVI time series. The results also showed that RFR was the most stable method to predict the maize yield in 2015, while it was trained using 2013-2014 dataset. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","?-support vector regression (SVR); Boosted regression tree (BRT); crop yield prediction; Gaussian process regression (GPR); Landsat 8 OLI; machine learning (ML); maize; normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series; random forest regression (RFR)","Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Crops; Decision trees; Earth (planet); Forecasting; Forestry; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Learning systems; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Satellites; Time series analysis; Vegetation; Boosted regression trees; Crop yield; Gaussian process regression; LANDSAT; maize; Normalized difference vegetation index time series; Random forests; Regression trees; Support vector regression (SVR); Vegetation mapping; Mapping; crop yield; ground penetrating radar; Landsat; maize; NDVI; prediction; remote sensing; satellite imagery; silage; support vector machine; time series analysis; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The principle of CST is that years similar to the target year (e.g. the current year) should have similar yields, or similar yield deviations from a technological time trend. In practice, CST guides the crop analyst through standard steps: After data screening to identify possible outliers and analysis of time trend, the crop analyst has the choice between the following two approaches to forecast yield: (1) multiple regression analysis in which a linear relationship is calibrated between historical yield data and yield indicators, while accounting for a time trend if present; (2) scenario analysis, whereby CST looks for the years most similar (according to the indicators) to the current year to estimate a yield deviation from the time trend or the average yield. CST allows to assess models with standard statistics and tests as well as warnings, which is especially useful when many indicators are available. Moreover, thanks to batch processing, the crop analyst can test a given model for various dekads, regions or crops. This paper illustrates the interest of CST with two case studies made over Africa and based on the regression approach between crop yields and NDVI or cumulated rainfall at a given dekad. In the first one, South African maize yields at province level over 1987-2015 were found to be well correlated with Vegetation/ProbaV NDVI or CHIRPS rainfall for two of the three main maize producing provinces; for each province, we tested indicators from the 15 dekads between January and May. In the second study, we regressed the 1999-2014 maize yields from the main 26 crop production zones against also NDVI and cumulated rainfall with two different start dates (April and June); we tested 3000 models (26 zones, 15 dekads, 3 single indicators without and with time trend, all indicators together, and finally trend alone) and obtained mixed results: A strong dominance of the time trend and for the indicators, unstable relationships and sometimes wrong slope signs. Beyond these contrasting results that could be partly due to the quality of yield statistics or the relevance of the selected indicators, CST combined with the SPIRITS tool for extracting indicators at region level from raster time series, should help crop analysts predict crop yield, in particular where many indicators derived from remote sensing data or crop models are to be tested. © 2017 IEEE.","crop yield prediction; food security; remote sensing","Agriculture; Batch data processing; Cultivation; Food supply; Forecasting; Rain; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Time series; Crop production; Crop yield; Food security; Linear relationships; Multiple regression analysis; Remote sensing data; Scenario analysis; Strong dominances; Crops",Conference Paper,Scopus

Theoretically, NDVI for this period can be used as a proxy of general weedness of crops.

Crop simulation models can provide the capability for predicting physiological and yield effects of these environmental changes across a wide range of species and day-to-day conditions. Much more is now known about rubisco kinetics, photosynthetic response to CO2, stomatal function, and leaf-level feedback mechanisms than 10 to 15 yr ago. Despite these advances, few whole crop models use leaf-level rubisco kinetics to model photosynthetic sensitivity to CO2 and almost none use an energy balance to predict foliage temperature and CO2-induced decreases in transpiration. These advances can be incorporated into whole canopy models of photosynthesis and energy balance that are sensitive to CO2, temperature, and humidity. Species differences in photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO2 and environmental or genotypic regulations of the amount and activity of rubisco represent significant knowledge gaps. We need better information on the second-order effects of CO2-enrichment on partitioning of assimilates and ability of plants to use the additional photosynthate. Model improvements are needed in predicting source-sink imbalances in order to simulate feedback inhibition effects on the photosynthetic response to CO2.

(sugar beet crops) under future climate change scenarios. RESULTS: A system dynamics model was developed which takes account of the effects of rainfall and temperature on sugar beetyields under limited irrigation conditions. A relationship was also developed between the seasonal evapotranspiration and seasonal growing degree days for sugar beet crops. The proposed model was set to run for the present time period of 1993-2012 and for the future period 2013-2040 for Lethbridge region (Alberta, Canada). The model provides sugar beet yields on a yearly basis which are comparable to the present field data. It was found that the future average yield will be increased at about 14% with respect to the present average yield. CONCLUSION: The proposed model can help to improve the understanding of soil water conditions and irrigation water requirements of an area under certain climatic conditions and can be used for future prediction of yields for any crops in any region (with the required information to be provided).

El Niño is the leading mode of SST interannual variability, and its impacts extend worldwide. Nevertheless, the predictability of these impacts is controversial, especially those associated with European climate variability, which have been found to be non-stationary and non-linear. The present study shows how potential crop yield obtained from reanalysis data and crop models serves as an alternative and more effective index of El Niño teleconnections because it integrates the nonlinearities between the climate variables in a unique time series. The relationships between El Niño and crop yield anomalies are more significant than the individual contributions of each of the atmospheric variables used as input in the crop model. Additionally, the non-stationarities between El Niño and European climate variability are more clearly detected when analyzing crop-yield variability. The understanding of this relationship allows for some predictability up to one year before the crop is harvested. This predictability is not constant, but depends on both high and low frequency modulation. These findings enhance the importance of crop models for impact studies, for the improvement of crop forecasting, and as generators of a climate variability index (the potential yield) for analyzing climate variability and change. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Bioclimatic index; Crop forecasting; Crop model; El Niño teleconnections in Europe; Potential yield; Seasonal crop yield prediction","agricultural management; annual variation; bioclimatology; climate modeling; climate prediction; climate variation; crop yield; El Nino; forecasting method; nonlinearity; crop improvement; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; teleconnection; Europe",Review,Scopus

The overall objective of this study was to update the corn and soybean yields which serve as a productivity index for Illinois soils since these two crops are grown on approximately 90% of the cropland. An approach based on multiple regression was used to evaluate the relationship between 16 selected soil properties of 34 major soils and established 1970s (1967-1976) corn and soybean yields as published in Circular 1156. Statistical models developed from major soils were tested internally by calculating the 10-year average corn and soybean yields for each of the 34 major soils. The coefficients generated from multiple regression were further tested using the soil property values for the additional 165 soils identified in nine counties representing the crop reporting districts and weather districts in Illinois. The 10-year average crop yield trends were determined for 66 counties in the northern region and for 36 counties in the southern region for the 20-year time period between 1976 and 1995. These 20-year yield trend increases were added to the established (Circular 1156) and model predicted 1970s crop yields to estimate 1990s (1986-1995) corn and soybean yields for the average management level for all 199 Illinois soil types in nine selected counties. The 1990s crop yield estimates for the selected Counties were weighted by extent of each soil type in the county and compared against 10-year county averages for the 1990s farmer reported Illinois Agricultural Statistics (IAS) corn and soybean yields. Predicted 1990s county crop yields were statistically similar to 1990s farmer reported (IAS) county crop yields. The proposed approach to updating corn and soybean yields worked well and should be useful in surrounding states or countries.

However, soil properties during sensitive stages of crop growth may have a greater effect on crop yield than the initial values. We determined if inclusion of soil properties, measured during the reproductive stage, could improve the accuracy of crop yield prediction. Classification and regression trees were used to determine the explanatory power of different soil and rice variables for predicting rice yield in alkaline salt-affected paddy fields in northeast China. The traditional method explained 77.5% of the rice yield variation and identified soil CO3 2− in the 0- to 10-cm soil layer, with single explanatory power of 53.4%, as the most important predictor. The whole explanatory power of the methods including soil variables during the reproductive stage and yield components, with/without soil variables before planting, increased to 81.3%. The residual sodium carbonate, measured in the 0- to 10-cm soil layer during the reproductive stage, was identified as the most limiting factor due to its single maximum explanatory power of 60.5%. We conclude that inclusion of soil properties, measured during the reproductive stage, has potential for improving the rice yield prediction accuracy by enhancing the explanatory power in identification of the most limiting factor.

Currently, crop models are widely used for crop yield prediction. However, they are hampered by the uncertainty or similarity of input parameters when extrapolated to field scale. Data assimilation methods that combine crop models and remote sensing are the most effective methods for field yield estimation. In this study, the World Food Studies (WOFOST) model is used to simulate the growing process of spring maize. Common assimilation methods face some difficulties due to the scarce, constant, or similar nature of the input parameters. For example, yield spatial heterogeneity simulation, coexistence of common assimilation methods and the nutrient module, and time cost are relatively important limiting factors. To address the yield simulation problems at field scale, a simple yet effective method with fast algorithms is presented for assimilating the time-series HJ-1 A/B data into the WOFOST model in order to improve the spring maize yield simulation. First, the WOFOST model is calibrated and validated to obtain the precise mean yield. Second, the time-series leaf area index (LAI) is calculated from the HJ data using an empirical regression model. Third, some fast algorithms are developed to complete assimilation. Finally, several experiments are conducted in a large farmland (Hongxing) to evaluate the yield simulation results. In general, the results indicate that the proposed method reliably improves spring maize yield estimation in terms of spatial heterogeneity simulation ability and prediction accuracy without affecting the simulation efficiency. © 2016 by the authors.","Fast assimilation algorithms; Prediction accuracy; Remote sensing; Spatial heterogeneity; WOFOST model; Yield simulation","Agriculture; Crops; Decision making; Digital storage; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Time series; Assimilation algorithms; Prediction accuracy; Spatial heterogeneity; Wofost models; Yield simulation; Algorithms",Article,Scopus

This study aimed to develop an approach for rice crop yield prediction in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and leaf area index (LAI). Data processing consisted of four main steps: (1) constructing time-series vegetation indices, (2) noise filtering of time-series data using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), (3) establishment of crop yield models, and (4) model validation. The results indicated that the quadratic model using two variables (EVI and LAI) produced more accurate results than other models (i.e. linear, interaction, pure quadratic, and quadratic with a single variable). The highest correlation coefficients obtained at the ripening period for the spring-winter and autumn-summer crops were 0.70 and 0.74, respectively. The robustness of the established models was evaluated by comparisons between the predicted yields and crop yield statistics for 10 sampling districts in 2006 and 2007. The comparisons revealed satisfactory results for both years, especially for the spring-winter crop. In 2006, the root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean bias error (MBE) for the spring-winter crop were 10.18%, 8.44% and 0.9%, respectively, while the values for the autumn-summer crop were 17.65%, 14.06%, and 3.52%, respectively. In 2007, the spring-winter crop also yielded better results (RMSE = 10.56%, MAE = 9.14%, MBE = 3.68%) compared with the autumn-summer crop (RMSE = 17%, MAE = 12.69%, MBE = 2.31%). This study demonstrates the merit of using MODIS data for regional rice crop yield prediction in the Mekong Delta before the harvest period.

However, past experience has shown that the empirical nature of the VI based models and the intensive data requirement of the complex mechanistic models has limited their use for regional and spatial crop yield prediction especially for operational use. The present study was aimed at development of an intermediate method based on the use of remote sensing and the physiological concepts such as the photo-synthetically active solar radiation (PAR) and the fraction of PAR absorbed by the crop (fAPAR) in Monteith's radiation use efficiency based equation (Monteith, 1977) for operational wheat yield forecasting by the Department of Agriculture (DoA). Net Primary Product (NPP) has been computed using the Monteith model and stress has been applied to convert the potential NPP to actual NPP. Wheat grain yield has been computed using the actual NPP and Harvest index. Kalpana-VHRR insolation has been used for deriving the PAR. Maximum radiation use efficiency has been collected from literature and wheat crop mask was derived at MNCFC, New Delhi using RS2-AWiFS data. Water stress has been derived from the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) which has been derived periodically from the MODIS surface reflectance data (NIR and SWIR1). Temperature stress has been derived from the interpolated daily mean temperature. Results indicated that this model underestimated the yield by 3.45 % as compared to the reported yield at state level and hence can be used to predict wheat yield at state level. This study will be able to provide the spatial wheat yield map, as well as the district-wise and state level aggregated wheat yield forecast. It is possible to operationalize this remote sensing based modified Monteith's efficiency model for future yield forecasting with around 0.15 t ha-1 RMSE at state level.","K1-VHRR; LSWI; MODIS; Monteith efficiency model; Regional wheat yield; Remote sensing; RS2-AWiFS","Agriculture; Crops; Efficiency; Forecasting; Plants (botany); Radiometers; Solar radiation; Sun; Surface waters; Efficiency models; K1-VHRR; LSWI; MODIS; RS2-AWiFS; Wheat yield; Remote sensing",Conference Paper,Scopus

We have taken up the issue of predicting the yield level by analysing the soil characteristics for the particular soil. As gathering the information from an enormous volume of data is practically a complicated task in the recent circumstances, we have concentrated only on Trichy district and the soil data samples have been collected. The modified regression by discretisation was used for training and testing of the data sets and the results were explored in order to obtain the crop yield prediction for the soil.

The simulation results optimized by PEST were better than the calibration results via manual trial and error method, and showed higher efficiency. Parameterization uncertainty analysis of the model by PEST showed that the calibration data selection, initial parameter value, soil hydraulic parameter estimation method, interactions between these different parameter types and objective functions (error resources) had significant influences on PEST optimization results. Similar optimized soil hydraulic parameters were obtained from above processes, but produced different soil water retention curve. By above assessment, the uncertainty in RZWQM parameter optimization was reduced with improved soil water and crop yield predictions.

The goal is to train a regression model that can accurately predict label of an unlabeled bag. Many remote sensing applications can be studied within this setting. We propose a novel probabilistic framework for MIR that represents bag labels with a mixture model. It is based on an assumption that each bag contains a prime instance which is responsible for the bag label. An expectation-maximization algorithm is proposed to maximize the likelihood of the mixture model. The mixture model MIR framework is quite flexible, and several existing MIR algorithms can be described as its special cases.

Crop growth models used to make these predictions rely on soil texture estimates, which influence simulated soil moisture and ultimately crop growth. The purpose of this research was to implement a k-means clustering approach to address the uncertainty of the soil texture estimates. By grouping similar soil textures based on their simulated responses, clustering reveals how soil texture uncertainty may impact yield estimates. Wheat growth simulations were conducted using a HYDRUS 1D and coupled crop model for soils defined on the USDA soil texture triangle. A k-means clustering algorithm was applied to the simulated biophysical data for each soil texture. Resulting clusters were different from traditional soil type classifications. The k-means clustering approach proved useful for investigating the relationship to soil texture that crop yield may have. This research shows that the impact of soil texture variation should be considered when conducting crop growth simulation for the purposes of yield forecasting.","Clustering; HYDRUS; Modeling; Soil moisture; Yield","Computer simulation; Crops; Forecasting; Models; Soil moisture; Textures; Uncertainty analysis; Clustering; Drought conditions; HYDRUS; K-means clustering; K-Means clustering algorithm; Simulated response; Yield; Yield forecasting; Clustering algorithms",Conference Paper,Scopus

The results showed that the calibrated EP index explained 78.1% variances of damaged crop area, and it was sensitive to identify typical extreme and severe flood year from 1961 to 2014. During the real-time rainstorm flood in 2014, the EP index showed a certain capability to determine the start, duration, and strength of each flood process, while there was disagreement for local and discontinuous flood processes.

Over this period, a strong correlation was found between crop yield and VH indices during the weather-related critical period of crop development, which controls much final crop productivity. The 3-month advanced yield forecasts were independently compared with official agricultural statistics, showing that the estimation errors for WW, sorghum and corn were 8%, 6% and 3%, respectively.

The present study proposes a sensitivity analysis of the impact of the choice of the ET0 equation on simulated millet yields using SARRA-H crop model over 12 Senegalese stations representative of the Sudano-Sahelian climate conditions of West Africa. Priestley-Taylor, a modified Priestley-Taylor and Hargreaves equations lead to simulated yields up to 19% than those calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation.

The choice of ET0 formulation introduces uncertainties representing 8% of baseline yield regardless of precipitation changes; for wet conditions these uncertainties approach 30% of the overall climate change impact.

Here, we analyze county-level corn and soybean yields and observed climate for the period 1983-2012 to understand how growing-season (June, July and August) mean T, P and R influence crop yields jointly and in isolation across the CONterminous United States (CONUS). Results show that nationally averaged corn and soybean yields exhibit large interannual variability of 21% and 22%, of which 35% and 32% can be significantly explained by T and P, respectively. By including R, an additional of 5% in variability can be explained for both crops. Using partial regression analyses, we find that studies that ignore the covariability among T, P, and R can substantially overestimate the sensitivity of crop yields to a single climate factor at the county scale. Further analyses indicate large spatial variation in the relative contributions of different climate variables to the variability of historical corn and soybean yields. The structure of the dominant climate factors did not change substantially over 1983-2012, confirming the robustness of the findings, which have important implications for crop yield prediction and crop model validations. © The Author(s) 2016.",,"climate; growing season; harvest; model; nonhuman; plant yield; prediction; regression analysis; soybean; United States; validation process",Article,Scopus

To explore the utility of the spectral vegetation indices, sugarcane fields of two popular sugarcane varieties (N19 and NCo376) were selected and harvested when the crops were 11-12 months old to measure their yield. The random forest algorithm was used to develop the predictive models.

Each function was tested with historical weather data from five locations: Stoneville, Mississippi; Meridianville, Alabama; Shafter, California; Corpus Christi, Texas; and Florence, South Carolina. Monthly mean values of each function's coefficients were derived, from which daily values were obtained via cubic spline interpolation. Calibrated with Mississippi weather data, each function predicted solar radiation from measured Tmax and Tmin data for each location. Predictions were compared to measured radiation for validation, and the best functions were identified. Agreement was obtained between predicted and measured radiation (r2 ranged from 0.49 to 0.89), depending on function choice and location. The functions performed best in California, and the 2nd order polynomial showed superior performance (r 2 = 0.89 in California). Performance deteriorated as polynomial order increased above N = 2.

The evaporation fraction, calculated as a function of the evapotranspiration and net radiation over heterogeneous land surface, is used as a drought indicator in this study, where areas with low evaporation fraction are under drought danger. A two-source energy balance model has been applied to calculate the fluxes arising from the heterogeneous target, vegetation and soil. The fluxes have been retrieved from the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR2) on board the European Research Satellite (ERS2). The main advantage of the algorithm is the separation of the canopy and soil fluxes. The fluxes have been calculated as a function of the aerodynamic temperatures of the components of the surface (vegetation and soil), retrieved from the ATSR2 satellite data. The relationship between canopy biophysical properties and evaporation are examined, using the ATSR2 observations. All variables are retrieved from the ATSR2 satellite data corrected for the atmospheric effects. The algorithm for drought prediction has a long-term application for processing data from the ATSR2/ERS2, the Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) on board ENVISAT, ASTER/Terra/NASA and the future high resolution ESA/Land Surface mission (SPECTRA). © 2011 COSPAR.

In spite of its importance to agriculture and drought monitoring, soil moisture information is not widely available on a regional scale. However, long-term soil moisture information is essential for agricultural drought monitoring and crop yield prediction. The hydrologic model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to develop a long-term record of soil water at a fine spatial (16 km2) and temporal (weekly) resolution from historical weather data. The model was calibrated and validated using stream flow data. However, stream flow accounts for only a small fraction of the hydrologic water balance. Due to the lack of measured evapotranspiration or soil moisture data, the simulated soil water was evaluated in terms of vegetation response, using 16 years of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from NOAA-AVHRR satellite data. The simulated soil water was well-correlated with NDVI (r as high as 0.8 during certain years) for agriculture and pasture land use types, during the active growing season April-September, indicating that the model performed well in simulating the soil water. The study provides a framework for using remotely sensed NDVI to verify the soil moisture simulated by hydrologic models in the absence of auxiliary measured data on ET and soil moisture, as opposed to just the traditional stream flow calibration and validation.","Drought; Evapotranspiration; NDVI; Soil moisture; SWAT; Texas","Data reduction; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Hydrology; Parameter estimation; Remote sensing; Soil cement; NDVI; Soil moisture; SWAT; Texas; Moisture; evapotranspiration; remote sensing; soil moisture",Article,Scopus

Meteorological outputs of the seasonal prediction system were used in a crop yield model to assess the performance and usefulness of such a system for crop yield forecasting. An innovative method for supplying s easonal forecast information to crop simulation models was developed. It consisted in running a crop model from each individual downscaled member output of climate models. An ensemble of crop yield was obtained and a probability distribution function (PDF) was derived. Preliminary results of wheat yield simulations in Europe using downscaled DEMETER seasonal weather forecasts suggest that reliable crop yield predictions can be obtained using an ensemble multi-model approach. When compared to the operational system, for the same level of accuracy, earlier crop forecasts are obtained with the DEMETER system. Furthermore, PDFs of wheat yield provide information on both the yield anomaly and the uncertainty of the forecast. Based on the spread of the PDF, the user can directly quantify the benefits and risk of taking weather-sensitive decisions. It is show n that the use of ensembles of seasonal weather forecast brings additional information for the crop yield forecasts and therefore has valuable benefit for decision-making in the management of European Union agricultural production.

During two seasons, a commercial field in Araras/SP, planted with variety SP80-1842, on the 4th and 5th cuts, was monitored on eight different dates, and data were obtained for 2 m of sugarcane in three crop rows at 18 sampling points. Linear and multiple regression analyses were used to study growth analysis and to correlate agronomic variables (leaf area index and number of plants per meter) with biomass and productivity. Gompertz model, a sigmoidal curve, was the best adjustment curve for total biomass and yield in relation to days after cutting (r2 = 0.8987 and r2 = 0.9682, respectively); number of plants and leaf area index showed best fit with a cubic exponential model and a quadratic exponential model, respectively. Total biomass and cane productivity were well correlated with LAI in the first two stages of the sugarcane cycle using linear regression. At the end of the cycle, total biomass and cane productivity were more related to number of plants, and lower r2 values than in other stages were obtained by the models. © 2005, Scientia Agricola.

This study investigates the links between the large-scale atmospheric circulation and crop yields in Europe, providing the basis to develop seasonal crop yield forecasting and thus enabling a more effective and dynamic adaptation to climate variability and change. Four dominant modes of large-scale atmospheric variability have been used: North Atlantic Oscillation, Eastern Atlantic, Scandinavian and Eastern Atlantic-Western Russia patterns. Large-scale atmospheric circulation explains on average 43% of inter-annual winter wheat yield variability, ranging between 20% and 70% across countries. As for grain maize, the average explained variability is 38%, ranging between 20% and 58%. Spatially, the skill of the developed statistical models strongly depends on the large-scale atmospheric variability impact on weather at the regional level, especially during the most sensitive growth stages of flowering and grain filling. Our results also suggest that preceding atmospheric conditions might provide an important source of predictability especially for maize yields in south-eastern Europe. Since the seasonal predictability of large-scale atmospheric patterns is generally higher than the one of surface weather variables (e.g. precipitation) in Europe, seasonal crop yield prediction could benefit from the integration of derived statistical models exploiting the dynamical seasonal forecast of large-scale atmospheric circulation. © 2017 The Author(s)","Atmospheric variability; Crop yield; Grain maize; NAO; Winter wheat","anomaly; atmospheric circulation; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; crop yield; growth; maize; North Atlantic Oscillation; regional pattern; seed; wheat; Europe; Russian Federation; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

In addition to the role of climate variables and soil characteristics, the actual ET is influenced by dynamic crop characteristics during the growing season. Therefore, accounting for the interaction between crop growth and actual ET can significantly improve the performance of models. In this study, an efficient approach is presented for simultaneous calibration of ET and crop growth parameters for the Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) model for daily, weekly, and monthly ET. The proposed approach involves the development of an objective function based on a compounded time series comprising of scaled annual ET and crop yield data. An efficient search algorithm based on the DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm was implemented in R language to find the parameter values that minimizes the defined objective function. The simultaneous calibration approach, which utilized annual data, improved ET prediction for annual and finer time scales (25% in RMSE reduction for 3-month, 18% for monthly, 17% for 2-week, 19% for weekly, 17% for 3-day, and 13% for daily time scales). The average of absolute relative error for crop yield predictions was also reduced from 43% to 16% for the calibrated model.

However, past uses of these models have been criticized in part due to a failure of researchers to quantify uncertainties of crop yield prediction. We have developed a method for considering uncertainty in a crop model using a simple sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) model as a case study. A Bayesian Monte Carlo approach generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation was used to estimate model parameters, their uncertainties, and correlations among them using data from five growing seasons at four locations in Brazil where crops received adequate nutrients and good weed control. Some of the model parameters were assumed to be correlated random variables, based on the literature, and varied across their ranges of uncertainty to estimate posterior distributions of parameters. The mean parameter values, parameter ranges, and the parameter covariance-correlation matrix are inputs to this Bayesian approach, which includes a Toeplitz–Cholesky factorization to generate correlated random variable samples and then simulate a distribution of state variables on a daily time step. Correlated random simulation, based on posterior distributions of parameters, was an effective method for including uncertainty in the crop growth and yield estimates. We demonstrated that uncertainty can be reduced with respect to model structure and parameter meaning because the optimization process is heavily dependent on prior knowledge of the parameters. Uncertainty varied with environment even though distributions of parameters remained the same across all environments. © 2017 by the American Society of Agronomy 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711 USA All rights reserved.",,,Article,Scopus

This study assesses the accuracy of state-of-the-art satellite rainfall retrievals for agriculture applications in two sites in Niger and Benin. Although these satellite data are widely used instead of rain gauge data for such applications, we found that, in a crop-modelling framework, their use can introduce large biases in crop yield simulations. Biases differ strongly among the four cultivars considered in both sites and are not simple extrapolation of each satellite product cumulative rainfall amount biases. In particular, we found that if an accurate estimation of the annual cumulative rainfall amount is important for yield simulations of pearl millet 'Souna 3' and 'Somno' cultivars in Niger, a realistic distribution of rainfall is also very important for predicting pearl millet 'Somno' and 'HK' yields in Niger as well as maize yields in Benin. Overall the satellite products tested, 3B42v6 appears to be the most suitable satellite product for our specific agricultural application since it minimizes both biases in rainfall distribution and in annual cumulative rainfall amount.

However, ground-based recording networks are not available at spatial and temporal scales needed to drive the models at many critical places on earth. An alternative would be to employ satellite-based observations of either precipitation or soil moisture. Satellite observations of precipitation are currently not considered capable of forcing the models with sufficient accuracy for crop yield predictions. However, deduction of soil moisture from space-based platforms is in a more advanced state than are precipitation estimates so that these data may be capable of forcing the models with better accuracy. In this study, a mature two-source energy balance model, the Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) model, was used to deduce root zone soil moisture for an area of North Alabama, USA. The soil moisture estimates were used in turn to force the state-of-the-art Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop simulation model. The study area consisted of a mixture of rainfed and irrigated cornfields. The results indicate that the model forced with the ALEXI moisture estimates produced yield simulations that compared favorably with observed yields and with the rainfed model. The data appear to indicate that the ALEXI model did detect the soil moisture signal from the mixed rainfed/irrigation corn fields and this signal was of sufficient strength to produce adequate simulations of recorded yields over a 10 year period. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","ALEXI; Crop modeling; DSSAT; Maximum entropy; Remote sensing; Soil moisture","Agrotechnology transfer; ALEXI; Crop modeling; DSSAT; Root zone soil moistures; Satellite observations; Spatial and temporal scale; Two-source energy balance model; Artificial intelligence; Crops; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Estimation; Maximum entropy methods; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Space platforms; Computer simulation",Article,Scopus

Therefore, an economic growth a nation mainly depends on the development of agricultural activities like improving crop production, utilizing developed technologies to monitor crop yield, etc. As a result, different crop yield monitoring systems have been developed to enhance the agricultural productivity. Among different systems, multi-objective firefly Optimized Fuzzy Cognitive Map (OFCM) was proposed for predicting the Arachis Hypogaea (groundnut) yield by using both soil and weather factors. Here, multi-objective firefly was applied for learning FCM by optimizing the weight parameters utilized in FCM. However, the Pareto-front issue has occurred in the firefly algorithm due to consider the multiple objective functions. Hence in this article, crowding distance between fireflies is computed for choosing appropriate fireflies. Moreover, an Improved Optimized OFCM (IOFCM) is proposed in which a modified multi-objective firefly optimization is used to minimize the randomness and achieve the global optima by improving the movement of fireflies. Though it achieves better optimization, FCM has high sensitive while input data are missing resulting in prediction decision is made with incomplete information. As a result, a modification in FCM is proposed to improve the prediction performance more effectively. In this modification, the value of each node in the FCM is computed by considering the hesitancy function that increases the prediction accuracy even some input data are missed. This newly proposed algorithm is called an Improved Optimized Intuitionistic FCM (IOIFCM). Finally, the experimental results show that the effectiveness of the proposed IOIFCM based crop yield prediction compared to the other optimization algorithms. © 2006-2018 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","Firefly algorithm; Fuzzy cognitive map; Intuitionistic FCM; Multi-objective firefly optimization; Yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

However, most reported studies are vague on the choice of the global circulation models (GCMs) for climate projections, and on the corresponding uncertainty with this type of model simulations. Here we investigated whether climate-crop modelling can be used for identifying crop management-level adaptation options. We focused our analyses on a case study for maize in southern Africa using the APSIM crop growth model and projections from 17 individual climate models for the period 2017–2060 for the contrasting representative concentration pathways 2.6 and 8.5. Intensification of nitrogen fertiliser use (from 30 to 90 kg N ha−1) was simulated as an example of a crop management-level adaptation to climate change. Uncertainties in crop yield predictions were about 30 to 60%, i.e. larger than expected crop responses to most management-level interventions or adaptations. Variation in simulated yields was caused by inter-seasonal rainfall variability and uncertainty with climate models. Some GCMs resulted in significantly different maize yield predictions, without any clear pattern across sites. Given these high uncertainties, we argue that crop modellers should be cautious when informing future crop management adaptation strategies based on climate-crop model ensembles. A better use of crop models is the simulation of crop responses to current weather variability aiming at the identification of crop management practices for coping with climate variability. Promising practices can then be evaluated with farmers on their feasibility over a range of plausible future biophysical and socio-economic farming conditions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; Climate models; Crop modelling; Crop yield; Uncertainty","agricultural management; agricultural modeling; climate change; climate modeling; crop yield; maize; seasonal variation; uncertainty analysis; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; South Africa; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Specifically, EVI2 temporal trajectory of crop growth was simulated using a hybrid piecewise logistic model (HPLM) for individual pixels, which was used to detect crop phenological metrics. The derived crop phenology was then applied to calculate crop greenness defined as EVI2 amplitude and EVI2 integration during annual crop growing seasons, which was further aggregated for croplands in each country, respectively. The interannual variations in EVI2 amplitude and EVI2 integration were combined to correlate to the variation in cereal yield from 1982-2012 for individual countries using a stepwise regression model, respectively. The results show that the confidence level of the established regression models was higher than 90% (P value < 0.1) in most countries in the northern hemisphere although it was relatively poor in the southern hemisphere (mainly in Africa). The error in the yield predication was relatively smaller in America, Europe and East Asia than that in Africa. In the 10 countries with largest cereal production across the world, the prediction error was less than 9% during past three decades.

The effect of water stress displayed in the crop canopy can be effectively monitored by the field based observations. This study focus on the relationship between the crop water stress and spectral signature of the maize crop measured in the Hyper-spectral mode during different growth stage. Maize crop was grown under controlled irrigation and plants were exposed to known water stress condition by limiting water supply. Spectral measurements were made before and after irrigation, using Spectroradiometer (GER 1500) having spectral range of 350 to 1050nm with view angle of 8°. The observations were made during early vegetative, vegetative and flowering stages of crop growth. Water stress displayed by the leaves from green to dry leaf conditions were also observed. Principal component analysis was performed in identifying the best spectral region for discriminating the water stressed and normal irrigated crop spectra. It is found that 840-870nm and 400-450nm were the most appropriate bandwidth for discriminating water stress at different growth stages. Water stressed leaves could be effectively discriminated in the 845-875nm and 620-700nm region. These spectral signatures can also be used in hyperspectral image classification for Hyperion data. Field spectral bandwidth of 840-870nm (indicates the crop water stress) coincides with Hyperion bands 49-52 and 71-73.

To monitor crop growth and predict crop yield, accurate and timely crop growth information is significant, in particularly for large scale farming. As the high cost and low data availability of high-resolution satellite images such as RapidEye, we focus on the time-series low resolution satellite imagery. In this research, NDVI curve, which was retrieved from satellite images of MODIS 8-days 250m surface reflectance, was applied to monitor soybean's yield. Conventional model and vegetation index for yield prediction has problems on describing the growth basic processes affecting yield component formation. In our research, a novel method is developed to well model the Crop Growth Dynamics (CGD) and generate CGD index to describe the soybean's yield component formation. We analyze the standard growth stage of soybean and to model the growth process, we have two key calculate process. The first is normalization of the NDVI-curve coordinate and division of the crop growth based on the standard development stages using EAT (Effective accumulated temperature).The second is modeling the biological growth on each development stage through analyzing the factors of yield component formation. The evaluation was performed through the soybean yield prediction using the CGD Index in the growth stage when the whole dataset for modeling is available and we got precision of 88.5% which is about 10% higher than the conventional method. The validation results showed that prediction accuracy using our CGD modeling is satisfied and can be applied in practice of large scale soybean yield monitoring. © 2014 SPIE.",,"Agriculture; Crops; Forecasting; Remote sensing; Satellites; Surface measurement; Time series; Accumulated temperatures; Conventional methods; Conventional modeling; High resolution satellite images; Modern agricultures; Prediction accuracy; Remote sensing technology; Standard development; Satellite imagery",Conference Paper,Scopus

This study has evaluated the performance of APHRODITE (Asian Precipitation-Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation), PERSIANN (Rainfall Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks), TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission), and AgMERRA (The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications) precipitation products to apply as input data for CSM-CERES-Wheat crop growth simulation model to predict rainfed wheat yield. Daily precipitation output from various sources for 7 years (2000–2007) was obtained and compared with corresponding ground-observed precipitation data for 16 ground stations across the northeast of Iran. Comparisons of ground-observed daily precipitation with corresponding data recorded by different sources of datasets showed a root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 3.5 for all data. AgMERRA and APHRODITE showed the highest correlation (0.68 and 0.87) and index of agreement (d) values (0.79 and 0.89) with ground-observed data. When daily precipitation data were aggregated over periods of 10 days, the RMSE values, r, and d values increased (30, 0.8, and 0.7) for AgMERRA, APHRODITE, PERSIANN, and TRMM precipitation data sources. The simulations of rainfed wheat leaf area index (LAI) and dry matter using various precipitation data, coupled with solar radiation and temperature data from observed ones, illustrated typical LAI and dry matter shape across all stations. The average values of LAImax were 0.78, 0.77, 0.74, 0.70, and 0.69 using PERSIANN, AgMERRA, ground-observed precipitation data, APHRODITE, and TRMM. Rainfed wheat grain yield simulated by using AgMERRA and APHRODITE daily precipitation data was highly correlated (r2 ≥ 70) with those simulated using observed precipitation data. Therefore, gridded data have high potential to be used to supply lack of data and gaps in ground-observed precipitation data. © 2018, ISB.","Crop model; Gauge data; Missing data; Reanalysis; Regional crop yield; Satellite","rain; desert climate; growth, development and aging; information processing; Iran; plant leaf; theoretical model; wheat; Datasets as Topic; Desert Climate; Iran; Models, Theoretical; Plant Leaves; Rain; Triticum",Article,Scopus

A data assimilation method that combines crop growth models with remotely sensed data has been proven to be the most effective method for regional yield estimates. This paper describes an assimilation method that integrates a time series of leaf area index (LAI) retrieved from ETM+ data and a coupled hydrology-crop growth model which links a crop growth model World Food Study (WOFOST) and a hydrology model HYDRUS-1D for regional maize yield estimates using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The coupled hydrology-crop growth model was calibrated and validated using field data to ensure that the model accurately simulated associated state variables and maize growing processes. To identify the parameters that most affected model output, an extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (EFAST) was applied to the model before calibration. The calibration results indicated that the coupled hydrology-crop growth model accurately simulated maize growth processes for the local cultivation variety tested. The coefficient of variations (CVs) for LAI, total above-ground production (TAGP), dry weight of storage organs (WSO), and evapotranspiration (ET) were 13%, 6.9%, 11% and 20%, respectively. The calibrated growth model was then combined with the regional ETM+ LAI data using a sequential data assimilation algorithm (EnKF) to incorporate spatial heterogeneity in maize growth into the coupled hydrology-crop growth model. The theoretical LAI profile for the near future and the final yield were obtained through the EnKF algorithm for 50 sample plots. The CV of the regional yield estimates for these sample plots was 8.7%. Finally, the maize yield distribution for the Zhangye Oasis was obtained as a case study. In general, this research and associated model could be used to evaluate the impacts of irrigation, fertilizer and field management on crop yield at a regional scale. © 2014.","Coupled hydrology-crop growth model; EFAST; EnKF; Remote sensing information","Arid regions; Calibration; Cultivation; Digital storage; Hydrology; Remote sensing; Coefficient of variation; Data assimilation methods; EFAST; EnKF; Ensemble Kalman Filter; Extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test (eFAST); Growth modeling; Remote sensing information; Computer simulation; algorithm; amplitude; arid region; assessment method; calibration; crop yield; cultivation; data set; evapotranspiration; growth modeling; heterogeneity; irrigation; leaf area index; maize; oasis; policy making; prediction; remote sensing; satellite data; China; Gansu",Article,Scopus

LAI can be derived from satellite optical data using models referred to physical-based approaches, which describe the physical processes of energy flow in the soil-vegetation- atmosphere system, and models using empirically derived regression relationships based on spectral vegetation indices (VIs). The first category of models are more general in application because they can account for the different sources of variability, although in many cases the information needed to constrain model inputs is not available. In contrast, empirical models depend on the site and time. The aim of this paper is to create a reliable semi-empirical method, applied in two Mediterranean sites, to estimate LAI with high spatial resolution images. The model uses a minimum dataset of a Landsat 5 TM or SPOT 4 XS image, land cover map and DEM for each area. Specifically, this model calculates the reflectance of initial bands implementing topographic correction with the aid of DEM and metadata of the images and afterwards uses a list of NDVI values that correspond to certain LAI values on different land cover types which has been proposed by the MODIS Land Team. This model has been applied in two areas; in the river basin of Nestos (Greece and Bulgaria) and in the river basin of Tamega (Portugal).

Thus, for an accurate estimation of grain yield, an accurate estimate of HI is very important. Experiments including five nitrogen treatments were conducted at field level to investigate the feasibility of estimating HI of winter wheat from canopy spectral reflectance information in present study. Total nine common vegetation indices (VIs), such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), ratio vegetation index (RVI), transformed vegetation index (TVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), renormalized difference vegetation index (RDVI), difference vegetation index (DVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and green chlorophyll index (CIgreen), were investigated in this work. Results demonstrated that estimating HI from canopy reflectance information based on the partitioning of crop activity before and after flowering can give good results but required long-term dataset of total growing season. Further analysis showed that HI had strong correlations with the accumulated values of VIs from anthesis to maturity period. Moreover, it was found that the correlation between HI and accumulated VI after anthesis was greatly improved by introducing another variable of VI at anthesis using binary regression analysis. The coefficients of determination (R2) of binary regression equations were higher than 0.80, and the root mean square deviations (RMSD) between the estimated HI and measured HI were as low as 0.04. It was suggested canopy spectral reflectance from anthesis to maturity had good performances on HI estimation. With short-term data requirement and good accuracy, the method based on VI dataset of anthesis-maturity period would be more favourable for large area application since the dataset can be easily collected by means of remote sensing.","Harvest index; Spectral reflectance; Vegetation indices; Winter wheat","nitrogen; agricultural parameters; article; canopy; difference vegetation index; enhanced vegetation index; feasibility study; flowering; green chlorophyll index; harvest index; modified soil adjusted vegetation index; nonhuman; normalized difference vegetation index; plant growth; ratio vegetation index; reflectometry; renormalized difference vegetation index; soil adjusted vegetation index; transformed vegetation index; winter wheat; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Today remotely sensed data have been widely applied to crop area estimation, but the result often differs from the statistics of crop area in the Statistical Yearbook, therefore the data of crop yield estimation by using remote sensing data is less adopted in the government's agricultural decision. Moreover, agricultural subsidy policy has been adopted by many countries, which aimed at the protection and development of agriculture. In China, the grain subsidy was provided according to taxed farmland area, a kind of statistics of crop area and usually smaller than the actual crop area, which caused part of peasant profits to be lost. Why the difference between the statistics of crop area in the Statistical Yearbook differ from predicted result by using remote sensing technique? Which is more close to the actual crop area? For answering the above questions and preventing peasant profits from being damaged, this paper studied the middle-season rice area in Honghu city, Hubei Province by using SPOT satellite imagery with a 10-m spatial resolution and data from field sampling survey. The result shows that the statistical area of middle-season rice from the Statistical Yearbook of Honghu city in 2006 was remarkably smaller than the actual and the predicted data of 58788.09 hm2 by remote sensing technique, or 52.156% lower than the latter. The main reason is due to the high ratio of customary unit of crop area adopted in estimation to standard unit (1.507). Besides, some local government concealed the actual rice planting area for evasion of agricultural taxation, which also made the statistical area of the middle-season rice differ from the actual and the predicted data by using remote sensing technique to a certain extent.","Crop area; Difference; Honghu city of Hubei Province; Prediction area by remote sensing; Statistical area","agricultural development; agricultural land; crop yield; estimation method; peasant agriculture; prediction; remote sensing; rice; SPOT; subsidy system; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Honghu; Hubei",Article,Scopus

Nutrient management specialists need simple and accurate estimation techniques to relate crop yields and nutrient utilization in the planning process. The objectives of this study were to: (1) investigate if artificial neural network (ANN) models could effectively predict Maryland corn and soybean yields for typical climatic conditions; (2) compare the prediction capabilities of models at state, regional, and local levels; (3) evaluate ANN model performance relative to variations of developmental parameters; and (4) compare the effectiveness of multiple linear regression models to ANN models. Models were developed using historical yield data at multiple locations throughout Maryland. Field-specific rainfall data and the USDA-NRCS Soil Rating for Plant Growth (SRPG) values were used for each location. SRPG and weekly rainfall means were necessary for effective corn and soybean yield predictions. Adjusting ANN parameters such as learning rate and number of hidden nodes affected the accuracy of crop yield predictions. Optimal learning rates fell between 0.77 and 0.90. Smaller data sets required fewer hidden nodes and lower learning rates in model optimization. ANN models consistently produced more accurate yield predictions than regression models. ANN corn yield models for Maryland resulted in r2 and RMSEs of 0.77 and 1036 versus 0.42 and 1356 for linear regression, respectively. ANN soybean yield models for Maryland resulted in r2 and RMSEs of 0.81 and 214 versus 0.46 and 312 for linear regression, respectively.

The key to fulfilling this promise is accurate segmentation and detection of fruit in images of tree canopies. This paper proposes two new methods for automated counting of fruit in images of mango tree canopies, one using texture-based dense segmentation and one using shape-based fruit detection, and compares the use of these methods relative to existing techniques:—(i) a method based on K-nearest neighbour pixel classification and contour segmentation, and (ii) a method based on super-pixel over-segmentation and classification using support vector machines. The robustness of each algorithm was tested on multiple sets of images of mango trees acquired over a period of 3 years. These image sets were acquired under varying conditions (light and exposure), distance to the tree, average number of fruit on the tree, orchard and season. For images collected under the same conditions as the calibration images, estimated fruit numbers were within 16 % of actual fruit numbers, and the F1 measure of detection performance was above 0.68 for these methods. Results were poorer when models were used for estimating fruit numbers in trees of different canopy shape and when different imaging conditions were used. For fruit-background segmentation, K-nearest neighbour pixel classification based on colour and smoothness or pixel classification based on super-pixel over-segmentation, clustering of dense scale invariant feature transform features into visual words and bag-of-visual-word super-pixel classification using support vector machines was more effective than simple contrast and colour based segmentation. Pixel classification was best followed by fruit detection using an elliptical shape model or blob detection using colour filtering and morphological image processing techniques. Method results were also compared using precision–recall plots.

Among these applications, UAV-based agricultural mapping and monitoring have attracted significant attention from both the research and professional communities. The interest in UAV-based remote sensing for agricultural management is motivated by the need to maximize crop yield. Remote sensing-based crop yield prediction and estimation are primarily based on imaging systems with different spectral coverage and resolution (e.g., RGB and hyperspectral imaging systems). Due to the data volume, RGB imaging is based on frame cameras, while hyperspectral sensors are primarily push-broom scanners. To cope with the limited endurance and payload constraints of low-cost UAVs, the agricultural research and professional communities have to rely on consumer-grade and light-weight sensors. However, the geometric fidelity of derived information from push-broom hyperspectral scanners is quite sensitive to the available position and orientation established through a direct geo-referencing unit onboard the imaging platform (i.e., an integrated Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS). This paper presents an automated framework for the integration of frame RGB images, push-broom hyperspectral scanner data and consumer-grade GNSS/INS navigation data for accurate geometric rectification of the hyperspectral scenes. The approach relies on utilizing the navigation data, together with a modified Speeded-Up Robust Feature (SURF) detector and descriptor, for automating the identification of conjugate features in the RGB and hyperspectral imagery. The SURF modification takes into consideration the available direct geo-referencing information to improve the reliability of the matching procedure in the presence of repetitive texture within a mechanized agricultural field. Identified features are then used to improve the geometric fidelity of the previously ortho-rectified hyperspectral data. Experimental results from two real datasets show that the geometric rectification of the hyperspectral data was improved by almost one order of magnitude. © 2016 by the authors.","Automated image registration; Hyperspectral push-broom scanners; Ortho-rectification; Phenotyping; SURF; UAV-based agricultural management","Agriculture; Air navigation; Automation; Crops; Geometry; Global positioning system; Image resolution; Imaging systems; Inertial navigation systems; Navigation systems; Remote sensing; Scanning; Spectroscopy; Tracking (position); Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Agricultural management; HyperSpectral; Ortho-rectification; Phenotyping; SURF; Hyperspectral imaging",Article,Scopus

Consequently, model simulations can be obtained only at a limited number of locations, i.e. at weather stations with long-term records of daily data. To estimate the potential crop production at country level, we present in this study a geostatistical approach for spatial interpolation and aggregation of crop growth model outputs. As case study, we interpolated, simulated and aggregated crop growth model outputs of sorghum and millet in West-Africa. We used crop growth model outputs to calibrate a linear regression model using environmental covariates as predictors. The spatial regression residuals were investigated for spatial correlation. The linear regression model and the spatial correlation of residuals together were used to predict theoretical crop yield at all locations using kriging with external drift. A spatial standard deviation comes along with this prediction, indicating the uncertainty of the prediction. In combination with land use data and country borders, we summed the crop yield predictions to determine an area total. With spatial stochastic simulation, we estimated the uncertainty of that total production potential as well as the spatial cumulative distribution function. We compared our results with the prevailing agro-ecological Climate Zones approach used for spatial aggregation. Linear regression could explain up to 70% of the spatial variation of the yield. In three out of four cases the regression residuals showed spatial correlation. The potential crop production per country according to the Climate Zones approach was in all countries and cases except one within the 95% prediction interval as obtained after yield aggregation. We concluded that the geostatistical approach can estimate a country's crop production, including a quantification of uncertainty. In addition, we stress the importance of the use of geostatistics to create tools for crop modelling scientists to explore relationships between yields and spatial environmental variables and to assist policy makers with tangible results on yield gaps at multiple levels of spatial aggregation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..","Geostatistics; Spatial aggregation; Spatial prediction; Uncertainty; Yield gap; Yield potential","aggregation behavior; agricultural modeling; agrometeorology; crop production; data acquisition; geostatistics; growth rate; millet; planning method; policy making; prediction; sorghum; spatial analysis; uncertainty analysis; West Africa",Article,Scopus

A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based method is employed to evaluate crop condition by inter-annual comparisons of both spatial variability (using NDVI images) and seasonal dynamics (based on crop condition profiles). Since this type of method will generate false information if there are changes in crop rotation, cropping area or crop phenology, information on cropped/uncropped arable land is integrated to improve the accuracy of crop condition monitoring. The study proposes a new method to retrieve adjusted NDVI for cropped arable land during the growing season of winter crops by integrating 16-day composite Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data at 250-m resolution with a cropped and uncropped arable land map derived from the multi-temporal China Environmental Satellite (Huan Jing Satellite) charge-coupled device (HJ-1 CCD) images at 30-m resolution. Using the land map's data on cropped and uncropped arable land, a pixel-based uncropped arable land ratio (UALR) at 250-m resolution was generated. Next, the UALR-adjusted NDVI was produced by assuming that the MODIS reflectance value for each pixel is a linear mixed signal composed of the proportional reflectance of cropped and uncropped arable land. When UALR-adjusted NDVI data are used for crop condition assessment, results are expected to be more accurate, because: (i) pixels with only uncropped arable land are not included in the assessment; and (ii) the adjusted NDVI corrects for interannual variation in cropping area. On the provincial level, crop growing profiles based on the two kinds of NDVI data illustrate the difference between the regular and the adjusted NDVI, with the difference depending on the total area of uncropped arable land in the region. The results suggested that the proposed method can be used to improve the assessment of early crop condition, but additional evaluation in other major crop producing regions is needed to better assess the method's application in other regions and agricultural systems. © 2014 by the authors.","Crop condition assessment; Cropped and uncropped arable land; Linear unmixing; NDVI; North China Plain","Agriculture; Charge coupled devices; Condition monitoring; Cultivation; Forestry; Image reconstruction; Land use; Pixels; Radiometers; Reflection; Satellite imagery; Arable land; Crop condition; Linear unmixing; NDVI; North China Plain; Crops",Article,Scopus

The increasing scarcity of rain gauges in West Africa generally limits assessments of the degree and spatial extent of hardship arising from rainfall deficiency. However, the improved availability and robustness of satellite-based rainfall products since the early 1980s, offers an alternative source of rainfall data which is spatially, and often temporally, more complete than rain gauges. This research evaluates four satellite-based rainfall products for their ability to represent both long term rainfall trends such as recovery from decadal droughts, and trends in seasonal rainfall variables relevant to crop yield prediction. The Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) rainfall product at 5 km resolution, was observed to be consistently most representative of ground station rainfall across northern Nigeria over a 35-year period 1981–2015, followed by TARCAT. CHIRPS was found to give a good overall prediction of rainfall amounts at dekadal, monthly and seasonal time scales, and was therefore used in the study to represent the typical performance of satellite rainfall datasets. The CHIRPS-observed increase in growing season length since the 1970s and 80s drought decades, was accompanied by significant rainfall increases in the later part of the growing season, especially marked in northern and northeastern states. This is especially important for the main subsistence crops sorghum and millet as the risk of late drought impedes swelling of the grain, affecting dry weight production. The CHIRPS data also indicate a significant decrease in dry spells in the northwest and southern parts of the study area, which would have favourable outcomes for crop production in the densely populated rural hinterlands of the cities of Sokoto, Jos and Abuja. In view of the continued intra-and inter-annual rainfall variability across northern Nigeria, and amid rapid rural population growth recently, a return to the rainfall levels of the drought decades, would require informed response.

India is one of the major rice producer and consumer in South Asia; more than 50% of the Indian population depends on rice as staple food. Rice is mainly grown in kharif season, which contributed 84% of the total annual rice production of the country. Rice cultivation in India is rainfed, which depends largely on rains, so reliability of the rainfall forecast plays a crucial role for planning the kharif rice crop. In the present study, an attempt has been made to test the reliability of seasonal and sub-seasonal ERFS summer monsoon rainfall forecasts for kharif rice yield predictions at Kharagpur, West Bengal by using CERES-Rice (DSSATv4.5) model. These ERFS forecasts are produced as monthly and seasonal mean values and are converted into daily sequences with stochastic weather generators for use with crop growth models. The daily sequences are generated from ERFS seasonal (June–September) and sub-seasonal (July–September, August–September, and September) summer monsoon (June to September) rainfall forecasts which are considered as input in CERES-rice crop simulation model for the crop yield prediction for hindcast (1985–2008) and real-time mode (2009–2015). The yield simulated using India Meteorological Department (IMD) observed daily rainfall data is considered as baseline yield for evaluating the performance of predicted yields using the ERFS forecasts. The findings revealed that the stochastic disaggregation can be used to disaggregate the monthly/seasonal ERFS forecasts into daily sequences. The year to year variability in rice yield at Kharagpur is efficiently predicted by using the ERFS forecast products in hindcast as well as real time, and significant enhancement in the prediction skill is noticed with advancement in the season due to incorporation of observed weather data which reduces uncertainty of yield prediction. The findings also recommend that the normal and above normal yields are predicted well in advance using the ERFS forecasts. The outcomes of this study are useful to farmers for taking appropriate decisions well in advance for climate risk management in rice production during different stages of the crop growing season at Kharagpur. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria.",,"crop production; crop yield; growth modeling; growth response; precipitation assessment; rice; risk assessment; seasonal variation; stochasticity; weather forecasting; India; Kharagpur; West Bengal",Article,Scopus

The crop growth model based on field scale is limited when it is extrapolated to regional scale to estimate crop yield due to the uncertainty of the input parameters. The data assimilation method which combines crop growth model and remotely sensed data has been proven to be the most effective method in regional yield estimation. The methods based on cost function are powerless with crop dynamic growth simulation and state variable dynamic update. However, sequence assimilation method has more advantages to overcome these problems, this paper presents a method of assimilation of time series HJ-1 A/B Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) into the coupled model (e.g. WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) crop growth model and A two layer Canopy Reflectance Model (ACRM) radiative transfer mode) for winter wheat yield estimates using Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) at the regional scale. The WOFOST model was selected as the crop growth model and calibrated and validated by the field measured data in order to accurately simulate the state variables and the growing process of winter wheat. The theoretically optimal time series LAI profile was obtained with the EnKF algorithm to reduce the errors which existed in both time series HJ-1 CCD NDVI and WOFOST-ACRM model. Finally, the winter wheat yield at the county level was estimated based on the optimized WOFOST model running on the wheat planting pixel. The experiment illustrates that in the potential mode, the EnKF algorithm has significantly improved the regional winter wheat yield estimates (R2=0.51, RMSE=775 kg/ha) over the WOFOST simulation without assimilation (R2=0.25, RMSE=2168 kg/ha) at county level compared to the official statistical yield data. Meanwhile, in the water-limited mode the results showed a high correlation (R2=0.53, RMSE=3005 kg/ha) with statistical data. In general, our results indicate that EnKF is a reliable optimization method for assimilating remotely sensed data into the crop growth model for predicting regional winter wheat yield. © 2012.","Ensemble Kalman Filter; HJ-1; Winter wheat yield; WOFOST","Bandpass filters; Cost functions; Food supply; Kalman filters; Remote sensing; Time series; Uncertainty analysis; Canopy reflectance model; Data assimilation methods; Ensemble Kalman Filter; HJ-1; Normalized difference vegetation index; Remotely sensed data; Winter wheat yields; WOFOST; Crops",Article,Scopus

The major aspects of remote sensing are timely estimates of agriculture crop yield, prediction of pest. Therefore, in this paper, an attempt has been made to investigate the utility and potential application of microwave remote sensing for detection of pest infestation within sorghum field. The studies were made on crop sorghum (Meethi Sudan) that is a forage variety and the pest observed was a species of grasshopper. The beds of crop sorghum were specially prepared for pests as well as microwave scattering measurements. In first phase of study, dependence of occurrence of pests on sorghum plant parameters (i.e., crop covered moist soil (SM), plant height (PH), leaf area index (LAI), percentage biomass (BIO), total chlorophyll (TC)) have been observed and analyzed and it was noticed that pests were more dependent on sorghum chlorophyll than other plant parameters, while climatic conditions were taken as constant. An empirical relationship has been developed between occurrence of pests and TC with quite significant values of coefficient of determination (r 2 = 0.82). These crop parameters are easily assessable through microwave remote sensing and therefore they can form the basis for prediction of pest remotely. In the second phase of this study, several observations were carried out for various growth stages of sorghum using scatterometer for both like polarizations (i.e., HH- and VV-) and different incidence angles at X-band (9.5 GHz). Linear regression analysis was carried out to obtain the best suitable incidence angle and polarization to assess the sorghum TC. VV-pol gives better results than HH-pol and incidence angle should be more than 40° for both like polarizations for assessing the sorghum TC at X-band. A negative correlation has been obtained between TC and scattering coefficient with the r 2 values (0.69 and 0.75 for HH- and VV-pol, respectively). The TC assessed by the microwave measurements was helpful to estimate the occurrence of pests on sorghum. Based on both phase of study an algorithm is proposed to estimate the number of pest on sorghum by remote sensing method. There is a quite good agreement between observed occurrence of pest and assessed occurrence of pest. © 2007.","Microwave remote sensing; Pest infestation; Polarization; Scattering coefficient","Crops; Polarization; Remote sensing; Microwave remote sensing; Pest infestation; Plant parameters; Scattering coefficient; Pest control; Farm Crops; Pest Control; Polarization; Remote Sensing",Article,Scopus

The data assimilation method which combined crop growth model and multi-source observed data has been proven to be the most effective method to simulate the crop growth process and predict crop yields. Based on the observed LAI, the time-series LAI data sets were obtained by using the smooth unequally spaced interpolation. With the support of amount of related data, the crop model of Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES)-Wheat can be used to simulate the growth of the winter wheat, and the particle filtering-based data assimilation strategy also could be implemented to improve the CERES-Wheat simulation process. Through the assimilation strategy, the incorporation between the observed and modeled LAIs was performed under the dynamic framework of the winter wheat growth process such that the LAI simulation was sequentially optimized, which led to optimal yield estimation. Comparing the measured the data with the assimilation and no assimilation results, it obvious showed that the yield estimations were dramatically improved after assimilation. Then considering the influence of the observed leaf area index on the assimilation process at multi-temporal scale, this paper try to analysis the uncertainty of the assimilation results from three aspects of temporal scale: First, Assimilating the observed LAI data at five kinds of temporal resolution (2-day, 4-day, 8-day, 16-day, 32-day), the results showed that the accuracy of the yield estimation tended to significantly improve as the temporal resolution of assimilating LAI increased from 32-day to 2-day. In addition, as the increasing of the temporal resolution, the computing time increased dramatically. Second, the observed LAI data was applied to assimilation with the four different stages of crop growth (green-jointing, jointing-heading, heading-mature, green-mature). The results showed that the accuracy of the yield estimation by assimilating the LAI at the stages of the green-mature (the whole growth phase) is the highest, while the accuracy during the stages from the green-jointing is the lowest. And also the accuracy during the stages from jointing-heading is the second highest. Third, the observed LAI data was used to assimilation with synthesizing the temporal resolution and the stages of crop growth (three kinds of temporal resolution (2, 4, 8 day) and four stages of crop growth). The results showed that on the premise of the optimal efficiency and accuracy, the optimal plan is to select observed LAI by using the temporal resolution of 8 day during the stages from jointing-heading. This study will be a better influence on decreasing the calculation time and improving the effect for the crop model data assimilation. © 2015 IEEE.","CERES-Wheat; Crop yield; data assimilation; LAI; multi-temporal; particle filtering","Agriculture; Bandpass filters; Food supply; Forecasting; Monte Carlo methods; Signal filtering and prediction; Uncertainty analysis; CERES-Wheat; Crop yield; Data assimilation; Multi-temporal; Particle Filtering; Crops",Conference Paper,Scopus

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the possibility of using MODIS-NDVI to forecast crop yield on the Canadian Prairies and also to identify the best time for making a reliable crop yield forecast. Growing season (May-August) MODIS 10-day composite NDVI data for the years 2000-2006 were obtained from the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS). Crop yield data (i.e., barley, canola, field peas and spring wheat) for each Census Agricultural Region (CAR) were obtained from Statistics Canada. Correlation and regression analyses were performed using 10-day composite NDVI and running average NDVI for 2, 3 and 4 dekads with the highest correlation coefficients (r) as the independent variables and crop grain yield as the dependent variable. To test the robustness and the ability of the generated regression models to forecast crops grain yield, one year at a time was removed and new regression models were developed, which were then used to predict the grain yield for the missing year. Results showed that MODIS-NDVI data can be used effectively to predict crop yield on the Canadian Prairies. Depending on the agro-climatic zone, the power function models developed for each crop accounted for 48 to 90%, 32 to 82%, 53 to 89% and 47 to 80% of the grain yield variability for barley, canola, field peas and spring wheat, respectively, with the best prediction in the semi-arid zone. Overall (54 out of 84), the % difference of the predicted from the actual grain yield was within ±10%. On the whole, RMSE values ranged from 150 to 654, 108 to 475, 204 to 677 and 104 to 714kgha-1 for barley, canola, field peas and spring wheat, respectively. When expressed as percentages of actual yield, the RMSE values ranged from 8 to 25% for barley, 10 to 58% for canola, 10 to 38% for field peas and 6 to 34% for spring wheat. The MAE values followed a similar trend but were slightly lower than the RMSE values. For all the crops, the best time for making grain yield predictions was found to be from the third dekad of June through the third dekad of July in the sub-humid zone and from the first dekad of July through the first dekad of August in both the semi-arid and arid zones. This means that accurate crop grain yield forecasts using the developed regression models can be made one to two months before harvest. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Canadian Prairie; Crop yield forecasting; MODIS; NDVI; Remote Sensing","barley; canola; correlation; crop yield; forecasting method; growing season; humid environment; legume; MODIS; NDVI; prairie; radiometer; regression analysis; remote sensing; satellite data; semiarid region; wheat; Canada; Brassica napus; Brassica napus var. napus; Hordeum; Pisum sativum; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Agricultural targets also vary spatially with differences observed from field to field, as well as within individual fields. The heterogeneity of corn-growing conditions in Mexico makes accurate data for crop type, crop condition and crop yield prediction difficult to obtain. Yield predictions are needed by the federal government to estimate, ahead of harvest time, the amount of corn required to be imported in order to meet the expected domestic shortfall. In this project a methodology for the estimation of corn yield ahead of harvest time is developed which uses radar and optical remote sensing and which specifically considers the corn-growing situation in Central Mexico. Radar based crop type classification requires data sets with multiple polarizations. Recent research to assess relative classification accuracies of multi-polarized combinations for target crops using airborne data has been reported. In addition to identifying crop type and variety, identifying crop growth stage is valuable. Crop condition, loosely defined as the vigor or health of a crop in a particular growth stage, is related to crop productivity and yield; however, the relationship is complex. Main crop condition indicators include biomass, height, leaf area and contents of plant water, chlorophyll and nitrogen. Crop-type and crop-condition mapping are among the applications that are expected to benefit the most from the technical enhancements embodied by RADARSAT-2. The potential of RADARSAT-1 data for these applications has been rated as ""limited"", whereas for RADARSAT-2 data this potential is anticipated to be ""strong"". The Science and Operational Applications Research for RADARSAT-2 Program (SOAR) is promoting the evaluation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) capabilities by providing images to selected research projects which include the present one.The objectives of this project are: a) use RADARSAT-2 data and optical data to determine cultivated areas and monitor crop condition for obtaining better estimations of crop yield; b) obtain polarization signatures from RADARSAT-2 data for corn and relate these to Leaf Area Index and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) crop parameters and vegetation indexes, to establish indicators of crop condition and produce estimates for crop yield; c) use field data collected for three key corn crop growth stages over 300 pilot plots during 2001-2006, and increase the number of plots to build a database to support accuracy studies using RADARSAT-2 data. The expected benefits of this project are: to obtain knowledge about crop type, crop condition and crop yield with better accuracy than with current methodologies; to support national corn farmers associations; to design agriculture related activities within State agriculture plans; to support the corn product industry and aid government decision making.

Remote sensing techniques have become popular in estimating actual crop evapotranspiration and hence crop water requirements in recent decades due to the advantages they offer to users, e.g. low cost, regional data and use of maps instead of point measurements as well as saving time. The use of earth observation data supports models' accuracy in the procedure for assessing water footprint, since no average values are used: instead, users have real values for the specific parameters. The present study provides two examples of how remote sensing techniques are used essentially for estimating evapotranspiration along with crop yield, two basic parameters, for assessing water footprint. Two different case studies have been illustrated to define the methodology proposed, which refers to Mediterranean conditions and can be applied after inferring the necessary field data of each crop. The first case study refers to the application of Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) for estimating evapotranspiration, while the second refers to the Crop Yield prediction. Both elements, such as evapotranspiration and crop yield, are vital for water footprint accounting. Firstly, the SEBAL was adopted, under the essential adaptations for local soil and meteorological conditions for estimating groundnut water requirements. Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ and Landsat 8 OLI images were used to retrieve the required spectral data. The SEBAL model is enhanced with empirical equations regarding crop canopy factors, in order to increase the accuracy of crop evapotranspiration estimation. Maps were created for evapotranspiration (ET) using the SEBAL modified model for the area of interest. The results were compared with measurements from an evaporation pan, used as a reference. Statistical comparisons showed that the modified SEBAL can predict ETc in a very effective and accurate way and provide water footprint modellers with high-level crop water data. Yield prediction plays a vital role in calculating water footprint. Having real values rather than taking reference (or averaged) values from FAO is an advantage that Earth Observation means can provide. This is very important in econometric or any other prediction models used for estimating water footprint because using average data reduces accuracy. In this context, crop and soil parameters along with remotely sensed data can be used to develop models that can provide users with accurate yield estimations. In a second step, crop and soil parameters along with the normalized difference vegetation index were correlated to examine whether crop yield can be predicted and to define the actual time-window to predict the yield. Statistical and remote sensing techniques were then applied to derive and map a model that can predict crop yield. The algorithm developed for this purpose indicates that remote sensing observations can predict crop yields effectively and accurately. Using the statistical Student's t test, it was found that there was no statistically significant difference between predicted and real values for crop yield. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2017.",,"algorithm; crop yield; energy balance; EOS; evapotranspiration; Landsat; Mediterranean environment; model test; NDVI; prediction; remote sensing; surface energy; water footprint; water use",Article,Scopus

Satellite remote sensing provides an effective means for regional and global cropland monitoring, particularly in data-sparse regions that lack reliable ground observations and reporting. The conventional approach of using visible and near-infrared based vegetation index (VI) observations has prevailed for decades since the onset of the global satellite era. However, other satellite data encompass diverse spectral ranges that may contain complementary information on crop growth and yield, but have been largely understudied and underused. Here we conducted one of the first attempts at synergizing multiple satellite data spanning a diverse spectral range, including visible, near-infrared, thermal and microwave, into one framework to estimate crop yield for the U.S. Corn Belt, one of the world's most important food baskets. Specifically, we included MODIS Enhanced VI (EVI), estimated Gross Primary Production based on GOME-2 solar-induced fluorescence (SIF-GPP), thermal-based ALEXI Evapotranspiration (ET), QuikSCAT Ku-band radar backscatter, and AMSR-E X-band passive microwave Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) in this study, benchmarked on USDA county-level crop yield statistics. We used Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), an effective statistical model for dimension reduction, to distinguish commonly shared and unique individual information from the various satellite data and other ancillary climate information for crop yield estimation. In the PLSR model that includes all of the satellite data and climate variables from 2007 to 2009, we assessed the first two major PLSR components and found that the first component (an integrated proxy of crop aboveground biomass) explained 82% variability of modelled crop yield, and the second component (dominated by environmental stresses) explained 15% variability of modelled crop yield. We found that most of the satellite derived metrics (e.g. SIF-GPP, radar backscatter, EVI, VOD, ALEXI-ET) share common information related to aboveground crop biomass (i.e. the first component). For this shared information, the SIF-GPP and backscatter data contain almost the same amount of information as EVI at the county scale. When removing the above shared component from all of the satellite data, we found that EVI and SIF-GPP do not provide much extra information; instead, Ku-band backscatter, thermal-based ALEXI-ET, and X-band VOD provide unique information on environmental stresses that improves overall crop yield predictive skill. In particular, Ku-band backscatter and associated differences between morning and afternoon overpasses contribute unique information on crop growth and environmental stress. Overall, using satellite data from various spectral bands significantly improves regional crop yield predictions. The additional use of ancillary climate data (e.g. precipitation and temperature) further improves model skill, in part because the crop reproductive stage related to harvest index is highly sensitive to environmental stresses but they are not fully captured by the satellite data used in our study. We conclude that using satellite data across various spectral ranges can improve monitoring of large-scale crop growth and yield beyond what can be achieved from individual sensors. These results also inform the synergistic use and development of current and next generation satellite missions, including NASA ECOSTRESS, SMAP, and OCO-2, for agricultural applications. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Crop yield; Fluorescence; Microwave; Optical; Partial least square regression6; Radar; Thermal","Agriculture; Backscattering; Climate models; Crops; Ecology; Fluorescence; Infrared devices; Microwaves; NASA; Radar; Remote sensing; Satellites; Vegetation; Video on demand; Crop yield; Microwave satellite data; Optical; Partial least square (PLS); Partial least square regression; Solar-induced fluorescences; Thermal; Visible and near infrared; Space-based radar; AMSR-E; backscatter; crop yield; environmental stress; estimation method; fluorescence; GOME; least squares method; MODIS; NSCAT; OCO; optical depth; optical method; QuikSCAT; radar altimetry; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite mission; vegetation index; Corn Belt; United States; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Its information is also essential for many applications, such as agricultural drought monitoring, crop status monitoring and crop yield prediction. Sentinel-1 of the European Space Agency (ESA) is composed of 2 satellites, Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B, which share the same orbital plane with a 180° orbital phasing difference. The Sentinel-1 mission can provide C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with a global revisit time of just 6 days and high spatial resolution of about tens of meters, thus showing a strong potential for global soil moisture monitoring at high/moderate spatial resolutions. The aim of this study was to investigate the capability of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data with a short repeating cycle in soil moisture estimation over agricultural fields. In order to retrieve soil moisture, an algorithm based on the change detection technique was utilized. This algorithm (referred to as alpha approximation approach) relies on the assumptions that the contributions of vegetation and surface roughness to the radar backscattered signal are multiplicative. Therefore, the effects of vegetation and surface roughness on radar backscattering coefficients can be decoupled from the effects of soil moisture changes by rationing multi-temporal like-polarized (HH and VV) intensities between two close acquisition dates. The ratio is expected to track changes in soil moisture only since the changes of surface roughness, canopy structure and vegetation biomass take place at longer temporal scales than soil moisture changes. The alpha approximation approach was firstly evaluated by comparing with data sets simulated by a theoretical radiative transfer (RT) scattering model. It was found that the alpha approximation approach was overall in good agreement with the RT scattering model without introducing significant errors for bare surface and low vegetation area, which confirmed that the alpha approximation approach was a simple and effective way to reduce the influences of vegetation and surface roughness. Furthermore, under the assumption of alpha approximation, the ratio of 2 consecutive backscatter measurements could be approximately represented as the squared ratio of corresponding Bragg scattering coefficients. For Sentinel-1 SAR data with only one like-polarized channel (i.e. VV), N SAR acquisitions would result in N - 1 linear equations in N unknown Bragg scattering coefficients. To solve this underdetermined system of equations, a bounded linear least-squares optimization was applied. Once the unknown Bragg scattering coefficients were retrieved, the relative dielectric constant could be analytically derived with the soil moisture being estimated by the inversion of microwave dielectric model. The alpha approximation approach was then applied to 4 consecutive Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired over Huailai experiment field. Soil moisture maps were successfully obtained for each date. The results were validated using ground measurements on one acquisition date, with root mean squared error (RMSE) value of 0.06 cm3/cm3 and mean bias value of 0.01 cm3/cm3. The results demonstrated the overall good performance of the alpha approximation approach. These results imply that multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data show great potential in achieving high resolution and accurate soil moisture retrievals over agricultural fields. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

UAV is characterized by high mobility, low cost and automated acquisition of the remote sensing data. These characteristics of UAV can be used to acquire high resolution images, and therefore, they are widely used in precision agriculture, pest forecasting, crop yield prediction, and so on. However, due to the restrictions of acquisition equipment and flight height, the task area may not be fully covered in acquired images. So it is necessary to mosaic the gathered image. In the process of using the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm for the mosaic of crop remote sensing images, the feature points were few and the effect of mosaic was poor because of the low contrast of the crop remote sensing images. To solve this problem, the contrast experiment was conducted for analyzing the steps of SIFT algorithm using the low altitude crop remote sensing images of past years. It was noted that the images were blurred because of Gaussian transform in the stage of image preprocessing and Gaussian pyramid constructing, which led to the lack of the feature points. Aiming at this problem, we proposed to use a sharpening filter to highlight the details of the image and increase the number of feature points after the Gauss transform. In the stage of searching feature points, after analyzing the feature points on the same scale, we found the feature points concentrated in the regions where the color changed obviously; while in the different scales, the overall distribution of the feature points was inversely proportional to the scale. To prevent the reduction of the feature points caused by the same sampling step in the regions of high scale, in this paper, a search method of feature points based on adaptive sampling step was used to achieve uniform distribution of the feature points, because the uniform distribution of feature points was more conducive to image mosaic. A larger sampling step was used in the low-scale region and a smaller sampling step was used in the high-scale region. In the phase of feature matching, the feature points of crop remote sensing images were mostly concentrated at the minimum value, and a few maximum points often did not affect the image matching effect, but it would increase the amount of calculation. Therefore, this paper adopted non-minimum suppression to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. In order to verify the validity of the proposed algorithm, we carried out the experiment based on UAV remote sensing platform from July to August in 2016. Through the contrast experiment using SIFT algorithm and proposed algorithm, we could see that, as for low altitude crop remote sensing images, the number of feature points was averagely increased by 77.5% after optimization, the distribution of feature points was also more uniform, the number of matching points averagely increased by 15 pairs and the matching rate averagely increased by 9.46%; for the crop images that could not be stitched by SIFT algorithm, the proposed algorithm could extract more than 8 pairs of matching points, and this satisfied the condition of image mosaic. Experiments have showed that the custom sharpening filter can extract more feature points, and after introducing the adaptive sampling step, the distribution of the feature points is more uniform, and the optimized algorithm keeps the robustness. Therefore, this algorithm is more suitable for the crop remote sensing images mosaic than SIFT algorithm. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Accurately investigating and monitoring crop growth information provides invaluable information for agricultural management, planning and decision-making, and further ensures sustainable development of agriculture. Guanzhong area is a main food production region of Northwest China, however, the varied topography, including loess hilly-gully region, Weihe plain and Qinling mountain, makes crop information extraction challenged and complicated. In order to obtain winter wheat planting information of Guanzhong area in 2014, thirty phases of MODIS NDVI image from September 2013 to December 2014 were used, the images were reconstructed by iterativeing Savitzky-Golay filter in time sequence, and the characteristics of NDVI profiles of the typical objects selected from filtered images were analyzed. And then the non-cropland was masked based on the characteristics analyzed above. On account of the special NDVI profile of winter wheat, the twi-difference algorithm was applied to the selection of 17 phases' image during period of November 2013 and July 2014, and the NDVI peaks were identified. From the local crop calendar and the characteristics of typical NDVI profiles, it was found that except winter wheat and rapeseeds, the rest of the crops did not show NDVI peaks during the selected period. Interestingly, winter wheat had two peaks in its growing season. The first one was appeared before the coming winter because of the snow or frost, and the second one was the normal growing peak. Rapeseeds had a single peak which was lower than that of winter wheat. Thus, the winter wheat of Guanzhong area was identified at the pixel level by combining the pixels which had double peaks and single peak with NDVI value under 0.65. For verifying the accuracy of extraction, the winter wheat growth area was measured at four typical plots of 1 km×1 km, which were used to compare with the remote sensing results. Besides, totally 100 winter wheat NDVI profiles were sampled to compare with the artificial interpretation at the pixel level. The results showed that the winter wheat was mainly distributed at two regions in Guanzhong area. One was located in the river valley of middle reaches of Weihe river, and the other one was located in the wide Weibei plain of the east side of Jinghe river. Meanwhile, the winter wheat presented a scattered pattern at the loess hilly-gully area in the north, and did not appear at the mountainous area in the south. The total area of winter wheat in Guanzhong area in 2014 was 8.882×105 hm2, and its areas in Xi'an, Tongchuan, Xianyang, Baoji and Weinan were 1.958×105 hm2, 2.296×105 hm2, 1.704×105 hm2, 2.222×105 hm2 and 2.769×105 hm2, respectively. Compared with the statistics of government, the total relative error of Guanzhong area was 3.70%, with variation of 1.08%~9.02% at the city level. The maximum relative error was 9.02% which was occurred at Baoji. The accuracies of four plots of Changwu, Yintai, Fufeng and Yangling were 17.3%, 15.1%, 5.6% and 7.7%, respectively. Besides, the accuracy of sampled 100 NDVI profiles at the pixel level reached 90.28%. The results indicated that exacting the crop information using NDVI time-series at a topography complicated region was feasible and it can be applied to the other regions of Northwest China for making plan of crop planting, agricultural resource allocation and monitoring crop growing. © 2017, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

Cultivation began by the last quarter of the 19th Century occupying 50% of the surface at present. Low input agriculture, in combination with livestock production, was performed till 1970, afterwards soybean (Glicyne max (L). Merr.) crop was introduced. This crop replaced pastures and at present it accounts for 60% of the grain crop seeded surface. During the 2007-2008 growing season 382 sites, widespread over the region, were sampled up to 1 m depth and carbonate R. Alvarez, J. L. carbon, organic carbon, and total nitrogen stocks were determined in these soil samples. Land use had no effect on inorganic carbon content, which accounted for one third of total soil carbon. Aggregation of soil map information showed that the carbonate carbon stock of the region was estimated to be 1.9 Gt. Organic carbon was affected by land use. Cropped soils lost 16% of their organic carbon stock up to 50 cm depth. The overall organic carbon stock of the Pampas was estimated to be 4.2 Gt. This estimation was achieved combining an artificial neural network model for carbon estimation that used as inputs climate, textural, and land use information, and satellite image classification that referred to land use per pampean county. The net flux of C-CO2 from soils to the atmosphere as the consequence of cultivation was estimated to be 0.33 Gt. Cropping effect on total nitrogen stock was similar to the effect on organic carbon. The average C/N ratio of the soils was 8.9, with only small differences between land use types and depth layers. When comparing present organic carbon and nitrogen stocks with those estimated from soil maps corresponding to surveys performed ca. 40 years ago, we observed that areas with high carbon and nitrogen contents tended to loose carbon and nitrogen and areas with low levels tended to maintain the levels or increase them. The maintenance or increase of carbon could be explained by increases in rainfall due to climate change and the increase of crop residue inputs of higher yielding crops, despite the soybean adoption in rotations. Additionally, the adoption of no-till as the most common tillage system favored carbon gain of many soils. The Pampean agroecosystems have a positive nitrogen balance with an annual gain of ca. 1 Mt N yr-1. The main nitrogen input to soils is through biological nitrogen fixation, both by leguminous pasture and soybean, which represents ca. 5 times the fertilizer input. In sites with annual crop rotations the nitrogen balance is near neutral. Productivity of Pampean soils is regulated by available water holding capacity and organic carbon content. Changes in carbon levels produced by the agricultural use have little impact on productivity. The effects of different management practices on organic carbon and some labile fractions (microbial biomass, in vitro mineralized carbon, particulate carbon, light fraction carbon) were assessed in numerous field experiments, performed mainly in the humid portion of the Pampas. The labile fractions of organic matter are not good indicators of future changes in the carbon content of Pampean soils. These fractions change more pronounced than organic carbon only when carbon changes are greater than 25-50% but vary in equal measure or even with an opposite trend below this threshold. Neither these fractions, nor the potentially mineralizable nitrogen or the organic matter/clay+silt ratio are good predictors of the nitrate level at planting or crop yields. Crop yield prediction could not be improved by using the mentioned labile fractions instead of organic carbon in models. Conversely, biological fractionations, determined by in vitro nitrogen mineralization, allowed a better soil nitrogen mineralization prediction under field conditions than using only carbon and nitrogen stocks. An artificial neural network model was fitted that predicted field nitrogen mineralization using as inputs, land use informatiooil texture, temperature, water content, total nitrogen stock, and the in vitro mineralization test results, with very good performance (R2= 0.76). The impact of cultivation on soil nitrogen supplying capacity was assessed for by applying this network. In average, cultivation produced an 80% decrease in the nitrogen mineralization capacity of soils. Despite soil nitrogen was only moderately affected by cropping, the biological fractionation method, coupled with artificial intelligence modeling, showed great significant soil degradation in the Pampas. Present levels of nitrogen mineralization capacity of soils are not enough to sustain high to medium wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and corn (Zea mayz L.) yield and fertilization has become a required practice. Our results show that pampean soils loose only a small fraction of their organic matter content, but this fraction had a deep impact on soil fertility. Biological fractionation, not physical fractionation of organic matter, allowed to asses cropping effects on soil quality, and resulted in the development of suitable methods for agronomic purposes in the Pampas. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The incorporation of any form of automation through the means of machine learning algorithms is still in incipient stage. This paper aims to introduce a fundamental approach to inaugurate the use of machine learning systems in the farming process. A comparative study between machine learning algorithms had been carried out in order to determine which algorithm is the most accurate in predicting the best crop for a particular land. Here, the best crop signifies the crop which had the most increase in terms of yield per unit area compared to previous years. This will ensure proper crop allocation throughout the country since optimal production for each crop will be secured. It will also increase the farmer's revenue margin. The study focuses on six major crops of Bangladesh which are Aman rice, Aus rice, Boro rice, Potato, Wheat and Jute. The algorithms that were used are Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and K-Nearest Neighbor Regression (KNNR). Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) gave the most accurate results during the analysis and was incorporated into an android application.

However, this way of farming here is still at the initial stage. The research suggests area based beneficial crop rank before the cultivation process. It indicates the crops that are cost effective for cultivation for a particular area of land. To achieve these results, we are considering six major crops which are Aus rice, Aman rice, Boro rice, Potato, Jute and Wheat.

The study area included 25 districts of Maharashtra and used climate and cropping data from year 1983 to 2012 (30 years). Seasonal Rainfall in millimeters (mm) and crop yield production data in tonnes/hectare (t/h) for Jowar crop were used in the study. Association Rule Mining techniques were carried out on the data set to ascertain the relationship between patterns of rainfall and crop production for the jowar crop. The study examined the temporal and spatial variability in rainfall and crop yield production. Association rules were developed to characterise the crop production for various districts and years related to the drought period. A number of interesting associations were derived with rainfall variability and crop yield production for Maharashtra state of India.

Most solutions for yield forecast rely on NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data which, besides being time-consuming to acquire and process, only allows forecasting once crop season has already started. To bring scalability for yield forecast, in the present paper we describe a system that incorporates satellite-derived precipitation and soil properties datasets, seasonal climate forecasting data from physical models and other sources to produce a pre-season prediction of soybean/maize yield-with no need of NDVI data. This system provides significantly useful results by the exempting the need for high-resolution remote-sensing data and allowing farmers to prepare for adverse climate influence on the crop cycle. In our studies, we forecast the soybean and maize yields for Brazil and USA, which corresponded to 44% of the world's grain production in 2016.

The agrarian economy was largely consumption-oriented and there were poor irrigation facilities and simple agricultural implements. Agricultural yield was very low and dependency on nature was very high. The food grains were not enough to feed the population. With a view to augment the yield, the Indian government had no option but to introduce Green Revolution. The Green Revolution was a movement towards excessive mechanisation of agriculture. The agriculturists were motivated and assisted to undertake the technology-based farming. Irrigation facilities were developed. However, the results of Green Revolution were not uniform all over the country. Neither has there has been uniform impact on all kinds of crops nor has there been uniform impact on all the regions and all categories of farmers. Even today the farmer falls prey to the risks unleashed by the nature. Success or failure of rain fed vegetation depends upon the sample and amounts of rainfall. But, other factors like temperature, photoperiod and grid additionally notably influence crop boom and yield. The analysis of climate performs a key role in planning better farming structures to enhance and stabilise yields, and to design appropriate crop breeding strategies. With the use of technology, it has also become possible to minimise the risks involved in agriculture to which the early farmers were awfully exposed. There are in particular two procedures to predict rainfall. Empirical technique and dynamical method. In our method we use the empirical technique that is based on evaluation of historical information of the rainfall and its dating to a spread of atmospheric variables over different components of the nation. The most broadly used empirical approaches used for weather prediction are regression, artificial neural network, fuzzy logic and institution approach of statistics dealing with. We use data mining techniques such as clustering and classification techniques for rainfall prediction. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Agricultural implements; Crops; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Irrigation; Machinery; Neural networks; Rain; Agricultural yields; Atmospheric variables; Classification technique; Comparative analysis; Empirical techniques; Historical information; Rainfall prediction; Weather prediction; Data mining",Conference Paper,Scopus

Artificial Intelligence is concerned with improving algorithms by employing problem solving techniques used by human beings. In this paper, we implemented a methodology to classify a huge data set into clusters using a standard mathematical equation. A new clustering algorithm is proposed which involuntarily evolves the number of clusters as well as proper partitioning from a data set with artificial intelligence techniques. Here for the assignment of points to different clusters a standard distance calculation measure Euclidean distance formula is used which is intended to overcome point symmetry based clustering. An idea to implement this methodology on chemical/molecular data came from a software program Fast Rigid Exhaustive Docking which generates interactions of new molecules whose biological activity is unknown. The molecular data thus obtained as scores are tabulated as values. This is considered as raw data, which is further preprocessed and hence from one point to other point distance is calculated using Euclidean distance which forms a multi dimensional database with several combinations. Later on clusters are analyzed and pattern recognition is performed by using an algorithm to obtain results. Density based clustering technique is performed for better results on molecular database. In the field of chemistry there is much need of data mining for identifying the best molecule whose biological activity value is unknown. Using Artificial intelligent techniques we predicted the biological activity of a molecule when a dependent core training set is provided and leads to different case studies of test set molecules for which data mining techniques are utilized.

There is a great challenge to simulate eco-hydrological processes using a hydrological model in the reserve. In this study, we investigated eco-hydrological processes in the marsh wetlands and proposed a new model calibration-validation framework for a hydrological model-Soil and Water Assessment Tool. In addition to the runoff from the outlet of a basin in the reserve, soil moisture from different sub-basins and various depths was measured. These runoff and soil moisture data were combined to calibrate and validate the model based on sensitivity analysis. During the calibration period, the determination coefficient (R2) for the runoff simulation was up to 0.7, and the relative error (RE) was about 21%. For the model validation, the simulation for soil moisture was also acceptable since R2 reached 0.7 and RE was less than 20%. The daily soil moisture reflects the status of internal humidity and the relationship between the soil type and the vegetation. Therefore, Soil and Water Assessment Tool model performed well during the calibration and the validation period and could be used to analyze the eco-hydrological processes in the reserve. Moreover, the soil moisture of four soil-vegetation types, meadow black soil-marshy meadow, meadow black soil-marsh, marsh soil-marshy meadow, and marsh soil-marsh, remained at high levels. So the eco-hydrological function of water regulation in the marsh wetlands was very significant. The four soil-vegetation types were within area of the seasonal water-logged or the perennial water-logged zones. The soil moisture gradient was the dominant factor, which controls the vegetation spatial patterns. It showed that the distribution of vegetation communities have accordingly shrunk into a banding distribution along a humidity gradient. So the marsh wetlands were in a well status and it was favorable for biodiversity conservation. The calibration-validation framework is potential to reduce the modeling uncertainties in such wetland area especially when the data is rather sparse.","Eco-hydrological process model; Marsh wetlands in Honghe; Runoff; Soil moisture; SWAT model","calibration; ecohydrology; humidity; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; marsh; model validation; runoff; sensitivity analysis; soil moisture; soil type; spatial distribution; vegetation type; China; Heilongjiang; Honghe Nature Reserve",Article,Scopus

Analysis of visibility is a topic that received less attention in the study of forecasting models. Yet without a visibility analysis predicted results would be questionable whether the forecasting results can still be trusted. Analysis of visibility is required for assessing the ability of a model to forecast future events. In this paper we introduce visibility error which has different concept from the definition of error obtained during model building. Visibility error is the forecasting performance statistic which is needed as base in determining how long period of forecasting can be done. Without this statistics the forecaster can predict the next thousand years without clear statistical reasoning. Specifically this study developed error time variant visibility using inductive logic. One important finding raised in this paper is a formula for determining the numbers of data testing required to perform forecasting work based on specific forecasting specifications.

Based on the own character of winter wheat, we found that the correlation between HI and the ratio of NDVIpre (the average value of NDVI form emergence to anthesis) and NDVIpost (the average value of NDVI from anthesis to maturity) is quite well. Therefore, with the NDVI calculated from remote sensing data, we can estimate the HI of winter wheat for every pixel.

This paper addresses the problem of optimally identifying seed varieties to reliably increase crop yield within a risk-sensitive decision making framework. Specifically, a novel hierarchical machine learning mechanism for predicting crop yield (the yield of different seed varieties of the same crop) is introduced. This prediction mechanism is then integrated with a weather forecasting model and three different approaches for decision making under uncertainty to select seed varieties for planting so as to balance yield maximization and risk. The model was applied to the problem of soybean variety selection given in the 2016 Syngenta Crop Challenge. The prediction model achieved a median absolute error of 235 kg/ha and thus provides good estimates for input into the decision models. The decision models identified the selection of soybean varieties that appropriately balance yield and risk as a function of the farmer’s risk aversion level. More generally, the models can support farmers in decision making about which seed varieties to plant. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Crop selection; Hierarchical modeling; Machine learning; Random forest; Stochastic decision model; Yield prediction","crop yield; decision making; error analysis; future prospect; hierarchical system; hunger; machine learning; malnutrition; optimization; plantation; prediction; seed; stochasticity; Glycine max",Article,Scopus

Owing to wheat importance in food, wheat demand is increasing continuously. Wheat yield is committed to the availability of water supply. Due to climatic and environmental variations of different countries, water supply is not available in constant and desire quantity that is necessary for better wheat yield. So, there is a strong relationship and dependency that exists between water supply and wheat yield. Therefore, water supply is becoming an issue because it directly effects wheat yield.

Also, water is a human right and must be treated as such to meeting other human rights such as civil and political. Except for drinking purposes, activities such as agriculture, industry, transportation, electricity and amenities make use of water. The last decade there is a growing concern that water is at scarcity and far exceeds the potential for its natural recharge. Degraded water quality deteriorates further the situation. Such worrisome concerns about water quality can be attributed to both natural processes and human activities. Significant environmental health issues and desalination processes at Greek hydrological river basins cannot be ignored. Over 20 countries worldwide are depending on water that is flowing from other nations, and more than 300 of the world hydrological river basins are considered transboundary. The tropics and mid-level northern hemisphere have the potential for freshwater than other parts of the world. According to the UK’s Center for Ecology and Hydrology, rich developed nations are guilty of mismanaging and overusing water resources. In developing countries, water is extraordinarily inefficient because 68% of it is lost in evaporation or returned to rivers and aquifers. The long-term effects arising from irrigation comprise loss of biodiversity and the hydrological river basin waters the ability to natural self-cleaning mechanisms. Shortage of water deprives the fauna and flora of their ecosystems. Besides their contributions to water scarcity, irrigation, industry and domestic effluent are major sources of water pollution and contamination. According to the World Bank in Middle East and North Africa region, many countries fulfil their water demand partially or totally by desalinating seawater. River basins in the region have around 60% of the world’s desalination capacity (7.2 × 109 m3/year). According to the countries plans and their historic desalination capability, the total capacity is expected to increase and reach 19.1 × 109 m3/year by the year 2016 and possibly 31.4 × 109 m3/year by 2025. This will count for around 39% of the anticipated region’s deficit. Preferably, the remaining deficit will be bridged through efficient demand and supply management.

Method/Analysis: In this regard an algorithm to train the SVM's i.e., the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), classifier algorithm was proposed and results showed that classifier accuracies were improved when compared to other existing techniques. The process involves in replacing all missing values globally. This implementation is globally and then changes nominal attributes to binary form. By default all the attributes are normalized. Findings: Classifier coefficients output is purely from normalized data rather than from original data, which is very useful and important. Pair wise coupling is a multi-class classification method. Approach addresses the predicted probabilities that are coupled with the pairwise coupling method of Hastie and Tibshirani's. The accuracies were very low when 10 fold cross validation is applied.

A crop yield soil properties (CYSP) model was developed from established 1970s wheat estimates and soil properties. Correlation and multiple regression analysis was used to establish the relationships between 16 physical and chemical soil properties and wheat yields. Using step-wise multiple regression, a final CYSP model with six variables (% silt in A and E horizons, % organic matter in A and E horizons, cation exchange capacity, rooting depth, bulk density of the B horizon, and Na content) explained 78% of the variation in 1970s wheat yields of (R2 = 0.78 [34 soils]). A 22-year yield trend was applied to the 1970s predicted and established wheat yields to estimate the 1990s yields under an average level of management used by all Illinois farmers.

The introduction of remote sensing in agricultural monitoring makes accurate estimation of regional crop yields possible. However, remote sensing images and crop distribution maps with coarse spatial resolution usually cause inaccuracy in yield estimation due to the existence of mixed pixels. This study aimed to estimate the annual yields of maize and sunflower in Hetao Irrigation District in North China using 30 m spatial resolution HJ-1A/1B CCD images and high accuracy multi-year crop distribution maps. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series obtained from HJ-1A/1B CCD images was fitted with an asymmetric logistic curve to calculate daily NDVI and phenological characteristics. Eight random forest (RF) models using different predictors were developed for maize and sunflower yield estimation, respectively, where predictors of each model were a combination of NDVI series and/or phenological characteristics. We calibrated all RF models with measured crop yields at sampling points in two years (2014 and 2015), and validated the RF models with statistical yields of four counties in six years. Results showed that the optimal model for maize yield estimation was the model using NDVI series from the 120th to the 210th day in a year with 10 days’ interval as predictors, while that for sunflower was the model using the combination of three NDVI characteristics, three phenological characteristics, and two curve parameters as predictors. The selected RF models could estimate multi-year regional crop yields accurately, with the average values of root-mean-square error and the relative error of 0.75 t/ha and 6.1% for maize, and 0.40 t/ha and 10.1% for sunflower, respectively. Moreover, the yields of maize and sunflower can be estimated fairly well with NDVI series 50 days before crop harvest, which implicated the possibility of crop yield forecast before harvest. © 2018 by the authors.

The source of data were obtained from the weather data collected through the source of Agra climate research Centre, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India for Coimbatore and Ammapet region. In this proposed method, initially the yield traces are split into a number of time spaces according to the plant being considered, and performs approximation under specified conditions. The growth approximation technique computes time oriented growth weight for each plant based on various irrigation methods (fluid), climate and geological parameters. Additionally, the method estimates the water regulation factor for each time window and generates a water key factor value. The water key factor denotes the level of water to be regulated to improve the crop yield using the environmental factors (FCG) like water, climate, and geology. The results of yield estimation efficiency produced by this model are 98% which was higher in comparing with the other methods. The estimated crop yield and water regulation to the cultivated crop achieved by the proposed new approach was 82500 Kg/ha and 140 mm respectively. The results of this proposed method shows improvements in comparing with the other methods. Hence this time variant growth approximation model proposes new innovative approach in estimating the amount of water needed to crop and estimating the crop yield for all seasons and regions. © 2018 EBSCO Information Services.

It was found that the most significant factors are the changes in crops acreage and the climatic conditions of the growing season. The date of the first NDVI value at the start of the season correlates well with air temperature data. But the trend of this indicator for the period of research (2001−2017) on the territory of the region is not revealed. An indistinct 5−7 years periodicity of local minima and maximums of this indicator is observed. Dynamics of crops acreage has stronger effect on the date of seasonal NDVI maximum than trends of weather conditions (which act towards the onset of an earlier peak in the growing season). It leads, albeit to a weak, but increasingly later NDVI seasonal peak date in the second half of the analyzed period.

The result of such an approach is that the processes in the basin are lumped by compositing the catchment processes over time and space. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model gives various outputs which are distributed all over the basin by use of the hydrologic response units (HRU). However, due to lack of physical location for the HRU, and their possible large number in a single watershed or even subbasin, it is physically and almost practically impossible to monitor the flow, nutrients and sediments at all the outlets of these HRUs. A new concept of land use soil units (LUSU) created from overlaid soil and land use classes makes it possible to spatially compare outputs. The use of geographic information system (GIS) to overlay datasheets and the availability of gridded remotely sensed data for biomass, evapotranspiration, leaf area index (LAI) and yields in real time makes it possible to perform a dynamic distributed model validation. The SWAT model is used to test the applicability of remotely sensed variables on a 2905 Km2 basin. The watershed is data scarce, geologically difficult, topographically challenging with dynamic land management practices, and drastically changing climatic conditions from semi- Arid to humid tundra/montane conditions. When actual management practices like fertilizer application are considered in the SWAT model, the simulated yields compare favourably with observed field yields (p=0.05). Although remotely sensed Leaf Area Index values are higher than the simulated LAI, it mirrors to a great extent the timing and shape of the simulated LAI for the annual landuse classes. The seasonality characteristics for these land classes are also consistent for both RS and simulated LAI.","Crop yields; LAI; SPOT NDVI; SWAT calibration",,Conference Paper,Scopus

Monitoring salt affected areas and assessing land cover changes, which caused by salinization, can be an effective approach to rehabilitate saline soils and prevent further salinization of agricultural fields. Using potential of satellite imagery taken over time along with remote sensing techniques, makes it possible to determine salinity changes at regional scales. This study deals with monitoring salinity changes and trend of the expansion in different land cover types of Bakhtegan Salt Lake district during the last two decades using multi-temporal Landsat images. For this purpose, per-pixel trend analysis of soil salinity during years 2000 to 2016 was performed and slope index maps of the best salinity indicators were generated for each pixel in the scene. The results of this study revealed that vegetation indices (GDVI and EVI) and also salinity indices (SI-1 and SI-3) have great potential to assess soil salinity trends in vegetation and bare soil lands respectively due to more sensitivity to salt features over years of study. In addition, images of May had the best performance to highlight changes in pixels among different months of the year. A comparative analysis of different slope index maps shows that more than 76% of vegetated areas have experienced negative trends during 17 years, of which about 34% are moderately and highly saline. This percent is increased to 92% for bare soil lands and 29% of salt affected soils had severe salinization. It can be concluded that the areas, which are close to the lake, are more affected by salinity and salts from the lake were brought into the soil which will lead to loss of soil productivity ultimately.","Land covers; Landsat time series data; Per-pixel trend analysis; Salinity indicators; Slope index; Soil salinity","Lakes; Maps; Pixels; Productivity; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Time series; Time series analysis; Vegetation; Weathering; Land cover; Landsat time series; Slope index; Soil salinity; Trend analysis; Soils",Conference Paper,Scopus

The site was chosen as it consists of soil types being representative for many agricultural areas along the coast in Western Norway. The main objective of the experimental field was to investigate the effect of a subsurface drainage system on yield, runoff and nitrogen loss, nitrogen use efficiency and trafficability of ley production along the western coast of Norway and as such provide detailed information/knowledge about drainage criteria under present condition but not least under future condition with climate change. The experiment consists of four alternatives each having 4 subsurface drains. Two alternatives have a drain spacing of 6 m while the remaining two alternatives have a drain spacing of 12 m. Each of the 4 plots is divided into two subplots with two and three ley harvest respectively and two different levels of fertilizer application, being 190 and 290 kg ha1 nitrogen(N) respectively. The first results indicated that both drainage alternatives function satisfactorily. The measurements indicate that a part of the excess precipitation passes the subsurface drainage system towards the groundwater which implies also drainage of excess nitrogen towards the groundwater. The observations at Askvoll show large diurnal variations in discharge resulting in a significant difference in flashiness index (FI) when using hourly or average daily discharge values. The FI-values indicate that a narrower drain spacing has a higher FI, and thereby faster response to excess precipitation compared to a larger spacing. © 2016 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

In the first stage, reflection coefficient of ground surface, ground radiation coefficient, vegetation indices such as NDVI, SAVI, GVI and BGRwere determined by data preprocessing obtained from satellite images during growth period for 2 years of 2005 - 2006 and 2006 - 2007. Then cultivation area and density were estimated. Using the SEBAL algorithm, elements of energy balance on ground surface and Real évapotranspiration were computed and assumed as the water consumption and relative water supply. Biological production of sugarcane obtained using the average daily solar radiation and fraction of photosynthetic absorbed radiation is determined in form of BGR index and assumed asa symbol of production. Water productivity is resulted from the ratio of biological production to real évapotranspiration. Process of seasonal variation is gained for biological production, vegetation index and évapotranspiration. Studying of water supply and demand presents no lack of water in this network and the fraction of overflow is used'for salt leaching in soil profile. Average water productivity for biological production in this network for two years of 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 is 5.21 and 6.16 kg/m3. In addition, relative water supplies for these two years are 1.67 and 1.73 respectively.

In this study, five steady-state equations including Hooghoudt, Kirkham, Dagan, Ernst, and Ernst-Hooghoudt; and three unsteady-state equations including Glover-Dumm, Van-Shilfgard, and De-zeeuw-Hellinga were implemented to compute drain spacing. Required field data were obtained from 52 ha of paddy fields of ""Haraz Human-Agriculture Resources Development Center,"" located in Mazandaran province of Iran. The computed drain spacings were evaluated using dynamic equilibrium concept and DRAINMOD model. The minimum and maximum drain spacings were found to be 26 and 63 m corresponding to Glover-Dumm and Ernst equations, respectively. Based on the dynamic equilibrium concept, the averages of the computed water table depths for the drain spacings obtained by the unsteady-state equations were 0.5-0.63 m as compared with those obtained by the steady-state methods which were in the range of 0-0.43 m. According to the DRAINMOD model simulations, the maximum relative yield was 80.2 % which was obtained when the drain spacing was 26 m and it reduced to 73.5 % when the drain spacing was increased to 63 m.

Among a new generation of high-resolution satellites, GaoFen-1 (GF-1) stands out. It sets high spatial resolution (2 m-16 m), multi-spectral and high temporal resolution (4-day) with 60 km-800 km swath in a fusion technology with strategic significance. In order to explore the adaptability of Chinese GF-1 images in rice growth monitoring, aboveground biomass (AGB) was considered as plant growth indicator. Multi-temporal GF-1 WFV images of Xinghua City, Jiangsu Province were selected for rice growth parameter retrieval. An extensive field campaign was carried out during the rice growing season in 2015. Six rice sample plots with areas larger than 200 × 200 m2 in Xinghua City were randomly chosen in order to measure the vegetation characteristics. Only cloud-free images were selected for AGB modeling. Using Savitzky-Golay filters, daily vegetation indices (VIs) time series were created from all the GF-1 images. For modeling of AGB from GF-1, there were 42 matching AGB sample sites. The matched cumulative VIs were calculated from 10-day composite data and were adopted for the estimation of AGB. Five traditional regression equations (linear, exponential, power, logarithmic, and quadratic polynomial regression) were applied in model construction. The leave-one-out cross-validation method was implemented to test the prediction capability of the models. The cumulative NDVI-based quadratic polynomial fit function was adopted for the prediction of AGB at all stages. In this paper, the application provided an important reference of field management and decision-making information. Indicated that GF-1 satellite's high time resolution provides chances to get cloudless data, and high spatial and spectral resolution features can replace the traditional medium resolution remote sensing of agricultural growth monitoring data to a certain extent, but a lot of ground survey data still needed to improve model and monitoring accuracy.

Decision Support Systems (DSS) are useful tools for such planning. Consequently, it is essential that land decision support systems are no longer confined to research centers but also adopted by the production sector and public administration. The MicroLEIS DSS developed by the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) is a user-friendly and suitable user-useful tool for local government officials, consultants and other land use decision makers. The evaluation process entails dynamic interactions between soil, climate and management variables. It includes 12 modules that allow for the assessment of soil capability and vulnerability, and the consequences of future global change scenarios. Here, we illustrate the application of MicroLEIS for land use planning in Asia where this kind of assessment is rather scarce. The decision support system was applied for Ahar, located in East Azarbaijan (Iran). Six agro-ecological land evaluation models, constituents of MicroLEIS DSS software, were selected for land evaluation at the regional level. We identified areas suitable for agricultural production, species suitable for restoring areas marginal for crop production, and suitable crop combinations, and performed a soil capability classification in the soil units. Results obtained from each evaluation model are presented and discussed in this chapter. In summary, MicroLEIS technology proved useful in this semi-arid region of Asia for sustainable agro-ecological planning.

However, an evaluation of the reservoir component has rarely been addressed despite the accuracy of simulated streamflow, which can be reduced by not considering a reservoir in the model. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impacts of reservoir outflow estimation methods in calibrating the SWAT model. This study was conducted within the Grenada Lake Reservoir watershed (4,500 km2) within the Yazoo River Basin. The SWAT model was calibrated and validated using long-term measured streamflow data from the U.S. Geological Survey gage stations (07282000, 07283000, and 07285500) and reservoir outflow data from U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Two upper sub-watersheds contributing to inflow of reservoir were first calibrated and validated for streamflow. Comparing with the measured streamflow data, the model performance showed satisfactory during both calibration and validation periods. Based on the calibrated parameters, the impacts of the reservoir outflow estimation methods were evaluated at the watershed outlet (07285500) of the study watershed, which is located below the Grenada reservoir. According to the statistical analysis, the measured outflow options showed satisfactory results for daily stream flow data, whereas the target release options showed unsatisfactory results. However, all four reservoir outflow options showed satisfactory results for monthly streamflow data. These results indicates that the target release approach using non-specific or specific target release approach in the SWAT model can effectively use to simulate the monthly streamflow with the limited information of reservoir. The results from our study can provide the useful information in applying the SWAT model for the watershed including the flood control reservoirs.","Calibration; Reservoir; Streamflow; SWAT; Target release approach","Agriculture; Calibration; Computer simulation; Engineers; Flood control; Landforms; Stream flow; Water resources; Watersheds; Calibration and validations; Effective tool; Estimation methods; Gage stations; Limited information; Model performance; Reservoir operation; River basins; Soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; SWAT model; U.S. Army; U.s. geological surveys; Reservoirs (water)",Conference Paper,Scopus

In this paper the use of MeteoSat-derived meteorological products to replace weather variables interpolated from weather stations (temperature, reference evapotranspiration and radiation) is explored. Simulations for winter-wheat were carried for Spain, Poland and Belgium using both interpolated and MeteoSat-derived weather variables. The results were spatially aggregated to national and regional level and were evaluated by comparing the simulation results of both approaches and by assessing the relationships with crop yield statistics over the periods 1995-2003 from EUROSTAT. The results indicate that potential crop yield can be simulated well using MeteoSat-derived meteorological variables, but that water-stress hardly occurs in the water-limited simulations. This is caused by a difference in reference evapotranspiration which was 20-30% smaller in case of MeteoSat. As a result, the simulations using MeteoSat-derived meteorological variables performed considerably poorer in a regression analyses with crop yield statistics on national and regional level. Our results indicate that a recalibration of the model parameters is necessary before the MeteoSat-derived meteorological variables can be used operationally in the system. © 2007.","Crop growth model; MeteoSat; Regional level; Yield forecasting","crop yield; evapotranspiration; forecasting method; growth modeling; Meteosat; satellite data; wheat; Belgium; Benelux; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Poland; Southern Europe; Spain; Western Europe; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

In coastal regions of north eastern Australia, regimes vary considerably over short distances. This occurs because of changes in local topography, including the height and orientation of mountain ranges and the direction of the coastline with respect to the prevailing moist south east air stream. Northern Australia experiences a tropical monsoon climate with rainfall occurring predominantly during the summer months. Areas with a closer proximity to the coast typically experience the heavier rainfalls. While networks of rainfall gauges have been established and continuous records are available for most of these stations from the 1890s, their low distribution density relative to the complexity of rainfall pattern they are required to represent means that there remains a poor understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall in the wet tropics. An enhanced knowledge of rainfall distribution in both space and time has the potential to deliver significant economic and environmental benefits to managers of natural resources. This paper reports on the application of a technique for estimating mean annual and mean monthly rainfall across the Herbert River catchment of north east Australia's dry and wet tropics. The technique utilises thin plate smoothing splines to incorporate both location and elevation into estimates of rainfall distribution. We demonstrate that the method can be applied successfully at the meso scale and within the domain of routinely available data. As such, the method has broad relevance for decision making. © 2004 Geographical Society of New South Wales Inc.","Estimation technique; Herbert River catchment; Modelling rainfall distribution; North eastern Australia","rainfall; raingauge; spatial distribution; temporal variation; tropical region; Australasia; Australia; Herbert River; Queensland",Article,Scopus

Linear regression is an old data processing tool, and artificial neural networks are a comparatively new one. The goal of the study was to determine whether artificial neural networks are more accurate than linear regression in sweet corn yield prediction. In the study we used a dataset obtained from field experiments on the technological improvement of sweet corn cultivation. The field experiments were conducted during the period from 2014 to 2016 on dark-chestnut soil under drip irrigated conditions in the Steppe Zone of Ukraine. We studied the impact of the moldboard plowing depths, mineral fertilizer application rates and plant densities on the crop yield. A significant impact of all the studied factors on the sweet corn productivity was proved by using the analysis of variance. The highest yield of sweet corn ears without husks (10.93 t ha–1) was under the moldboard plowing at the depth of 20–22 cm, mineral fertilizers application rate of N120P120, plant density of 65,000 plants ha–1. Data processing by using the linear regression and artificial neural network methods showed that the latter is a great deal better than linear regression in sweet corn yield prediction. Higher accuracy of the artificial neural network prediction was proved by the higher value of the coefficient of determination (R2) – 0.978, in comparison to 0.897 for the linear regression prediction model. We conclude that artificial neural networks are a much better data processing tool, especially, in the life sciences and for prediction of the non-linear natural processes and phenomena. The main disadvantage of the neural network models is their “black box” nature. However, linear regression will not lose its popularity among scientists in the nearest future. Linear regression is a much simpler data analysis tool, it is easier to perform the prediction, but it still provides a sufficiently high level of accuracy. © 2018 Oles Honchar Dnipro National University.

So, this paper focuses on predicting data values on a large spectrum of fuzzy logic computations based on second and third-degree relationships. This paper showcases work on 4 different types of the fuzzy interval, where each interval is tested with 4 degrees of regression equations.

A sensitivity analysis was performed and the ratio of fruit length to fruit width, number of days to first harvest, and number of days to flowering had the greatest impact on individual fruit weight. The highest standard deviation was for total yield and individual fruit weight, respectively (308.8 and 67.5), and correlation coefficients were high between fruit weight and number of days to flowering (0.99**) and individual fruit weight and total yield (0.88**).

Design/methodology/approach – The production and consumption of rice crop is governed by diverse variables. In the present study five key input variables for production of rice based on literature review and the authenticated data available from agricultural sources have been selected. These variables are area sown, agricultural workers (AW), area irrigated, growth rate and yield per hectare. On similar basis four key input variables responsible for consumption of rice are considered, namely, price of rice, population, poverty ratio and per capita net national product (NNP). Findings – Correlation analysis showed that priority wise production of rice depends upon yield per hectare, percentage irrigation, AW and area sown. The growth rate is found to be having insignificant correlation with other variables of production and hence was omitted from subsequent study. Correlation analysis also showed that priority wise consumption depends upon whole sale price per ton, population and the per capita NNP. The poverty ratio is found to be having insignificant correlation with other variables of consumption and hence was omitted from subsequent study. The outcomes of the correlation analysis are utilized for designing rule base for fuzzy inference system (FIS) to forecast the production and consumption of the rice. Subsequently Bayesian technique is used to forecast production and consumption and its results are compared with the results of fuzzy inference analysis. Originality/value – There are many techniques used for forecasting purpose but FIS and Bayesian technique outperform others. In the present study, the authors therefore focussed on these two techniques. Bayesian technique takes into account the expert opinion at the current conditions whereas FIS uses previously designed rule base. Besides discussing the appropriateness of these two techniques for forecasting production and consumption of rice, their forecasting outcomes will help in logistical and operational planning of the resources at national level, farmers’ level and traders’ level. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Decision making; Demand management",,Article,Scopus

Drought severity assessment is based on the soil water dynamics simulation by agroecological model Daisy. Daily meteorological data from the years 1961-2012 from 31 localities were used in simulations. Criteria for the drought occurrence were 1) available soil water content below 50% of available water capacity, 2) soil water content below long-term average soil water content and 3) duration of continuous drought for fifteen or more days. Standardized index of daily available soil water content was used for drought severity classification. According to the index the drought is categorized into four degrees of severity from mild to extreme drought. Cumulative sum of available soil water index was used to drought quantification throughout its duration. Normal climate period 1961- 1990 was chosen as reference period to enable historical comparison of drought severity as well as climate change impacts. Extreme drought of the largest spatial extent was identified in 1990. Extreme drought occurred regionally in the southwest Slovakia in 1978 and in the southeast Slovakia in 1986, respectively.","Available soil water; Daisy model; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Precipitation; Soil water content","available water capacity; classification; drought; evapotranspiration; simulation; soil water; water content; Slovakia",Article,Scopus

As the most intuitive effect of dams, deformation contains important information on dam evolution. Actual response has the purpose of diagnosis and early warning compared with model prediction. Given the poor generalization ability of the conventional statistical model, establishing a dam deformation monitoring model is thus essential. The prediction of concrete dam deformation using statistical model and random forest regression (RFR) model is studied. To build an optimized RFR model, the statistical model is used to establish input variables, select the appropriate parameters Mtry and Ntree according to out-of-bag error, and extract strong explanatory variables. The model's advantage is that the influence factors can describe concrete dam deformation, and RF can serve as a sensible new data mining tool. The importance of variables for deformation prediction is measured by RF. The RFR method can extract representative influencing factors based on variable importance. The methods are applied to an actual concrete dam. Results indicate that the RFR model can be applied for analysis and prediction of other structural behavior.

A large error in the simulation of daily rainfall sequence influences to take up a bias correction and for that reason, two approaches are used. The bias-corrected GCM is able to capture the inter-annual variability in rainfall events.

Many approaches are based on classification techniques considering observation at certain points in time. However, some land cover classes, such as crops, change their spectral characteristics due to environmental influences and can thus not be monitored effectively with classical mono-temporal approaches. Nevertheless, these temporal observations should be utilized to benefit the classification process. After extensive research has been conducted on modeling temporal dynamics by spectro-temporal profiles using vegetation indices, we propose a deep learning approach to utilize these temporal characteristics for classification tasks. In this work, we show how long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks can be employed for crop identification purposes with SENTINEL 2A observations from large study areas and label information provided by local authorities. We compare these temporal neural network models, i.e., LSTM and recurrent neural network (RNN), with a classical non-temporal convolutional neural network (CNN) model and an additional support vector machine (SVM) baseline. With our rather straightforward LSTM variant, we exceeded state-of-the-art classification performance, thus opening promising potential for further research.","Crop identification; Deep learning; Land cover classification; Long short-term memory; Recurrent neural networks; Sentinel 2","Brain; Crops; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Education; Neural networks; Recurrent neural networks; Support vector machines; Classification performance; Classification technique; Convolutional neural network; Crop identification; Land cover classification; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Sentinel 2; Spectral characteristics; Long short-term memory",Conference Paper,Scopus

The change of cultivated land quality with climate change has become one of the hot research areas in global change in recent years. Based on the meteorological data, soil information and field experimental data were used, utilizing the Wageninngen method recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to calculate the potential productivity of potato and spring wheat from 1989 to 2009 in Wuchuan County, Inner Mongolia, a typical semi-arid climate-sensitive area in North China. We examined the influence of climate change on production potential, the standard cropping system, and the yield. Further, by the method of regulations of Farmland classification, we used the data of potential productivity and land use to analyze the changes of natural quality grades and utilization grades under climate change. The results showed that: (1) The annual temperature of Wuchuan County increased at an average rate of 0.57°C/10a during 1967-2009. The precipitation varied greatly among the years, and the annual precipitation declined slightly over time. The soil relative humidity in soil layers 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm depth in crop growing season (April-September) in the period 1989-2009 had a decreasing trend with an average rate of 1.8%/a and 1.5%/a, respectively. Drought index increased noticeably. In conclusion, Wuchuan County was getting warmer and dryer under climate change. (2) Most of the cultivated lands were the dry lands in Wuchuan county (accounting for more than 90%), but the irrigated lands increased in recent years. The main crop in Wuchuan county was potatoes in 2009 instead of spring wheat in 1989. The planting area of potatoes increased from 8.4% to 39.8%, while spring wheat planting area decreasing from 52.1% to 17.1% in the period 1989-2009. (3) The production potential of the potatoes and spring wheat showed a declining trend under the dry warming climate in Wuchuan county. The production potential of potatoes decreased more obviously than spring wheat. Precipitation was the main factor affecting the production potential of potatoes and spring wheat. The natural quality grade index of dry land and irrigated land in the period 1989-2009 had an obviously decreasing trend with an average rate of 2.1/a and 0.5/a, respectively. The natural quality index of irrigated land was significantly higher than that of dry land. The dry land utilization grade index showed a descending trend, but the irrigated land utilization grade index showed a rising trend. The utilization grade index of the irrigated land was also significantly higher than that of the dry land, and the influence of climate change in the dry land was greater than in the irrigated land. However, the effect of land utilization by human activities in the irrigated land was greater. Therefore, as a comparative system between dry land quality and irrigated land quality, water is the major constraint to the cultivated land quality grade. This research can provide the scientific basis for formulation of the land-use system, protection and improvement of the quality of cultivated land under the background of climate change.","Arid regions; Climate change; Cultivated land quality; Land use; Natural quality grade index; Utilization grade index","Annual precipitation; Annual temperatures; Cultivated land qualities; Experimental datum; Food and agriculture organizations; Meteorological data; Potential productivity; Quality grade; Arid regions; Cultivation; Land use; Meteorology; Productivity; Soils; Climate change",Article,Scopus

Further, poor water quality threatens the security of food supplies worldwide. To address agriculture's significant effect on our waterways, reliable water quality models are needed to forecast the water quality consequences of different agricultural nutrient management scenarios. One important agricultural management technology is tile drainage. Tile drainage and drainage management are significant factors determining water quality by expediting nutrient delivery. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), version 2009, will be applied to simulate stream-flows, riverine nitrate (NO3) export, and watershed nitrogen (N) budgets in the Salt Fork watershed in east-central Illinois, which has extensive corn-soybean cultivation, large N fertilizer input, and extensive tile drainage. The simulation will be calibrated for observed water quality and flow volume data from stream monitoring locations within the watershed. The extent of tile-drainage in the watershed will be based on existing tile maps and inference from land slope and soil hydraulic conductivity. In addition, drainage-related best management practices will be simulated. The calibrated SWAT will predict changes in flow and nitrate export. Lessons learnt from this application of SWAT could lead to more reliable predictions of the water quality outcomes of nutrient management practices in tile-drained watersheds.","BMPs; Hydrological modeling; SWAT; Tile-drainage management; Water quality","Cultivation; Food supply; Landforms; Management; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nutrients; Watersheds; Agricultural management; Agricultural nutrients; Best management practices; BMPs; Flow volumes; Hydrological modeling; Illinois; Large N; Monitoring locations; Nutrient delivery; Nutrient management; Soil and water assessment tool; Soil hydraulic conductivity; SWAT; Tile drainage; Treatment costs; Water quality models; Water quality",Conference Paper,Scopus

The data were from three replicates of two randomized complete block design experiments sited in a newly cleared forest and on previously cultivated land both in Nsukka, eastern Nigeria. The 28 soil physicochemical properties and six crop yield parameters measured were partitioned between location and year before applying a stepwise regression procedure to analyze them. The study showed that soil variables accounted for >70% of the variation in cassava root yields and harvest index. Both soil physical and chemical properties contributed but the former (particularly macroporosity, microporosity, total porosity and bulk density) contributed most. Selected soil variables also accounted for >70% of the variation in yam tuber yield and shape index of tubers especially in 1998. In both crop years chemical properties appeared to dominate over the physical ones. Soil variables accounted for between 51 and 99% of the variation in maize grain and stover yields. The only exception was the figure of 44% obtained at the forest location in 1998. Soil pH, total exchangeable acidity and microporosity were particularly important contributors to the variations in both maize yield parameters. The contributions of soil variables to pigeon pea yield parameters were low (<50%) except in 1999 at the forest location where seven soil variables accounted for over 85% variation in seed yield. It was obvious generally from the study that soil variables were important determinants of yield variations in the four crops. It was also shown that physical properties should always be included in this kind of analysis. Also the number of soil variables which were of significance generally increased when the level of soil properties was low, as was the case with the cultivated site versus forest site, and 1999 versus 1998 analysis. Thus increasing the number of soil variables used and partitioning them into more homogeneous units helped to improve the results obtained using the procedure. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Yield gains can be improved by use of High-Throughput Phenotyping (HTP) based on multispectral imaging and application of genomic selection. Several spectral indices have been tested to estimate grain yield, such as the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) and MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI). For the present work, data was gathered from a field trial with 96 plots of 24 wheat cultivars laid out in an alpha-lattice split plot design. The design had two levels of nitrogen (N) fertilization, 75 and 150 kg N/ha, applied at sowing. Also, a larger field trial with 301 breeding lines with two reps of high N fertilization was used. Multispectral images where taken in the wavebands green (550 nm), red (660 nm), red edge (735 nm) and near infrared (NIR) (790 nm) with a Parrot Sequoia multispectral camera combined with a sunshine sensor. This allows vegetation indices to be calculated. In addition, 3D models and Digital Surface Models (DSM) are used to estimate plant height. All cameras and sensors were mounted on a light Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Images were taken at regular intervals throughout the growth season. The time series of the vegetation indices showed high values during the period of grain filling for wheat plots that received higher dose of fertilization. The values reached their peak around the period of grain filling before declining when plants approached maturity. For site B, the historical cultivars showed significant differences in NDVI and MTCI, but the indices were weakly correlated with grain yield. On site B, however, the large field with breeding lines, both vegetation indices were associated with grain yield with MTCI showing the strongest correlation coefficient of 0.49. The plant heights computed from the DSM showed deviations of 0.1 to 0.2 meters from the manual measurements, indicating that more sophisticated models are needed for reliable prediction of plant height. © SPIE.

An accurately designed subsurface drainage system can improve soil and water environment as well as the crop yield. Computer models, such as DRAINMOD, are often used to simulate the field hydrology or design the subsurface drainage systems under different scenarios. The accuracy of the model simulation is highly depending on the accuracy of the input parameters. As an important input parameter to DRAINMOD, evapotranspiration (ET) is estimated using temperature based reference ET method and a stress adjustment factor, while an inaccurate ET estimation can cause errors in DRAINMOD simulation. This paper will evaluate the effects of accurate ET estimation on DRAINMOD prediction through comparisons of various reference ET and actual ET estimates. Reference ET was calculated using data from a nearby weather station. Actual ET was measured by an eddy covariance system. Drainage and hydrology data, including water table, precipitation, and drainage flow were measured in the field in 2009 and used in DRAINMOD simulation. With different reference ET values, different monthly adjustment factors were obtained for each reference ET method in order to match the simulated with the measured water tables. After compared with the actual ET by the eddy covariance method, we found that without adjustment factors, Jensen-Haise, modified Penman (NDAWN) and ASCE-EWRI reference ET methods showed the best agreement than Thorthwaite with an R2 of 0.63, 0.58, and 0.58, respectively. The default reference ET method showed poor agreement without adjustment factors with an R2 of 0.05 and 0.10 for B1 and B2 locations, and improved to 0.8 and 0.70 by using adjustment factors.","DRAINMOD; Eddy covariance; Model evaluation; Subsurface drainage system","Evapotranspiration; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Hydrology; DRAINMOD; Eddy covariance; Eddy covariance method; Eddy covariance systems; Model evaluation; Shallow water tables; Subsurface drainage system; Subsurface drainages; Drainage",Conference Paper,Scopus

Yet, only about 35% of the total arable land is used properly. Most of the farmers that depend from subsistence-agriculture, nearly 80%, live under poverty conditions and are affected by malnutrition. Information about their crop's health would be valuable to considerably increase yields, reduce the use of fertilizer and reduce losses by early detecting diseases. Satellite images and unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs) are often used in conjunction with multi-spectral cameras to provide the spectral response of a specific crop, this response can be analyzed through vegetation indexes like the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which provides information about crops' health. The problem is that commercial NDVI solutions are extremely expensive for Guatemalan farmers, which restricts them from the benefits of the technology. In this paper, we describe the prototype development of a low-cost autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform for crop analysis via NDVI. To reduce costs, a modified webcam was used for NDVI calculation. Off-the-shelf components were used to facilitate replication by other parties and a quadcopter topology was chosen given the irregularities of Guatemala's geography, Test flights were performed in sugar cane fields to evaluate the platform's autonomy and the NDVI calculation.

Based on the difference of the water requirement of crop in different stages, the crop growing season was divided into several periods for crop biomass estimation. In each period, multi-year time-series ET data estimated with ETWatch was used to get the maximal ET value, which approximately equals to potential ET. And the water stress scalar was calculated for crop biomass estimation. HI was simulated by the ratio of NDVIpre(the average value of NDVI form emergence to anthesis) and NDVIpost (the average value of NDVI from anthesis to maturity). With the estimated crop biomass and HI, crop yield can be calculated by the follow expression: YIELD = BIOMASS * HI. For crop identification, the fusion data of Envisat ASAR VV polarization backscatter data and HJ satellite multi-spectral data was investigated using different classifiers. Results indicated that fusion data can take full advantage of spectral information of HJ multi-spectral data and the structure sensitivity feature of ASAR VV polarization data. The fusion data enlarges the spectral difference among different classifications and improves crop classification accuracy. Crop classification accuracy with fusion of HJ and ASAR was improved by 5 percent compared to the single HJ CCD data. Crop classification with support vector machine (SVM) classifier using multi-configuration SAR data including ENVISAT ASAR and TerraSAR-X was also investigated in our project. Multi-configuration SAR data achieved satisfactory classification accuracy (best overall accuracy of 91.83%) in the North China Plain. ASAR performed slightly better than TerraSAR data acquired in the same time span for crop classification, while the combination of C- and X-band data was better than the multi-temporal C-band data. Two temporal ASAR data acquired in late jointing and flowering periods achieved sufficient classification accuracy. Crop acreage estimation using ENVISAT MERIS and CBERS-02B CCD data of 2008 was investigated in our project. Firstly, adaptive maximum likelihood classification of CBERS-02B CCD images based on ground survey provided reliable maize area fraction image (AFI). CBERS derived AFIs (as reference AFI) were used to train a 3-layer back-propagation neural network, this was then used to the whole MERIS data to generate MERIS AFIs (AFIe). To estimate maize acreage, the maize AFI from MERIS was masked with cropland dataset and maize acreages were estimated by zonal statistic of maize AFI at district level. This reliable method can not only be applied to MERIS and CBERS-02B data. Classification results of multi-configuration SAR data or fusion data of ASAR and HJ data can be used to get crop area fraction image (AFI). This method is valuable for wide-scale, regional crop acreage estimation at the early stage of growing season by combination of high resolution data and moderate-resolution data.",,"Back propagation neural networks; Classification accuracy; Classification results; High resolution data; Maximum likelihood classifications; Spectral differences; Spectral information; Structure sensitivity; Biomass; Crops; Cultivation; Estimation; Geodetic satellites; Neural networks; Plants (botany); Polarization; Support vector machines; Classification (of information)",Conference Paper,Scopus

The objectives of this study were to investigate the effectiveness and cost-benefit of conservation management practices on sediment reduction under a corn-soybean rotation. The experimental site was 6.4 ha (15.8 ac) and located within the Four Mile Creek watershed in eastern Iowa. Management practices consisted of tillage with a mold-board plow with a row cropped system of corn and soybeans. Annual sediment yield from this site was estimated using the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model for three tillage systems (chisel plow, disk tillage, and no-tillage) as well as three conservation structures (grassed waterways, filter strips, and terraces). The WEPP model was validated using five-year (1976 to 1980) field-measured sediment yield and surface runoff data. Without supplemental conservation measures, predicted sediment yield was 22.5, 17.7, and 3.3 t ha-1 y-1 (10.0, 7.9, and 1.5 tn ac-1 yr-1) from chisel plow, disk tillage, and no-tillage, respectively. Supplemental conservation measures had the most impact on sediment yield reduction when used in conjunction with chisel plow management and the smallest impact with the no-tillage system. The value of lost soil resulting from soil erosion ranged between $10.9 and $137.3 ha-1 y-1 ($4.4 and $55.6 ac-1 yr-1) for the simulated scenarios in the study when a soil value of $6.1 t-1 ($5.5 tn-1) was considered. When factoring in the value of soil, no-tillage was the most efficient practice with the highest net benefit of $94.5 ha-1 y-1 ($38.2 ac-1 yr-1).

The ""Biologically Identified Optimal Temperature Interactive Console (BIOTIC)"" is an irrigation protocol that provides irrigation scheduling based upon measurements of canopy temperatures and the temperature optimum of the crop species of interest. One of the goals of this paper is to document the gradual development of the method and its implementation. Two threshold values are required to implement BIOTIC irrigation of a crop in a given region, a species-specific temperature threshold and a species/environment-specific time threshold. The temperature threshold, an indication of the thermal optimum for the plant, is derived from the thermal dependence of its metabolism. The time threshold, which represents the average amount of time each day that the canopy temperature of the well-watered crop will exceed the temperature threshold, is calculated from weather data. Interest in the use of BIOTIC for irrigation scheduling for peanut ( Arachis hypogaea L.) resulted in this study in which the temperature and time thresholds for peanut were determined on the Texas Southern High Plains. A temperature threshold value of 27°C was determined from the thermal dependence of the reappearance of photosystem II variable fluorescence (PSII Fv) following illumination. A time threshold of 405 min was calculated from an analysis of weather data collected over the course of the 1999 growing season. The determination of these threshold values for peanut provides the basis for the application of the BIOTIC protocol to irrigation scheduling of peanut on the Southern High Plains of Texas. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","Irrigation; Peanut; Water stress","Biodiversity; Crops; Fluorescence; Metabolism; Optimization; Thermal effects; BIOTIC irrigation; Canopy temperatures; Temperature threshold; Irrigation; groundnut; irrigation; temperature; Biodiversity; Farm Crops; Fluorescence; Irrigation; Metabolism; Optimization; North America; Texas; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; Arachis hypogaea",Article,Scopus

Machine learning (ML), with its predictive power to tackle complex systems, may solve this barrier in the development of locally based N recommendations. The objective of this study was to explore application of ML methodologies to predict economic optimum nitrogen rate (EONR) for corn using data from 47 experiments across the US Corn Belt. Two features, a water table adjusted available water capacity (AWCwt) and a ratio of in-season rainfall to AWCwt (R AWCwt), were created to capture the impact of soil hydrology on N dynamics. Four ML mod-els—linear regression (LR), ridge regression (RR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, and gradient boost regression trees (GBRT)—were assessed and validated using “leave-one-location-out” (LOLO) and “leave-one-year-out” (LOYO) approaches. Generally, RR outperformed other models in predicting both at planting and split EONR times. Among the 47 tested sites, for 33 sites the predicted split EONR using RR fell within the 95% confidence interval, suggesting the chance of using the RR model to make an acceptable prediction of split EONR is ~70%. When RR was used to test split EONR prediction with input weather features surrogated with 10 yr of historical weather data, the model demonstrated robustness (MAE, 33.6 kg ha–1; R2 = 0.46).

However, to what extent seasonal climate prediction and remote sensing observations can improve crop yield forecasting at regional scale remains unknown. Using a statistical seasonal forecasting framework for U.S. county-level maize yield, we demonstrated that (1) incorporating satellite-based enhanced vegetation index (EVI) significantly improved the yield forecasting performance, compared with other climate-only models using monthly air temperature (T), precipitation (P), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). (2) The bias-corrected climate prediction from the Coupled Forecast System model version 2 (CFSv2) showed better yield forecasting performance than the historical climate ensemble.

Of all input data for WXGEN, precipitation is critical due to its sensitivity to the number of wet days. Since global climate model (GCM) data tend to have excessive wet days, use of GCM precipitation data for WXGEN may cause errors in the estimation of climate variables and therefore SWAT predictions. To examine such impacts of GCM data, we prepared two climate data for SWAT using WXGEN with both the original GCM data with the excessive number of wet days (EGCM) and the processed GCM data with the reasonable number of wet days (RGCM). We then compared SWAT simulations from EGCM and RGCM. Results show that because of the excessive wet days in EGCM, solar radiation generated by WXGEN was underestimated, subsequently leading to 143 mm lower ET and 0.6-0.8 m3/s greater streamflow compared to the simulations from RGCM. Simulated crop biomass under EGCM was smaller than RGCM due to less solar radiation. Although use of WXGEN is increasing in projecting climate change impacts using SWAT, potential errors from the combination of WXGEN and GCM have not well investigated. Our findings clearly demonstrate that GCM bias (excessive wet days) leads WXGEN to generate inaccurate climate data, resulting in unreasonable SWAT predictions. Thus, GCM data should be carefully processed to use them for WXGEN. © 2018 by the authors.","Excessive wet days; GCM bias; SWAT; WXGEN","Climate change; Solar radiation; Climate change impact; Excessive wet days; GCM bias; Global circulation model; Global climate model; Soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; WXGEN; Climate models; climate effect; climate modeling; comparative study; hydrological modeling; prediction; soil and water assessment tool; wet season",Article,Scopus

The watershed has been identified as ""impaired waters"" under Section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act due to high levels of sediment and total phosphorus. This excess is then transported to the Gulf of Mexico via the Yazoo River, further damaging the nation's water resources. The specific objectives of this study were to assess the impact of corn (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr., and rice (Oryza sativa, L.) crop-rotations (corn after soybean, soybean after rice, continuous soybean) and tillage practices (conventional, conservation, no-till) on crop yields and sediment yield using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The SWAT model was calibrated from January 2001 to December 2005 and validated from January 2006 to September 2010 for monthly stream flow with good to very good performance [coefficient of determination (R2) values from 0.68 to 0.83 and Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency index (NSE) values from 0.51 to 0.63] using stream flow data from three spatially distributed USGS gage stations within the BSRW. The SWAT model was further calibrated for corn and soybean yields from research fields at Stoneville and validated using research fields at the Clarksdale experiment stations with fair to excellent statistics (R2 values from 0.43 to 0.59 and NSE values from 0.34 to 0.96). The SWAT model simulation results suggested that corn yields were greater in the corn after soybean rotation under conventional tillage (mean=9.88Mgha-1) than no-tillage (mean=8.81Mgha-1) practices. However, tillage practices had no effects on soybean yield for the corn after soybean rotation. Soybean yields under conventional tillage practice indicated greater yields (mean=3.01Mgha-1) for the soybean after rice rotation than for soybean after corn. Continuous soybean under conventional tillage had the lowest simulated crop yield (mean=2.07Mg ha-1) and the greatest sediment yield (5.2Mg ha-1) in this study. The cumulative (1981-2009) sediment yield at the end of the simulation period (2009) indicated a maximum difference of about 8Mgha-1 between no-till and conventional tillage practices, with no-till contributing the lowest sediment yield. The cumulative difference of the sediment yield between no-till and conservation till was about 2Mgha-1.

In order to calculate climatic suitability index in different times (from early April to the 10-day before forecast day), methods of absolute, normalization, and correlation were used respectively to determine the weight coefficient of climatic suitability of each 10-day. Then, the relevance between meteorological influence index for maize yield and climatic suitability index obtained by different methods has been analyzed. A yield dynamic prediction model was established by regression analysis, and was used to forecast the spring maize yield in Jilin province. The results showed that, there were some differences between the three weight coefficient determination methods, but on the whole, the variation trend with the growth period were basically the same. The yield bumper or poor harvest prediction model established by regression analysis using materials from 1981 to 2012 most passed the 0.05 level effective test and the historical fitting average accuracy was all above 85.0%, the normalized root mean square error NRMSE was all less than 17.0%, and the accuracy of the bumper or poor harvest trend was generally in 60.0%−80.0%.The difference between the three methods was not obvious. The results of maize yield extrapolation forecast from 2013 to 2016 showed that, the yield prediction accuracy in each forecast times had fluctuant, but the average accuracy of methods of absolute, normalization, and correlation was 93.5%, 90.8% and 87.2%, respectively，and the standard deviation of the forecast results was 32.6, 69.4 and 116.1, respectively.

The proposed TCP is composed of 1 gateway and 2 modules as follows. First, the optimized farm sensor gateway (OFSG) collects data by internetworking sensor nodes which use Zigbee, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth protocol and reduces the number of sensor data fragmentation times through the compression of a fragment header. Second, the data storage module (DSM) stores the collected farm data and weather data in a farm central server. Third, the crop self-diagnosis module (CSM) works in the cloud server and diagnoses by deep learning whether or not the status of a farm is in good condition for growing crops according to current weather and soil information. The TCP performance shows that the data processing rate of the OFSG is increased by about 7% compared with existing sensor gateways. The learning time of the CSM is shorter than that of the long short-term memory models (LSTM) by 0.43 s, and the success rate of the CSM is higher than that of the LSTM by about 7%. Therefore, the TCP based on deep learning interconnects the communication protocols of various sensors, solves the maximum data size that sensor can transfer, predicts in advance crop disease occurrence in an external environment, and helps to make an optimized environment in which to grow crops. © 2018 by the authors.","Crop-diagnosis; Deep leaning; Farm cloud server; Farm sensor gateway",,Article,Scopus

This task is related to canonical correlation analysis, but our work extends beyond traditional techniques that were developed in the context of linear prediction algorithm. We perform clustering on independent and dependent attributes and compare the overlap in membership with what would be expected by random chance.

The utility of HadCM3 as a tool in climate change predictions in cross cultural studies is scarce. Therefore, this study sought to investigate and predict climate change induced temperature and precipitation in Iran. The calibration and validation using the HadCM3 was performed during 1961-2001, using daily temperatures and precipitation. The data on temperature and precipitation from 1961 to 1990 were used for calibration, and, for model validation, data from 1991 to 2001 were used. Moreover, in order to downscale general circulation models to station scales, SDSM version 4.2 was utilized. The least difference between observed data and simulation data during calibration and validation showed that the parameter was precisely modeled for most of the year. Simulation under the A2 scenario was performed for three time periods (2020, 2050, and 2080). According to our simulated model, precipitation showed a decreasing trend whereas temperature showed an increasing trend.

However, this study found that applying commonly used thresholds in defining HRUs may lead to considerable loss of information about the watershed landscape, emphasizing larger soil types on smaller land covers once the land covers meet a threshold for land cover, and potentially changing average slopes. These changes often have a minor effect on water yield and streamflow simulations by SWAT but a larger effect on sediment and nutrient load simulations, which are more sensitive to slope and soil type and are more influential on outputs at the subwatershed than at the watershed outlet.

High impact areas to which a large amount of pollutants are attributed were identified by simulating and analyzing nitrate outputs from 131 subbasins. Simulation results showed that growing switchgrass instead of corn could reduce nitrate yield by up to 71% (14. kg/ha) and sediments by up to 99% (5. t/ha).

A pertinent question is to know the optimal level of soil sampling or how many soil samples are needed formodel input, in order to improve model predictions. In this study, measured soil properties were clustered into five different configurations as inputs to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) simulation of the Castor River watershed (11-km2 area) in southern Quebec, Canada. SWAT is a process-based model that predicts the impacts of climate and land use management on water yield, sediment, and nutrient fluxes. SWAT requires geographical information system inputs such as the digital elevation model as well as soil and land use maps. Mean values of soil properties are used in soil polygons (soil series); thus, the spatial variability of these properties is neglected. The primary objective of this study was to quantify the impacts of spatial variability of soil properties on the prediction of runoff, sediment, and total phosphorus using SWAT. The spatial clustering of the measured soil properties was undertaken using the regionalized with dynamically constrained agglomerative clustering and partitioning method. Measured soil data were clustered into 5, 10, 15, 20, and 24 heterogeneous regions. Soil data from the Castor watershed which have been used in previous studies was also set up and termed ""Reference"". Overall, there was no significant difference in runoff simulation across the five configurations including the reference.

The transformation made was two-fold. First, we corrected the rainfall frequency bias of the climate model by truncating its daily rainfall cumulative distribution into the station's distribution based on a prescribed observed wet-day threshold. Then, we corrected the climate model rainfall intensity bias by mapping its truncated rainfall distribution into the station's truncated distribution. Further improvements were made to the bias corrected GCM rainfall by linking it with a stochastic disaggregation scheme to correct the time structure problem inherent with daily GCM rainfall. Results of the simple and hybridized GCM downscaled precipitation variables (total, probability of occurrence, intensity and dry spell length) were linked with a crop model for a more objective evaluation of their performance using a non-linear measure based on mutual information based on entropy.

By combining an advanced statistical bias correction method with a dynamical downscaling it constitutes a hybrid technique that yields nearly unbiased, high-resolution, physically consistent, three-dimensional fields that can be used for climate impact studies. The method is based on a prior statistical distribution correction of large-scale global climate model (GCM) 3-dimensional output fields to be taken as boundary forcing of a dynamical regional climate model (RCM). GCM fields are corrected using meteorological reanalyses. We evaluate this methodology over a decadal experiment. The improvement in terms of spatial and temporal variability is discussed against observations for a past period. The biases of the downscaled fields are much lower using this hybrid technique, up to a factor 4 for the mean temperature bias compared to the dynamical downscaling alone without prior bias correction. Precipitation biases are subsequently improved hence offering optimistic perspectives for climate impact studies. © 2012. American Geophysical Union.

Due particularly to the prominent yellow flowers exhibited by lesquerella canopies, remote sensing may be a useful tool for monitoring and managing the crop. In this study, we used a hand-held spectroradiometer to measure spectral reflectance over lesquerella canopies in 512 narrow wavebands from 268 to 1095nm over two growing seasons at Maricopa, Arizona. Biomass samples were also regularly collected and processed to obtain aboveground dry weight, flower counts, and silique counts. Partial least squares regression was used to develop predictive models for estimating the three lesquerella biophysical variables from canopy spectral reflectance. For model fitting and model testing, the root mean squared prediction errors between measured and modeled aboveground dry weight, flower counts, and silique counts were 2.1 and 2.3Mgha-1, 251 and 304 flowers, and 1018 and 1019 siliques, respectively. Analysis of partial least squares regression coefficients and loadings highlighted the most sensitive spectral wavebands for estimating each biophysical variable. For example, the flower count model heavily emphasized the reflectance of yellow light at 583nm, and contrasted that with reflectance in the blue (483nm) and at the red edge (721nm).

Remote sensing images are capable of identifying crop health, as well as predicting its yield. Vegetation indices (VIs), such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) calculated from remotely sensed data have been widely used to monitor crop growth and to predict crop yield. This study used 8 day TERRA MODIS reflectance data of 500 m resolution for the years 2005 to 2006 to estimate the yield of potato in the Munshiganj area of Bangladesh. The satellite data has been validated using ground truth data from fields of 50 farmers. Regression models are developed between VIs and field level potato yield for six administrative units of Munshiganj District. The yield prediction equations have high coefficients of correlation (R2) and are 0.84, 0.72 and 0.80 for the NDVI, LAI and fPAR, respectively. These equations were validated by using data from 2006 to 2007 seasons and found that an average error of estimation is about 15% for the study region.

This model is based on an indigenous crop growth simulator called Infocrop. The Infocrop-cotton model was calibrated and validated to simulate the effect of diverse weather, soil, and agronomic management practices on growth, development and yield of cotton varieties and hybrids using results of several diverse field experiments (60 datasets). These experiments were conducted during 2000-01 to 2004-05 in major cotton-producing states of India across locations spreading from Hisar (29°10′N, 75°46′E) to Coimbatore (11°00′N, 77°00′E) with varying management practices, weather and soil. The model satisfactorily simulated the trends in leaf area, dry matter growth, days to flowering and seed cotton yield. The simulated time to flowering and maturity varied between 54 and 80 days as well as 136 to 193 days, with an RMSE value of 3 and 8.5 days respectively. Total biomass and seed cotton yield showed an accuracy of 86 and 89% respectively. The model also precisely simulated water deficit and N stress, the two important abiotic constraints for dryland cotton production. The Infocrop-cotton model was used in conjunction with RS and GIS techniques for developing an integrated approach for deriving cotton production estimates. Resourcesat-1 LISS III data of October/November months corresponding to peak vegetative stage of cotton crop were used to derive spatial distribution of cotton crop. The study area was classified as polythesian polygons based on pedo-climatic variables, namely soil type, soil depth and rainfall pattern using GIS. Cotton yields for each of these polygons were simulated using the crop model and were aggregated to determine the total production of the district. The prediction of cotton production was more accurate to the partially irrigated or irrigated districts and not for the rainfed districts. The utility of the integrated approach in prediction of cotton production at the regional level has been discussed.","Cotton; Crop simulation model; Production; Remote sensing","Gossypium hirsutum",Article,Scopus

A necessary first step is to identify techniques to reliably quantify the relationships between soil and topographic characteristics and crop yield. Stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), projection pursuit regression (PPR), and several types of supervised feed-forward neural networks were investigated in an attempt to identify methods able to relate soil properties and grain yields on a point-by-point basis within ten individual site-years. To avoid overfitting, evaluations were based on predictive ability using a 5-fold cross-validation technique. The neural techniques consistently outperformed both SMLR and PPR and provided minimal prediction errors in every site-year. However, in site-years with relatively fewer observations and in site-years where a single, overriding factor was not apparent, the improvements achieved by neural networks over both SMLR and PPR were small. A second phase of the experiment involved estimation of crop yield across multiple site-years by including climatological data. The ten site-years of data were appended with climatological variables, and prediction errors were computed. The results showed that significant overfitting had occurred and indicated that a much larger number of climatologically unique site-years would be required in this type of analysis.","Neural networks; Precision agriculture; Prediction; Regression analysis","Climatology; Errors; Feedforward neural networks; Regression analysis; Soils; Projection pursuit regression (PPR); Agriculture; artificial neural network; crop yield; prediction; soil property; statistical analysis; topographic effect",Article,Scopus

Landsat 8 imageries for 2015 were used, applying the maximum likelihood supervised classifier to delineate the agricultural fields. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) applied on Landsat imageries on the mapped fields during the dry season (July to August) was used to identify irrigated areas, because years of satellite data analysis suggest that healthy crop conditions during dry seasons are only possible with irrigation.

Inner Mongolia, which occupies the largest area of the semiarid region in China, is a good representation of the region's climate and dryland agricultural conditions. Spring wheat is widely grown in this region, but the negative impacts of climate change have seriously threatened spring wheat production in recent years. To adapt to these changes, it is imperative to study the influence of climate change on spring wheat production. We employed a vulnerability assessment method to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of climate change on spring wheat production in Inner Mongolia and recommended specific countermeasures based on the results. The average temperature and precipitation during the spring wheat growing season was 16.5 °C and 224 mm, respectively, from 1961 to 2012. Northeastern Inner Mongolia was characterized by lower temperature and higher precipitation; the eastern region had both higher temperature and precipitation; and the southwestern area had higher temperature and lower precipitation. The climate in this region showed a warming and drying trend from 1961 to 2012, with average temperature during the spring wheat growing season increasing with an average rate 0.3 °C/10a and average precipitation decreasing with an average rate 4.3 mm/10a. Over the study period (from 1996 to 2012), the vulnerability of spring wheat in the eastern, central, and southwestern areas of Inner Mongolia was high, whereas that in the northeast was relatively low. Assuming the adaptive capacity of spring wheat is stable, the comprehensive unit vulnerability of spring wheat production is expected to significantly increase under the investigated climate change scenarios (based on historical climate trends and RCP4.5, RCP8.5 scenarios) relative to average values over the study period. Exposure and regional vulnerability could be reduced by decreasing the proportion of spring wheat grown in vulnerable areas, such as the central and southwestern areas of Inner Mongolia. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Assessment; Climate change; Inner Mongolia; Spring wheat; Vulnerability","Agriculture; Arid regions; Agricultural conditions; Assessment; Climate change scenarios; Inner Mongolia; Precipitation distribution; Spring wheat; Vulnerability; Vulnerability assessments; Climate change; agricultural production; climate change; dryland farming; global climate; growing season; risk assessment; spring (season); sustainable development; vulnerability; wheat; China; Nei Monggol; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Climatic indices and their variation were calculated during seven growth stages of wheat in five locations in the northeast of Iran from 1983 to 2008. Principal component analysis (PCA) technique was applied to explore major modes of variation in the regional climatic indices during different crop growth stages. The principle component obtained for each region was correlated to the regional winter wheat yield. Finally the regional amount of water and precipitation use efficiency (WUE and PUE) were analyzed in order to assess any possible association with wheat yield. The results showed that the highest precipitation occurred during the tillering stage and spatially decreased from north (Bojnord) to south (Birjand) and from east (Mashhad) to west (Sabzevar). The difference between the highest and the lowest precipitation across all locations was 2.5 of standard value. The variation pattern of AET, compared to other indices, showed more similarity to variation of precipitation at different growth stages and the highest AET (more than 2 of standard value in all locations) occurred during the tillering stage. The PCA indicated that effective components varied in different locations. The most positive and effective components were types of evapotranspiration that are associated with crop (ETC and AET) and precipitation. However none of these effective PCs showed a significant correlation with final yield. The PUE and WUE analysis indicated that PUE provides more information to interpret the relationship between total amounts of precipitation and the final yield. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This led to the increment in biomass accumulation, total alkaloid concentration, and vincamine production in selected treatments. The resultant experimental values were correlated with algorithm approaches of artificial neural network that assisted in finding the yield of vincamine, alkaloids, and growth kinetics using number of elicits. The inputs were the hydroxylase/acetyltransferase elicitors and cyclooxygenase inhibitor along with various precursors from shikimate and secoiridoid pools and the outputs were growth index (GI), alkaloids, and vincamine.

Growth kinetic studies revealed that shikimate and tryptophan supplementation triggers biomass accumulation (GI = 440.2 to 540.5); while maximum alkaloid (3.7 % dry wt.) and vincamine production (0.017 ± 0.001 % dry wt.) was obtained on supplementation of secologanin along with tryptophan, naproxen, hydrogen peroxide, and acetic anhydride. The study shows that experimental and predicted values strongly correlate each other. The correlation coefficient for growth index (GI), alkaloids, and vincamine was found to be 0.9997, 0.9980, 0.9511 in GRNN and 0.9725, 0.9444, 0.9422 in FFBPNN, respectively. GRNN provided greater similarity between the target and predicted dataset in comparison to FFBPNN. The findings can provide future insights to calculate growth index, alkaloids, and vincamine in combination to different elicits. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Artificial neural network; Generalized regression neural network; MATLAB; Vinca minor","Alkaloids; Amino acids; Biochemistry; Biological systems; Chemical compounds; Complex networks; Ecology; Kinetics; MATLAB; Metabolites; Neural networks; Algorithm approaches; Alkaloid biosynthesis; Artificial neural-network based modeling; Biomass accumulation; Correlation coefficient; Generalized regression neural networks; Terpenoid indole alkaloids; Vinca minor; Growth kinetics; acetic anhydride; acyltransferase; hydrogen peroxide; indole alkaloid; naproxen; oxygenase; secoiridoid; secologanin; shikimic acid; tryptophan; vincamine; alkaloid; Article; artificial neural network; back propagation; back propagation neural network; biomass; biosynthesis; correlation coefficient; hairy root; hairy root culture; kernel method; learning algorithm; nerve cell; nonhuman; perceptron; plant growth; plant root; Vinca; Vinca minor; biosynthesis; metabolism; plant root; Vinca; Alkaloids; Neural Networks (Computer); Plant Roots; Vinca",Article,Scopus

To simplify the procedure of generating weather realizations and make them available over the Internet, we implemented novel mechanisms for providing weather generators as web services, as well as a mechanism for sharing identical weather realizations given a climatological information. A web service for preparing long-term climate data was implemented based on an international standard, Sensor Observation Service (SOS). The weather generator services, which are the core components of the framework, analyze climatological data, and can take seasonal climate forecasts as inputs for generating weather realizations. The generated weather realizations are encoded in a standard format, which are ready for use to crop modeling. All outputs are generated in SOS standard, which broadens the extent of data sharing and interoperability with other sectoral applications, e.g., water resources management. These services facilitate the development of other applications requiring input weather realizations, as these can be obtained easily by just calling the service. The workload of analysts related to data preparation and handling of legacy weather generator programs can be reduced. The architectural design and implementation presented here can be used as a prototype for constructing further services on top of an interoperable sensor network system. © 2016 by the authors.","Climatological data; Crop model; Sensor observation service; Weather model; Weather realizations","Crops; Data handling; Information management; Interoperability; Sensor networks; Systems engineering; Water resources; Websites; Climatological data; Climatological information; Crop model; Design and implementations; Seasonal climate forecast; Sensor observation services; Water resources management; Weather modeling; Web services",Article,Scopus

Land surface patches within one HRU have identical hydrological properties (e.g., land use, soil, slope and management) and thus have similar hydrological responses. The non-spatial aspects of HRUs, however, are considered a key weakness of the SWAT model because it is difficult to determine the spatial locations and describe the interactions between different HRUs. Here, a new method to produce continuous HRUs with a clear spatial position for SWAT using Geographic Information System tools is proposed and then tested in a small catchment of the Taihu Basin, China. The SWAT model was then modified based on spatial continuous discretized HRUs accounting for the surface runoff lag difference of HRUs in one sub-basin. The results showed that the modified model was more sensitive to the lag in runoff processes and thus had better simulation accuracy. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Hydological response unit; Hydrological model; Runoff lag; Spatial discretization; Taihu basin","Catchments; Geographic information systems; Land use; Hydological response unit; Hydrological modeling; Runoff lags; Spatial discretizations; Taihu basins; Runoff; ecohydrology; GIS; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; land surface; runoff; spatial analysis; China; Taihu Basin",Article,Scopus

Crop rotation has been a primary land use change in recent several decades in agro-ecosystem of central United States. Understanding hydrological responses to crop rotation is critical for developing appropriate crop rotation guide strategies for sustainable water resources management and protection of public safety. However, these responses are not well demonstrated and there exists only a few comparison analyses regarding impacts of different rotation patterns on hydrological process. Herein, we show how crop rotation, specifically shifted rotation patterns in various periods, can affect stream flow simulation using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in a typical agro-ecosystem watershed (the Smoky Hill River Watershed) in the Great Plains of the United States. Our results show that, although an accurate crop rotation pattern (2008-2010) slightly improved the simulation performance from 1999 to 2013, precision of stream flow simulation in corresponding and adjacent periods increased significantly. A significant improvement of stream flow simulations in 2006-2008 was also found when applied the corresponding rotation patterns in this period. However, model performance in periods adjacent to 2006-2008 for these two scenarios was not better than that in the periods longer distanced from 2006-2008. The trends of significant improvement to model performance for the corresponding rotation periods suggest that SWAT model capturing more information on crop rotation pattern can lead to a more accurate stream flow prediction. We conclude that selecting various periods of crop rotation patterns has obvious advantage in performance of predicting stream flow.

The Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) has used the TxRR (Texas Rainfall-Runoff) model to estimate the total fresh water inflow and annual sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loads from measured and simulated stream flows to the bays in Texas. Applying newer methods, such as distributed hydrologic models, e.g., SWAT, enables the temporal and spatial distribution of freshwater, sediment, and nutrient loads to also be predicted. To develop the SWAT model for the estimation of sediment and nutrient loads from two watersheds, the Matagorda as a rural watershed and Galveston as an urbanized watershed, the average of the calibrated model parameter values were applied to the ungauged lower sub-watersheds in consideration of land use homogeneity. The monthly sediment calibration showed good agreement compared with the observed total suspended sediment, with Nash Sutcliffe Model Efficiency (NSE) values ranging from 0.55 to 0.75 and Percent Bias (PBIAS) values ranging from +10.3% to +51.0%. The predicted monthly total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) at gauge stations exhibited poor correlation with the observed values in the urbanized sub-watersheds but good-to-acceptable correlation in the other watersheds, with NSE values ranging from -0.15 to 0.85 and PBIAS values ranging from+13.3% to +84.0%. The comparison of the SWAT and available estimations from previous studies showed good agreement for the mean annual total suspended sediment and nutrient loads from ungauged sub-watersheds to the bays. Using parameter settings from gauged watersheds for ungauged watersheds, SWAT can be applied to other Texas coastal watersheds to estimate flow and sediment and nutrient loads. However, extending the global average values of the adjusted parameters to the highly developed ungauged sub-watersheds may lead to poor results, and limited regionalization in parameter allocation to these areas should be considered. © 2014 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers","Modeling; Nutrients; Sediment; SWAT; Texas; Ungauged","Land use; Models; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Rain; Runoff; Sediments; Stream flow; Suspended sediments; Water; Water quality; Watersheds; Distributed hydrologic model; Soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; Temporal and spatial distribution; Texas; Texas water development boards; Total suspended sediments; Ungauged; Nutrients",Article,Scopus

However, the choice of a particular method and of a particular regional model can strongly influence the final result since crop models are very sensitive to the quality of the input climate forcing. The objective of this study is to address this issue by analysing the dispersion of rainfall provided by eight regional models and how this dispersion spreads in the estimation of millet yields in Senegal. The SARRAH crop model is used to simulate millet yields. The study shows that there is a wide dispersion in the representation of rainfall from one regional model to another (and even sometimes for the same regional model with two sets of parameters) at both the seasonal and intra-seasonal scales. These biases introduce significant errors in estimating the agronomic impacts, which might invalidate conclusions about the impacts of climate change based on the use of a single regional model.

Sedimentation due to forest harvesting has been identified as one of the major threat to Upper Pearl River Watershed (UPRW) located in east central Mississippi. The overall objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of forest harvesting, particularly clear cutting and thinning, on hydrological and water quality characteristics at UPRW.

The statistical analysis such as coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (NSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and percentage bias (PBIAS) were used for evaluating SWAT efficiency for predicting average monthly flow. The calibrated SWAT model showed fair to good performance with R2 ranging from 0.70 to 0.74, NSE from 0.42 to 0.7, RMSE from 1.13 to 4.8 m3/s and PBIAS from 0.1% to .3%.

Drainage water management showed potential for reducing annual average (1915-2006) drain flow from all drain spacings (10-35 m) regardless of the growing season operational strategy, with reductions varying between 52 and 55% for the drain spacings considered. Approximately 81 to 99% of the annual drain flow reduction occurred during the non-growing season, depending on the operational strategy. Fixed DWM operational strategies led to an increase in mean predicted yield for narrower spacings compared with conventional drainage systems. Maximum yield was achieved with no control for drain spacings wider than 20 m in 50% of the years. Overall, the height of control had more influence on relative yield than the date of initiation of control. The greatest positive impacts of DWM on relative yield (1.2%) occurred in cool, dry years, while the greatest average negative impacts (-0.2%) occurred in cool, wet years. On average, with the best-case operation selected for annual weather conditions, DWM increased relative yield by approximately 0.8, 0.4, and 0.2% for the 10-, 20-, and 30-m drain spacing, respectively.

Data required to calculate the mean VPD on a daily basis are rarely available, and most models use approximations to estimate it. In APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator), VPD is estimated from daily maximum and minimum temperatures with the assumption that the minimum temperature equals dew point, and there is little change in vapour pressure or dew point during any one day. The accuracy of such VPD estimations was assessed using data collected every 15 min near Wagga Wagga in New South Wales, Australia. Actual vapour pressure of the air ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 kPa. For more than 75% of the time its variation was less than 20%, and the maximum variation was up to 50%. Daytime mean VPD ranged from 0 to 5.3 kPa. Daily minimum temperature was found to be a poor estimate of dew point temperature, being higher than dew point in summer and lower in winter. Thus the prediction of vapour pressure was poor. Vapour pressure at 0900 hours was a better estimate of daily mean vapour pressure. Despite the poor estimation of vapour pressure, daytime mean VPD was predicted reasonably well using daily maximum and minimum temperatures. If the vapour pressure at 0900 hours from the SILO Patched Point Dataset was used as the actual daily mean vapour pressure, the accuracy of daytime VPD estimation was further improved. Simulations using historical weather data for 1957-2002 show that such improved accuracy in daytime VPD estimation slightly increased simulated crop yield and deep drainage, while slightly reducing crop water uptake. Comparison of the APSIM RUE/TE and CERES-Wheat approaches for modelling potential transpiration revealed differences in crop water demand estimated by the two approaches. Although the differences had a small effect on the probability distribution of simulated long-term wheat yield, water uptake, and deep drainage, this finding highlights the need for a scientific re-appraisal of the APSIM RUE/TE and energy balance approaches for the estimation of crop demand, which will have implications for modelling crop growth under water-limited conditions and calculation of water required to maintain maximum growth.",,"agricultural modeling; crop yield; drainage; plant water relations; water use efficiency; Australasia; Australia; Eastern Hemisphere; New South Wales; Wagga Wagga; World; Ilex cookii; Ruta; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to analyze the past dataset of crop yields and predict future yields using regression-based approximation of time series fuzzy data. A framework-based algorithm, which we named DAbFP (data algorithm for degree approximation-based fuzzy partitioning), is proposed to forecast wheat yield production with fuzzy time series data. Specifically, time series data were fuzzified by the simple maximum-based generalized mean function. Different cases for prediction values were evaluated based on two-set interval-based partitioning to get accurate results. The novelty of the method lies in its ability to approximate a fuzzy relation for forecasting that provides lesser complexity and higher accuracy in linear, cubic, and quadratic order than the existing methods. A lesser complexity as compared to dynamic data approximation makes it easier to find the suitable de-fuzzification process and obtain accurate predicted values. The proposed algorithm is compared with the latest existing frameworks in terms of mean square error (MSE) and average forecasting error rate (AFER). © 2018 by the authors.","Fuzzy regression; Fuzzy rules; Time series; Wheat production prediction",,Article,Scopus

Evaluation of soil nutrients in intercropping is a basic criterion for selecting the type of cultivation and increasing the productivity of the soil. Based on experimental study, evaluation of soil needs time and cost too much. However the soil parameters can be rapidly estimated using predicted meteorology and can be appropriately assessed. Linear estimation methods are less accurate than non-linear methods, but non-linear methods for modeling of soil elements are diffi cult due to highly computing times. The artifi cial intelligence is a powerful tool for fast modeling, more accurately. In this paper, artifi cial intelligence method such as Artifi cial Neural Networks (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) has been used to estimate soil chemical properties (carbon and nitrogen). Four input parameters including the soil temperature, type of intercropping (different ratios of Roselle – green gram), type of tillage (no-tillage, minimum tillage, conventional tillage) and sodium have been used in ANN and ANFIS prediction. ANFIS and ANN modeling have been compared using several statistics (root mean square error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results indicate that the artifi cial intelligences can be successful applied for estimating soil carbon and nitrogen. ANFIS is found to be more accurate than the ANN. A sensitivity analysis has conducted based on ANFIS estimate. It is shown that increased percent of green gram in intercropping can reduce the percentage of carbon to nitrogen (C/N). © 2017, National Centre for Agrarian Sciences.

Data from 964 orchards of lemon, mandarin, and orange in Corrientes, Argentina are analysed. Graphic and analytical descriptive statistics, correlation coefficients, principal component analysis and Biplot were performed. Production was predicted via M5-Prime, a model regression tree constructor which produces a classification based on piecewise linear functions. For all the species studied, the most informative variable was the trees’ age; in mandarin and orange orchards, age was followed by between and within row distances; irrigation also affected mandarin production. Also, the performance of M5-Prime in the prediction of production is adequate, as shown when measured with correlation coefficients (~0.8) and relative mean absolute error (~0.1).

This study presents a new approach based on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for extracting and predicting the alpha power band of EEG signals during Muslim prayer (Salat). Proposed models can acquire information related to the alpha power variations during Salat from other physiological parameters such as heart rate variability (HRV) components, heart rate (HR), and respiration rate (RSP). The models were developed by systematically optimizing the initial ANFIS model parameters. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to evaluate the performance of the optimized ANFIS models.

The focus is mainly on the design of specific forecast advisories that are risk-free and useful in spite of their inherent errors. The strategy works for these specific applications because the forecast advisories are based on when NOT to irrigate or apply fertilizer/pesticide because rain is predicted (risk-free because wrong forecast only delays irrigation/application of fertilizer/pesticide within tolerance). Thus, unlike in conventional forecast evaluation, a forecast is considered as valid if the forecasted rain (or no rain) is correct for the day of the forecast (D0C) or the next day or the day after (designated D1C and D2C, respectively), as the farmer can afford to postpone the field application for a couple of days beyond the scheduled date. The methodology has been evaluated for rainfall forecasts over Karnataka (a state in southwest India with nearly 56% of the workforce engaged in agriculture). Here, forecast validation against rain gauge observations is presented at comparable resolutions for the southwest (June to September) and the northeast (October to December) monsoon seasons during 2011–2014. Analyses demonstrate that forecasts over several areas which may appear to be less reliable based on conventional evaluation (D0C) are found to have useful skill for the specific agro-applications as evident from evaluation based on D1C and D2C criteria. Our analysis shows that the evaluation strategy presented is effective during the non-rainy (January–May) season also.

Study focus: Climate change is projected to have significant impacts on agricultural production. Therefore, understanding the regional impacts of climate change on irrigation demand for crop production is important for watershed managers and agricultural producers to understand for effective water resources management. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool was used to assess the impact of climate change on corn and soybean irrigation demand in the Kalamazoo River Watershed. Bias-corrected statistically downscaled climate change data from ten global climate models and four emissions scenarios were used in SWAT to develop projections of irrigation demand and yields for 2020-2039 and 2060-2079. Six adaptation scenarios were developed to shift the planting dates (planting earlier and later in the growing season) to take advantage of periods with greater rainfall or lower temperature increases. New hydrological insights for the region: Uncertainty in irrigation demand was found to increase moving from 2020-2039 to 2060-2079, with demand generally decreasing moving further into the future for corn and soybean. A shift in timing of peak irrigation demand and increases in temperature lead to corn yield reductions. However, soybean yield increased under these conditions. Finally, the adaptation strategy of planting earlier increased irrigation demand and water available for transpiration, while delaying planting resulted in demand decreases for both crops. © 2014 The Authors.","Adaptation; Climate change; Crop yield; Irrigation demand; SWAT; Uncertainty","Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The spatial heterogeneity of crop condition (e.g., phenology and yields) at that scale could be substantial. Because the atmosphere-cropland exchanges of energy, water, and materials are sensitive to crop condition, this issue poses a question: How can we simulate the condition of a crop of interest on a GCM grid scale while taking into account the spatial heterogeneity of crop condition at a sub-grid scale? We therefore proposed an ensemble approach that uses stochastic parameter values to represent the spatial variation in the phenological and biophysical characteristics of a crop within a given GCM grid box, and tested its feasibility with simulation experiments. The combination of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) applied to maize in the Central Great Plains, United States, and coarse-resolution (2.5° × 2.5°) reanalysis data was taken as the example. The ensemble simulations successfully captured the spatial variation in the phenology and yield.

In this study, canopy reflectance band and different band ratios in form of vegetation indices (VI) with leaf area index (LAI) were used to generate remotely sensed pre-harvest empirical rice yield prediction models. LAI measurements, spectral data derived from two SPOT data acquired on August 24, 2008 and August 23, 2009 and observed rice yield were used as main inputs for rice yield modeling. Each remotely sensed factor was used separately and in combination with LAI to generate the models. The results showed that green spectral band, middle infra-red spectral band and green vegetation index (GVI) did not show sufficient capability as rice yield estimators while other inputs such as red spectral band, near infrared spectral band and vegetation indices that are algebraic ratios from these two spectral bands when used separately or in combined with leaf area index (LAI) produced high accurate rice yield estimation models. The validation process was carried out using two statistical tests; standard error of estimate and the correlation coefficient between modeled and predicted yield. The validation results indicated that using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) combined with leaf area index (LAI) produced the model with highest accuracy and stability during the two rice seasons.

Saline irrigation water is a major concern in the North Fork of the Red River watershed in southwestern Oklahoma. The Elm Fork Creek flows through salt deposits, making the creek and its receiving stream, the North Fork River, too saline to use for irrigation. This greatly reduces the number of hectares that can be utilized for agricultural crops within the watershed. Future weather scenarios were analyzed to determine how varied precipitation and temperature would impact salinity levels in the streams and crop yields within the watershed. Due to no significant weather trends in the 57 year record within the watershed, WXGEN was used to simulate a potential 10% increase and decrease in precipitation from 2011-2060. Output from the weather generator was input into a calibrated SWAT model to simulate wheat and dryland and irrigated cotton yields for the various weather scenarios. Using an existing correlation between ionic strength and streamflow, salinity levels were estimated and found to increase by 9% for the dry scenario and decrease 31% for the wet scenario at the USGS gage station located downstream from salt springs on the Elm Fork River. The levels ranged from 22 dS m-1 to 35 dS m-1, which were much higher than the levels (10 dS m-1) where only very tolerant crops can be successfully grown. Though there was not a significant difference in wheat yields, the simulations with a 10% increase in precipitation had significantly higher yields than the simulations with a 10% decrease in precipitation for both the dryland and irrigated cotton.","Cotton modeling; Crop yield; North Fork of the Red River; Salinity; Soil and water assessment tool","Cotton; Crops; Ionic strength; Irrigation; Landforms; Salinity measurement; Water supply; Watersheds; Agricultural crops; Crop yield; Dryland; Future climate; Gage stations; Higher yield; Irrigated cotton; Oklahoma; Red River; Saline irrigation; Salinity; Salinity levels; Soil and Water assessment tools; SWAT model; Weather generator; Wheat yield; Rivers",Conference Paper,Scopus

There is a pressing need for a watershed model to better understand the interaction between land use activities and hydrologic processes and to support sustainable water use planning. In this study, we evaluated the performance of SWAT for hydrologic modeling in the Xixian River Basin, located at the headwaters of the Huaihe River, and compared its performance with the Xinanjiang (XAJ) model that has been widely used in China. Due to the lack of publicly available data, emphasis has been put on geospatial data collection and processing, especially on developing land use-land cover maps for the study area based on ground-truth information sampling. Ten-year daily runoff data (1987-1996) from four stream stations were used to calibrate SWAT and XAJ. Daily runoff data from the same four stations were applied to validate model performance from 1997 to 2005. The results show that both SWAT and XAJ perform well in the Xixian River Basin, with percentage of bias (PBIAS) less than 15%, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) larger than 0.69 and coefficient of determination (R2) larger than 0.72 for both calibration and validation periods at the four stream stations. Both SWAT and XAJ can reasonably simulate surface runoff and baseflow contributions. Comparison between SWAT and XAJ shows that model performances are comparable for hydrologic modeling. For the purposes of flood forecasting and runoff simulation, XAJ requires minimum input data preparation and is preferred to SWAT. The complex, processes-based SWAT can simultaneously simulate water quantity and quality and evaluate the effects of land use change and human activities, which makes it preferable for sustainable water resource management in the Xixian watershed where agricultural activities are intensive. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Huaihe River; Hydrologic modeling; Multi-site calibration; SWAT; Water resource; Xinanjiang model","Huaihe river; Hydrologic modeling; Multi-site calibration; SWAT; Xinanjiang model; Calibration; Climate change; Data handling; Flood control; Human resource management; Land use; Landforms; Quality control; Rivers; Runoff; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Watersheds; Weather forecasting; Climate models; headwater; human activity; hydrological modeling; land use planning; model validation; runoff; water management; water resource; water use; watershed; China; Huai River",Article,Scopus

Direct and indirect methods are available to feed DRAINMOD with the required inputs. Direct measurements of soil parameters are time consuming and costly compared with indirect methods such as the use of pedotransfer functions (PTFs). The goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of running DRAINMOD using saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) and soil water characteristics (SWC) data estimated by PTFs. In previous research, we have identified the best performing PTFs for estimating the Ksat and SWC data for US soils of different textural classes. Data from Four U.S. agricultural drained sites, having different soils, crops, drainage systems, and climatological conditions, were used in the analysis. For each of the four sites Ksat and SWC data have been estimated using the best performing PTFs according to the soil textural class. The model was run using both calibrated and PTF-estimated Ksat and SWC data. Measured annual drainage was compared to predicted drainage using estimated and calibrated soil hydraulic properties. The Normalized Root Mean Square Error and Modeling Efficiency were used to assess the model performance. As expected, predicted annual drainage using the calibrated soil parameters (NRMSE=9-24%, EF=0.62-0.91) was more accurate than predicted drainage using PTF-estimated soil parameters (NRMSE=21-33%, EF=0.29-0.70). The errors in DRAINMOD predictions induced by using PTF-estimated soil parameters appear to have a small impact on DRAINMOD predictions of the system's response (annual drainage rate) to different management scenarios (e.g. conventional and controlled drainage). This finding has important implications regarding the large scale application of DRAINMOD to quantify the hydrologic and water quality impacts of controlled drainage across the U.S. Midwest.","DRAINMOD; Hydraulic conductivity; Pedotransfer functions; Soil water characteristics data","Climatological conditions; Computer simulation model; Controlled drainage; Conventional and controlled drainage; Direct and indirect methods; Direct measurement; Drainage rate; Drainage systems; Drainage water management; DRAINMOD; Indirect methods; Large-scale applications; Management scenarios; Model performance; Pedotransfer functions; Root mean square errors; Saturated hydraulic conductivity; Soil hydraulic properties; Soil parameters; Soil water characteristics; Soil water characteristics data; Water quality impact; Computer simulation; Drainage; Forecasting; Hydraulic conductivity; Parameter estimation; Quality control; Soil moisture; Wastewater disposal; Water management; Water quality; Geologic models",Conference Paper,Scopus

The aim of this study was to model hydrologic processes of sugarcane-grown organic soils utilizing OntoSim in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) of South Florida. This OntoSim-Sugarcane model describes the complex hydrology of sub-irrigation and open ditch drainage commonly used on Florida farms. Model calibration was conducted by (i) selecting rectangular farm water management units (<12 ha), which are encompassed with farm ditches, from two farms in the EAA, (ii) assembling all relevant input data including water tables (WT) recorded at the monitoring farm well of each unit, and (iii) optimizing the fits between the simulated and observed daily WT during two consecutive water years (WY). By calibrating two site-specific parameters - lateral saturated hydraulic conductivities of soil profiles and vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity of the underlying limestone bedrock - good agreement between simulated and observed daily WT was obtained (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient >0.65; coefficient of residual mass <1%) within the units during WY96-97 (May 1995-April 1997). The validation of the model during subsequent WY98-99 at both units also showed Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency >0.55 and coefficient of residual mass <3%. It indicated that OntoSim-Sugarcane is able to simulate daily fluctuations of WT within the farm units and estimate lateral drainage/sub-irrigation and deep seepage that significantly contribute to the water balance at farms in the EAA.

The WQFS has forty-eight cropping system treatment plots with 10 m drain spacing. Drain flow observations from a subset of the treatment plots with continuous corn (Zea mays L.) were used to calibrate the model, which was then used to develop an operational strategy for drainage water management. The chosen dates of raising and lowering the outlet during the crop period were 10 and 85 days after planting, respectively, with a control height of 50 cm above the drain (40 cm from the surface). The potential effects of this operational strategy on hydrology and corn yield were simulated over a period of 15 years from 1991 to 2005. On average, the predicted annual drain flows were reduced by 60% (statistically significant at 95% level). This is the most significant benefit of drainage water management since it may reduce the nitrate load to the receiving streams. About 68% of the reduced drain flow contributed to an increase in seepage. Drainage water management increased the average surface runoff by about 85% and slightly decreased the relative yield of corn crop by 0.5% (both are not statistically significant at 95% level). On average, the relative yield due to wet stress (RYw) decreased by 1.3% while relative yield due to dry stress (RYd) increased by 1%. Overall, the relative crop yield increased in 5 years (within a range of 0.8-6.9%), decreased in 8 years (within a range of 0.2-5.5%), and was not affected in the remaining 2 years. With simulated drainage water management, the water table rose above the conventional drainage level during both the winter and the crop periods in all years (except 2002 crop season).

MODIS/AQUA enhanced vegetation index and land surface temperature (LST) at 1 km were used to calculate TVDI and maize yield over a large agricultural area of Argentine Pampas. The comparison between TVDI and official yield statistics was carried out to derive regression models in two agro-climatic zones, obtaining linear and quadratic adjustments. The models account for between 73% and 83% of yield variability, with the best prediction in the humid zone. The RMSE values ranged from 14% to 19% of average yield. The bias showed a slightly higher difference between predicted and observed yield data in semi-Arid zone. The models showed aptitude to estimate yield with reasonable accuracy 8-12 weeks before harvest. In addition, the TVDI-maize yield relationship and the impact of submonthly water stress were evaluated at field scale using yield measurements to ensure the analysis on maize. The highest \text{R}^{2} (0.61) was obtained using monthly values suggesting that the entire critical stage should be taken into account for yield forecasting.

This study was designed to simulate the hydrologic responses of eight land cover and climate scenarios of Pagsanjan-Lumban Watershed (PLW) in Laguna, Quiaoit River Watershed (QRW) in Ilocos Norte, and Saug Watershed (SW) in Davao del Norte through the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Streamflow was then used to calibrate and validate the model using SUFI-2 algorithm in SWAT-CUP.

Simulation results showed that (i) increased (decreased) precipitation in the areas also increased (decreased) water yield, surface runoff, and baseflow; (ii) the moderate shift to forest within the watershed moderately decreased runoff volume and increased evapotranspiration, which consequently decreased baseflow; (iii) urbanization resulted in lower baseflow but higher evapotranspiration; and (iv) presence of forest vegetation is associated with high infiltration and recharge; thus, lower surface runoff with higher baseflow. Hydrologic behavior, therefore, changes as it responds to changes in land cover and climate.

In fine-textured, low-permeability soil profiles, moles can be installed to supplement an underlying tile drain system. However, moles are often not included in such designs. The objective of this modeling study was to investigate the performance impacts of variations in mole integrity and design in such a soil profile during a range of rainfall event scenarios. A finite element software package (SEEP/W) was used to model a field site having (system 1) subsurface tile drains (0.9 m depth, 15 m spacing) with gravel aggregate(10 to 50 mm) and intersecting mole drains (0.6 m depth, 1.4 m spacing). The field site was subjected to a pedological survey to characterize the soil profile, while an on-site weather station and end-of-pipe flowmeters provided rainfall and discharge data from which the model could be calibrated. The calibrated model showed close agreement between modeled and observed subsurface discharge in the validation period (coefficient of mass residual = 0.12, index of agreement = 0.94, model efficiency = 0.74). The model was then used to evaluate the impact of three alternative designs: tile drains only, a common practice in similar soils (system 2); a design similar to system 1 but with the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) of the mole-drained layer decreased to mimic a reduction in mole drain integrity and effectiveness (system 3); and a design similar to system 1 but with Ks of the mole-drained layer increased to mimic improved soil disturbance and fissuring during installation (system 4). These systems were analyzed using the calibration (event A) and validation (event B) rainfall events as well as two notional rainfall scenarios: a ""fixed rainfall"" scenario (event C) with a rainfall rate of 2 mm h-1 applied to all systems for 50 h and a ""historical rainfall"" scenario (event D) with annual (30 year) average daily values for the area (taken as the average monthly totals divided by the number of days per month) applied over a year. Results showed that the modeled designs exhibited similar relative behavior in all simulated rainfall scenarios. Systems 1 and 4 consistently outperformed systems 2 and 3 in terms of average and peak discharge and water table control capacity. Across rainfall events, system 2 (without mole drains) was the least effective and was seen to decrease drain discharge by an average of 63% and reduce mean water table depth by an average of 72% relative to systems 1 and 4. Results showed the importance of mole channels in supplementing tile drainage on fine soils, as well as the importance of mole integrity for optimal performance. Such a tool could provide decision support in the drainage system design process and assess the implications of design variations on cost, expected performance, and likely returns to the landowner by estimating seasonal variations in drainage discharge and water table position. Identifying and characterizing the major soil types on a farm through soil profile pedological descriptions and collation of real soil physical and meteorological data is essential to prescribe appropriate drainage designs and prioritize areas for drainage installation in light of technical feasibility and cost estimates. With highresolution data, the software can be calibrated for other drainage system and climate change scenarios. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Mole drainage; Rainfall; SEEP/W; Simulation; Soil physical properties; Subsurface drainage","Climate change; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Cultivation; Decision support systems; Decision tables; Drainage; Finite element method; Forestry; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Hydraulic conductivity; Meteorology; Rain; Soil testing; Soils; Systems analysis; Mole drainage; SEEP/W; Simulation; Soil physical property; Subsurface drainages; Soil surveys; calibration; design; hydraulic conductivity; installation; model validation; modeling; peak discharge; pedology; physical property; rainfall; seasonal variation; simulation; software; soil drainage; soil profile; soil property; subsurface flow; tile drain; water table",Conference Paper,Scopus

Accurate simulation of irrigation and other associated water balance components are critical for meaningful evaluation of the effects of irrigation management strategies. Modelers often employ auto-irrigation functions within models such as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). However, some studies have raised concerns as to whether the function is able to adequately simulate representative irrigation practices. In this study, observations of climate, irrigation, evapotranspiration (ET), leaf area index (LAI), and crop yield derived from an irrigated lysimeter field at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory at Bushland, Texas were used to evaluate the efficacy of the SWAT auto-irrigation functions. Results indicated good agreement between simulated and observed daily ET during both model calibration (2001-2005) and validation (2006-2010) periods for the baseline scenario (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency; NSE ≥ 0.80). The auto-irrigation scenarios resulted in reasonable ET simulations under all the thresholds of soil water deficit (SWD) triggers as indicated by NSE values > 0.5. However, the auto-irrigation function did not adequately represent field practices, due to the continuation of irrigation after crop maturity and excessive irrigation when SWD triggers were less than the static irrigation amount. © 2017 by the authors.","Crop yield; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation frequency; Irrigation magnitude; Leaf area index (LAI); Lysimeters; Single-HRU method; Soil water deficit threshold; SWAT","Agriculture; Aquifers; Crops; Evapotranspiration; Function evaluation; Lysimeters; Plants (botany); Rain; Research laboratories; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Soils; Crop yield; Irrigation frequency; Leaf Area Index; Single-HRU method; Soil water deficit; SWAT; Irrigation; agricultural management; calibration; crop production; crop yield; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; leaf area index; lysimeter; management practice; model validation; recharge; semiarid region; soil and water assessment tool; upland region; water budget; Great Plains; Ogallala Aquifer; United States",Article,Scopus

In order to examine the subsurface drainage system layout plans based on the high probability of waterlogging prevention in the farmlands, a model simulation study using the field hydrology model-DRAINMOD was conducted for cotton growing condition in Dongtai, Jiangsu, China. The applicability of DRAINMOD was tested with reported data of water table drawdown from a locally conducted subsurface drainage experiment. Long term simulations were subsequently conducted based on daily weather data from 1953 to 2015 in the study area, and the soil drainage and crop factors. The waterlogging control objective was based on lowering water table depth to 80 cm below soil surface in 3 days after rainfall events, and DRAINMOD simulation results for different subsurface drainage system layout plans were evaluated on the assurance rate of 95%. In addition, the effect of supplemental irrigation on crop yields were examined through simulations of crop yields with different irrigation strategies. The simulation results showed that: 1) DRAINMOD could predict water table depths reasonably well for the study area and the relative error between simulated and measured water table depths was 4.7%; to meet the high assurance rate of 95% for cotton, the required subsurface pipe spacing presented a logarithmic relationship with the subsurface pipe depth that ranged from 80 to 200 cm (P&lt;0.01); when supplemental irrigation was applied in August, the predicted average relative yields of cotton were in the range of 84.3% to 86.3% under the proposed drainage system layout. 2) For the optimum design of subsurface drain depth at 150 cm and spacing at 20 m, with good surface drainage condition, the simulated subsurface drainage accounted for 87.3% of the total drainage, the surface drainage alone could not meet the drainage requirement for waterlogging reduction in the study area. 3) DRAINMOD predicted values of the soil excess water index (SEW30) in the flowering and boll-forming stage of cotton were in the range of 27.15 to 47.49 cm∙d, which were much lower than the values that would lead to 10% to 15% reduction of the cotton yield based on existing studies. 4) For a severe 3-day storm event that produced 369.9 mm rainfall in 3 days in the simulated period, DRAINMOD simulation results showed that shallow and narrowly placed drains could lower water table more effectively during the early days of drainage, while the deep and wider drains could lower water table to a greater depth during the later time period. 5) For the coastal area, lowering water table depth from 150 cm to 200cm may result in salt water surface rise of 11.96 m, posing a potential threat of saltwater intrusion. Because lowering water table to an excessive depth may lead to high soil moisture and nutrient losses, the subsurface drainage pipes should be placed as shallow as necessary to achieve the desired water table control level from both the economical and the environmental perspective. Considering multiple objectives of waterlogging reduction, salinity control, maximum crop yields, environmental protection and economic benefits, the authors recommend the drain depths of between 120 cm and 150 cm and the spacing between 15 m and 20 m as the appropriate design parameters for the study area. Findings from this study may provide technical reference for agricultural drainage system installation in the coastal mud-flat area. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The experimental data and simulated model data were analysed on partitioning of leaf, stem and grains, and validated. It was found that the model closely simulated the field data from phenological events and biomass. Simulated biological and grain yield was in accordance with-field experiment crop yield within the acceptable range. The correlation coefficient between field-experiment and simulated yield data and biomass data varied significantly from 0.81 and 0.96. The model showed overestimation from field-experimental yield for both cultivars. The cultivar PBW 343 gave higher yield than cultivar PBW 542 on 15 November during both years. The model performance was evaluated and it was found that CERES-wheat model could predict growth parameters like days to anthesis and maturity, biomass and yield with reasonably good accuracy (error less than 8%) and also correlation coefficient between field-experimental and simulated yield data and biomass data varied from 0.94 and 0.95. The results showed that the correlation coefficient between simulated and districts yield varied from 0.41 to 0.78 and also significantly at all six selected districts.

The goal is to obtain a close-loop operation with rainfall information, whose design is based on optimal control theory. Thus, the neurocontroller design proposed helps to drive the growth development of the cultivation as cost function and final state errors are minimized by physical constraints on the process variables. Therefore, it is possible to establish the control scheme and policy according to the criterion that generates the highest profit margin in the process. The contribution shows an optimal policy to guide the crop from an initial to a desired state. The estimates are consistent in a weak sense, and the question whether they are pointwise consistent is still open.

In addition, the study was designed to also explore the potential of predicting the alfalfa yield using vegetation indices. A calibrated yield monitor mounted on a large rectangular hay baler was used to measure the actual alfalfa yield for four alfalfa harvests performed in the period from October 2013 to May 2014. A total of 18 Landsat-8 images, representing different crop growth stages, were used to derive different vegetation indices (VIs). Data from the yield monitor was used to generate yield maps, which illustrated a definite spatial variation in alfalfa yield across the experimental field for the four studied harvests as indicated by the high spatial correlation values (0.75 to 0.97) and the low P-values (4.7E-103 to 8.9E-27).

This paper aims at examining the use of field spectroscopy along with Landsat's satellite imagery in order to test the accuracy of raw satellite data and the impact of atmospheric effects on determining crop yield derived from models using remotely sensed data. The spectroradiometric retrieved Vegetation Indices(VI) of Durum wheat, is directly compared to the corresponding VI of Landsat 7 ETM+ and 8 OLI, sourcing from both atmospherically corrected and not corrected satellite images in order to test the effects of atmosphere upon them. Vegetation Indices are vital in the procedure for estimating Crop Yield since they are used in stochastic or empirical models for describing or predicting crop yield. Leaf Area Index, which is also inferred using VI, is also compared to the real values of LAI that are measured using the SunScan instrument, during the satellite's overpass. Crop Yield is finally determined using the Cyprus Agricultural Research Institute's Crop Yield model for Durum wheat, adapted to satellite data, and is used to examine the impact of atmospheric effects. The results have prevailed that if crop yield models using remote sensing imagery, do not apply atmospheric effects algorithms, then there is statistically significant difference in the prediction from the real yield and hence a significant error regarding the model.

This study was conducted within the Grenada Reservoir watershed (4,500 km2) in Mississippi. The SWAT model was calibrated and validated using long-term measured streamflow and reservoir outflow data. The performance of the SWAT model was evaluated using four statistics: the coefficient of determination (R2), the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), the percent bias (PBIAS), and the ratio of the root mean square error to the observation standard deviation (RSR). Based on the calibrated parameters, the impacts of the reservoir outflow estimation methods were evaluated at the watershed outlet, which is located below the Grenada Reservoir. According to the statistical analysis, the measured daily flow, the measured monthly flow, and the specific target release methods showed satisfactory results for downstream flow for both daily and monthly time steps, whereas the non-specific target release method showed unsatisfactory results. These results indicate that proper selection of the reservoir outflow approach in SWAT is important to accurately simulate the streamflow regulated by reservoirs.

The primary purpose of this research was to develop a conceptual model in order to determine the sources of variations within the dataset and to explore equations for the sampled soils. The findings revealed that two soil properties components (chemical and physical properties) were significant in explaining YCW.The accepted model in the multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis demonstrated that the soil's chemical and physical properties measures are statistically significant in estimating YCW. Following this,and according to R square statistic, 87% of the variance in YCW was explained by the soil chemical properties and 83% was accounted for by soil physical properties.

Model results obtained using the new land-use layer are compared to those obtained using a more conventional land-use layer. Results indicate that water flow and nutrient loadings are similar at the basin outlet, confirming the overall consistency of the approach. Water flow results at upland subbasin outlets appear similar; however, nutrient loadings are different since the crop distributions in the alternative approach are more representative of actual practice in the basin.

This DSS is based on the multifunctional evaluation of soil quality, using input data collected in standard soil surveys, and with particular reference to the peculiarities of the Mediterranean region. Specific agro-ecological strategies to prevent soil degradation in the benchmark sites were designed within two major topics: (i) strategies related to land use planning at a regional level: segregation of agricultural lands, restoration of marginal areas, diversification of crop rotation, and identification of vulnerability areas; and (ii) those related to land management planning at a farm level: organic matter restoration, formulation of tillage practices and workability timing, optimum machinery use, and input rationalization. The predicted results of applying the 12 agro-ecological land evaluation model constituents of MicroLEIS DSS are presented and discussed for each application site. The main conclusion of this paper is that using soil type information in decision-making is at the heart for sustainable use and management of agricultural land. This agro-ecological approach can be especially useful when formulating soil-specific agricultural practices to reverse environmental degradation, based on the spatial variability of soils and related resources.","Agro-ecological land evaluation; Biophysical modelling; Decision support tools; Land degradation; Soil management; Soil protection; Soil quality","agricultural land; agroecology; benchmarking; decision support system; environmental impact; land evaluation; land use location; land use planning; soil quality; strategic approach; sustainability; Andalucia; Eurasia; Europe; Sevilla; Southern Europe; Spain",Article,Scopus

The approach requires two independent steps: 1. Cloud properties are determined from narrow-band satellite radiances. 2. These cloud properties are used together with data on water vapor column and surface albedo to calculate the atmospheric flux transmittance. The retrieved irradiance is biased low by about 3-4 W/m2 throughout the year, corresponding to an underestimate in atmospheric flux transmittance of about 0.015 in summer and 0.04 in winter. From a least-squares linear regression, residual standard deviations of 56 W/m2 (0.072, 17.0%), 11 W/m2 (0.052, 10.8%), and 4 W/m2 (0.021, 4.2%) are found for hourly, daily and monthly mean irradiance (transmittance, relative error), respectively. These findings indicate that the accuracy of the retrieval is comparable to first-class pyranometers in the summer half year (5% of daily-mean values), but significantly lower in winter.

A field scale deterministic hydrological model, DRAINMOD has been calibrated and validated for two soils: Webster soil cultivated with continuous corn (WEBS_CC) and Canisteo soil cultivated with corn-soybean rotation (CANI_CS). The cumulative subsurface drainage over the calibration and validation years from 1990 to 2003 was predicted 2% higher than the observed subsurface drainage for WEBS_CC (coefficient of mass residual CRM = 0.02) and 10% lower for CANI_CS (CRM = -0.10). The overall values of index of agreement IoA and model efficiency EF were higher than 0.85 for both WEBS_CC and CANI_CS, and showed a close agreement between the predicted and observed subsurface drainage. The calibrated and validated DRAINMOD was further used to simulate impacts of varying designs of subsurface drainage system for WEBS_CC over the 14 (1990-2003) years of weather record in Iowa's tile landscapes. Simulation results suggest that a drainage system designed for a drainage intensity of 0.46 cm day-1 with a drain depth of 1.05 m and drain spacing of 25 m is sufficient enough to maximize crop production (average relative yield ≈98%) while minimizing subsurface drainage and its associated nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) loss. Though the results are based on the simulations with simple and approximate methods to represent the real system, they indicate that installing the drains at shallower depth (&lt;1.05 m) might help to reduce subsurface drainage, but there might be negative impacts in terms of increased excess water stress on crop production and increased surface runoff.

However, data are lacking for this parameter in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This study produced the first spatially explicit, coherent and complete maps of the rootable depth and RZ-PAWHC of soil in SSA. We compiled geo-referenced data from 28,000 soil profiles from SSA, which were used as input for digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques to produce soil property maps of SSA. Based on these soil properties, we developed and parameterised (pedotransfer) functions, rules and criteria to evaluate soil water retention at field capacity and wilting point, the soil fine earth fraction from coarse fragments content and, for maize, the soil rootability (relative to threshold values) and rootable depth. Maps of these secondary soil properties were derived using the primary soil property maps as input for the evaluation rules and the results were aggregated over the rootable depth to obtain a map of RZ-PAWHC, with a spatial resolution of 1 km2. The mean RZ-PAWHC for SSA is 74 mm and the associated average root zone depth is 96 cm. Pearson correlation between the two is 0.95. RZ-PAWHC proves most limited by the rootable depth but is also highly sensitive to the definition of field capacity. The total soil volume of SSA potentially rootable by maize is reduced by one third (over 10,500 km3) due to soil conditions restricting root zone depth. Of these, 4800 km3 are due to limited depth of aeration, which is the factor most severely limiting in terms of extent (km2), and 2500 km3 due to sodicity which is most severely limiting in terms of degree (depth in cm). Depth of soil to bedrock reduces the rootable soil volume by 2500 km3, aluminium toxicity by 600 km3, porosity by 120 km3 and alkalinity by 20 km3. The accuracy of the map of rootable depth and thus of RZ-PAWHC could not be validated quantitatively due to absent data on rootability and rootable depth but is limited by the accuracy of the primary soil property maps. The methodological framework is robust and has been operationalised such that the maps can easily be updated as additional data become available. © 2018 The Authors","Digital soil map; Maize; Root zone depth; Rootability; Soil data; Soil water; Sub-Saharan Africa","Aluminum alloys; Correlation methods; Crops; Cultivation; Mapping; Seed; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Maize; Root zone; Rootability; Soil data; Soil maps; Soil water; Sub-saharan africa; Soils; agricultural management; crop production; crop yield; data set; digital map; fertilizer application; growth rate; maize; mapping method; pedotransfer function; plant water relations; rainfed agriculture; rhizosphere; soil property; Sub-Saharan Africa; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

In crop modeling, the CERES-Maize model was calibrated and evaluated with the field experiment data and after calibration and evaluation, this model was used to forecast maize yield. A Field survey of 64 farm was also conducted in Faisalabad to collect data on initial field conditions and crop management data. These data were used to forecast maize yield using crop model at farmers’ field. While in remote sensing, peak season Landsat 8 images were classified for landcover classification using machine learning algorithm. After classification, time series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) of the surveyed 64 farms were calculated. Principle component analysis were run to correlate the indicators with maize yield. The selected LSTs and NDVIs were used to develop yield forecasting equations using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Calibrated and evaluated results of CERES-Maize showed the mean absolute % error (MAPE) of 0.35–6.71% for all recorded variables.

While food insecurity has persistently remained a world concern, its monitoring with this strategy has received limited attention. In attempt to address this concern, UN Global Pulse demonstrated that tweets reporting food prices from Indonesians can aid in predicting actual food price increase. For regions like Kenya and Uganda where use of tweets is considered low, this option can be problematic. Using Uganda as a case study, this study takes an alternative of using tweets from all over the world with mentions of; (1) Uganda +food, (2) Uganda + hunger, and (3) Uganda + famine for years 2014, 2015 and 2016. The study however utilized tweets on food insecurity instead of tweets on food prices. In the first step, five data mining algorithms (D-tree, SVM, KNN, Neural Networks and N-Bayes) were trained to identify tweets conversations on food insecurity. Algorithmic performance were found comparable with human labeled tweet on the same subject. In step two, tweets reporting food insecurity were generated into trends. Comparing with trends from Uganda Bureau of Statistics, promising findings have been obtained with correlation coefficients of 0.56 and 0.37 for years 2015 and 2016 respectively. The study provides a strategy to generate information about food insecurity for stakeholders such as World Food Program in Uganda for mitigation action or further investigation depending on the situation.

The SVM model has previously been shown to reduce the prediction error of monthly electricity consumption by 54% compared to the MLR model. Results found both the MLR and SVM models predicted annual electricity consumption per farm to within 20%. However, the error of the SVM model reduced to 9% when two farms with the greatest monthly prediction errors were removed. With herd sizes in excess of 190 dairy cows, these two farms were found to represent less than 3.3% of the Irish dairy farm demographic. Regarding the ability of each model to predict catchment level electricity consumption, the MLR model prediction resulted in an error of 4% while the SVM prediction resulted in an error of 9%. The improved accuracy of the MLR model when predicting electricity consumption at a catchment level was respective of a greater balance between the under and over prediction of electricity consumption across the 20 dairy farms.

Nevertheless, a better understanding of the competitive interactions that determine the proportions of leucaena and grass components is needed to optimise the design and management of the hedgerow pasture system. In a water-limited environment, belowground interactions between species are especially influential. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of leucaena plant density and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana Kunth) competition on root distribution, evapotranspiration, patterns of soil-water use and the resulting water-use efficiency (WUE) of the leucaena and grass components. Results showed that although leucaena had deeper roots than Rhodes grass, the majority of fine roots of both leucaena and Rhodes grass were in the upper 1.5 m of the soil profile suggesting a high level of competition for water resources. A major factor favouring Rhodes grass was that its root abundance was 8-10 times greater than leucaena, allowing it to compete more effectively for water resources and limit the lateral spread of leucaena roots. Higher cumulative evapotranspiration values were recorded from leucaena grown with Rhodes grass than from leucaena grown in absence of grass. However, this difference was negligible at the highest leucaena density owing to the reduced yield of grass caused by shading and increased water uptake of leucaena. The findings of this study also confirmed the hypothesis that at low tree densities, leucaena-grass pasture will have higher WUE (13.8 kg DM mm -1) than sole leucaena, but this difference was reduced with increments of leucaena density. Highest WUE (65.9 kg DM mm -1) occurred at highest leucaena density with or without grass. © CSIRO.","agroforestry; below-ground competition; Chloris gayana; legume trees; water uptake","agroforestry; belowground production; evapotranspiration; grazing management; hedgerow; interspecific competition; legume; pasture; population density; soil water; water uptake; water use efficiency; yield response; Australia; Dodecanese; Greece; Queensland; Rhodes [Dodecanese]; Rhodes [Southern Aegean]; Southern Aegean; Chloris gayana; Leucaena; Leucaena leucocephala",Article,Scopus

Different densities and planting configurations of leucaena will influence relative yields of both species because of intra- and interspecific competition. With the aim to describe the effects of competition between leucaena and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana Kunth), a Nelder Wheel trial with 10 different leucaena tree densities (100-80 000 trees ha -1) growing with and without Rhodes grass was established in a subtropical environment at Gatton, south-east Queensland, in November 2013. From 2014 to 2016, the biomass of leucaena (six harvests) and Rhodes grass (seven harvests) was measured by using allometric equations and the BOTANAL sampling procedure over 742 and 721 days, respectively. No complementary or facilitative aboveground interactions were observed between the leucaena and Rhodes grass components of the pasture system. Increasing leucaena tree density resulted in greater aboveground intra- and interspecific competition. Average maximum individual tree yield (38.9 kg DM tree -1 year -1) was reached at 100 trees ha -1 without grass competition and was reduced by 60% with grass competition. Rhodes grass biomass yield was negatively affected by shading from the leucaena canopy, with negligible grass yield at tree densities ≥8618 trees ha -1. Therefore, there was effectively no grass competition on individual tree yield at higher leucaena densities.

Inherently, these are difficult to translate into information useful for decision support in agriculture. For example, probabilistic SCF must first be downscaled to daily weather realizations to link with process-based crop models, a tedious process, especially for non-technical users. Here, we present two approaches for downscaling probabilistic seasonal climate forecasts – a parametric method, predictWTD, and a non-parametric method, FResampler1, and compare their performance. The predictWTD, which is based on a conditional stochastic weather generator, was found to be not very sensitive to types of rainfall information (amount, frequency or intensity) in constraining or conditioning the stochastic weather generator, but conditioning the stochastic weather generator on both rainfall frequency and rainfall intensity had distorted the distribution of the downscaled seasonal rainfall total. Both predictWTD and FResampler1 are sensitive to the length of climate data, especially for a wet SCF; climate data longer than 30 years was found suitable for reproducing the theoretical distribution of SCF. FResampler1 performed well as predictWTD in downscaling probabilistic SCF, however, it requires the generation of more realizations to ensure stable simulations of the seasonal rainfall total distributions. © 2017 The Authors","Non-parametric downscaling; Parametric downscaling; Probabilistic seasonal climate forecast; Stochastic disaggregation",,Article,Scopus

Neural networks (NNs) are new computational tools that provide a quick and accurate means of physical properties prediction of agricultural materials, and have been shown to perform well in comparison with traditional methods. In this research, some physical properties of pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) seeds, including linear dimensions, volume, surface and projected area, geometric mean diameter and sphericity were calculated tridimensional in lab conditions. Then, prediction of these parameters was carried out using NNs. The research was divided into two parts; experimental investigation and simulation analysis with NNs. Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Radial Basis Neural Network (RBNN) structures were employed to estimate physical parameters of the pumpkin seeds. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was 0.6875 for BPNN and 0.0025 for RBNN structures.

In recent years, geostatistical methods have proven valuable for estimating hydrological variables in ungauged catchments. However, four major problems restrict the development of geostatistical methods. We established a new information diffusion model based on genetic algorithm (GIDM) for spatial interpolating of runoff in the ungauged basins. Genetic algorithms (GA) are used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems. So, using GA, the parameter of optimal window width can be obtained. To test our new method, seven experiments for the annual runoff interpolation based on GIDM at 17 stations on the mainstream and tributaries of the Yellow River are carried out and compared with the inverse distance weighting (IDW) method, Cokriging (COK) method, and conventional IDMs using the same sparse observed data. The seven experiments all show that the GIDM method can solve four problems of the previous geostatistical methods to some extent and obtains best accuracy among four different models. The key problems of the PUB research are the lack of observation data and the difficulties in information extraction.

This is a significant advancement over typical quantile-matching alternatives available for bias correction, as they implicitly assume that correction of individual variable attributes will lead to correction of dependence biases between multiple variables. Furthermore, existing approaches perform bias correction at a given time scale (e.g., daily), whereas applications often require biases to be addressed at more than one time scale (such as annual in the case of most water resources planning projects). The proposed approach addresses all these issues, and additionally attempts to correct for lag-1 dependence (and cross-dependence) attributes across multiple time scales. The approach is called multivariate recursive quantile nesting bias correction (MRQNBC). The fidelity of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a vector of CSIRO Mk3 GCM atmospheric variables and comparing the results with the commonly used quantile-matching approach. Following this, the implications of the approach in hydrology- and water resources–related applications are demonstrated by feeding the bias-corrected data to a rainfall downscaling model and comparing the downscaled rainfall attributes for current and future climate. The proposed approach is shown to represent the variability and persistence related attributes better and can thus be expected to have important consequences for the simulation of occurrence and intensity of extreme events such as floods and droughts in downscaled simulations, of importance in various climate impact assessment applications. © 2016 American Meteorological Society",,"Climate models; Rain; Time measurement; Atmospheric variables; Climate impact assessment; General circulation model; Hydrology and water resource; Multiple time scale; Rainfall downscaling; Systematic bias; Water resources planning; Water resources; atmospheric general circulation model; correction; downscaling; multivariate analysis; rainfall; vector",Article,Scopus

The developed model by a multiple regression analysis is Yield = 5.635NDVI – 0.0012P9+ 0.91 (where yield is the white rice yield in t ha-1and P9 is the observed monthly precipitation in September in mm month-1).

Such condition may be properly used to encourage crops to use in-situ shallow groundwater in order to reduce irrigation application and the subsequent drainage discharge. This will help improve the irrigation water use efficiency and mitigate the negative impact of agricultural drainage. To estimate the amount of shallow groundwater use in field condition, however, is often difficult due to the complex relationships among soils, crops and the field hydrology. In this paper, we presented a method for calculating shallow groundwater use by field crops based an assumption that crop uptake of groundwater caused the timely difference in water table depth between the fields with and without crops, providing that the weather condition and the irrigation and drainage practices were similar. With a case study in a semi-arid irrigation area Shaanxi, China, we demonstrated the application of the proposed method in a cotton and wheat rotational field; the daily water table depths under the two different surface cover conditions were predicted with the field hydrology model-DRAINMOD, which has been tested at the same site previously; the salt accumulation in crop root zone under shallow groundwater use was predicted with a simple salt balance model. The difference in potential evapotranspirations (PET) in the fields with and without crops were calculated separately and fed into the model as inputs in order to represent the different effect of PET on field hydrology in DRAINMOD. The sub-irrigation module in the DRAINMOD was used to simulate the effect of high water level in drainage ditches due to the occasional block up of the drainage outlet. The calculation results showed that the approach used in this paper produced reasonable estimate of water balance in comparison with the actual field conditions; the DRAINMOD predicted soil moisture content was in close agreement with the field measurements since the average deviation was 0.475%, the average absolute deviation was 0.356%, and the correlation coefficient was 0.86. The DRAINMOD predicted that the average water table in the crop field was about 50 cm lower than that in no crop fields due to the consumptive use of the shallow groundwater by crops; the predicted water table responded more rapidly to rainfall and irrigation events in no crop fields due to the shallower unsaturated zone. The calculated total crop use of shallow ground water was 305.8 mm per unit area in the study period, in which 160 mm occurred in the cotton growth period, accounting for 24% of the annual water requirement of cotton in the study area. The salt balance analysis showed that crop use of the shallow ground water led to salinity buildup in the soil profile, but the average salinity within 1 m depth of soil profile was below the crop salt tolerance level. Based on existing studies on the salt leaching effect of rainfall and irrigation in the study area, the salinity buildup under shallow groundwater use condition only has a limited impact on crop production. Therefore, encouraging shallow groundwater use through engineering measures such as the controlled drainage may be a viable option for more efficient water use in irrigated areas where shallow water table exists.

Thus, drainage design simulation models provide for a simplistic and cost-effective method of determining the most appropriate subsurface drainage design parameters. In this study, the performance of the DRAINMOD model (Version 6.1) in predicting WTDs and DDs was investigated for a 32 ha sugarcane field in Pongola, South Africa. Water table depths were monitored in 1.7 m deep piezometers installed mid-way between two drains by using an electronic dip meter with a beeper, while DDs were measured at drain lateral outlet points, using a bucket and a stop watch. Both WTDs and DDs were monitored from September 2011 to February 2012. Results of the DRAINMOD model evaluation in predicting WTD, during calibration period, showed that there was a very strong agreement between simulated and observed WTDs with a goodness-of-fit (R2) of 0.826 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3 cm. Similarly, simulated and observed DDs during the model validation period also showed very strong agreement, with an R2 value of 0.801 and an MAE of 0.2 mm∙day-1. Results of simulated WTDs at various combinations of drain depth and spacing indicated that in clay soil a WTD of 1.0 to 1.5 m from the soil surface can be achieved by installing drain pipes at drain spacing ranging from 25 to 40 m and drain depth between 1.4 and 1.8 m. On the other hand, in clay-loam soil, the same 1.0 to 1.5 m WTD can be achieved when the drain pipes are installed at drain depths ranging from 1.4 to 1.8 m and corresponding drain spacing ranging from 55 to 70 m. Based on these results, it was concluded that DRAINMOD 6.1 can reliably be used as a subsurface drainage design tool in the Pongola region. This would simplify the design of subsurface drainage systems and the formulation of subsurface drainage design criteria for different crops and soil types found in the area and possibly throughout South Africa. © 2015, South African Water Research Commission.

It is critical for local agricultural development and environmental protection to find practical water management practice for crop production in these downstream irrigation areas. In this paper, we present an analytical study on salt and water exchange between drainage ditches and the farmlands in a downstream irrigation area, where the drainage ditches were periodically filled with a large amount of inflow (irrigation return flow and drainage water) from the upstream irrigation area. Due to its low elevation and poor drainage outlet of the study area, the drainage ditches originally built for salinity control now capacitate water storage for crop fields in the growing season; the high water level in the drainage ditches produced sub-irrigation effect on crop fields to meet some crop water requirement. To investigate the effect of reduced drainage intensity on salt and water balance in the crop fields, we employed the field hydrology model - DRAINMOD to predict the field water table fluctuations under subirrigation condition based on observed data from summer 2009 to fall 2010.Salt and water exchange between crop fields and drainage ditches was then calculated based on the predicted water table variations. The results showed that the water table depth in the study area was generally below 2 m, while the water level in the drainage ditches was generally higher; the salinity level in drainage ditches was much lower than the groundwater in the crop fields. The water table depth predicted by the DRAINMOD model agreed with the field measurements reasonably well; the average deviation was 3.29 cm, the mean absolute error was 8.6 cm, and the correlation coefficient was 0.97. With DRAINMOD simulations of water table depths in the crop fields and the measured water level changes in the drainage ditches, we calculated salt and water exchange between drainage ditches and the subirrigatd fields; the results showed that in one planting year, the drainage ditches received a total inflow water volume of 9.3 m3 per unit length; while considering the outflow from the drainage ditches, the net ditch storage was 5.5 m3 per unit length per annum. The calculated subsurface drainage was only 2.3 mm while the cumulative subirrigation water depth was 49 mm during the study period; subsurface drainage occurred only occasionally during some heavy rain and irrigation time period, the drainage ditches provided subirrigation to crop fields during the rest of the time due to the periodic inflow from the upstream irrigation area. Comparing with the crop evapotranspiration, the subirrigation water amount was relatively small, but the heightened water level in the drainage ditches reduced drainage intensity, resulting in less subsurface drainage in the growing season. The high water level in drainage ditches had positive effect on recharging the water table of the farm fields. The calculated salt load moved into fields with the subirrigation water was about 20 times of that lost with the subsurface drainage discharge, but the actual salinity in the field was much lower than the salt tolerance level of cotton, no significant salinity buildup was observed in the soil profile. Currently, the inflow from the upstream irrigation area had no negative impact on salt and water balance in the study area; instead, it alleviates the draught stress in the downstream irrigation area. The long-term effect of maintaining high water level in the drainage ditches on salt balance in the crop fields, however, needs further investigation. ©, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) are thus routinely applied to predict CEC from easily measured physicochemical properties (e.g., texture, soil organic matter, pH). This study developed the support vector machines (SVM)-based PTFs to predict soil CEC based on 208 soil samples collected from A and B horizons in Qingdao City, Shandong Province, China. The database was randomly split into calibration and validation datasets in proportions of 3:1 using the bootstrap method. The optimal SVM parameters were searched by applying the genetic algorithm (GA). The performance of SVM models was compared to those of multiple stepwise regression (MSR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. Results show that the accuracy of CEC predicted by SVM improves considerably over those predicted by MSR and ANN. The performance of SVM for B horizon (R2 = 0.85) is slightly better than that for A horizon (R2 = 0.81). The SVM is a powerful approach in the simulation of nonlinear relationship between CEC and physicochemical properties of widely distributed samples from different soil horizons. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to explore the influence of each input parameter on the CEC predictions by SVM. The clay content is the most sensitive parameter, followed by soil organic matter and pH, while sand content has the weakest influence. This suggests that clay is the most important predictor for predicting CEC of both soil horizons. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Based on the field survey, laboratory analysis, and satellite image interpretation in cooperation with geographic information system (GIS), the physiographic map was executed. Three main landscape units were identified as follow: marine deposits, eolian deposits, and river terraces. The soils were classified mainly as Typic Torripsamments, Typic Paleorthids, and Typic Calciorthids. Land suitability assessment was done to define maps of the suitable areas for agricultural production using MicroLEIS microcomputer program and ALESarid-GIS system as well. According to the crop suitability results, the most suitable crops to grow in the study area were maize, melon, potato, sunflower, onion, garlic, olive, and date palm in the order indicated. Generally, the data on land suitability resulting from the evaluation models indicated that 56.1 % of the area is considered as suitable, 30.8 % is moderately to marginally suitable, and 13.1 % is not suitable.

A calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to derive total annual irrigation applied in the irrigated areas of the basin during the year 2007. The SWAT model was parameterized by station corrected precipitation data (R) from the Tropical Rainfall Monitoring Mission, land use, soil type, and outlet locations. The model was calibrated using a new approach based on spatially distributed ET fields derived from different satellite sensors. The calibration results were satisfactoryand strong improvements were obtained in the Nash-Sutcliffe criterion (0.52 to 0.93), bias (-17.3% to -0.4%), and the Pearson correlation coefficient (0.78 to 0.93). Satellite information on R and ET was then combined with model results of surface runoff, drainage, and percolation to derive groundwater abstraction and depletion at a nominal resolution of 1km. It was estimated that in 2007, 68km3 (262mm) of groundwater was abstracted in the Indus Basin while 31km3 (121mm) was depleted. The mean error was 41mm/year and 62mm/year at 50% and 70% probability of exceedance, respectively.

It aims to improve the productivity of poorly drained agricultural fields. Nevertheless, studies have also shown that subsurface drainage is a significant pollution pathway to surface water. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of tile drain spacing on surface runoff, subsurface drainage flows, and phosphorus (P) loss from two tile-drained agricultural fields located near Bedford, Québec. Field data were used with the DRAINMOD model, and in developed regression models in order to perform the analysis. Both DRAINMOD and the regression models showed good performance. Simulation results indicated that when lateral tile drain spacing is increased, the volume of subsurface drain flow decreases, and the volume of surface runoff increases, at sites with sandy and clay loam soils. For every 5 m increase in drain spacing, total phosphorus (TP) loads in subsurface drainage decreased by 6% at a site with sandy loam soil, and increased by 20% at a site with clay loam soil.

However, the challenges to biofuel development are its effects on the environment, especially water quality. This study evaluates the long-term impacts of biofuel production alternatives (e.g., elevated corn stover removal rates and the potential land cover change) on an ecosystem with a focus on biomass production, soil erosion, water quantity and quality, and soil nitrate nitrogen concentration at the watershed scale. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was modified for setting land cover change scenarios and applied to the Iowa River Basin (a tributary of the Upper Mississippi River Basin). Results show that biomass production can be sustained with an increased stover removal rate as long as the crop demand for nutrients is met with appropriate fertilization. Although a drastic increase (4.7-70.6%) in sediment yield due to erosion and a slight decrease (1.2-3.2%) in water yield were estimated with the stover removal rate ranging between 40% and 100%, the nitrate nitrogen load declined about 6-10.1%. In comparison to growing corn, growing either switchgrass or miscanthus can reduce sediment erosion greatly. However, land cover changes from native grass to switchgrass or miscanthus would lead to a decrease in water yield and an increase in nitrate nitrogen load. In contrast to growing switchgrass, growing miscanthus is more productive in generating biomass, but its higher water demand may reduce water availability in the study area. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Biofuel; Corn stover; Miscanthus; SWAT; Switchgrass; Water quantity and quality","Biofuel production; Biofuels production; Biomass productions; Corn stover; Land-cover change; Miscanthus; Native grass; Nitrate nitrogen; Perennial grass; Removal rate; River basins; Second generation; Sediment erosion; Sediment yields; Soil and water assessment tool; Soil erosion; Study areas; SWAT; Switchgrass; Upper Mississippi; Water availability; Water demand; Water quantities; Water yield; Watershed scale; Anoxic sediments; Biofuels; Biomass; Dewatering; Erosion; Forestry; Landforms; Nitrogen; Rivers; Runoff; Sedimentology; Soils; Water quality; Watersheds; Nitrogen removal; biofuel; biomass power; environmental impact assessment; erosion control; fertilizer application; grass; land cover; maize; native species; nitrate; renewable resource; river basin; soil erosion; sustainability; water availability; water demand; water quality; water yield; watershed; Iowa; Iowa Basin; Mississinewa Basin; United States; Miscanthus; Panicum virgatum; Poaceae; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

A sensitivity analysis was conducted using an extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test, followed by an automatic calibration procedure to calibrate the curve number for moisture condition 2 (CN2), curve number index coefficient (CNIC), conservation practice factor (PEC), and peak runoff rate - rainfall energy adjustment factor (APM). The percent errors of mean (PE) were within 20%, with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (EF) and R 2 values all above 0.45 and 0.55 for both daily runoff and sediment yield for the three plots during the calibration period. For the validation period, the PE values were within 25%, and the EF and R 2 values ranged from 0.41 to 0.84 and from 0.55 to 0.85, respectively. Scenario analyses were conducted for a 24-year period for (1) fallow (baseline), (2) mixed wood-grass with horizontal terraces (scenario 1), and (3) woodland with horizontal-level ditches (scenario 2). The long-term benefits of scenario 1 over the baseline were quantified as minimum surface runoff and sediment yield reductions of 37 mm year-1 (35%) and 22 Mg ha-1 year-1 (84%), respectively. The benefits of scenario 2 over the baseline were reductions of 37% surface runoff and 89% sediment yield. The results suggest that APEX is a useful tool for evaluating soil and water loss for different management practices in the middle Huaihe River watershed, China, and that construction of horizontal-level ditches and horizontal terraces, and enhancing vegetation, are efficient strategies for controlling runoff and sediment in the region.

However, thorough evaluation of these models is needed to assess their predictive ability for this resource issue. The EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate) model version 3060 was evaluated using data collected from six cultivated small watersheds (4.0 to 8.4 ha) near Riesel, Texas. The study watersheds were fallow in 2001, cropped with corn (Zea mays L.) in 2002 and 2003, and planted to winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in 2004. A target poultry litter application rate from 0 to 13.4 Mg ha -1 was randomly assigned to each of the watersheds. Monthly data of runoff, sediment, and soluble P for 2001-2002 from one watershed (Y13) were used to calibrate the initial CN2, erosion control practice factor, RUSLE C factor coefficient, and phosphorus sorption ratio. The modeling efficiency (EF) for the calibrated period was 0.90 for runoff, 0.65 for sediment, and 0.94 for soluble P. EPIC was validated using the 2001-2004 measured data for the other five watersheds and the remaining data for Y13. It successfully predicted surface runoff on an annual, monthly, and daily basis for all watersheds, with EF values larger than 0.5 and R 2 larger than 0.7. The sediment, organic N and P, soluble P, and NO 3-N losses simulated by EPIC were satisfactory, with EF values ranging from 0.59 to 0.87 based on annual comparisons and larger than 0.4 (in 25 out of 30 tests) based on monthly comparisons. EF was 0.96 for crop yields. Paired t-tests based on monthly comparisons of runoff, sediment and nutrient losses, and annual crop yields indicated that the differences between predicted and observed values were not significantly different from zero at the significance level α = 0.05, except for soluble P losses for the control watershed. Both parametric and nonparametric statistical tests for EF values of monthly comparisons of runoff, sediment and nutrient losses, and percent errors of crop yields indicated that the reliability of the model was not significantly different among the poultry litter application watersheds and the control watershed, with the exception of soluble P losses for the control watershed. These statistical tests indicate that EPIC was able to replicate the runoff, water quality, and crop yield impacts of poultry litter application.","Animal manure; Crop yield; EPIC model; Nutrient loss; Runoff; Sediment loss; Water quality","Animal manure; EPIC model; Nutrient loss; Sediment loss; Environmental impact; Fertilizers; Runoff; Sediments; Watersheds; Crops; crop yield; environmental policy; leaching; manure; nutrient; runoff; sediment; water quality; Farm Crops; Fertilization; Runoff; Sediments; Water Sheds; Animalia; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

For historic conditions, the mean maize relative yield increased by 27% with subirrigation on the Nappanee loam soil, but had minimal effect on the Paulding clay and Hoytville silty clay soils. Maize relative yield under free subsurface drainage is predicted to decrease in the future, causing the relative yield difference between free subsurface drainage and subirrigation practices to nearly double from 9% to 16% between the historic and future periods.

By analysing this type of data, the pattern of the changes in the object of concern can be explored. The natural change in the Earth's surface is relatively slow and exhibits a pronounced pattern. Some natural events (for example, fires, floods, plant diseases, and insect pests) and human activities (for example, deforestation and urbanisation) will disturb this pattern and cause a relatively profound change on the Earth's surface. These events are usually referred to as disturbances. However, disturbances in ecosystems are not easy to detect from SITS data, because SITS contain combined information on disturbances, phenological variations and noise in remote sensing data. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed for online disturbance detection from SITS. The framework is based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. First, LSTM networks are trained by historical SITS. The trained LSTM networks are then used to predict new time series data. Last, the predicted data are compared with real data, and the noticeable deviations reveal disturbances.

Growth parameters and soil water use of the crop were monitored in a randomized split-plot two-year (2014–2015) field experiment under four irrigation regimes (60%, 80%, 100%, and 120% of crop evapotranspiration − ET) and four nitrogen treatments (0, 75, 150, and 225 kg ha−1) using an automated ET- based drip irrigation system in a semi-arid climate. The results showed that Marjorana syriaca adapted best to the higher irrigation regimes, with fresh weight and dry leaf weight higher by 185% and 165% respectively than the lowest irrigation treatment. Although applying medium doses of nitrogen improved yield at higher irrigation regimes, it did not affect the harvest index or crop water productivity. Dry matter fraction (ratio of dry to fresh aboveground biomass) and to a higher extent crop water productivity (ratio of marketable dry yield to unit of water used) significantly decreased when irrigation was doubled. Biblical hyssop can be grown and perform best when irrigated with 100% fraction of evapotranspiration at full stage and when supplied with 150 kg N ha−1 yr−1.In case of water shortage, managed deficit irrigation at 60% ET increased water productivity, sustained yield, and saved water. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Biblical hyssop; Marjorana syriaca; Medicinal herbs; Oregano; Smart irrigation; Water productivity","Crops; Evapotranspiration; Nitrogen; Productivity; Soil moisture; Water management; Water supply; Biblical hyssop; Marjorana syriaca; Medicinal herb; Oregano; Water productivity; Irrigation; drip irrigation; evapotranspiration; fertilizer application; herb; inorganic nitrogen; medicinal plant; water use; Hyssopus officinalis; Origanum",Article,Scopus

The main imaging and non-imaging remote sensing based techniques for the detection of plant stress (water stress and other types of stress) are thermography, visible (VIS), near- and shortwave infrared (NIR/SWIR) reflectance, and fluorescence. Just very recently, in addition to broadband thermography, narrowband (hyperspectral) thermal imaging has become available, which even facilitates the retrieval of spectral emissivity as an additional measure of plant stress. It is, however, still unclear at what stage plant stress is detectable with the various techniques. During summer 2014 a water treatment experiment was run on 60 potato plants (Solanum tuberosum L. Cilena) with one half of the plants watered and the other half stressed. Crop response was measured using broadband and hyperspectral thermal cameras and a VNIR/SWIR spectrometer. Stomatal conductance was measured using a leaf porometer. Various measures and indices were computed and analysed for their sensitivity towards water stress (Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), Moisture Stress Index (MSI), Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), and spectral emissivity, amongst others). The results show that water stress as measured through stomatal conductance started on day 2 after watering was stopped. The fastest reacting, i.e., starting on day 7, indices were temperature based measures (e.g., CWSI) and NIR/SWIR reflectance based indices related to plant water content (e.g., MSI). Spectral emissivity reacted equally fast. Contrarily, visual indices (e.g., PRI) either did not respond at all or responded in an inconsistent manner. This experiment shows that pre-visual water stress detection is feasible using indices depicting leaf temperature, leaf water content and spectral emissivity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Crop water stress (CWSI); Drought stress; Hyperspectral thermal infrared; Solanum tuberosum L.; Spectral emissivity; Thermography","crop production; drought stress; emissivity; leaf; potato; reflectance; remote sensing; stomatal conductance; temperature profile; water content; water stress; Solanum tuberosum",Article,Scopus

The combined SWAT-MODFLOW model was calibrated (2000–2010) and validated (2010–2012) based on streamflow, wheat yield, groundwater extraction, and groundwater-level data. This multi-criteria calibration procedure provided greater confidence for the partitioning of water between soil storage, actual evapotranspiration, and aquifer recharge. The SWAT model provided satisfactory predictions of the hydrologic budget for the watershed outlet. It also provided good predictions of irrigated wheat yield and groundwater extraction. The 10-year mean annual recharge rate estimated using the combined model varied greatly, ranging from 0 to 960 mm, with an average of 176 mm. This result showed good agreement with the independently estimated annual recharge rate from an earlier study.

Therefore, a better understanding of the response to photoperiod is needed in order to improve production and ultimately increase yield. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of the adaptive capability of local varieties, especially in coping with environmental stress conditions. The objective of this study was to determine the photoperiod sensitivity (PS) characteristics of the most common local varieties of millet and sorghum in Burkina Faso, West Africa. Planting date experiments consisting of 5 or 6 planting dates with complementary irrigation and fertilizer to avoid water and nitrogen stress effect on phenology were conducted at the experiment station of Di in northwestern Burkina Faso during the rainy seasons of 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007. The study included 7 millet and 11 sorghum varieties from the three main agroecological zones in Burkina Faso to determine their sensitivity to photoperiod. In addition to the various key phenological parameters, panicle initiation date was measured in 2007. Therefore, thermal time from emergence to PI and photoperiod at PI could be experimentally determined. After evaluation of the relation between the PI stage and the other stages that could easily be observed, thermal time from emergence to flag leaf expansion was used to determine the date of panicle initiation (PI) as well as the photoperiod at PI for the experiments conducted from 2003 to 2006. Then, a graphical analysis was conducted to define the critical threshold photoperiod and photoperiod sensitivity for each variety. For both millet and sorghum, the photoperiod sensitivity ranged from 142 to 6184 growing degree days (GDD h -1) per hour of photoperiod extension. The critical photoperiod (Pc) ranged from a daylength of 13.00 to 13.35 h. Although these experiments were only conducted at one location, this study showed that photoperiod response is not only related to latitude, but depends also on the capability of lowlands to maintain soil moisture. There was a positive correlation between the critical photoperiod (Pc) and the latitude of origin of the local varieties and a negative correlation between photoperiod sensitivity and the latitude of origin.

The bias-correction is a quantile mapping of empirical cumulative frequency distributions. Corrections are applied at a daily time step to five variables: rainfall, potential evaporation (PE), solar radiation, maximum temperature and minimum temperature. Corrections are calculated independently for each season. We show that quantile mapping of empirical distributions can be highly effective in correcting biases in RCM outputs. Cross-validation shows biases are effectively reduced across the range of cumulative frequency distributions, with few exceptions. The bias-correction is not as effective at correcting biases for values at or near zero (e.g. in rainfall simulations), although even here the bias-correction improves biases evident in the uncorrected simulations. In addition, the bias-correction improves frequency characteristics of variables such as the number of rain days. We use a detrending technique to apply the bias-correction to 140-year time series of RCM variables. We show that the bias-correction effectively preserves long-term changes (e.g. to the mean and variance) to variables projected by the uncorrected RCM simulations. Correlations between key variables are also largely preserved, thus the bias-corrected outputs reflect the dynamics of the underlying RCM. However, the bias-corrected simulations still exhibit some of the deficiencies of the RCM simulations, e.g. the tendency to underestimate the magnitude and duration of large, multi-day rain events, and the tendency to underestimate the duration of dry spells.

We used an extensive field-level data set of on-farm yields from 134 irrigated and 94 rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) fields in Nebraska during a 4-yr period to evaluate three methods that do not require ground-based calibration. The first method is based on summing estimates of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, the second on using either MODIS or Landsat data to calibrate a crop model (Hybrid-Maize), and the third using Hybrid-Maize simulations to train a simple regression, which is then applied to MODIS or Landsat data. For MODIS, all three methods performed similarly poorly at predicting maize yields, with an R2 between observed and predicted yields of roughly 0.10 for rainfed and 0.20 for irrigated fields. Estimates from Landsat were considerably more accurate, with up to 20% of rainfed and 50% of irrigated yield variation captured by the predictions. Across all methods and sensors, irrigated yield variations were more successfully captured than rainfed yields because of relatively smaller rainfed field sizes and the added difficulty of modeling crop water stress in rainfed fields. Agreement between observed and predicted yields was highest for the third approach, which is attractive because it leverages a crop model's ability to synthesize knowledge on crop physiology and year-to-year differences in weather throughout the season, yet produces a simple regression that can be rapidly applied to Landsat imagery. © 2014 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

To understand the implications of such increased production on water resources and stream quality at regional and local scales, we have applied a watershed model for the Upper Mississippi River Basin, where most of the current and future crop/residue-based biofuel production is expected. The model simulates changes in water quality (soil erosion, nitrogen and phosphorus loadings in streams) and resources (soil-water content, evapotranspiration, and runoff) under projected biofuel production versus the 2006 baseline year and a business-as-usual scenario. The basin average results suggest that the projected feedstock production could change the rate of evapotranspiration in the UMRB by approximately +2%, soil-water content by about -2%, and discharge to streams by -5% from the baseline scenario. However, unlike the impacts on regional water availability, the projected feedstock production has a mixed effect on water quality, resulting in 12% and 45% increases in annual suspended sediment and total phosphorus loadings, respectively, but a 3% decrease in total nitrogen loading. These differences in water quantity and quality are statistically significant (p < 0.05).

Average seasonal CWSIe values calculated for each plot from temperature measurements made by infrared thermometer thermocouples mounted on a center pivot lateral were inversely related to crop water use with r2 values &gt;0.89 and 0.55 for soybean and cotton, respectively. There was also a significant inverse relationship between the CWSIe and soybean yields in 2004 (r2=0.88) and 2005 (r2=0.83), and cotton in 2007 (r2=0.78). The correlations were not significant in 2008 for cotton. Contour plots of the CWSIe may be used as maps to indicate the spatial variability of within-field crop water stress. These maps may be useful for irrigation scheduling or identifying areas within a field where water stress may impact crop water use and yield. © 2011.","Cotton yields; Empirical crop water stress index; Infrared thermography; Infrared thermometry; Soybean yields; Water use","Cotton yield; Empirical crop water stress index; Infrared thermometry; Soybean yields; Water use; Amino acids; Cotton; Crops; Irrigation; Nitrogen fixation; Plants (botany); Rain; Soil moisture; Thermocouples; Thermography (imaging); Thermography (temperature measurement); Thermometers; Water supply; Heavy water; correlation; cotton; crop yield; empirical analysis; environmental monitoring; irrigation; measurement method; radiation balance; rainfall; soybean; spatiotemporal analysis; temperature effect; water stress; water use; Glycine max; Gossypium hirsutum",Article,Scopus

Geostationary satellite data are used to map GSR in many inversion algorithms in which ground GSR measurements merely serve to validate the satellite retrievals. In this study, a simple algorithm with artificial neural network (ANN) modeling is proposed to explore the non-linear physical relationship between ground daily GSR measurements and Multi-functional Transport Satellite (MTSAT) all-channel observations in an effort to fully exploit information contained in both data sets. Singular value decomposition is implemented to extract the principal signals from satellite data and a novel method is applied to enhance ANN performance at high altitude. A three-layer feed-forward ANN model is trained with one year of daily GSR measurements at ten ground sites. This trained ANN is then used to map continuous daily GSR for two years, and its performance is validated at all 83 ground sites in China. The evaluation result demonstrates that this algorithm can quickly and efficiently build the ANN model that estimates daily GSR from geostationary satellite data with good accuracy in both space and time. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Artificial neural network; Data compression; Geostationary satellite; Global solar radiation","Algorithms; Data compression; Models; Neural networks; Signal processing; Singular value decomposition; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Sun; Artificial Neural Network; Channel observations; Daily global solar radiation; Data sets; Evaluation results; Feed-Forward; Global solar radiation; High altitude; Inversion algorithm; Multi-functional; Non-linear; Novel methods; Renewable energies; Satellite data; Satellite retrieval; SIMPLE algorithm; Simple and efficient algorithms; Space and time; Three-layer; Geostationary satellites; algorithm; artificial neural network; data set; geostationary satellite; MTSAT; satellite data; solar radiation; China",Article,Scopus

Although there have been only a few field studies of the effect of drain depth and spacing on N loss to surface waters, the data that exist indicate that N loss increases as subsurface drains are placed closer together. Some simulation model studies agree with these trends, others do not. Published field data from Indiana and North Carolina were plotted as a function of drainage intensity (DI), which was defined as the steady-state drainage rate when the water table at a point midway between the drains is coincident with the surface. Trends for NO3-N loss as a function of DI were similar for soils in the two states in spite of large differences in weather and soil conditions. These data indicated that the magnitude of NO3-N loss in drainage waters is strongly dependent on DI. Simulations were conducted to examine effects of drain depth, spacing, and soil properties on processes that affect NO3-N loss from drained soils. The use of DI explained or normalized the effect of these variables on some of the processes but not others. Results showed that, in addition to its effect on DI, drain depth appears to have a significant impact on NO 3-N losses. © 2005 American Society of Agricultural Engineers.","Drainage; Drainage intensity; DRAINMOD; Nitrogen; Non-point source","Agriculture; Nitrogen; Soils; Water quality; Drainage intensity; DRAINMOD; Non-point source; Drainage; agricultural runoff; drainage; nonpoint source pollution; Agriculture; Drainage; Nitrogen; Soil; Water Quality",Article,Scopus

This study combined a variety of environmental and agricultural factors and assessed the waterlogging risk of winter wheat from the aspects of sensitivity of hazard formative environments, hazard risk, and vulnerability of hazard-affected body using multi-source data. Furthermore, it constructed a compound waterlogging risk assessment model to classify the study area into high, relatively high, moderate, and low risky areas, respectively. The results showed that the proposed model could more comprehensively reflect the occurrence mechanism of winter wheat waterlogging by synchronizing geographical, agricultural, and meteorological factors.

[Method] The model consists of three parts, trend yield estimate (Yt), remote sensing correction yield (Ys) and random error. The trend yield estimation was firstly calculated by using the polynomial regression method based on a long time series data of historical yield and then corrected by ARIMA model, which was set up by using the bias between the trend yield estimates and the historical yields. After that, a multiple linear regression model was set up to further reduce the estimation errors by using the bias between the trend yield estimates (Yt) and the reference yields as dependent variable and NDVI in critical growth period of crop as independent variables. In order to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the new hybrid estimation model, this paper estimated the yield of winter wheat in Beijing in 2015 based on three HJ Imagery obtained in winter wheat growing season, winter wheat yield of 30 sampling fields in 2015, and a nearly 30 years time series data of winter wheat yield (1985-2014) of Beijing. The estimation results from the hybrid yield estimation model was then compared with the true yield (2015 statistic winter wheat yield). [Result] The accuracy of winter wheat yield by using novel hybrid yield estimation model was 98.7%at city level and above 90%at country level. Except Fangshan(90.3%), the relative accuracy of yield estimation at the other countries was above 95%. The accuracy of winter wheat yield by using traditional trend yield model in Beijing was 94.75%, but the accuracy by using traditional trend yield model at country level was low, especially was lower 80%in Fangshan. ARIMA model was used for improving the accuracy of the traditional trend yield model. The accuracy of winter wheat yield improved in average by introducing the ARIMA model. For the remote sensing correction model established in this paper, using three remote sensing images for improving the accuracy was better, and this method improved the accuracy of winter wheat yield by 3.55%, especially the accuracy had a significant ascension in Fangshan and Pinggu. [Conclusion] The accuracy of winter wheat yield by using the novel hybrid estimation model is good at city level and county level. The model considers the change of time and spatial and can be used in crop yield estimation.","ARIMA model; NDVI; Winter wheat; Yield estimation model","accuracy assessment; crop yield; estimation method; NDVI; numerical model; remote sensing; wheat; Beijing [China]; China",Article,Scopus

Good agreement was obtained between simulated and observed streamflow values during model calibration (NSE=0.84 &amp; R2=0.86), and validation (NSE=0.61 &amp; R2=0.68). For the entire watershed, reduction in forest cover and rangeland resulted to an increase in surface runoff and decreases in baseflow or dry season flow and groundwater recharge. LULC changes affected the water quantity and timing of occurrence. Subbasin with 22% increase in forest cover and rangeland increased the baseflow by 1% to 15% and reduced the streamflow by 1% to 17% during the rainy months. Another subbasin with 54% forest loss resulted to more pronounced rainfall-runoff response with 11% to 17% decrease in baseflow and 4% to 24% increase in streamflow during rainy months.

However, as the availability of irrigation water decreases and potential costs and regulation of nitrogen (N) increase, there is a need to better understand how irrigation levels interacts with N fertilizer rates. A two-year field experiment was conducted in Maricopa, Arizona USA on a Casa Grande sandy loam to assess effects of N fertilizer and irrigation rates on grain yield, grain N, canopy temperatures yellow berry, and N use efficiency. Five rates of N fertilizer as urea ammonium nitrate (0, 84, 168, 252, and 336 kg N ha-1) were applied in three equal splits at Zadoks stages 30, 32, and 39. Ten un-randomized, sequential rates of irrigation ranging from 0.35 to 1.14 fraction of a non-deficit base irrigation treatment (maintained &gt;45% soil water depletion) were applied by sequentially varying the nozzles in a gradient in an overhead sprinkler system. Irrigation plus rain ranged from 230 to 660 mm in the first season, and 180 to 600 mm in the second season. Grain yield was maximum in 2013 at the 252 kg N ha-1 fertilizer rate and at the 10th water level (1.14 irrigation), and between 168 kg and 252 kg N ha-1 at the 8th water level (1.0 irrigation) in 2014. The maximum grain yield of 7500 kg ha-1 in 2013 was reduced to 5000 kg ha-1 in 2014 due to a warmer, shorter growing season. Economic optimum N rate was at water level 8 both years (196 and 138 kg N ha-1 in 2013, and 2014, respectively). Recovery efficiency of added N was high in this system (i.e., &gt;70%) at N fertilizer and water levels that maximized biomass and grain yields. Grain N was maximum at a lower water level (level 3 or 0.50-0.54 irrigation), was positively affected by N fertilizer rate, and was negatively related to yellow berry incidence. Canopy temperature minus air temperature values decreased linearly with increasing irrigation level. Nitrogen fertilizer applications reduced canopy temperature when water levels &gt;0.54 and 0.69 irrigation fraction in 2013, and 2014, respectively. The study results suggested that canopy temperature and weather data that reflects the grain-filling period could be used to improve irrigation and N management, respectively. In short, irrigated durum wheat growers on this soil would achieve the economically optimum grain yield, with the least risk of yield or protein reduction, by applying 200 kg N ha-1 at the base irrigation level which maintains root zone soil moisture depletion below 45%. © 2016.","Infrared thermometry; N use efficiency; Water-nitrogen interactions; Yellow berry","agricultural soil; ammonium; canopy; cereal; crop yield; fertilizer application; fruit; growing season; infrared radiation; irrigation system; nitrogen compound; nutrient use efficiency; phytomass; protein; soil moisture; temperature effect; wheat; Arizona; Maricopa County; United States; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum",Article,Scopus

When applying ecohydrologic models to study climate impacts on crop yield, especially interannual yield responses to climate stresses, the model simulation of plant available soil moisture must be constrained in order to reproduce plant production variation via moisture related bio-climate variables. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to investigate the relationship between climate variability and crop yield at four sites (Boone, Woodbury, Madison, and Mason) in the Midwestern USA. The model was first calibrated for soil moisture at the plot scale. The calibrated model was then used to extend the observational records between 1991 and 2010 to better capture the effect of climate variability on crop yield over a longer period (1941-2010). We also explored the relative yield reduction due to individual stresses. Our results indicated that annual observed yield from 1991 to 2010 is correlated with drought stress intensity in the early and middle reproductive stage at most sites. The early and middle reproductive periods were thought more critical than other stages, because severe drought stress in those periods is substantially correlated with low observed yields. No significant relationship between crop yield and aeration stress was found at any of the four sites, due to their different impacts under different spatial scales, as well as low frequency of events in the historical record. Long term simulation of yield reduction indicates that drought stress was the dominant factor affecting yield in the historical period when compared with aeration stress both at short and long return periods (high/low probability of exceedance). For a 70-year period, the total yield reduction due to drought stress is 8.1%, 17.5%, 15.2% and 9.7% respectively for Boone, Woodbury, Madison and Mason. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Aeration stress; Climate variability; Crop yield; Drought stress; Soil moisture; SWAT","aeration; agrometeorology; climate change; climate effect; crop production; crop yield; drought stress; estimation method; historical record; soil moisture; Madison; Midwest; United States; Wisconsin",Article,Scopus

Usually such assessments apply statistically postprocessed output of climate model projections to force impact models. Increasingly, time series with daily resolution are used, which require high consistency, for instance with respect to transition probabilities (TPs) between wet and dry days and spell durations. However, both climate models and commonly applied statistical tools have considerable uncertainties and drawbacks. This paper compares the ability of 1) raw regional climate model (RCM) output, 2) bias-corrected RCM output, and 3) a conventional weather generator (WG) that has been calibrated to match observed TPs to simulate the sequence of dry, wet, and very wet days at a set of long-term weather stations across Switzerland. The study finds systematic biases in TPs and spell lengths for raw RCM output, but a substantial improvement after bias correction using the deterministic quantile mapping technique. For the region considered, bias-corrected climate model output agrees well with observations in terms of TPs as well as dry and wet spell durations. For the majority of cases (models and stations) bias-corrected climate model output is similar in skill to a simple Markov chain stochastic weather generator. There is strong evidence that bias-corrected climate model simulations capture the atmospheric event sequence more realistically than a simple WG. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","Climate models; Mathematical and statistical techniques; Model comparison; Model errors; Model evaluation/performance; Model output statistics; Models and modeling; Statistical techniques","Mapping; Markov processes; Statistical mechanics; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Model comparison; Model errors; Model evaluation/performance; Model output statistics; Statistical techniques; Climate models; climate modeling; climate prediction; Markov chain; probability; regional climate; stochasticity; uncertainty analysis; weather forecasting",Article,Scopus

However, the accuracy of phenological parameters extracted by remote sensing data cannot be guaranteed because of the influence of climate, e.g. the monsoon season, and limited available remote sensing data. In this study, we integrate the data of HJ-1 CCD and Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) by using the ordinary least-squares (OLS), and construct higher temporal resolution vegetation indices (VIs) time-series data to extract the phenological parameters of single-cropped rice. Two widely used VIs, namely the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and 2-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2), were adopted to minimize the influence of environmental factors and the intrinsic difference between the two sensors. Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filters were applied to construct continuous VI profiles per pixel. The results showed that, compared with NDVI, EVI2 was more stable and comparable between the two sensors. Compared with the observed phenological data of the single-cropped rice, the integrated VI time-series had a relatively low root mean square error (RMSE), and EVI2 showed higher accuracy compared with NDVI. We also demonstrate the application of phenology extraction of the single-cropped rice in a spatial scale in the study area.

A version of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, calibrated in a previous study to estimate annual runoff, sediment and total phosphorus (TP) fluxes from the Castor subwatershed into the Pike River watershed, which, in turn, flows into the Missisquoi Bay, used static landscapes and single land uses to arrive at its predictions. However, in reality, farmers do rotate crops. Therefore, the present study’s objective was to quantify the impact of soil heterogeneities on land use change patterns in the Castor subwatershed from 1999 to 2011. Data from a 24-point soil survey within the Castor subwatershed were partitioned and regionalized into 5, 10, 15, 20 and 24 heterogeneous regions or configurations. Using the standard soils map (with mean properties) employed in several prior studies in the subwatershed, a sixth configuration termed “Reference,” was also developed. All 6 configurations were factorially combined with either 1999 or 2011 land use data to yield 12 different versions of the SWAT model and quantify the heterogeneities and uncertainty of soil properties on land use change. For hydrology, it was discovered that there were no marked differences in the predictions, which was attributable to the use the SCS-CN subroutine which masks the physical properties of soil parameters within the same hydrologic group. We evaluated all the models for two periods i.e. 1991-1999 and 2000-2007. All the 1999 land use SWAT configurations underestimated runoff, sediment and TP whereas all the 2011 land use SWAT set ups gave higher and more accurate values. For both land use periods, the 5 Region models both showed higher and more accurate estimates, than those set ups with a greater number of regions, but were similar in accuracy to the Reference model set-ups. Since the 5-region configurations showed the highest within-zone heterogeneity, it can be concluded that having many regions (many sampling points as regions) does not necessarily increase SWAT’s prediction accuracy. © 2015 ISEIS All rights reserved","Curve number; Land use; Partitioning; Total phosphorus","algal bloom; calibration; discharge; flux measurement; heterogeneity; land use change; mapping method; nutrient enrichment; phosphorus; regionalization; runoff; soil property; soil quality; spatiotemporal analysis; uncertainty analysis; watershed; Canada; Castor River; Lake Champlain; Missisquoi Bay; Quebec [Canada]; algae",Article,Scopus

This study aims to develop a semi-automated approach using Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite data and associated vegetation indices to extract annual cropping pattern in Muzaffarpur district of Bihar, India at a fine scale (1:50,000). Three vegetation indices (VIs) - NDVI, EVI2 and NDSBVI, were calculated using three seasonal (Kharif, Rabi and Zaid) IRS Resourcesat 2 LISS-III images. Threshold reference values for vegetation and non-vegetation thematic classes were extracted based on 40 training samples over each of the seasonal VI. Using these estimated value range a decision tree was established to classify three seasonal VI stack images which reveals seven different cropping patterns and plantation. In addition, a digitised reference map was also generated from multi-seasonal LISS-III images to check the accuracy of the semi-automatically extracted VI based classified image. The overall accuracies of 86.08%, 83.1% and 83.3% were achieved between reference map and NDVI, EVI2 and NDSBVI, respectively.

The core of the framework is an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) used to control crop model runs, assimilate remote sensing (RS) data and update model state variables. We modified the Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer - Cropping System Model (DSSAT-CSM)-Maize model (Jones et al., 2003) to be able to stop and start simulations at any given time in the growing season, such that the EnKF can update model state variables as RS data become available. The data assimilation-crop modeling framework was evaluated against 2003-2009 maize yields in Story County, Iowa, USA, assimilating AMSR-E soil moisture and MODIS-LAI data independently and simultaneously. Assimilating LAI or soil moisture independently slightly improved the correlation of observed and simulated yields (R=0.51 and 0.50) compared to no data assimilation (open-loop; R=0.47) but prediction errors improved with reductions in MBE and RMSE by 0.5 and 0.5Mgha-1 respectively for LAI assimilation while these were reduced by 1.8 and 1.1Mgha-1 for soil moisture assimilation. Yield correlation improved more when both soil moisture and LAI were assimilated (R=0.65) suggesting a cause-effect interaction between soil moisture and LAI, prediction errors (MBE and RMSE) were also reduced by 1.7 and 1.8Mgha-1 with respect to open-loop simulations. Results suggest that assimilation of LAI independently might be preferable when conditions are extremely wet while assimilation of soil moisture+LAI might be more suitable when conditions are more nominal. AMSR-E soil moisture tends to be more biased under the presence of high vegetation (i.e., when crops are fully developed) and that updating rootzone soil moisture by near-surface soil moisture assimilation under very wet conditions could increase the modeled percolation causing excessive nitrogen (N) leaching hence reducing crop yields even with water stress reduced at a minimum due to soil moisture assimilation. However, applying the data assimilation-crop modeling framework strategically by considering a-priori information on climate condition expected during the growing season may improve yield prediction performance substantially, in our case with higher correlation (R=0.80) and more reductions in MBE and RMSE (2.5 and 3.3Mgha-1) compared to when there is no data assimilation. Scaling AMSR-E soil moisture to the climatology of the model did not improve our data assimilation results because the model is also biased. Better soil moisture products e.g., from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, may solve the soil moisture data issue in the near future. © 2013.","Crop model; Data assimilation; Leaf area index; Soil moisture; Yield forecasting","Crop model; Data assimilation; Ensemble Kalman Filter; Leaf Area Index; Open-loop simulations; Remotely sensed soil moisture; Soil moisture active passive (SMAP); Yield forecasting; Artificial intelligence; Computer simulation; Crops; Data processing; Decision support systems; Errors; Forecasting; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Solvents; Technology transfer; Vegetation; Soil surveys; agricultural management; agricultural technology; correlation; crop yield; data acquisition; decision support system; growing season; Kalman filter; maize; MODIS; remote sensing; simulation; soil moisture; water stress; Iowa; Story County; United States",Article,Scopus

The objectives of this study were to close the water balance, to quantify the amount of groundwater outflow, to identify the effects of topography on drain discharge, and to determine the effects of different subsurface drain installation methods and spacing of drainage lines on water outflow components in a clayey agricultural field. Hydro-meteorological, soil and topographic data were available from paired field sections in southern Finland including two control sections and two sections where different subsurface drainage methods were applied. A 3D hydrological model (FLUSH) was applied to the whole field area for snow- and frost-free periods in three measurement years to decipher the hydrological effects of the drainage improvements. The simulated field area was 14. ha. Simulation results revealed that a steep slope outside of the field decreased drain discharge with 40% and increased groundwater outflow, which was quantified to be a major component of the water balance, approximately 9-15% of the precipitation. The model simulations demonstrated and quantified how drainage improvements in a treatment section affected the hydrology of an adjacent control section. This revealed that the sections shared a hydrological connection through subsurface flow processes. Such connection is typically neglected in the experimental comparison of measurement results from paired field sections. According to the simulations trenchless drain installation changed soil hydraulic properties by decreasing the volumetric fraction of connected soil macropores and by increasing the rate of water exchange between soil matrix and macropores. This affected more the dynamics than the absolute amount of drain discharge.

Data of fCover were acquired throughout the growing season in the central plains of Córdoba (Argentina); they were used for training and validating the networks. The results show that the NNs are an appropriate methodology for estimating the temporal evolution of soybean coverage fraction from MODIS and Landsat images, with coefficients of determination (R2) equal to 0.90 and 0.91, respectively. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"Amino acids; Infrared devices; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Environmental applications; Fractional vegetation cover; Landsat satellite; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Near-infrared bands; Neural network model; Neural networks model; Temporal evolution; Nitrogen fixation; agronomy; artificial neural network; estimation method; Landsat; MODIS; numerical model; satellite data; satellite imagery; soybean; Argentina; Glycine max",Article,Scopus

The first objective is to review and introduce the research addressed within this special collection. The second objective is to summarize and synthesize the model performance statistics and parameters published in these articles to provide a succinct guide to complement a previous SWAT model summary. Recent SWAT developments in landscape representation, stream routing, and soil P dynamics are presented in this collection. Numerous critical applications of the SWAT model were conducted across a variety of landscape scales, climatic and physiographic regions, and pollutant sources. In this article, model performance in terms of coefficient of determination, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, and percent bias across all the studies is summarized and found to be satisfactory or better in all cases. These results are then compiled with a previous synthesis of results to generate a comprehensive assessment of SWAT. Model parameters used to calibrate the model for streamflow, sediment, N, and P in numerous studies are also summarized. This collection demonstrates that research in development and application of the SWAT model and associated tools continues to grow internationally in a wide range of settings and applications. © 2010 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Hydrologic modeling; Hydrology; SWAT; Water quality; Watershed","Associated tool; Coefficient of determination; Comprehensive assessment; Critical applications; Hydrologic modeling; Landscape scale; Model parameters; Model performance; Physiographic regions; Pollutant sources; Soil and water assessment tool; Stream routing; SWAT; SWAT model; Landforms; Research; Soils; Water pollution; Water quality; Watersheds; Geologic models; calibration; hydrological modeling; model test; numerical model; performance assessment; phosphorus; pollutant source; soil nutrient; streamflow; water quality; watershed",Article,Scopus

Using two years (1998 and 1999) of data collected from the site, the model's ability to predict water table depth (WTD), drain outflow, and nitrate (NO3 --N) loads in drain water was tested. The site was arranged in a split-plot design, with two N fertilizer rates (120 and 200 kg ha -1, main plots) factorially combined with two modes of water table management: sub-irrigation (SI) at a WTD of 0.6 m vs. free drainage (FD) at a drain depth of 1.0 m (subplots). The model was calibrated using water table depth and subsurface flow data from 1998 and validated with 1999 data. The model's accuracy was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R 2), modeling efficiency (E), and other statistical parameters. DRAINMOD 5.1 performed well at simulating the number and timing of drainage events in both snowmelt and later-season periods. The model underestimated annual drain outflow under free drainage and sub-irrigation by 12 mm and 20 mm, respectively, in both years. The model simulated the pattern of water table fluctuations fairly well, with R 2 values ranging from 0.81 to 0.91, indicating good model fit. The model performed well in predicting total NO3 --N loads in subsurface flow, even though there was a tendency to underestimate loads under both free drainage and sub-irrigation treatments. © 2010 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Cold climate; Drainmod 5.1; Freezing-thawing; Nitrogen; Water table management","Coefficient of determination; Cold climate; Drain depth; DRAINMOD; Field research; Freezing and thawing; Freezing-thawing; Irrigation treatments; Model fit; N fertilizers; Nitrogen loss; Quebec , Canada; Snowmelt; Split-plot design; Statistical parameters; Subsurface Flow; Water table depths; Water table fluctuations; Water table management; Aquifers; Freezing; Irrigation; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Roads and streets; Thawing; Computer simulation; climate effect; drainage water; freezing; irrigation; model validation; nutrient loss; snowmelt; spatiotemporal analysis; subsurface flow; thawing; water depth; water table; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; White tip die-back phytoplasma",Article,Scopus

An efficient knowledge-based approach utilizing the method of fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) for characterizing cotton yield behavior is presented in this research work. FCM is a modelling approach based on exploiting knowledge and experience. The novelty of the method is based on the use of the soft computing method of fuzzy cognitive maps to handle experts' knowledge and on the unsupervised learning algorithm for FCMs to assess measurement data and update initial knowledge. The advent of precision farming generates data which, because of their type and complexity, are not efficiently analyzed by traditional methods. The FCM technique has been proved from the literature efficient and flexible to handle experts' knowledge and through the appropriate learning algorithms can update the initial knowledge. The FCM model developed consists of nodes linked by directed edges, where the nodes represent the main factors in cotton crop production such as texture, organic matter, pH, K, P, Mg, N, Ca, Na and cotton yield, and the directed edges show the cause-effect (weighted) relationships between the soil properties and cotton field. The proposed method was evaluated for 360 cases measured for three subsequent years (2001, 2003 and 2006) in a 5 ha experimental cotton yield. The proposed FCM model enhanced by the unsupervised nonlinear Hebbian learning algorithm, was achieved a success of 75.55%, 68.86% and 71.32%, respectively for the years referred, in estimating/predicting the yield between two possible categories (""low"" and ""high""). The main advantage of this approach is the sufficient interpretability and transparency of the proposed FCM model, which make it a convenient consulting tool in describing cotton yield behavior. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Soil data from soil surveys and climate data from meteorological records were employed. Grain production information from statistics at county level was integrated at a geomorphological level. The Pampas was divided into 10 geographical units and data from 10 growing season were used (1995-2004). Surface regression and artificial neural networks (ANN) methodologies were tested for analyzing the data. Wheat yield was correlated to soil available water holding capacity (SAWHC) in the upper 100 cm of the profiles (r2 = 0.39) and soil organic carbon (SOC) content (r2 = 0.26). The climate factor with stronger effect on yield was the rainfall/crop potential evapotranspiration ratio (R/CPET) during the fallow and vegetative crop growing cycle periods summed (r2 = 0.31). The phototermal quotient (PQ) during the pre-anthesis period had also a significant effect on yield (r2 = 0.05). A surface regression response model was developed that account for 64% of spatial and interannual yield variance, but this model could not perform a better yield prediction than the blind guess technique. An ANN was fitted to the data that accounted for 76% of yield variability. Comparing predicted versus observed yield a lower RMSE (P = 0.05) was obtained using the ANN than using the regression or the blind guess methods. Regional production estimations performed by the ANN showed a good agreement with observed data with a RMSE equivalent to 7% of the whole surveyed area production. As variables used for the ANN development may be available around 40-60 days before wheat harvest, the methodology may be used for wheat production forecasting in the Pampas. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The primary objective of this study was to test the suitability of the method, depending on predicted crop production, to estimate crop yield with a MODIS-NDVI-based model on a regional scale. In this paper, MODIS-NDVI data, with a 250 m resolution, was used to estimate the winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield in one of the main winter-wheat-growing regions. Our study region is located in Jining, Shandong Province. In order to improve the quality of remote sensing data and the accuracy of yield prediction, especially to eliminate the cloud-contaminated data and abnormal data in the MODIS-NDVI series, the Savitzky-Golay filter was applied to smooth the 10-day NDVI data. The spatial accumulation of NDVI at the county level was used to test its relationship with winter wheat production in the study area. A linear regressive relationship between the spatial accumulation of NDVI and the production of winter wheat was established using a stepwise regression method. The average yield was derived from predicted production divided by the growing acreage of winter wheat on a county level. Finally, the results were validated by the ground survey data, and the errors were compared with the errors of agro-climate models. The results showed that the relative errors of the predicted yield using MODIS-NDVI are between -4.62% and 5.40% and that whole RMSE was 214.16 kg ha-1 lower than the RMSE (233.35 kg ha-1) of agro-climate models in this study region. A good predicted yield data of winter wheat could be got about 40 days ahead of harvest time, i.e. at the booting-heading stage of winter wheat. The method suggested in this paper was good for predicting regional winter wheat production and yield estimation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

A study was carried out using MODIS TERRA optical and thermal band data and ground observations to estimate evaporative fraction and daily actual evapotranspiration (AET) over agroecosystems in India. Five study regions, each covering a 10 km × 10 km area falling in agricultural land use, were selected for ground observations at a time closest to TERRA overpasses. The data on radiation and crop parameters in paddy (irrigated and rainfed), cotton (rainfed), groundnut (residual moisture) crops were recorded at 14-day intervals between August 2003 to January 2004 from 2 km × 2 km homogeneous crop patches within each study region. Eight MODIS scenes in seven optical (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) and two thermal bands (31, 32) level 1B data acquired from the National Remote Sensing Agency, Hyderabad, India and resampled at 1 km, were used to generate surface albedo (α), land surface temperature (Ts,MODIS) and emissivity (εs). Evaporative fraction and daily AET were generated using a single source energy balance approach with (i) ground based observations only ('stand alone' approach), and (ii) 'fusion' of MODIS derived land surface variables on cloud free dates and coincident ground observations. Land cover classes were assigned using a hierarchical decision rule applied to multi-date Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The exponential model could be fitted between 1-EFins,ground (ground based evaporative fraction) and difference between Ts,MODIS and air temperature (Ta) with R2= 0.77. Linear fit (R2=0.74) could be obtained between 1-EFins,ground and temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI), derived from Ts,MODIS-NDVI triangle. Energy balance daily AET from the 'fusion' approach was found to deviate from water balance AET by between 4.3% to 24.5% across five study sites with a mean deviation of 11.6%. The root mean square error (RMSE) from the energy balance AET was found to be 8% of the mean water balance AET. The satellite based energy balance approach can be used to generate spatial AET, but needs more refinements before operational use in the light of progress in algorithms and their validation with huge datasets.",,"Agriculture; Energy balance; Evapotranspiration; Land use; Mathematical models; Temperature; Agricultural land use; Agroecosystems; Land surface temperature; Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); Root mean square error (RMSE); Ecosystems; agricultural ecosystem; algorithm; data acquisition; data set; energy balance; estimation method; evapotranspiration; land cover; land use; MODIS; NDVI; numerical model; observational method; remote sensing; satellite data; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia; Gossypium hirsutum",Article,Scopus

The generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation procedure was used to evaluate the uncertainty in DRAINMOD predictions of daily, monthly, and yearly subsurface drain flow. A variance-based sensitivity analysis technique, the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test, was used to identify the main sources of prediction uncertainty. The analysis was conducted for the experimental drainage field at the Southeast Purdue Agricultural Center in Indiana. Six years of data were used and the uncertainties in eight model parameters were considered to analyse how uncertainties in input parameters propagate to model outputs. The width of 90% confidence interval bands of drain flow ranged from 0 to 0.6 cm day-1 for daily predictions, from 0 to 3.1 cm month-1 for the monthly predictions, and from 7.6 to 12.4 cm year-1 for yearly predictions. Annual drain flow predicted by DRAINMOD fell well within the 90% confidence bounds. Model results were most sensitive to the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity of the restrictive layer and the lateral hydraulic conductivity of the deepest soil layer, followed by the lateral hydraulic conductivity of the top soil layer and surface micro-storage.

Integration of remotely sensed data and machine learning algorithms offers cost-and time-effective approach for spatial prediction of soil properties and crop yield compared to conventional approaches. The objectives of this study were to: (i) evaluate the role of remotely sensed images; (ii) compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms; and (iii) identify the importance of remotely sensed image-derived variables, in spatial prediction of soil properties and corn yield. This study integrated field based data on five soil properties (i.e., soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), and pH) and yield monitor based corn yield data with multispectral aerial images and topographic data, both collected in 2013, from seven fields at the Molly Caren Farm near London, Ohio. Digital elevation model data, at a resolution of 1 m, was used to derive topographic properties of the fields. Multispectral images collected at bare-soil conditions, at a resolution 0.30 m, were used to derive soil and vegetation indices. Models developed for prediction of soil properties and corn yield using linear regression (LM) and five machine learning algorithms (i.e., Random Forest (RF); Neural Network (NN); Support Vector Machine (SVM) with radial and linear kernel functions; Gradient Boosting Model (GBM); and Cubist (CU)) were evaluated in terms of coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Machine learning algorithms were found to outperform LM algorithm for most of the times with a higher R2 and lower RMSE. Based on models for seven fields, on average, NN provided the highest accuracy for SOM (R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 0.44) and CEC (R2 = 0.67, RMSE = 2.35); SVM for K (R2 = 0.21, RMSE = 0.49) and Mg (R2 = 0.22, RMSE = 4.57); and GBM for pH (R2 = 0.15, RMSE = 0.62). For corn yield, RF consistently outperformed other models and provided higher accuracy (R2 = 0.53, RMSE = 0.97). Soil and vegetation indices based on bare-soil imagery played a more significant role in demonstrating in-field variability of corn yield and soil properties than topographic variables. The accuracy of the models developed for prediction of soil properties and corn yield observed in this study suggested that the approach of integrating remotely sensed data and machine learning algorithms are promising for mapping soil properties and corn yield at a local scale, which can be useful in locating areas of potential concerns and implementing site-specific farming practices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","DEM; Mapping; Remote sensing; Soil; Yield","Adaptive boosting; Antennas; Artificial intelligence; Crops; Data integration; Decision trees; Forecasting; Forestry; Mapping; Mean square error; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Surveying; Vegetation; Cation exchange capacities; Coefficient of determination; Digital elevation model data; Linear kernel functions; Machine learning techniques; Remotely sensed images; Root mean square errors; Yield; Soils; agricultural practice; cation exchange capacity; crop yield; machine learning; magnesium; maize; precision agriculture; remote sensing; soil organic matter; spatial analysis; England; London [England]; Ohio; United Kingdom; United States; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

In order to avoid the ‘food versus fuel competition’, arising from grain-based ethanol production, the United States has passed regulations that require second generation or cellulosic biofeedstocks to be used for majority of the biofuel production by 2022. Agricultural residue, such as corn stover, is currently the largest source of cellulosic feedstock. However, increased harvesting of crops residue may lead to increased application of fertilizers in order to recover the soil nutrients lost from the residue removal. Alternatively, introduction of less-fertilizer intensive perennial grasses such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and Miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus Greef et Deu.) can be a viable source for biofuel production. Even though these grasses are shown to reduce nutrient loads to a great extent, high production cost have constrained their wide adoptability to be used as a viable feedstock. Nonetheless, there is an opportunity to optimize feedstock production to meet bioenergy demand while improving water quality. This study presents a multi-objective simulation optimization framework using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Multi Algorithm Genetically Adaptive Method (AMALGAM) to develop optimal cropping pattern with minimum nutrient delivery and minimum biomass production cost. Computational time required for optimization was significantly reduced by loose coupling SWAT with an external in-stream solute transport model. Optimization was constrained by food security and biofuel production targets that ensured not more than 10% reduction in grain yield and at least 100 million gallons of ethanol production. A case study was carried out in St. Joseph River Watershed that covers 280,000 ha area in the Midwest U.S. Results of the study indicated that introduction of corn stover removal and perennial grass production reduce nitrate and total phosphorus loads without compromising on food and biofuel production. Optimization runs yielded an optimal cropping pattern with 32% of watershed area in stover removal, 15% in switchgrass and 2% in Miscanthus. The optimal scenario resulted in 14% reduction in nitrate and 22% reduction in total phosphorus from the baseline. This framework can be used as an effective tool to take decisions regarding environmentally and economically sustainable strategies to minimize the nutrient delivery at minimal biomass production cost, while simultaneously meeting food and biofuel production targets. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Non-point source pollution; Spatial optimization; SWAT","nitrate; phosphorus; biofuel; bioenergy; biofuel; cellulose; crop residue; ethanol; farming system; food production; food security; grass; nonpoint source pollution; optimization; reduction; soil and water assessment tool; spatial analysis; sustainability; Article; biofuel production; biomass production; cropping system; food industry; food security; grain yield; model; Multi Algorithm Genetically Adaptive Method; Panicum virgatum; perennial plant; process optimization; Soil and Water Assessment Tool; stream (river); water pollution; watershed; biomass; Panicum; soil; United States; Louisiana; Midwest; Saint Joseph; United States; Miscanthus; Miscanthus x giganteus; Panicum virgatum; Poaceae; Zea mays; Biofuels; Biomass; Midwestern United States; Panicum; Soil",Article,Scopus

This dataset was obtained using the cumulative distribution function transform (CDF-t) method, a method that has been applied to several regions and contexts but never to Africa. Here CDF-t has been applied over the period 1950-2099 combining Historical runs and climate change scenarios for six variables: precipitation, mean near-surface air temperature, near-surface maximum air temperature, near-surface minimum air temperature, surface downwelling shortwave radiation, and wind speed, which are critical variables for agricultural purposes. WFDEI has been used as the reference dataset to correct the GCMs. Evaluation of the results over West Africa has been carried out on a list of priority user-based metrics that were discussed and selected with stakeholders. It includes simulated yield using a crop model simulating maize growth. These bias-corrected GCM data have been compared with another available dataset of bias-corrected GCMs using WATCH Forcing Data as the reference dataset. The impact of WFD, WFDEI, and also EWEMBI reference datasets has been also examined in detail. It is shown that CDF-t is very effective at removing the biases and reducing the high inter-GCM scattering. Differences with other bias-corrected GCM data are mainly due to the differences among the reference datasets. This is particularly true for surface downwelling shortwave radiation, which has a significant impact in terms of simulated maize yields.

A vegetation index (VI) derived from an aerially observed multispectral image (MSI) can quantify crop health, moisture and nutrient content. However, due to the high cost of multispectral sensors, alternate, low-cost solutions have lately received great interest. We present a novel method for model-based estimation of a VI using RGB color images. The non-linear spatio-spectral relationship between the RGB image of vegetation and the index computed by its corresponding MSI is learned through deep neural networks. The learned models can be used to estimate VI of a crop segment. Results: Analysis of images obtained in wheat breeding trials show that the aerially observed VI was highly correlated with ground-measured VI. In addition, VI estimates based on RGB images were highly correlated with VI deduced from MSIs. Spatial, spectral and temporal information of images contributed to estimation of VI. Both intra-variety and inter-variety differences were preserved by estimated VI. However, VI estimates were reliable until just before significant appearance of senescence. Conclusion: The proposed approach validates that it is reasonable to accurately estimate VI using deep neural networks. The results prove that RGB images contain sufficient information for VI estimation. It demonstrates that low-cost VI measurement is possible with standard RGB cameras. © 2018 The Author(s).","Deep learning; Phenotyping; Precision agriculture; Wheat",,Article,Scopus

LULC change from 2003 to 2008 included an increase in built-up areas (69%) and a reduction of mixed vegetation including riparian vegetation (−10%), which have significant effects on hydrology. Using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), significant increases in surface runoff (5%) and sediment yield (6%) and a reduction in baseflow (−11%) were shown. Spatial and temporal variations of the impacts were observed: degraded sub-basins experienced increased streamflow (up to 31%) during stormy months and reduced baseflow (up to −26%) during dry months. In contrast, improved sub-basins decreased stormflow (up to −4%), and increased baseflow (up to 5%) during dry months. Nine landscape metrics known to affect hydrology were quantified using Fragstats and were correlated with surface runoff, baseflow and sediment yield using partial least square (PLS) regression. The results indicated that increasing patch density and largest patch index of agricultural and forested landscapes, respectively, leads to a decrease in surface runoff and sediment yield while increasing baseflow. In contrast, increasing cohesion and aggregation index of agricultural and forested landscapes, respectively, results to an increase in surface runoff and sediment yield as baseflow decreases. Although more observed data is needed for validation, the relationship model produced in this study can be applied to new data or used for scenario analysis.

Usually, a common method for developing leaf area estimation models was to execute regression analysis by taking leaf area as dependant variable and leaf parameters as independent variables. However, the regression analysis applicable only when there is a relation between dependent and independent variables. Therefore, the objective of this work was to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model including leaf length and leaf width as inputs and to make comparison with regression models. Leaf area (LA) of Durain (Durio zibethinus) was estimated by ANN and regression models. Among the linear regression models (LRM), the equation LA = 0.888 (L*W) − 4.961 (R2 = 0.91, MSE = 5.17) was found to be the best fitting for durian. In ANN modelling best fitting results were obtained with two input nodes (leaf length and leaf width), one hidden layer, and one output layer (leaf area) as 2-1-1. Based on the values of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and coefficient determination (R2), ANN model was found to be more accurate both in terms of training (R2 = 0.96, RMSE = 3.77, MAE = 2.41 and MAPE = 7.77) and testing phases (R2 = 0.94, RMSE = 4.81, MAE = 2.91 and MAPE = 0.05) than the best fitting regression model.

The optimization problem is formulated as a multi-objective one, with the objective function consisting of the end-of-season yield and total irrigation. In order to compute the sub-optimal irrigation schedules, a hybrid formulation is presented, according to which a single irrigation event is optimized for the five subsequent days, while irrigation during the rest of the season is assumed to be triggered at some soil water levels which are determined as part of the optimization. This hybrid formulation minimizes the number of decision variables so that solving the optimization problem requires less than one minute on an i5-3470 PC. Such an efficient procedure can be executed whenever new weather forecasts become available and could be integrated in a web-based decision support system. In order to test the proposed approach we used nine years of climatic data from Northern Greece and a locally-calibrated AquaCrop model for cotton crop. We considered three extreme cases with respect to the weather forecasts: perfect weather forecasts available for the whole season; perfect short-term weather forecasts available daily for the five subsequent days and historical weather data available as forecasts for the rest of the season; and only historical weather available as forecasts. The results show that re-computing the sub-optimal solution minimizes the negative effect of imperfect weather forecasts.

Considering the characteristics of the mechanisms and data related to yield, data mining techniques are suitable candidates for modelling. The use of these techniques within a context with feature engineering, feature selection, and proper tuning can further improve performance beyond a simple replacement of multiple linear regression. To evaluate the impact of the different steps in the mentioned context, we evaluated sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) yield modelling with data obtained from a sugarcane mill. For a combination of six techniques, tuning, feature selection, and feature engineering, leading to 66 combinations, we assessed final model performance. Average performance across combinations resulted in a mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.42 Mg ha−1. Using different techniques led to a range of MAE from 4.57 to 8.80 Mg ha−1 on average. The best and worst performances for an individual model were MAEs of 4.11 and 9.00 Mg ha−1. Models with lower performance were close to simply predicting yield from the average yield for each number of cuts (MAE of 9.86 Mg ha−1). Tuning and feature engineering reduced the MAE on average by 1.17 and 0.64 Mg ha−1, respectively. Feature selection removed nearly 40% of the features but increased the MAE by 0.19 Mg ha−1. The performance of models was improved by simple strategies such as decomposing weather attributes and detailing fertilisation. Evaluation of feature importance provided by the RReliefF feature selection algorithm was used to explain the performance gains. If empirical models are needed, they will rely on using advanced techniques, but they will need proper algorithm tuning and feature engineering to extract most of the information from datasets.

Assessing weather effects by statistical methods is a classical approach, but for obtaining robust results many details deserve attention and require individual decisions as is demonstrated in this paper. We evaluated regression models for annual yield changes of winter wheat and silage maize in more than 300 German counties and revised them to increase their predictive power. A major effort of this study was, however, aggregating separately estimated time series models (STSM) into panel data models (PDM) based on cluster analyses. The cluster analyses were based on the per-county estimates of STSM parameters. The original STSM formulations (adopted from a parallel study) contained also the non-meteorological input variables acreage and fertilizer price. The models were revised to use only weather variables as estimation basis. These consisted of time aggregates of radiation, precipitation, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration. Altering the input variables generally increased the predictive power of the models as did their clustering into PDM. For each crop, five alternative clusterings were produced by three different methods, and similarities between their spatial structures seem to confirm the existence of objective clusters about common model parameters. Observed smooth transitions of STSM parameter values in space suggest, however, spatial autocorrelation effects that could also be modeled explicitly. Both clustering and autocorrelation approaches can effectively reduce the noise in parameter estimation through targeted aggregation of input data. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cluster analysis; Crop yield estimation; Germany; Multivariate regression; Silage maize; Winter wheat","adaptive management; agricultural modeling; climate change; cluster analysis; crop yield; maize; model test; prediction; regression analysis; silage; wheat; winter; Germany; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Here, we present global assessments of the climatic constraints on crops (maize, soybeans, rice, and wheat), the degree of the climate-crop relationship, and the reliability of seasonal forecasts of dominant climatic constraints based on statistical crop models and ensemble seasonal climate forecasts. We then classify the reliability of within-season crop prediction into four categories based on the degree of the climate-crop relationship and the reliability of the climate forecasting: (I) reliable; (II) less reliable due to the low reliability of climate forecasting; (III) not reliable due to the low reliability of climate forecasting and a weak climate-crop relationship; and (IV) less reliable due to a weak climate-crop relationship. The results showed that a strong climate-crop relationship exists in the area that produces 24-38% of the global crop production. On a global scale, 51-59% of the maize and soybean production is sensitive to soil moisture level during the reproductive growth period, whereas 47-53% of the rice and wheat production is sensitive to temperature. Due to the greater reliability of temperature forecasts, crop prediction is reliable in those areas in which the crop yield is temperature-sensitive and temperature forecasts are reliable. The categorized reliability of crop prediction indicated that improvements of soil moisture forecasts in 30-50°N during July- October and in 30-40 ? S during February-April are needed for better maize and soybean prediction, whereas improved temperature forecasts in 20-60 ° N during March-August are keys to rice and wheat prediction.

Research on ecosystem services has increased recently, though relatively fewer studies apply a data driven approach to quantify freshwater provisioning for different ecosystem services. In this study, freshwater provisioning was quantified annually from 1995 to 2013 for 13 watersheds in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). Results showed that the annual freshwater provision indices for all watersheds were less than one indicating that freshwater provisioning is diminished in the UMRB. The concentrations of sediment and nutrients (total nitrogen, and total phosphorus) are the most sensitive factors that impact freshwater provisioning in the UMRB. A significant linear relationship was observed between precipitation and freshwater provisioning index. During wet periods freshwater provisioning generally decreased in the study watersheds, primarily because of relatively high concentrations and loads of sediment and nutrients delivered from nonpoint sources.

Here, we present global assessments of the climatic constraints on crops (maize, soybeans, rice, and wheat), the degree of the climate-crop relationship, and the reliability of seasonal forecasts of dominant climatic constraints based on statistical crop models and ensemble seasonal climate forecasts. We then classify the reliability of within-season crop prediction into four categories based on the degree of the climate-crop relationship and the reliability of the climate forecasting: (I) reliable; (II) less reliable due to the low reliability of climate forecasting; (III) not reliable due to the low reliability of climate forecasting and a weak climate-crop relationship; and (IV) less reliable due to a weak climate-crop relationship. The results showed that a strong climate-crop relationship exists in the area that produces 24-38% of the global crop production. On a global scale, 51-59% of the maize and soybean production is sensitive to soil moisture level during the reproductive growth period, whereas 47-53% of the rice and wheat production is sensitive to temperature. Due to the greater reliability of temperature forecasts, crop prediction is reliable in those areas in which the crop yield is temperature-sensitive and temperature forecasts are reliable. The categorized reliability of crop prediction indicated that improvements of soil moisture forecasts in 30-50° N during July- October and in 30-40° S during February-April are needed for better maize and soybean prediction, whereas improved temperature forecasts in 20-60°N during March-August are keys to rice and wheat prediction. This study established a novel way of assessing the reliability of crop prediction, which will enable decision-making and allow researchers to prioritize the direction of new research to improve crop prediction in a given area for global food prediction. © 2016 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

The process-based models, which estimate nitrogen dynamics under irrigation, are widely used to investigate the best irrigation and fertilization management practices in developed and developing countries. However, for modeling such a complex system for wastewater reuse, it is critical to conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine numerous input parameters and their interactions that contribute most to the variance of the model output for the development of process-based model. In this study, application of a comprehensive global sensitivity analysis for nitrogen dynamics was reported. The objective was to compare different global sensitivity analysis (GSA) on the key parameters for different model predictions of nitrogen and crop growth modules. The analysis was performed as two steps. Firstly, Morris screening method, which is one of the most commonly used screening method, was carried out to select the top affected parameters; then, a variance-based global sensitivity analysis method (extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test, EFAST) was used to investigate more thoroughly the effects of selected parameters on model predictions. The results of GSA showed that strong parameter interactions exist in crop nitrogen uptake, nitrogen denitrification, crop yield, and evapotranspiration modules. Among all parameters, one of the soil physical-related parameters named as the van Genuchten air entry parameter showed the largest sensitivity effects on major model predictions. These results verified that more effort should be focused on quantifying soil parameters for more accurate model predictions in nitrogen- and crop-related predictions, and stress the need to better calibrate the model in a global sense. This study demonstrates the advantages of the GSA on a more complete analysis of model input parameters and their interactions on the model output for nitrogen modeling. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Global sensitivity analysis; Irrigation; Nitrogen dynamics; Treated wastewater","crop yield; denitrification; developing world; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; numerical method; numerical model; sensitivity analysis; soil nitrogen; wastewater; water resource; water treatment; China; nitrogen; waste water; water pollutant; adsorption; agriculture; chemical model; chemistry; computer simulation; crop; denitrification; metabolism; sensitivity and specificity; waste water; water pollutant; Adsorption; Agriculture; Computer Simulation; Crops, Agricultural; Denitrification; Models, Chemical; Nitrogen; Sensitivity and Specificity; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,Scopus

The purpose of this paper is to assess the ability of SWAT to simulate hydrological processes in the Aixola watershed. Electrical conductivity (EC) was used to estimate water contribution from the two main sub-watersheds. Streamflow contribution from the sub-watersheds varies throughout the year; the larger of the two contributes greater flow in wetter seasons, while the smaller one has more regulation capacity and contributes more in summer. The data obtained from EC were used to calibrate the model, simulating this variability satisfactorily and even more-so when the model was forced during calibration. Additionally, EC measured at the outlet of the watershed was used to make a decomposition of the hydrograph (surface runoff - base flow), comparing the data obtained with those simulated by SWAT. The results showed that the model performed well and identified the source of uncertainties in modelling this watershed.

The Alegria River watershed (Basque Country, northern Spain) is an agricultural area dominated by a Quaternary shallow aquifer that has suffered nitrate-related problems since the 1990s. Our objective was to use the SWAT hydrological water quality model for long-term backward simulation (1990–2011) considering main changes in management practices to determine their impact on water quality. Hydrology, crop yield, nitrogen losses and soil nitrogen budgets were simulated satisfactorily. Nitrogen budgets indicated that annual N inputs exceed outputs (which consider main N loss pathways), resulting in mean N surpluses of 114 and 65 kg ha-1 year-1 in the periods 1990–1999 and 2000–2011, respectively. In the long-term, trends in N surplus generally follow those of fertilization input, which directly affect groundwater nitrate concentration. The characteristics of the aquifer and non-point source pollution have enabled us to properly simulate the historical trends in N concentration in the Vitoria-Gasteiz aquifer. Editor Z.W.

From SWAT2005 and onward, an alternative approach has become available to apply the CN method by relating the runoff potential to daily evapotranspiration (SCSII). While improved runoff prediction with SCSII has been reported in several case studies, few investigations have been made on its influence to water quality output or on the model uncertainty associated with the SCSII method. The objectives of the research were: 1) to quantify the improvements in hydrologic and water quality predictions obtained through different surface runoff estimation techniques; and 2) to examine how model uncertainty is affected by combining different surface runoff estimation techniques within SWAT using Bayesian model averaging (BMA). Applications of BMA provide an alternative approach to investigate the nature of structural uncertainty associated with both CN methods. Results showed that SCSII and BMA associated approaches exhibit improved performance in both discharge and total NO3 predictions compared to SCSI. In addition, the application of BMA has a positive effect on finding well performed solutions in the multi-dimensional parameter space, but the predictive uncertainty is not evidently reduced or enhanced. Therefore, we recommend additional future SWAT calibration/validation research with an emphasis on the impact of SCSII on the prediction of other pollutants. © 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The results showed that: in southern rice production area of China, the effectiveness of thermal resources of single cropping rice area (SCRA) was less than that of double cropping rice area (DCRA), whereas the effectiveness of thermal resources of both SARA and DCRA showed a decreasing trend. The index value of effective precipitation satisfaction of SCRA was higher than that of DCRA, nevertheless the index value of effective precipitation satisfaction of both SCRA and DCRA showed a decreasing trend. There was a significant linear relationship between effective thermal resource and water demand, likely water demand increased by 18 mm with every 100°C d increase of effective heat. Effective precipitation satisfaction index (EPSI) showed a negative correlation with effective heat, yet showed a positive correlation with effective precipitation. EPSI reduced by 1% when effective heat resource increased by 125°C d.

In many countries, but particularly in developing countries such as South Africa, standardized methodological frameworks that deliver comparable results across large areas as a baseline for regional scale monitoring are absent. Due to limitations of scale at which techniques can be applied and erosion processes assessed, this study describes a multi-process and multi-scale approach for soil erosion risk assessment under South African conditions. The framework includes assessment of sheet-rill erosion at a national scale based on the principles and components defined in the Universal Soil Loss Equation; gully erosion in a large catchment located in the Eastern Cape Province by integrating 11 important factors into a GIS; and sediment migration for a research catchment near Wartburg in KwaZulu-Natal by means of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool. Three hierarchical levels are presented in the framework, illustrating the most feasible erosion assessment techniques and input datasets that are required for application at a regional scale with proper incorporation of the most important erosion contributing factors.

Here, we have applied the process-based crop model SARRA-H calibrated and validated over multi-year field trials and surveys at eight contrasting sites in terms of climate and agricultural practices in Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. The model gives a reasonable correlation with observed yields of sorghum and millet under a range of cultivars and traditional crop management practices. We applied the model to more than 7000 simulations of yields of sorghum and millet for 35 stations across West Africa and under very different future climate conditions. We took into account 35 possible climate scenarios by combining precipitation anomalies from -20% to 20% and temperature anomalies from +0 to +6 °C. We found that most of the 35 scenarios (31/35) showed a negative impact on yields, up to -41% for +6 °C/ - 20% rainfall. Moreover, the potential future climate impacts on yields are very different from those recorded in the recent past. This is because of the increasingly adverse role of higher temperatures in reducing crop yields, irrespective of rainfall changes. When warming exceeds +2 °C, negative impacts caused by temperature rise cannot be counteracted by any rainfall change. The probability of a yield reduction appears to be greater in the Sudanian region (southern Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, northern Togo and Benin), because of an exacerbated sensitivity to temperature changes compared to the Sahelian region (Niger, Mali, northern parts of Senegal and Burkina Faso), where crop yields are more sensitive to rainfall change. Finally, our simulations show that the photoperiod-sensitive traditional cultivars of millet and sorghum used by local farmers for centuries seem more resilient to future climate conditions than modern cultivars bred for their high yield potential (-28% versus -40% for the +4 °C/ - 20% scenario). Photoperiod-sensitive cultivars counteract the effect of temperature increase on shortening cultivar duration and thus would likely avoid the need to shift to cultivars with a greater thermal time requirement. However, given the large difference in mean yields of the modern versus traditional varieties, the modern varieties would still yield more under optimal fertility conditions in a warmer world, even if they are more affected by climate change. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.","agriculture; climate change; impacts; West Africa","Agriculture; Climate models; Computer simulation; Crops; Plants (botany); Rain; Agricultural practices; Climate change impact; Crop management practices; Effect of temperature; impacts; Precipitation anomalies; Sensitivity to temperatures; West Africa; Climate change; agricultural management; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; cultivar; management practice; millet; model validation; savanna; sorghum; West Africa",Article,Scopus

Additionally, other procedures such as model calibration, which may require thousands of model iterations, can increase running time and thus further reduce rapid modeling and analysis. Using the widely-applied SWAT as an example, this study demonstrates how to parallelize a serial hydrological model in a Windows® environment using a parallel programing technology-Message Passing Interface (MPI). With a case study, we derived the optimal values for the two parameters (the number of processes and the corresponding percentage of work to be distributed to the master process) of the parallel SWAT (P-SWAT) on an ordinary personal computer and a work station. Our study indicates that model execution time can be reduced by 42%-70% (or a speedup of 1.74-3.36) using multiple processes (two to five) with a proper task-distribution scheme (between the master and slave processes). Although the computation time cost becomes lower with an increasing number of processes (from two to five), this enhancement becomes less due to the accompanied increase in demand for message passing procedures between the master and all slave processes. Our case study demonstrates that the P-SWAT with a five-process run may reach the maximum speedup, and the performance can be quite stable (fairly independent of a project size). Overall, the P-SWAT can help reduce the computation time substantially for an individual model run, manual and automatic calibration procedures, and optimization of best management practices. In particular, the parallelization method we used and the scheme for deriving the optimal parameters in this study can be valuable and easily applied to other hydrological or environmental models. © 2013.","Hydrological model; Message passing; Parallelization; SWAT","Climate models; Hydrology; Personal computers; Automatic calibration; Best management practices; Hydrological modeling; Hydrological models; Message passing interface; Parallelizations; Soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; Message passing; best management practice; calibration; environmental modeling; hydrological modeling; optimization; parameterization; performance assessment; project design; software",Article,Scopus

This study aims to derive reservoir operating rules through establishing a multi-objective optimization model for the Xinfengjiang (XFJ) reservoir in the East River Basin in southern China to minimize water supply deficit and maximize hydropower generation. Additionally, to enhance the estimation of irrigation water demand from the downstream agricultural area of the XFJ reservoir, a conventional method for calculating crop water demand is improved using hydrological model simulation results. Although the optimal reservoir operating rules are derived for the XFJ reservoir with three priority scenarios (water supply only, hydropower generation only, and equal priority), the river environmental health is set as the basic demand no matter which scenario is adopted. The results show that the new rules derived under the three scenarios can improve the reservoir operation for both water supply and hydropower generation when comparing to the historical performance. Moreover, these alternative reservoir operating policies provide the flexibility for the reservoir authority to choose the most appropriate one. Although changing the current operating rules may influence its hydropower-oriented functions, the new rules can be significant to cope with the increasingly prominent water shortage and degradation in the aquatic environment.

The results showed good agreement between simulated and observed values. The average yield predicted by the calibrated SWAT model was 11 Mg ha-1 (from 8 to 13 Mg ha-1) for switchgrass and 34 Mg ha-1 (from 25 to 45 Mg ha-1) for miscanthus. Both switchgrass and miscanthus yields were determined higher in the central part of the YRB than in other areas.

The breakeven prices of both switchgrass and miscanthus were estimated lower in the central regions of the YRB than in the other areas of the watershed due to higher crop yields. Conversely, the breakeven prices of both crops were higher in the northern regions of the watershed due to lower crop yields.

However, these measures may cause adverse environmental consequences that are not yet fully understood. This study 1) evaluates the long-term impacts of increased frequency of corn in the crop rotation system on water quantity and quality as well as soil fertility in the James River Basin and 2) identifies potential grasslands for cultivating bioenergy crops (e.g. switchgrass), estimating the water quality impacts. We selected the soil and water assessment tool, a physically based multidisciplinary model, as the modeling approach to simulate a series of biofuel production scenarios involving crop rotation and land cover changes. The model simulations with different crop rotation scenarios indicate that decreases in water yield and soil nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration along with an increase in NO3-N load to stream water could justify serious concerns regarding increased corn rotations in this basin. Simulations with land cover change scenarios helped us spatially classify the grasslands in terms of biomass productivity and nitrogen loads, and we further derived the relationship of biomass production targets and the resulting nitrogen loads against switchgrass planting acreages. The suggested economically efficient (planting acreage) and environmentally friendly (water quality) planting locations and acreages can be a valuable guide for cultivating switchgrass in this basin.

Regional climate models (RCMs) are used as tools for dynamic downscaling of climate scenarios from global climate models (GCMs) to regional scales for climate change impact studies. It is known that running an RCM is more expensive and time consuming at a higher resolution than at a lower resolution. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate how resolutions of an RCM and statistical processing of RCM data may result in differences in projected crop yield changes. We used the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT)–CERES-Wheat model to simulate yield changes of spring wheat at 13 locations across the Canadian Prairies, with climate scenarios from a Canadian RCM (CanRCM4) driven by a Canadian earth system model (CanESM2) with the forcing scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 at 25 and 50 km resolutions. Bias correction and a stochastic weather generator referred to as AAFC-WG were used as statistical processing tools to develop future climate scenarios as input to the crop model. The results showed that when changes were averaged across the locations, whether 25- or 50-km resolution CanRCM4 data were used, the projected yield changes were fairly consistent with those based on its driving GCM–CanESM2, especially if AAFC-WG was used to develop future climate scenarios. The spatial patterns of the projected yield changes were also similar for the two resolutions of CanRCM4, although the magnitude of the projected changes had a relatively large range among the scenarios at some locations. These results indicated that using future climate scenarios based on climate change simulations by GCMs might be sufficient for projecting regional crop yield changes on the Canadian Prairies. © 2015 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada International Journal of Climatology © 2015 Royal Meteorological Society","Canadian Prairies; climate change impacts; climate scenarios; spring wheat yield","Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Climate models; Crops; Data handling; Decision support systems; Earth (planet); Electric power system interconnection; Location; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Canadian prairie; Climate change impact; Climate change simulations; Climate scenarios; Future climate scenarios; Regional climate modeling; Spring wheat; Stochastic weather generator; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; crop yield; prairie; regional climate; statistical analysis; wheat; Canada; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

The combination of their high temporal frequency with their extended geographical coverage generally associated with low costs per area unit makes these images a convenient choice at both national and regional scales. Several qualitative and quantitative approaches can be clearly distinguished, going from the use of low resolution satellite imagery as the main predictor of final crop yield to complex crop growth models where remote sensing-derived indicators play different roles, depending on the nature of the model and on the availability of data measured on the ground. Vegetation performance anomaly detection with low resolution images continues to be a fundamental component of early warning and drought monitoring systems at the regional scale. For applications at more detailed scales, the limitations created by the mixed nature of low resolution pixels are being progressively reduced by the higher resolution offered by new sensors, while the continuity of existing systems remains crucial for ensuring the availability of long time series as needed by the majority of the yield prediction methods used today. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Agriculture; Low resolution; Remote sensing; Yield forecasts","Fundamental component; Geographical coverage; High temporal frequency; Low resolution; Low resolution images; Operational systems; Performance anomaly; Qualitative and quantitative approaches; Agriculture; Crops; Forecasting; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery",Review,Scopus

In Brazil, the agricultural areas offer an opportunity to mitigate this effect, especially with the sugarcane crop, since, depending on the management system, sugarcane stores large amounts of carbon, thereby removing it from the atmosphere. The CO2 production in soil and its transport to the atmosphere are the results of biochemical processes such as the decomposition of organic matter and roots and the respiration of soil organisms, a phenomenon called soil CO2 emissions (FCO2). The objective of the study was to investigate the use of neural networks with backpropagation algorithm to predict the spatial patterns of soil CO2 emission during short periods in sugarcane areas. FCO2 values were collected in three commercial crop areas in the São Paulo state, southeastern Brazil, registered through the LI-8100 system during the years 2008 (Motuca), 2010 (Guariba city), and 2012 (Pradópolis), in the period after the mechanical harvesting (green cane). A neural network multilayer perceptron with a backpropagation algorithm was applied to estimate the FCO2 in 2012, using data from 2008 and 2010 as training for the neural network. The neural network initially presented a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 18.3852 and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9188. Data obtained from the observed and estimated values of FCO2 present moderate spatial dependence, and it is observed from the maps of the spatial pattern of the CO2 flow that the results from the neural network show considerable similarity to the observed data. The model results identify the higher and lower characteristics in sample points of CO2 emissions and produce an overestimation of the range of spatial dependence (0.45 m) and an underestimation of the interpolated values in the field (R2 = 0.80; MAPE = 12.0591), when compared to the actual soil CO2 emission values. Therefore, the results indicate that the artificial neural network provides reliable estimates for the evaluation of FCO2 from data of the soil’s physical and chemical attributes and describes the spatial variability of FCO2 in sugarcane fields, thereby contributing to the reduction of uncertainties associated with FCO2 accountings in these areas. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Green harvest; Neural techniques; Soil respiration","Article; artificial neural network; biomass; carbon footprint; greenhouse gas; mathematical computing; nonhuman; perceptron; pH; pore volume; principal component analysis; radial based function; soil analysis; soil moisture; soil respiration; soil temperature; spatiotemporal analysis; sugarcane; agriculture; analysis; atmosphere; Brazil; chemistry; climate change; environmental monitoring; forecasting; gas; greenhouse effect; metabolism; procedures; soil; carbon; carbon dioxide; Agriculture; Atmosphere; Brazil; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Forecasting; Gases; Greenhouse Effect; Neural Networks (Computer); Saccharum; Soil",Article,Scopus

In the study, the use of measured and/or open access data in watershed modeling is investigated and evaluated by developing three distinguished hydrological models for the Upper Anthemountas basin. To strengthen the whole procedure the hydrological models are coupled with a calibrated groundwater flow model, thus forming three separate integrated model systems. A key element of the procedure followed is the comparison between the new groundwater models and the calibrated one, leading to more reliable results regarding the use of measured and/or open access data.

One step further is then the maximization of the agricultural economic benefits, by properly adjusting the irrigated crop area pattern to optimally use the limited amount of water available. To that avail, a sequential hydro-economic model has been developed and applied to the agriculturally intensively used Zarrine River Basin (ZRB), Iran. In the first step, the surface and groundwater resources, especially, the inflow to the Boukan Dam, as well as the potential crop yields are simulated using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model, driven by GCM/QM-downscaled climate predictions for three future 21th-century periods under three climate RCPs. While in all nine combinations consistently higher temperatures are predicted, the precipitation pattern are much more versatile, leading to corresponding changes in the future water yields. Using the basin-wide water management tool MODSIM, the SWAT-simulated water available is then optimally distributed across the different irrigation plots in the ZRB, while adhering to various environmental/demand priority constraints. MODSIM is subsequently coupled with CSPSO to optimize (maximize) the agro-economic water productivity (AEWP) of the various crops and, subsequently, the net economic benefit (NEB), using crop areas as decision variables, while respecting various crop cultivation constraints. Adhering to political food security recommendations for the country, three variants of cereal cultivation area constraints are investigated. The results indicate considerably-augmented AEWPs, resulting in a future increase of the annual NEB of ~16% to 37.4 Million USD for the 65%-cereal acreage variant, while, at the same time, the irrigation water required is reduced by ~38%. This NEB-rise is achieved by augmenting the total future crop area in the ZRB by about 47%-indicating some deficit irrigation-wherefore most of this extension will be cultivated by the high AEWP-yielding crops wheat and barley, at the expense of a tremendous reduction of alfalfa acreage. Though presently making up only small base acreages, depending on the future period/RCP, tomato- and, less so, potato- and sugar beet-cultivation areas will also be increased significantly. © 2018 by the authors.","Agro-economic water productivity; Climate change; CSPSO-MODSIM; Hydro-economic modeling; Iran; Net economic benefits; Optimal crop pattern; Zarrine River Basin","agricultural economics; agricultural production; alfalfa; climate change; crop yield; cultivation; food security; high temperature; twenty first century; water availability; water resource; water use; water use efficiency; wheat; Iran; Zarrineh River; Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Hordeum; Lycopersicon esculentum; Medicago sativa; Solanum tuberosum; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

The increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles in recent times opens up new possibilities for remotely sensing crop status and yields even on complex smallholder farms. This study demonstrates the applicability of a vegetation index derived from UAV imagery to assess maize (Zea mays L.) crop vigor and yields at various stages of crop growth. The study employs a quadcopter flown at 100 m over farm plots and equipped with two consumer-grade cameras, one of which is modified to capture images in the near infrared. We find that UAV-derived GNDVI is a better indicator of crop vigor and a better estimator of yields—r = 0.372 and r = 0.393 for mean and maximum GNDVI respectively at about five weeks after planting compared to in-field methods like SPAD readings at the same stage (r = 0.259). Our study therefore demonstrates that GNDVI derived from UAV imagery is a reliable and timeous predictor of crop vigor and yields and that this is applicable even in complex smallholder farms in SSA. © 2018 by the authors.

Electricity and water consumption data were attained through the utilisation of a remote monitoring system installed on a study sample of 58 pasture-based, commercial Irish dairy farms between 2014 and 2016. In total, 15 and 20 dairy farm variables were analysed for their predictive power of monthly electricity and water consumption, respectively. These variables were related to milk production, stock numbers, infrastructural equipment, managerial procedures and environmental conditions. A CART decision tree algorithm, a random forest ensemble algorithm, an artificial neural network and a support vector machine algorithm were used to predict both water and electricity consumption. The methodology employed backward sequential variable selection to exclude variables, which added little predictive power. It also applied hyper-parameter tuning with nested cross-validation for calculating the prediction accuracy for each model on unseen data (data not utilised for model development). Electricity consumption was predicted to within 12% (relative prediction error (RPE)) using a support vector machine, while the random forest predicted water consumption to within 38%. Overall, the developed machine-learning models improved the RPE of electricity and water consumption by 54% and 23%, respectively, when compared to results previously obtained using a multiple linear regression approach. Further analysis found that during the January, February, November and December period, the support vector machine overpredicted electricity consumption by 4% (mean percentage error (MPE)) and water consumption by 21% (MPE), on average. However, overprediction was greatly reduced during the March – October period with overprediction of electricity consumption reduced to 1% while the overprediction of water consumption reduced to 8%. This was attributed to a phase shift between farms, where some farms produce milk all year round, some dry off earlier/later than others and some farms begin milking earlier/later resulting in an increased the coefficient of variance of milk production making it more difficult to model electricity and water accurately. Concurrently, large negative correlations were calculated between the number of dairy cows and absolute prediction error for electricity and water, respectively, suggesting improvements in electricity and water prediction accuracy may be achieved with increasing dairy cow numbers. The developed machine learning models may be utilised to provide key decision support information to both dairy farmers and policy makers or as a tool for conducting macro scale environmental analysis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,"Dairies; Data mining; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Electric power utilization; Errors; Farms; Forecasting; Linear regression; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Coefficient of variance; Decision-tree algorithm; Environmental conditions; Machine learning models; Multiple linear regression approaches; Nested cross validations; Remote monitoring system; Support vector machine algorithm; Learning algorithms; accuracy assessment; algorithm; electricity; energy use; farm; machine learning; methodology; pasture; prediction; water use; Ireland",Article,Scopus

Third, climate variables from regional model being fed into panel data regression model.

In this study, two statistical models, multiple linear regression and random forest, were used to identify rainfall extremes indices affecting wheat yield in three different regions of the New South Wales wheat belt. The results show that the random forest model explained 41–67% of the year-to-year yield variation, whereas the multiple linear regression model explained 34–58%. In the two models, 3-month timescale standardized precipitation index of Jun.–Aug. (SPIJJA), Sep.–Nov.

Our results indicated that the inter-annual variability of rainfall in winter and spring was largely responsible for wheat yield variation, and pre-growing season rainfall played a secondary role. Frequent shortages of rainfall posed a greater threat to crop growth than excessive rainfall in eastern Australia.

To this aim, proximal and remote spectral vegetation indices are increasingly replacing soil analysis. In this study the spatial variation of soil properties, proximal and remote spectral vegetation indices were compared in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop grown in a 4.15 ha field in northern Italy. Soil analysis (particle size distribution, pH, carbonates, C, total N, available P, exchangeable cations and electrical conductivity) was geo-referentially carried out; the proximal indices chlorophyll content by N-Tester and normalised difference vegetation index through GreenSeeker were determined in three dates during stem elongation; the remote indices PurePixel ™ chlorophyll index and PurePixel™ vegetation index were determined through the Landsat 8 satellite in three dates during the same wheat stage. Dry biomass yield (DBY), grain yield (GY) and yield components were determined at harvest. Soil, proximal and remote data were submitted to principal component analysis (PCA), and the retained PCs were clustered to delineate areas at low, intermediate and high yield potential, based on soil parameters (CLUsp), proximal (CLUpi), and remote vegetation indices (CLUri). DBY and GY were significantly correlated with several soil parameters and vegetation indices. Spatiabl distribution of soil and crop data consistently depicted a low performing area (GY&lt;3 Mg ha-1) and a high performing one (GY&gt;8 Mg ha-1). CLUsp determined a lower GY difference between low and high performing area (+60%), compared to CLUpi and CLUri (almost +100%). In CLUsp and CLUpi the low and high performing area were of similar size (25 and 29% for the two respective areas in CLUsp; 25 and 33% in CLUpi), whereas in CLUri they were quite different (16 and 46%). Lastly, yield potential levels determined by vegetation indices (CLUpi and CLUri) exhibited a better degree of agreement with DBY and GY levels, than soil parameters (CLUsp). In exchange for this, the above referred soil parameters are quite consistent in time, allowing soil data to be used for more years.

We conducted a 25-year simulation study using the hydrological model, DRAINMOD, and the carbon and nitrogen (N) model, DRAINMOD-NII, to evaluate the performance of CD at 48 locations across the U.S. Midwest. Hydrological and Nitrogen predictions of this simulation study were compared to RZWQM-DSSAT predictions by Thorp et al. (2008). Simulation results showed that CD reduced annual subsurface drainage by 86 mm (30%) and annual N drainage losses by 10.9 kg N ha−1 (32%), on average over the 48 sites. DRAINMOD predicted highest reductions in drain flow at the south and southeast locations and lowest reductions at the northwest locations. The large reductions in drain flow in the south and southeast locations resulted in a large increase in surface runoff, which could increase soil erosion and sediment transport to surface water. In the north and northwest locations, the smaller amount of water that did not pass through the drainage system because of CD was primarily lost as evapotranspiration. DRAINMOD-NII predictions of annual reductions in N drainage loss followed the same trend of annual reductions in drainage flow. DRAINMOD-NII predictions show that reductions in N drainage loss under CD were mainly attributed to increase in denitrification. The declining trend in predicted annual denitrification from the southern to the northern locations of the Midwest region is most likely attributed to the lower temperature and less precipitation at the northern locations. RZWQM-DSSAT predicted reductions in annual drainage and N loss under CD conditions showed a similar trend to DRAINMOD/DRAINMOD-NII predictions. RZWQM-DSSAT, however, predicted substantially higher reductions in both drain flow (regional average of 151 mm yr−1, 53%) and N drainage losses (regional average of 18.9 kg N ha−1 yr−1, 51%). The discrepancies between DRAINMOD/DRAINMOD-NII and RZWQM-DSSAT predictions of annual reductions in drain flow and N loss under CD conditions were caused by differences in model predictions of individual components of the water and nitrogen balances under both free drainage and controlled drainage scenarios. Overall, this simulation study showed that climate variation across the region has a substantial impact on CD efficacy for reducing N drainage loss. © 2017","Agricultural drainage; Controlled drainage; DRAINMOD; DRAINMOD-NII; Nitrogen losses; RZWQM-DSSAT","Carbon; Denitrification; Drainage; Forecasting; Groundwater flow; Nitrogen; Runoff; Sediment transport; Surface waters; Agricultural drainage; Controlled drainage; DRAINMOD; Nitrogen loss; RZWQM-DSSAT; Location; agricultural runoff; best management practice; carbon; climate variation; comparative study; denitrification; drainage water; evapotranspiration; hydrological modeling; low temperature; nitrogen; performance assessment; precipitation (climatology); prediction; water management; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico; Midwest; Mississippi River; United States",Article,Scopus

The study site was located near the city of Balcarce. Climatic conditions for three periods of years were characterized and named as Historical, Near Future and Distant Future. Pasture production, meat production and gross margin were modeled. The results indicate that the region will experience an increase in minimum (maximum) average temperature of 2.6°C (1.9°C), and an increase of 27% in mean annual rainfall at the end of the twenty first century.

Next, we predicted the yield of each variety in each of 6,490 observed subregions of the Midwest. Furthermore, yield was predicted for all the possible weather scenarios approximated by 15 historical weather instances contained in the dataset. Using predicted yields and covariance between varieties through different weather scenarios, we performed portfolio optimisation. In this way, for each subregion, we obtained a selection of varieties, that proved superior to others in terms of the amount and stability of yield. According to the rules of Syngenta Crop Challenge, for which this research was conducted, we aggregated the results across all subregions and selected up to five soybean varieties that should be distributed across the network of seed retailers.

Here I show that these glaciers provide summer meltwater to rivers and aquifers that is sufficient for the basic needs of 136 million people, or most of the annual municipal and industrial needs of Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. During drought summers, meltwater dominates water inputs to the upper Indus and Aral river basins. Uncertainties in mountain precipitation are poorly known, but, given the magnitude of this water supply, predicted glacier loss would add considerably to drought-related water stress.

Therefore, the accurate prediction of winter temperature in extended range is of utmost importance. The National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) has been providing climatic variables from the fully coupled global climate model, known as Climate Forecast System version 1 (CFSv1) on monthly to seasonal scale since 2004, and it has been upgraded to CFSv2 subsequently in 2011. In the present study, the performance of CFSv1 and CFSv2 in simulating the winter 2 m maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures (Tmax, Tmin, and Tmean, respectively) over India is evaluated with respect to India Meteorological Department (IMD) 1° × 1° observations. The hindcast data obtained from both versions of CFS from 1982 to 2009 (27 years) with November initial conditions (lead-1) are used. The analyses of winter (Tmax, Tmin, and Tmean) temperatures revealed that CFSv1 and CFSv2 are able to replicate the patterns of observed climatology, interannual variability, and coefficient of variation with a slight negative bias. Of the two, CFSv2 is appreciable in capturing increasing trends of winter temperatures like observed. The Tmax, Tmin, and Tmean correlations from CFSv2 is significantly high (0.35, 0.53, and 0.51, respectively), while CFSv1 correlations are less (0.29, 0.15, and 0.12) and insignificant. This performance of CFSv2 may be due to the better estimation of surface heat budget terms and realistic CO2 concentration, which were absent in CFSv1. CFSv2 proved to have a high probability of detection in predicting different categories (below, near, and above normal) for winter Tmin, which are required for crop yield and public utility services, over north India. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.",,"air temperature; climate modeling; climate prediction; climate variation; climatology; heat budget; weather forecasting; winter; India",Article,Scopus

The InVEST model may do a poor job estimating the spatial distribution of water yield in the Upper Upatoi Creek Watershed because baseflow provides a significant portion of the site's total water yield, which means that storage dynamics which are not modeled by InVEST may be important.

The high resolution of output provided by Regional Climate Models (RCMs) is expected to be a suitable tool to describe regional and local climatic features, although their simulation results may still present biases. For these reasons, we compared several post-processing methods to correct or reduce the biases of RCM simulations from the ENSEMBLES project for the IP. The bias-corrected datasets were also evaluated in terms of their applicability and consequences in improving the results of a crop model to simulate maize growth and development at two IP locations, using this crop as a reference for summer cropping systems in the region. The use of bias-corrected climate runs improved crop phenology and yield simulation overall and reduced the inter-model variability and thus the uncertainty. The number of observational stations underlying each reference observational dataset used to correct the bias affected the correction performance. Although no single technique showed to be the best one, some methods proved to be more adequate for small initial biases, while others were useful when initial biases were so large as to prevent data application for impact studies.

These watersheds were small, fairly flat, extensively agricultural, and heavily subsurface tile-drained. The targeting approach was also used to evaluate the model's representation of conservation practices in cost and water quality improvement, defined as export of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and sediment from cropped fields. FS, GW, and habitats were the most effective at improving water quality, while CC and wetlands made the greatest water quality improvement in lands with multiple existing conservation practices.

Wetlands are constantly affected by anthropogenic factors such as engineering projects and landscaping. Therefore, simulation of hydrologic processes and modeling the factors involved are important. In this study, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to simulate the hydrologic process in the Karkheh River Basin (KRB) in southwest Iran and to evaluate the impacts of engineering projects on its wetland (Al Hawizeh) located in the Iran-Iraq border. Calibration, validation, and uncertainty analysis were performed using Sequential Uncertainty Fitting Ver. 2 (SUFI2), which is one of the program interfaces with SWAT, in the Package SWAT Calibration Uncertainty Programs (SWAT-CUP). To assess the goodness of calibration and validation, four measures were applied: (i) percentage of data bracketed by 95% prediction uncertainty or P-factor (95PPU) calculated at 2.5% and 97.5% intervals of the simulated variables, (ii) R-factor, which is the ratio of average thickness of the PPU, (iii) Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE), and (iv) determination of coefficient (R2). Stream flows from four gauge stations combined with 14 synoptic stations were used for calibration (1987-1990) and validation (1991-1994). The P-factor values for these stations ranged from 0.64 to 0.84 and from 0.65 to 0.79 for calibration and validation, respectively. These results showed reasonable accuracy according to literature. NSE values were also acceptable, ranging from 0.52 to 0.8 and from 0.62 to 0.72 for calibration and validation, respectively. R2 values were also within an acceptable range. The calibration and validation results were then used to simulate two watershed scenarios (with and without a dam). In addition, annual flow volumes (AFVs) for two downstream stations (Hamidiyeh and Pay e Pol) were computed. AFV is defined as the volume of water that discharges from catchment at the desired output during a year. The results showed that the flows during 1987-2000 (before dam construction) and 2001 to 2010 (after dam construction) were significantly reduced after the Karkheh dam construction. The corresponding AFVs for the Hamidiyeh and Pay e Pol stations were 8.92×1011 and 1.04×1012m3 in 1987-2000 and 2.57×1011 to 3.94×1011m3 in 2001-2010. Thus, the AFVs before and after dam construction were reduced to 6.34×1011 and 6.53×1011m3 for the Hamidiyeh and Pay e Pol gauges, respectively. Consequently, flow reduction affected the wetland area, in which the surface area of the wetland was reduced and dust emission was increased. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.","Engineering projects; KRB; Simulation; SUFI-2; SWAT model; Uncertainty analysis","accuracy assessment; anthropogenic effect; calibration; land use; nature-society relations; numerical model; river basin; river engineering; river flow; uncertainty analysis; wetland; Iran; Karkheh Basin; Khuzestan",Article,Scopus

Consequently, water quality is a significant concern associated with conversion of lands to bioenergy production. This study focused on the Arkansas-White-Red river basin (AWR), one of five major river basins draining to the Mississippi River. The AWR has a strong precipitation gradient from east to west, and advanced cellulosic feedstocks are projected to become economically feasible within normal-to-wet areas of the region. In this study, we used large-scale watershed modeling to identify areas along this precipitation gradient with potential for improving water quality. We compared simulated water quality in rivers draining projected future landscapes with and without cellulosic bioenergy for two future years, 2022 and 2030 with an assumed farmgate price of $50 per dry ton. Changes in simulated water quantity and quality under future bioenergy scenarios varied among subbasins and years. Median water yield, nutrient loadings, and sediment yield decreased by 2030. Median concentrations of nutrients also decreased, but suspended sediment, which is influenced by decreased flow and in-stream processes, increased. Spatially, decreased loadings prevailed in the transitional ecotone between 97° and 100° longitude, where switchgrass, Panicum virgatum L., is projected to compete against alternative crops and land uses at $50 per dry ton. We conclude that this region contains areas that hold promise for sustainable bioenergy production in terms of both economic feasibility and water quality protection. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Panicum virgatum; POLYSYS; Bioenergy; Biofuels; Cellulosic feedstocks; Land-use change; Soil Water Assessment Tool; Sustainability; Water quality","Biofuels; Feedstocks; Forestry; Land use; Nutrients; Soil moisture; Suspended sediments; Sustainable development; Water quality; Water resources; Watersheds; Bio-energy; Cellulosic feedstocks; Land-use change; Panicum virgatum; POLYSYS; Soil water assessment tool; Rivers; biofuel; forecasting method; grass; land use change; river water; soil and water assessment tool; sustainability; water quality; Arkansas; Mississippi River; Red River [United States]; United States; White River [United States]; Panicum virgatum",Article,Scopus

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a semi distributed physically based model, was chosen and set up in the KRB for hydrologic modeling. SWAT-CUP (SWAT-Calibration and Uncertainty Programs) was used for model calibration, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, following the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) technique. The model calibration was performed for the period (1987-1999), with initial 3 years of warm up (1987-89); then, the model was validated for the subsequent 6 years of data (2000-2005). To assess the competence of model calibration and uncertainty, two indices, the p-factor (observations bracketed by the prediction uncertainty) and the r-factor (achievement of small uncertainty band), were taken into account. The results of SWAT simulations indicated that during the calibration the p-factor and the r-factor were reported as 0.82 and 0.76, respectively, while during the validation the p-factor and the r-factor were obtained as 0.71 and 0.72, respectively. After a rigorous calibration and validation, the goodness of fit was further assessed through the use of the coefficient of determination (R2) and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NS) between the observed and the final simulated values. The results indicated that R2 and NS were 0.77 and 0.74, respectively, during the calibration. The validation also indicated a satisfactory performance with R2 of 0.71 and NS of 0.69. The results would be useful to the hydrological community, water resources managers involved in agricultural water management and soil conservation, as well as to those involved in mitigating natural hazards such as droughts and floods. © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Sensitivity; Streamflow; SUFI-2 algorithm; SWAT-CUP; Uncertainty","Agriculture; Floods; Hazards; Soil conservation; Stream flow; Water conservation; Water management; Watersheds; Agricultural water management; Coefficient of determination; Sensitivity; Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis; Sequential uncertainty fittings; Soil and water assessment tool; SWAT-CUP; Uncertainty; Uncertainty analysis; algorithm; alternative agriculture; calibration; flood control; flow modeling; hazard management; hydrological modeling; model validation; sensitivity analysis; streamflow; uncertainty analysis; water management; India",Article,Scopus

The objective of this research was to narrow the range of values characterizing the limits within which estimates are expected to fall in the diagnostics of agroclimatic risks. Assessments were made by analyzing historical observations and evaluating the influence of heat stress and rainfall variability on crop water demand, biomass and grain yields of short-cycle cultivars of pearl millet and maize. We used a wide range of consistent and practical sets of crop model ensemble analyses (based on crop management practices such as plant density, fertilization levels, early/late sowing dates and soil types) and climate model ensembles from 2 climate change hypothesis (A1b and RCP8.5) over the West African Sudan-Sahel. Recent rainfall developments show that hazardous intra-seasonal rainfall distribution affects crop productivity, with increased frequency and intensity of daily rainfall, false start and early cessation of the rainy season and decreasing diurnal temperature range. In 2011-2050 perspectives, relative to the 1981-2010 baseline, a slight in - crease in temperature (i.e. +0.6 to +0.8°C) combined with a stationary to moderate decrease in precipitation leads to a 10 to 15% (8 to 15%) decrease in aboveground biomass production (grain yield). When the warming is moderate (i.e. +1.4 to 1.8°C), the decline in grain yield worsens (10 to 20%), despite a slight increase in rainfall projections. At these rates of loss in crop production, resilience can be reinforced. However, it will require that climate-smart crop management practices be embedded in sub-seasonal and interannual monitoring and early warning systems. © Inter-Research 2015.","Agroclimatic risks; Ensemble scenarios; Maize; Pearl millet; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty management; West African Sudan-Sahel","baseline conditions; biomass; climate change; crop production; crop yield; early warning system; ecosystem resilience; environmental impact; hypothesis testing; millet; precipitation intensity; water demand; Eritrea; Northern Red Sea; Sahel [Northern Red Sea]; Sudan; Pennisetum glaucum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The intervariable, spatial, and temporal dependencies of the corrected data are usually poor compared to observations.Here, the authors propose a novel method for multivariate BC. The empirical copula-bias correction (EC-BC) combines a one-dimensional BC with a shuffling technique that restores an empirical multidimensional copula. Several BC methods are investigated and compared to high-resolution reference data over the FrenchMediterranean basin: notably, (i) a 1D BC method applied independently to precipitation and temperature fields, (ii) a recent conditional correction approach developed for producing correct two-dimensional intervariable structures, and (iii) the EC-BC method. Assessments are realized in terms of intervariable, spatial, and temporal dependencies, and an objective evaluation using the integrated quadratic distance (IQD) is presented. As expected, the 1D methods cannot produce correct multidimensional properties. The conditional technique appears efficient for intervariable properties but not for spatial and temporal dependencies. EC-BC provides realistic dependencies in all respects: intervariable, spatial, and temporal. The IQD results are clearly in favor of EC-BC. As many BC methods, EC-BC relies on a stationarity assumption and is only able to reproduce patterns inherited from historical data. However, because of its ease of coding, its speed of application, and the quality of its results, the EC-BC method is a very good candidate for all needs in multivariate bias correction. © 2015 American Meteorological Society.","Bias; Precipitation; Statistical techniques; Temperature","Climatology; Precipitation (chemical); Temperature; Bias; Correction approaches; High resolution; Historical data; Objective evaluation; Shuffling technique; Statistical techniques; Temporal structures; Climate models; air temperature; atmospheric correction; atmospheric modeling; climate modeling; data quality; multivariate analysis; precipitation (climatology); spatiotemporal analysis",Article,Scopus

A point of crucial importance in this region is therefore how intensive corn (Zed mays L.)-based cropping systems for food and fuel production can be sustainable and coexist with a healthy water environment, not only under existing climate conditions but also under a changed climate in the future. To address this issue, a UMRB integrated modeling system has been built with a greatly refined 12-digit subbasin structure based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) water quality model, which is capable of estimating landscape and in-stream water and pollutant yields in response to a wide array of alternative cropping and/or management strategies and climatic conditions. The effects of the following four agricultural management scenarios on crop production and pollutant loads exported from the cropland of the UMRB to streams and rivers were evaluated: (1) expansion of continuous corn across the entire basin, (2) adoption of no-till on all corn and soybean ( Glycine max L.) fields in the region, (3) substitution of the traditional continuous corn and corn-soybean rotations with an extended five-year rotation consisting of corn, soybean, and three years of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), and (4) implementation of a winter cover crop within the baseline rotations. The effects of each management scenario were evaluated both for current climate and a projected midcentury (2046 to 2065) climate from a General Circulation Model (GCM). All four scenarios behaved similarly under the historical and future climate, generally resulting in reduced erosion and nutrient loadings to surface water bodies compared to the baseline agricultural management. Continuous corn was the only scenario which resulted in increased N pollution while no-till was the most environmentally effective and able to sustain production at almost the same levels. Rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop within the fallow period was also effective in reducing erosion and both sediment-bound and soluble forms of nutrients. The results indicated that alternative management practices could reduce sediment, N, and P exports from UMRB cropland by up to 50% without significantly affecting yields. Results for the climate change scenario showed that the effectiveness of the management scenarios was strongly linked to the reduced water availability predicted under the future climate, which assisted in mitigating pollutant transport, although with a small loss of production.","Agricultural management scenarios-; Climate change-corn based systems-; Nonpoint pollution-; Soil and water assessment tool-; Upper mississippi river basin","climate change; cropping practice; environmental management; river basin; surface water; water management; water quality; Mississippi Basin; United States; Glycine max; Medicago sativa; Secale cereale; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Our study evaluated the applicability of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in modeling subsurface drainage in a cold environment; we then employed streamflow response analyses to assess the potential impacts of the extensive subsurface drainage development in the Red River Valley (RRV) on streamflows in the Red River. The results showed that extensive subsurface drainage in the RRV would likely increase the magnitude of smaller peak flows while decreasing the magnitude of larger peak flows. Discharge reduction of large peak flows was mainly caused by reducing the flow volumes rather than increasing the time-to-peak of the hydrograph. Our analysis also suggested that extensive subsurface drainage could move more water from the watershed to the rivers in the fall season, creating more storage capacity in the soils. However, such increase in storage capacity in soils would have a negligible effect in reducing the monthly flow volumes in the following spring. The proposed method of coupling a watershed model with streamflow response analysis can be readily adopted by other researchers to evaluate the streamflow impact of land-use and climate changes around the world. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Red River of the North; Streamflow response analysis; Subsurface drainage; SWAT",,Article,Scopus

The aim of the paper is to study whether satellite observation of plant phenology are consistent with ground knowledge of crop cycles as expressed in agro-simulations. We used phenological variables from a MODIS Land Cover Dynamics (MCD12Q2) product and examined whether they reproduced the spatio-temporal variability of crop phenological stages in Southern Mali. Furthermore, a validated cereal crop growth model for this region, SARRA-H (System for Regional Analysis of Agro-Climatic Risks), provided precise agronomic information. Remotely-sensed green-up, maturity, senescence and dormancy MODIS dates were extracted for areas previously identified as crops and were compared with simulated leaf area indices (LAI) temporal profiles generated using the SARRA-H crop model, which considered the main cropping practices. We studied both spatial (eight sites throughout South Mali during 2007) and temporal (two sites from 2002 to 2008) differences between simulated crop cycles and determined how the differences were indicated in satellite-derived phenometrics. The spatial comparison of the phenological indicator observations and simulations showed mainly that (i) the satellite-derived start-of-season (SOS) was detected approximately 30 days before the model-derived SOS; and (ii) the satellite-derived end-of-season (EOS) was typically detected 40 days after the model-derived EOS. Studying the inter-annual difference, we verified that the mean bias was globally consistent for different climatic conditions. Therefore, the land cover dynamics derived from the MODIS time series can reproduce the spatial and temporal variability of different start-of-season and end-of-season crop species. In particular, we recommend simultaneously using start-of-season phenometrics with crop models for yield forecasting to complement commonly used climate data and provide a better estimate of vegetation phenological changes that integrate rainfall variability, land cover diversity, and the main farmer practices.","Crops; Mali; MODIS; Phenology; Practices; SARRA-H model",,Article,Scopus

Improvements in the timeliness and accuracy of yield forecasting by incorporating near real-time remote sensing data and the use of sophisticated statistical methods can improve our capacity to respond effectively to these challenges. The objectives of this study were (i) to investigate the use of derived vegetation indices for the yield forecasting of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) from the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at the ecodistrict scale across Western Canada with the Integrated Canadian Crop Yield Forecaster (ICCYF); and (ii) to compare the ICCYF-model based forecasts and their accuracy across two spatial scales-the ecodistrict and Census Agricultural Region (CAR), namely in CAR with previously reported ICCYF weak performance. Ecodistricts are areas with distinct climate, soil, landscape and ecological aspects, whereas CARs are census-based/statistically-delineated areas. Agroclimate variables combined respectively with MODIS-NDVI and MODIS-EVI indices were used as inputs for the in-season yield forecasting of spring wheat during the 2000-2010 period. Regression models were built based on a procedure of a leave-one-year-out. The results showed that both agroclimate + MODIS-NDVI and agroclimate + MODIS-EVI performed equally well predicting spring wheat yield at the ECD scale. The mean absolute error percentages (MAPE) of the models selected from both the two data sets ranged from 2% to 33% over the study period. The model efficiency index (MEI) varied between ??1.1 and 0.99 and ??1.8 and 0.99, respectively for the agroclimate + MODIS-NDVI and agroclimate + MODIS-EVI data sets. Moreover, significant improvement in forecasting skill (with decreasing MAPE of 40% and 5 times increasing MEI, on average) was obtained at the finer, ecodistrict spatial scale, compared to the coarser CAR scale. Forecast models need to consider the distribution of extreme values of predictor variables to improve the selection of remote sensing indices. Our findings indicate that statistical-based forecastingerror could be significantly reduced by making use of MODIS-EVI and NDVI indices at different times in the crop growing season and within different sub-regions. © 2014 by the authors.","Ecodistrict; ICCYF; MODIS; Spring wheat; Yield forecasting","Agriculture; Climate change; Crops; Cultivation; Forecasting; Image reconstruction; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Surveys; Ecodistrict; ICCYF; MODIS; Spring wheat; Yield forecasting; Radiometers",Article,Scopus

The objectives of this study were to combine thermal and spectral indices to determine water stress, and to estimate yield and investigated traits via these indices for green bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. Gina) under different water stress levels using stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) analysis. The performance of various reference surfaces for Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) computation was also tested. A field experiment was conducted in Çanakkale, Turkey in 2012 consisting of four irrigation treatments, full irrigation (unstressed) and three stress levels applying 25%, 50%, and 75% of full irrigation. To conclude, it was found that the green bean plant was very susceptible to water stress. In determining water stress, Water Band Index (WBI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Simple Ratio (SR) from the spectral indices tested were found to be highly useful in the discrimination of all treatments. CWSI based on the artificial reference (CWSIa) from thermal indices performed well in discrimination of water stress. Statistical differences were found between wet and dry reference surfaces. Considering both accuracy and ease of measurement in determining references, the use of thermal indices based on artificial references and empirical methods was found to be more useful. The highest R2 value between yield, investigated traits and indices was between chlorophyll readings (Ch1R) and indices with 0.82 according to SMLR. As a result, it can be said that the combined use of thermal and spectral indices can be used as a potential indicator of water stress in green bean. © by PSP.","Green bean; Irrigation; Spectral reflectance; Thermal imaging; Water stress","crop yield; irrigation system; legume; NDVI; spectral analysis; spectral reflectance; water stress; Canakkale [Turkey]; Turkey",Article,Scopus

Developing parallel computing software to improve calibration efficiency has received growing attention of the watershed modeling community as it is very time demanding to run iteratively complex models for calibration. In this research, we introduce a Python-based parallel computing package, PP-SWAT, for efficient calibration of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. This software employs Python, MPI for Python (mpi4py) and OpenMPI to parallelize A Multi-method Genetically Adaptive Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm (AMALGAM), allowing for simultaneously addressing multiple objectives in calibrating SWAT. Test results on a Linux computer cluster showed that PP-SWAT can achieve a speedup of 45-109 depending on model complexity. Increasing the processor count beyond a certain threshold does not necessarily improve efficiency, because intensified resource competition may result in an I/O bottleneck. The efficiency achieved by PP-SWAT also makes it practical to implement multiple parameter adjustment schemes operating at different scales in affordable time, which helps provide SWAT users with a wider range of options of parameter sets to choose from for model(s) selection. PP-SWAT was not designed to address errors associated with other sources (e.g. model structure) and cautious supervision of its power should be exercised in order to attain physically meaningful calibration results. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Evolutionary multi-objective optimization; High performance computer; Parallel processing; Parameter calibration; Soil and water assessment tool","Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; High performance computers; Parallel processing; Parameter calibration; Soil and Water assessment tools; Algorithms; Calibration; Computer operating systems; Efficiency; High level languages; Iterative methods; Multiobjective optimization; Parallel architectures; Water resources; Watersheds; Climate models; calibration; climate change; human activity; hydrological modeling; multiobjective programming; numerical model; parallel computing; software; water resource; watershed",Article,Scopus

In this study, we used the physically-based hydrological/water quality model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool, to investigate the influence of PS and NPS pollution on the water quality of the East River (Dongjiang in Chinese) in southern China. Our results indicate that NPS pollution was the dominant contribution (>94%) to nutrient loads except for mineral phosphorus (50%). A comprehensive Water Quality Index (WQI) computed using eight key water quality variables demonstrates that water quality is better upstream than downstream despite the higher level of ammonium nitrogen found in upstream waters. Also, the temporal (seasonal) and spatial distributions of nutrient loads clearly indicate the critical time period (from late dry season to early wet season) and pollution source areas within the basin (middle and downstream agricultural lands), which resource managers can use to accomplish substantial reduction of NPS pollutant loadings. Overall, this study helps our understanding of the relationship between human activities and pollutant loads and further contributes to decision support for local watershed managers to protect water quality in this region. In particular, the methods presented such as integrating WQI with watershed modeling and identifying the critical time period and pollutions source areas can be valuable for other researchers worldwide.","East River (Dongjiang); Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Pollution source areas; SWAT; Water quality index","East River; Non-point source pollution; Point source and nonpoint sources; Pollution sources; Soil and Water assessment tools; SWAT; Water quality indexes; Water quality variables; Decision support systems; Landforms; Managers; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Pollution; Rivers; Water quality; Watersheds; River pollution; assessment method; decision making; index method; nitrogen compound; numerical model; phosphorus; pollutant source; river pollution; seasonal variation; spatial distribution; water quality; China; Dong River",Article,Scopus

Estimations of SR are evaluated with the meteorological values by using the statistical bases. The obtained results indicated that the ANN model could achieve a satisfactory performance when compared to the MLR model. Moreover, it is understood that more accurate results in estimation of SR are obtained in the use of satellite data, rather than the use of meteorological station data.

In this study, the hydrology of the Lower Porsuk Stream Watershed in Turkey has been modelled with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool to determine optimal water management strategies. The calibration and the validation process have been accomplished using data from two monitoring stations. The model has been run for the 1978-2009 period, and while the 1998-2004 period has been used for calibration, the validation has spanned the whole period. The SWATCup calibration and uncertainty program has been used for this purpose. No significant differences have been detected among different iteration numbers in the calibration period. The monthly Nash-Sutcliffe and R2 performance indicators for the upstream Esenkara station have been 0.74 and 0.88, respectively, for the calibration period, and 0.87 and 0.87, respectively, for the validation period. The Kiranharmani station, which is located close to the watershed outlet, has shown values of 0.59 and 0.72, respectively, for the calibration period, and 0.44 and 0.56, respectively, for the validation period. There are uncertainties in the abstracted irrigation and groundwater quantities that have reflected in the results in the Kiranharmani station, which is more affected as it lies downstream of the irrigation areas. The effects of different irrigation practices on the flow regime have been also investigated. A scenario has been implemented in which drip irrigation wholly replaces conventional furrow and sprinkler irrigation. The scenario has shown increases in stream flows by 87% for the whole year. The adoption of more efficient irrigation practices thus results in reducing the water stress induced by irrigation demands. With this study, a modelling framework has been founded to aid water management applications in the Lower Porsuk Stream Watershed by generating scenarios for best management practices. © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd..","Calibration; Hydrologic modelling; Irrigation; SWAT; SWATCup; Validation","Best management practices; Drip irrigation; Flow regimes; Hydrologic modelling; Integrated watershed management; Irrigation area; Irrigation practices; Iteration numbers; Management applications; Management practices; Modelling framework; Monitoring stations; Performance indicators; Soil and Water assessment tools; Sprinkler irrigation; SWAT; SWATCup; Validation; Validation periods; Validation process; Water management strategies; Water stress; Watershed models; Benchmarking; Calibration; Groundwater; Irrigation; Landforms; Soil conservation; Stream flow; Water conservation; Water management; Water quality; Watersheds; Sprinkler systems (irrigation); assessment method; best management practice; calibration; drip irrigation; groundwater; hydrological modeling; model validation; streamflow; water management; water quality; watershed; Turkey",Article,Scopus

In this study, water, sediment, and nutrient delivery to the stream flow at the Donga-Pont river catchment outlet (586km2) in the Republic of Benin, West Africa were simulated incorporating local management practices including detailed crop systems, fertilization and manure deposition, using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT).At the study scale (586km2), cropping systems are not mapped. Therefore, a land use map was refined for the study area, enabling the evaluation of four management scenarios: crop systems with fertilizer supplied only to cotton, rice and maize, as is common in Benin (Sc0); crop systems without the use of fertilizer (Sc0a); the original land use map with similar fertilizer inputs to all cropping systems (Sc1); and the original land use map without fertilizer inputs (Sc1a). Compared to the first scenario, the latter two scenarios, commonly used in regional scale modeling, exhibited distinct biases in plant growth parameters, crop yields, water yield, sediment yield and nitrogen load.Finally, it was apparent that at the catchment scale, decreases in water yield and nutrient loading were induced by reductions in rainfall (as the result of climate change scenarios), but the effects of the decline in precipitation were counteracted by the effects of changes in land use (land use scenarios). This indicates the strength of the relationship between agriculture and water quality (sediment and nutrient loads) within the Donga-Pont catchment. It was clear that management practices such as fertilizer inputs are among the principal factors controlling this dynamic.

To provide spatially distributed rainfall data, point measurements are interpolated. However, in low density measurement networks, the use of different interpolation methods may result in large differences and hence in deviations from the actual spatial distribution of rainfall. Our study aims at analyzing different rainfall interpolation schemes with regard to their suitability to produce spatial rainfall estimates in a monsoon dominated region with scarce rainfall measurements. The study was carried out in the meso-scale catchment of the Mula and the Mutha Rivers (2036km 2) upstream of the city of Pune, India. Rainfall data from 16 rain gauges were spatially interpolated using seven different methods, including Thiessen polygons, statistical, and geostatistical approaches. The two most suitable covariates for rainfall interpolation were identified as (i) distance in wind direction from the main orographic barrier and as (ii) a 0.05° pattern of mean annual rainfall derived from satellite data acquired by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Consequently, these two covariates were used in the regression-based interpolation approaches. The quality of the different methods was assessed using a two step validation approach: (i) Cross-validation was used to evaluate the capability to reproduce measured data. (ii) Spatially integrated interpolation performance was assessed by using a hydrologic model to calculate runoff and compare modeled to measured runoff. By this assessment, the regression-based methods showed the best performance. We found that the choice of the covariate had a significant impact on precipitation and runoff amounts, as well as on the temporal course of runoff events. Our results show, that the decision on the suitable interpolation scheme should not only be based on the comparison with point measurements, but should also take the representativeness of the given measurement network as well as of the interpolated spatial rainfall distribution into account. The successful application of regression-based interpolation methods using a high resolution TRMM pattern as covariate is very promising as it is transferable to other data scarce regions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","India; Interpolation; Kriging; Rainfall; SWAT; TRMM","Annual rainfall; Covariates; Cross validation; Daily rainfall; Environmental applications; Geostatistical approach; High resolution; Hydrologic models; India; Interpolation method; Interpolation schemes; Kriging; Mesoscale; Orographic barriers; Point measurement; Precipitation and runoff; Rain gauges; Rainfall data; Rainfall interpolation; Rainfall measurements; Satellite data; Significant impacts; Spatial interpolation; Spatial rainfall; SWAT; TRMM; Tropical rainfall measuring missions; Validation approach; Wind directions; Catchments; Interpolation; Quality control; Rain gages; Regression analysis; Runoff; Spatial distribution; Rain; comparative study; data set; interpolation; kriging; rainfall; rainfall-runoff modeling; raingauge; regression analysis; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; TRMM; India; Maharashtra; Mula Basin; Mutha Basin; Pune",Article,Scopus

Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer, responsible for one third of the world production. A coffee plot exhibits high and low production in alternated years, a characteristic so called biennial yield. High yield is generally a result of suitable conditions of foliar biomass. Moreover, in high production years one plot tends to lose more leaves than it does in low production years. In both cases some correlation between coffee yield and leaf biomass can be deduced which can be monitored through time series of vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery. In Brazil, a comprehensive, spatially distributed study assessing this relationship has not yet been done. The objective of this study was to assess possible correlations between coffee yield and MODIS derived vegetation indices in the Brazilian largest coffee-exporting province. We assessed EVI and NDVI MODIS products over the period between 2002 and 2009 in the south of Minas Gerais State whose production accounts for about one third of the Brazilian coffee production. Landsat images were used to obtain a reference map of coffee areas and to identify MODIS 250 m pure pixels overlapping homogeneous coffee crops. Only MODIS pixels with 100% coffee were included in the analysis. A wavelet-based filter was used to smooth EVI and NDVI time profiles. Correlations were observedbetween variations on yield of coffee plots and variations on vegetation indices for pixels overlapping the same coffee plots. The vegetation index metrics best correlated to yield were the amplitude and the minimum values over the growing season. The best correlations were obtained between variation on yield and variation on vegetation indices the previous year (R = 0.74 for minEVI metric and R = 0.68 for minNDVI metric). Although correlations were not enough to estimate coffee yield exclusively from vegetation indices, trends properly reflect the biennial bearing effect on coffee yield. © 2012 by the authors.","Coffee yield; Remote sensing; Vegetation indices; Wavelet filtering","Foliar biomass; Growing season; High yield; Landsat images; Leaf biomass; Minas Gerais; Minimum value; Previous year; Pure pixel; Reference map; Remote sensing imagery; Vegetation index; Wavelet filtering; Pixels; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Satellite imagery",Article,Scopus

Like many Mediterranean areas, this basin is characterized by water shortages and diffuse pollution from agricultural sources. Hence the objective of this study was to develop possible land use and land management scenarios that could constitute an alternative to the current watershed management. Several land use and land management scenarios were formulated and analyzed with local stakeholders, and two were selected and simulated as realistic in consideration of the socio-economical aspects of the study area. Scenario 1 involves agricultural practices that include a reduction in fertilizer use to meet the Water Framework Directive requirements for "" good"" status of water bodies. Scenario 2 introduces rapeseed cultivation, replacing durum wheat in a small area, to investigate the impact of biofuel plant cultivation on water quality. Each option was assessed by considering the effects on water quality, crop yields and economic benefits. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was applied to simulate hydrological processes and evaluate current and future nutrient loads. This model requires adequate streamflow data for calibration and validation. However, as is the case for many Mediterranean basins, insufficient data were available. Therefore, a methodology was developed and tested to calibrate hydrological processes based on the transposition of a parameter set from a gauged catchment located in the same region. This study suggests that a sound use of fertilizers could substantially reduce the amount of nutrients flowing into surface waters, although the effects of such a policy on crop yield and farm income would be negative in some cases. Moreover, the results clearly predict that the replacement of durum wheat with rapeseed (a biofuel crop), could offer a margin of profit, but would have a negative impact on water quality due to increased nutrient losses. Consequently, this option is unsuitable for this area. Furthermore, it can be inferred from these results that the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources may have a negative impact on the objectives of the EU Water Framework Directive. Clearly, this process needs to be regulated, taking into account environmental and socio-economical aspects. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Biofuel crops; Land use scenarios; SWAT model; Ungauged basin; Water quality","biofuel; land management; land use; numerical model; socioeconomic status; stakeholder; streamflow; water management; water quality; watershed; Italy; Sardinia; Brassica napus; Triticum aestivum; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum",Article,Scopus

Traditionally, precipitation measurements are available at rain gauge points, which are usually too sparsely distributed to capture spatial variability; therefore, these point data need to be interpolated to estimate the spatial distribution of precipitation. Development of methods to interpolate precipitation data from sparse networks of rain gauge stations has been a focus of past research (e.g., Phillips et al. 1992; Hasenauer et al. 2003). In recent years, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) installed a network of (approximately 160) Weather Surveillance Radar—1988 Dopplers (WSR-88Ds) radar stations as part of a Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) program that began implementation in 1991 (Young et al. 2000; Hardegree et al. 2008). The NEXRAD products, located in the Contiguous United States (CONUS) at approximately 4 × 4 km2 resolution, provide nominal coverage of 96% of the country (Crum et al. 1998). The ability of NEXRAD to provide spatially distributed precipitation estimates makes it one important source of precipitation information for hydrologists and natural resources managers. The NEXRAD precipitation products have been used for multiple purposes in hydrologic modeling and agricultural and rangeland management (e.g., Diak et al. 1998; Krajewski and Smith 2002; Zhang et al. 2004; Hardegree et al. 2008). © 2012 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Radar imaging; Radar stations; Rain gages; Spatial distribution; Surveillance radar; Hydrologic modeling; Land-surface process; National Weather Services; Precipitation measurement; Precipitation products; Rangeland management; Spatial and temporal variability; Weather surveillance radar; Rain",Book Chapter,Scopus

Fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) is a fusion of fuzzy logic and cognitive map theories, and is used for modeling and representing experts' knowledge. It is capable of dealing with situations including uncertain descriptions using similar procedure such as human reasoning does. It is a challenging approach for decision making especially in complex processing environments. The FCM approach presented here was chosen to be utilized in agriculture because of the nature of the application. The prediction of yield in cotton production is a complex process with sufficient interacting parameters and FCMs are suitable for this kind of problem. Throughout this proposed method, FCMs designed and developed to represent experts' knowledge for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) yield prediction and crop management. The developed FCM model consists of nodes linked by directed edges, where the nodes represent the main factors affecting cotton crop production such as texture, organic matter, pH, K, P, Mg, N, Ca, Na and cotton yield, and the directed edges show the cause-effect (weighted) relationships between the soil properties and cotton yield. The investigated methodology was evaluated for 360 cases measured during the time of six subsequent years (2001-2006) in a 5 ha experimental cotton field, in predicting the yield class between two possible categories (""low"" and ""high""). The results obtained reveal its comparative advantage over the benchmarking machine learning algorithms tested for the same data set for the years mentioned by providing decisions that match better with the real measured ones. The main advantage of this approach is its simple structure and flexibility, representing knowledge visually and more descriptively. Hence, it might be a convenient tool in predicting cotton yield and improving crop management. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Cotton; Decision making; Fuzzy cognitive maps; Fuzzy sets; Knowledge representation; Modeling; Yield","Cause-effect; Cognitive maps; Comparative advantage; Complex Processes; Complex processing; Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.); Cotton production; Cotton yield; Crop managements; Crop production; Data sets; Fuzzy cognitive map; Fuzzy cognitive maps; Human reasoning; Machine learning algorithms; Modeling; Organic matter; Precision Agriculture; Simple structures; Softcomputing techniques; Soil property; Yield; Yield prediction; Artificial intelligence; Crops; Cultivation; Decision making; Decision support systems; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy rules; Fuzzy sets; Fuzzy systems; Geologic models; Image matching; Knowledge representation; Large scale systems; Learning algorithms; pH effects; Sodium; Soft computing; Cotton",Article,Scopus

The approach is based on look-up tables created via comprehensive radiative transfer modeling to achieve high accuracy and high computational efficiency. The synergy of the multispectral sensor MODIS and the high-temporal-resolution geostationary satellite MTSAT enables the adequate use of multisource remote sensing information to determine the atmosphere and surface states, and thereby complements shortcomings of their own. Here we use MTSAT data to capture the changes of cloud fields in the atmosphere and use MODIS products to obtain the dynamic aerosol loading, water vapor content, surface reflectance, and other information. Meanwhile, on the basis of instantaneous retrieval results, the calculation of hourly average SSI is also explored. The preliminary validation demonstrates that both instantaneous and hourly SSIs can be produced accurately over northern China using this approach, and the retrieval quality of hourly SSI data is slightly better than that of instantaneous SSI data.

Cotton crop management is a complex process with interacting parameters like soil, crop and weather factors. The soft computing technique of fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) was used for modeling and representing experts' knowledge. FCM, as a fusion of fuzzy logic and cognitive map theories, is capable of dealing with uncertain descriptions like human reasoning. It is a challenging approach for decision making especially in complex environments. The yield management in cotton production is a complex process with sufficient interacting parameters and FCMs are suitable for this kind of problem. The developed FCM model consists of nodes that represent the main factors affecting cotton production linked by directed edges that show the cause-effect relationships between factors and cotton yield. Furthermore, weather factors and conditions were taken into consideration in this approach by categorizing springs as dry-wet and warm-cool. The methodology was evaluated for approximately 360 cases measured over 2001, 2003 and 2006 in a 5 ha cotton field. The results were compared with some benchmarking machine learning algorithms, which were tested for the same data set, with encouraging results. The main advantage of FCM is the simple structure and the easy handling of complex data. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","cotton; decision making; Fuzzy cognitive maps; fuzzy sets; knowledge representation; modeling; yield",,Conference Paper,Scopus

In this study, an integrated monitoring, sensing and modeling system for estimating CO2 fixation and grain yields using a photosynthetic sterility model was developed. Input data for model computation include observed meteorological data, numerical prediction reanalysis data, and satellite data such as solar radiation, land-cover and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) on a continental scale. Model validation requires crop yields and the Crop Situation Index (CSI) was provided by the Japanese government. It also demonstrates the application potential of this system to grain fields of paddy rice, winter wheat, and maize in Southeast Asia. The carbon hydrate in grains has the same chemical formula as that of cellulose in grain vegetation. The partition of sequestered CO2 into grain, straw, and root portions of plant biomass weight was computed. The present photosynthesis model was evaluated using the mass of carbon included in the harvested grains of provincial crop production. Results indicate that the proposed system successfully estimates the photosynthesis fixation of rice reasonably well in Japan and China through the analysis of carbon in grains. However, the model tends to underestimate the photosynthesis rates for winter wheat and maize.

Currently, some serious environmental problems of waterlogging and soil salinization are burgeoning in parts of Haryana State of India; half a million hectare area of the State is already waterlogged. Poor irrigation and drainage management and inadequate exploitation of saline ground water are the main factors responsible for this phenomenon. In order to prevent further degradation and to maintain the food production for the growing population, judicious use of natural resources is a must. A wide range of solutions could be considered to address the problems. But the effectiveness of all the solutions and their combinations cannot be verified with on-farm experiments. Simulation models by way of their predictive capability are often the only viable means of providing input to management decisions. These models can help to forecast the likely impacts of a particular alternative management strategy. In the present study a physical based one-dimensional simulation model SWASALT was employed to evaluate on-farm irrigation water management options. After successful calibration and validation with field experimentation data, several scenario building exercises have been conducted under different crop, soil and rainfall conditions. The water and salt balance component obtained for each simulation run were used to derive water management response indicators. The simulation study revealed that in most conditions, saline water of up to 7.5. dS/m can be used safely on long term basis for crop production. The simulation study further revealed that alternative use of canal and saline water had an edge over mix use. Several alternatives have been suggested for sustainable agricultural production in the region. The strategies suggested, if followed, would lend sustainability to the agricultural production besides substantial increase in production and water resources conservation, by impeding the environmental hazard of waterlogging and soil salinization. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Efficient irrigation management; Environmental hazard; Management alternatives; Semi-arid region; Sustainable agriculture; Water resources conservation","Agricultural productions; Agricultural sustainability; Alternative management; Careful management; Crop production; Decision supports; Environmental hazard; Environmental hazards; Environmental problems; Field experimentation; Food production; Irrigated agriculture; Irrigation management; Long term; Management decisions; On-farm irrigation; One-dimensional simulations; Predictive capabilities; Rainfall condition; Saline groundwater; Salt balances; Scenario building; Semi-arid region; Simulation model; Simulation studies; Soil salinization; Sustainable agriculture; Arid regions; Computer simulation; Crops; Cultivation; Decision making; Decision support systems; Experiments; Farms; Groundwater; Irrigation; Saline water; Soil conservation; Soils; Sustainable development; Water management; Water supply; Water conservation; calibration; crop production; decision making; drainage; exploitation; food production; irrigation; land management; natural resource; numerical model; one-dimensional modeling; rainfall; salinization; semiarid region; sustainability; water management; water resource; waterlogging; Haryana; India",Article,Scopus

The presented kernel clustering methods are the kernel version of many classical clustering algorithms, e.g., K-means, SOM and neural gas. Spectral clustering arise from concepts in spectral graph theory and the clustering problem is configured as a graph cut problem where an appropriate objective function has to be optimized.

In this paper we used an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to assimilate coarse resolution satellite microwave sensor derived soil moisture estimates (SWI) for correcting errors in the water balance of the world food studies (WOFOST) crop model. Crop model simulations with the EnKF for winter wheat and grain maize were carried out for Spain, France, Italy and Germany for the period 1992-2000. The results were evaluated on the basis of regression with known crop yield statistics at national and regional level. Moreover, the EnKF filter innovations were analysed to see if any systematic trends could be found that could indicate deficiencies in the WOFOST water balance. Our results demonstrate that the assimilation of SWI has clearly improved the relationship with crop yield statistics for winter wheat for the majority of regions (66%) where a relationship could be established. For grain maize the improvement is less evident because improved relationships could only be found for 56% of the regions. We suspect that partial crop irrigation could explain the relatively poor results for grain maize, because irrigation is not included in the model. Analyses of the filter innovations revealed spatial and temporal patterns, while the distribution of normalised innovations is not Gaussian and has a non-zero mean indicating that the EnKF performs suboptimal. The non-zero mean is caused by differences in the mean value of the forecasted and observed soil moisture climatology, while the excessive spread in the distribution of normalised innovations indicates that the error covariances of forecasts and observations have been underestimated. These results clearly indicate that additional sources of error need to be included in the simulations and observations. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Remote sensing data have become the most important data source for crop type mapping, and the emerging digital technology also provides a series of new approaches. However, with the advent of smart agriculture era, new demands are placed on crop type mapping with higher spatial and temporal resolution, higher product accuracy and more automated. The object was to provide a review of technology trends, key issues and demand gaps of crop type mapping based on remote sensing. It was concentrated on the main problems and main research work from the three perspectives of small-scale crop type fine identification, large-scale crop type automated mapping and crop type mapping mode change. It was highlighted that crop type mapping products needed more precise, near real-time and higher accuracy on the small scale, mainly using super-high spatialresolution image data, such as one meter or less. Furthermore, it still faced significant challenges to improve crop type mapping accuracy, such as more than 95%, for extracting high accuracy crop phenotypes information to meet application needs. On the large-scale crop type mapping, it needed to be more automated and meet the reliable accuracy, such as around 90%. High spatial and temporal resolution image data were mainly used, such as 2~5 d and 10~30 m, and also the issues of how to deal with the storage management and analysis were faced when it came to big data, to develop the classification method in a robust manner over the large scale, and to fine a scientific and efficient ground true sample acquisition approach. It was also presented that the pattern of crop type mapping would also shift from confirming monitoring to early prediction and specific crop detection. Moreover, five prospects were proposed from the perspectives of strengthening scientific research and accelerating application, which provided some ideas for the development of remote sensing crop type identification and mapping products that met the different needs of smart agriculture and smart land. © 2018, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

Projecting crop yield changes under climate change requires future climate scenarios as input to crop yield models. It is widely accepted that downscaling of climate data is required to bridge the gap between large-scale global climate models (GCMs) and climate change impact models, such as crop growth models. Regional climate models (RCMs) are often used to dynamically downscale GCM simulations to smaller regional scales, while statistical methods, such as regression-based transfer functions and stochastic weather generators, are also widely employed to develop future climate scenarios for this purpose. The methods used in developing future climate scenarios often contribute to uncertainties in the projected impacts of climate change, in addition to those associated with GCMs and forcing scenarios. We employed climate scenarios from the state-of-the-art RCMs in the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP), along with climate scenarios generated by a stochastic weather generator based on climate change simulations performed by their driving GCMs, to drive the CERES-Wheat model in DSSAT to project changes in spring wheat yield on the Canadian Prairies. The future time horizon of 2041–2070 and the baseline period of 1971–2000 were considered. The projected changes showed an average increase ranging from 26 to 37 % of the baseline yield when the effects of the elevated CO2 concentration were simulated, but only up to 15 % if the elevated CO2 effect was excluded. In addition to their potential use in climate change impact assessment, the results also demonstrated that the simulated crop yield changes were fairly consistent whether future climate scenarios were derived from RCMs or they were generated by a stochastic weather generator based on the simulated climate change from the GCMs that were used to drive the RCMs, in this case, when they were compared for regional averages. © 2015, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.",,"climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; crop yield; growth response; wheat; Canada; Prairie Provinces; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Modeling the long-term hydrologic impacts of alternative crops can be a time-saving and cost-effective alternative to field-based experiments. A newly developed management allowed depletion (MAD) irrigation scheduling algorithm for Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used in this study. The impacts of irrigated farming, dryland farming, and continuous fallow on water conservation were evaluated. Results indicated that simulated irrigation, evapotranspiration, and crop yield were representative of the measured data. Approximately 19%, 21%, and 32% reductions in annual groundwater uses were associated with irrigated soybean, sunflower, and sorghum, respectively, as compared to irrigated corn. On average, annual soil water depletion was more than 52 mm for dryland farming scenarios. In contrast, only 18 mm of soil water was lost to evaporation annually, for the long-term continuous fallow simulation.

The ORF and ANDF models, which are fuzzy logic systems based on t-conorm and t-norm between temperature and moisture conditions, respectively, were developed to assess the quality of climate conditions for crops. The parameter values for both models were obtained from existing knowledge, e.g., the EcoCrop database. These models were then compared with the EcoCrop model, which is based on the t-norm. The ORF model explained greater variation (54%) in the yield of annual ryegrass at 84 site-years than the ANDF model (43%) and the EcoCrop model (5%). The climate suitability index of the ORF model had the greatest likelihood of occurrence of annual ryegrass compared to the other models. The ORF model also had similar results for alfalfa and sorghum.

The classification methodology is adapted in order to be trained with a limited number of extreme cases. Using four weather predictors—the average temperature in July and August, and the SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index) in June and July—71% of the extreme cases are well classified by this statistical model. Furthermore, the neural network output represents a good yield severity index and can provide an early quantitative warning for extreme yield anomalies. ©2018.

Data analysis was divided into four steps: i) data acquisition and preparation; ii) selection of training data; iii) building of forecasting models; and iv) spatial and temporal validation. Analysis was performed using yield data collected from 19 maize fields located in Brazil (2016 and 2017) and in the United States (2016), and normalised vegetation indices (NDVI, green NDVI and red edge NDVI) derived from Sentinel-2. Main outcomes from this study were: i) data selection impacted yield forecast model and fields with narrow yield variability and/or with skewed data distribution should be avoided; ii) models considering spatial correlation of residuals outperformed Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression; iii) red edge NDVI was most frequently retained into the model compared with the other VIs; and iv) model prediction power was more sensitive to yield data frequency distribution than to the geographical distance or years.

The dependence of two canopy traits, height and vigour, on fertilizer treatment was observed in a field trial comprised of ten varieties of spring wheat. A custom-built mobile ground platform (MGP) and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were deployed at the experimental site for standard red, green and blue (RGB) image collection on five occasions. Meanwhile, reference field measurements of canopy height and vigour were manually recorded during the growing season. Canopy level estimates of height and vigour for each variety and treatment were computed by image analysis. The agreement between estimates from each platform and reference measurements was statistically analysed. Estimates of canopy height derived from MGP imagery were more accurate (RMSE = 3.95 cm, R2 = 0.94) than estimates derived from UAV imagery (RMSE = 6.64 cm, R2 = 0.85). In contrast, vigour was better estimated using the UAV imagery (RMSE = 0.057, R2 = 0.57), compared to MGP imagery (RMSE = 0.063, R2 = 0.42), albeit with a significant fixed and proportional bias. The ability of the platforms to capture differential development of traits as a function of fertilizer treatment was also investigated. Both imaging methodologies observed a higher median canopy height of treated plots compared with untreated plots throughout the season, and a greater median vigour of treated plots compared with untreated plots exhibited in the early growth stages. While the UAV imaging provides a high-throughput method for canopy-level trait determination, the MGP imaging captures subtle canopy structures, potentially useful for fine-grained analyses of plants. © 2018 by the authors.","Canopy imaging; Canopy traits; Field phenotyping; Height; Mobile ground platform; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vigour; Wheat","Aerial photography; Fertilizers; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Canopy traits; Height; Mobile ground platform; Phenotyping; Vigour; Wheat; Antennas",Article,Scopus

Given that only monthly observed temperature data is readily available for the late 19th and early 20th century at a national scale for the UK, the objective of this work was to derive the best possible UK-wide gridded PET dataset from the limited data available.To that end, firstly, a combination of (i) seven temperature-based PET equations, (ii) four different calibration approaches and (iii) seven input temperature data were evaluated. For this evaluation, a gridded daily PET product based on the physically based Penman-Monteith equation (the CHESS PET dataset) was used, the rationale being that this provides a reliable ""ground truth"" PET dataset for evaluation purposes, given that no directly observed, distributed PET datasets exist. The performance of the models was also compared to a ""naïve method"", which is defined as the simplest possible estimation of PET in the absence of any available climate data. The ""naïve method"" used in this study is the CHESS PET daily long-term average (the period from 1961 to 1990 was chosen), or CHESS-PET daily climatology.The analysis revealed that the type of calibration and the input temperature dataset had only a minor effect on the accuracy of the PET estimations at catchment scale. From the seven equations tested, only the calibrated version of the McGuinness-Bordne equation was able to outperform the ""naïve method"" and was therefore used to derive the gridded, reconstructed dataset. The equation was calibrated using 43 catchments across Great Britain.The dataset produced is a 5km gridded PET dataset for the period 1891 to 2015, using the Met Office 5km monthly gridded temperature data available for that time period as input data for the PET equation. The dataset includes daily and monthly PET grids and is complemented with a suite of mapped performance metrics to help users assess the quality of the data spatially.This dataset is expected to be particularly valuable as input to hydrological models for any catchment in the UK. © Author(s) 2018.",,,Article,Scopus

The consequences of these changes on food security and natural resources in this region might be very dramatic. Anticipating climate change impacts by improving agricultural systems efficiency is a critical need. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the vulnerability of water resources and performance of two major rainfed crops (Winter wheat & Sunflower) to climate change impact in R'dom watershed. The study aimed also, to evaluate some adaptation strategies to improve crops water productivities while preserving hydrologic resources. The study site is a typical Mediterranean agro-silvo-pastoral watershed in North-western Morocco, where water resources are facing an increasing demand. Both hydrologic and plants growth modules of Soil and Water Assessment Tool Model (SWAT) have been calibrated and validated over the period 2004 to 2009. SWAT model and downscaled Global Circulation Model CNRM CM5 were used to simulate water yield and crops water productivities in 2031–2050 period under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). The RCM data revealed that the study area will experience important precipitation drop and mean temperature increase in the period 2031 to 2050. About 26.4% (±2.89) decrease of basin water yield and up to 44.7% (±9.03) drop down of crops water productivities were consequently predicted. After simulation of 5 combinations of no tillage and two early sowing dates’ strategies, TOPSIS technique was used to prioritize strategies according to different management policies. Both no tillage and the 10 days early sowing strategies have stood out as two best adaptation strategies among the management policies evaluated as compared to business as usual. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation strategy; Climate change; R'dom watershed; SWAT model; TOPSIS","adaptive management; agricultural management; agricultural modeling; agricultural policy; alternative agriculture; climate change; climate effect; crop production; farming system; food security; Mediterranean environment; natural resource; rainfed agriculture; soil and water assessment tool; sowing date; vulnerability; water demand; water resource; water yield; watershed; Morocco; Helianthus; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

It corrects the complete distribution, but does not correct for errors in the annual cycle. Therefore, QM is often applied separately to temporal subsamples of the data (e.g. each calendar month), which reduces the calibration sample size. The question arises whether this sample size reduction negates the benefit from applying QM to temporal subsamples. We applied four QM methods in a cross-validation approach to 40 years of daily precipitation data from 10 regional climate model (RCM) hindcast runs, without and with (semi-annual, seasonal, and monthly) subsampling. QM subsampling improved the BC of daily RCM precipitation; less distinct for independent data but considerably for the calibration data. The optimal subsampling timescale for the correction of independent data depended on the chosen QM method and ranged between semi-annual and monthly.

However, very few models have been tested using a comprehensive hydrologic data set. The present study's objective was to evaluate the hydrologic component of RZWQM2 (Root Zone Water Quality Model) using a comprehensive hydrological dataset including subsurface tile drainage, subirrigation, soil water content, sap flow and crop growth data such as leaf area index, crop yield and crop growth stages. Drawing on 2008 and 2009 data from a farm site in Southern Quebec, the RZWQM2 model showed accurate simulation in soil water content, sap flow, growth stage, leaf area index, and crop yield. While mean values for growing season tile flow under both free drainage (FD) and controlled drainage with subirrigation (CD-SI) were reasonably accurate, winter tile flow was significantly overestimated, indicating RZWQM2’s reliability to be compromised by its imperfect winter drainage process. Accordingly, a Kalman filter technique was applied to enhance model reliability and reduce predictive uncertainties. A novel RZWQM2 model equipped with a Kalman filter algorithm adequately simulated, in both calibration and validation phases, the hydrology and corn growth which occurred under both FD and CD-SI systems at the selected field site. Simulation results suggest that RZWQM2 model can be used for water management under subsurface drained and irrigated field and the Kalman filter technique significantly improved the accuracy of RZWQM2 model in simulating winter drainage in cold areas. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Controlled drainage; Kalman filter; Model evaluation; Transpiration; Uncertainty analysis","Agriculture; Crops; Cultivation; Finite difference method; Hydrology; Quality control; Soil moisture; Subirrigation; Transpiration; Uncertainty analysis; Water management; Water quality; Calibration and validations; Controlled drainage; Kalman filter algorithms; Kalman filter technique; Model evaluation; Predictive uncertainty; Root zone water quality models; Subsurface tile drainage; Kalman filters; agricultural modeling; crop production; crop yield; growing season; growth rate; irrigation system; Kalman filter; leaf area index; maize; sap flow; soil water; transpiration; uncertainty analysis; water management; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Most wheat production studies use the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to estimate the production and yield of wheat and other crops. On the one hand, few studies use the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) to determine crop yield and production on a regional level. This is possibly due to a lack of continuity of MERIS. On the other hand, the emergence of Sentinel 2 open new possibilities for the research and application of MTCI. This study has built two empirical models to estimate wheat production and yield in Andalusia. To this end, the study used the complete times series (weekly images from 2006–2011) of the MTCI vegetation index from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) sensor associated with the Andalusian yearbook for agricultural and fishing statistics (AEAP—Anuario de estadísticas agrarias y pesqueras de Andalucía). In order to build these models, the optimal development period for the plant needed to be identified, as did the time-based aggregation of MTCI values using said optimal period as a reference, and relation with the index, with direct observations of production and yield through spatial aggregation using coverage from the Geographic Information System for Agricultural Parcels (SIGPAC—Sistema de información geográfica de parcelas agrícolas) and requests for common agricultural policy (CAP) assistance.

To address the water quality implications of increased biofuel production, biofuel scenarios were tested with a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model revision featuring improved biofuel crop representation. Scenarios included corn stover removal and the inclusion of two perennial bioenergy crops, switchgrass and Miscanthus, grown on marginal lands (slopes >2% and erosion rates >2 t/ha) and nonmarginal lands. The SWAT model estimates show water quality is not very sensitive to stover removal. The perennial bioenergy crops reduce simulated sediment, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) yields by up to 60%. Simulated sediment and P reductions in marginal lands were generally twice that occurring in the nonmarginal lands. The highest unit area reductions of N occurred in the less sloping tile-drained lands. Productivity showed corn grain yield was independent from stover removal, while yields of the two perennial bioenergy crops were similar in the marginal and nonmarginal lands. The results suggest planning for biofuel production in the Corn Belt could include the removal of stover in productive corn areas, and the planting of perennial bioenergy crops in marginal land and in low-sloped tile-drained areas characterized by high N pollution.

Understanding hydrologic responses to crop rotation is critical for developing appropriate crop rotation strategies for sustainable water resources management. These responses are not well understood due to limited availability of multi-year, crop-specific land use-land cover data. The study focuses on the Smoky Hill River watershed in west-central Kansas, a typical agro-ecosystem watershed in the Central Great Plains of the U.S. A multi-year land use dataset developed for the state of Kansas was used to identify 3-year crop rotation patterns in the watershed for three different periods (2006–08, 2008–10, 2010–12). Out of 276 unique rotations, 21 rotations were found to be dominant, with rotation patterns of grain sorghum-fallow-winter wheat (G-F-W), winter wheat-winter wheat-fallow (W-W-F), and continuous winter wheat (W-W-W) occupying more than 81% of the cropland in each rotation period. From 2006 to 2012, the coverage of grain sorghum increased by 26% and corn by 305%, while winter wheat decreased by 20%. Three 11-year simulation scenarios based on three 3-year crop rotation patterns were implemented in the SWAT model and separately calibrated for streamflow at two gauge sites. The SWAT model produced good calibration statistics for the periods corresponding to the applied crop rotations, while the statistics tended to decrease for other periods, with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient becoming unsatisfactory for periods of six to eight years outside of the calibration period. Applying a different number of dominant crop rotations to the SWAT model, it was found that the number can be reduced down to the five most dominant without significant loss in model performance. While the optimum number of crop rotations must be evaluated for each agricultural watershed, this finding provides valuable information for watershed model development and calibration, which can help to avoid issues of over-parameterization and equifinality. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Crop rotations; Land use representability; Model performance; SWAT; Watershed modeling","crop rotation; data set; hydrological modeling; land use change; management practice; parameterization; soil and water assessment tool; sorghum; streamflow; water management; watershed; wheat; Great Plains; Kansas; Smoky Hills; United States; Sorghum bicolor bicolor; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

However, the selection of the most accurate method to estimate MAP can be daunting because there are numerous methods to choose from (e.g., proximate gauge, direct weighted average, surface-fitting, and remotely sensed methods). Multiple methods (n = 19) were used to estimate MAP with precipitation data from 11 distributed monitoring sites, and 4 remotely sensed data sets. Each method was validated against the hydrologic model simulated stream flow using the Soil andWater Assessment Tool (SWAT). SWAT was validated using a split-site method and the observed stream flow data from five nested-scale gauging sites in a mixed-land-use watershed of the central USA. Cross-validation results showed the error associated with surface-fitting and remotely sensed methods ranging from -4.5% to -5.1%, and -9.8% to -14.7%, respectively. Split-site validation results showed the percent bias (PBIAS) values that ranged from -4.5% to -160%. Second order polynomial functions especially overestimated precipitation and subsequent stream flow simulations (PBIAS = -160) in the headwaters. The results indicated that using an inverse-distance weighted, linear polynomial interpolation or multiquadric function method to estimate MAP may improve SWAT model simulations.

Given the interconnectedness between freshwater availability and many ecosystem services, including food provisioning, it is important to evaluate the drought implications on freshwater provisioning and food provisioning services. Studies about drought implications on streamflow, nutrient loads, and crop yields have been increased and these variables are all process-based model outputs that could represent ecosystem functions that contribute to the ecosystem services. However, few studies evaluate drought effects on ecosystem services such as freshwater and food provisioning and quantify these services using an index-based ecosystem service approach. In this study, the drought implications on freshwater and food provisioning services were evaluated for 14 four-digit HUC (Hydrological Unit Codes) subbasins in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB), using three drought indices: standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized soil water content index (SSWI), and standardized streamflow index (SSI). The results showed that the seasonal freshwater provisioning was highly affected by the precipitation deficits and/or surpluses in summer and autumn. A greater importance of hydrological drought than meteorological drought implications on freshwater provisioning was evident for the majority of the subbasins, as evidenced by higher correlations between freshwater provisioning and SSI12 than SPI12. Food provisioning was substantially affected by the precipitation and soil water deficits during summer and early autumn, with relatively less effect observed in winter. A greater importance of agricultural drought effects on food provisioning was evident for most of the subbasins during crop reproductive stages. Results from this study may provide insights to help make effective land management decisions in responding to extreme climate conditions in order to protect and restore freshwater provisioning and food provisioning services in the UMRB. © 2017 by the authors.

The normalize difference vegetation indices (NDVIs) showed highly significant response to N rate in three of four growth-stage-years, but significant water and small N effects at Zadoks 32 (early stem elongation) in 2014. The canopy chlorophyll content index (CCCI), DATT (Datt, 1999), and Meris terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI) were the most consistent VIs in distinguishing N rates, with minimal water effects. No VIs detected water stress with minimal N effect as well as the infrared thermometer (IRT) measurements of canopy temperature did. © 2017 by the American Society of Agronomy.",,,Article,Scopus

To address the need for quantitative estimates of time patterns of tillage practices, this study proposes modeling the time patterns using the Markov chains framework and estimating the probabilities of transition from one tillage-crop combination to another tillage-crop combination from time-ordered spatially aggregated data. We developed a first-order, four-state Markov chain model of tillage-crop dynamics in corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) production systems and estimated the transition probabilities for the state of Iowa using the 1992 to 1997 data collected by the Conservation Technology Information Center. The transition probabilities strongly suggest that the majority of NT acreage is not in continuous but rather in rotational NT, i.e., NT crop production in rotation with conventional or other tillage systems. We find that the probability of two-year continuous NT is 8%, and that 70% of Iowa cropland has never used NT over two consecutive years. When three-year tillage history is considered on corn acreage, 3% is in continuous NT, 62% has never used NT, and the rest of the acreage is in rotational NT. When three-year tillage history is considered on soybean acreage, 4% is in continuous NT, 56% has never used NT, and the rest of the acreage is in rotational NT. The methodology presented is applicable to corn-soybean production systems in other regions and is generalizable to other cropping systems. Regional estimates of the use of rotational and continuous NT are likely to benefit simulation modeling for the assessment of the environmental effects of alternative tillage practices.

This study evaluated crop sub-model parameters of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a widely used, physically based, hydrological model. Baseline SWAT crop parameters were calibrated at the model hydrologic-response-unit-scale using 10 years of replicated field-scale data at one site and validated using 5 years at a second site for corn and grain sorghum, and new parameters were developed and tested for sweet sorghum (bioenergy crop) using 4 years of unreplicated field data. Calibration of crop yields focused on four parameters: lower harvest index (WYSF), harvest index for optimal growing condition (HVSTI), radiation use efficiency (BIO_E), and maximum leaf area index (BLAI). Calibration improved model performance and resulted in slight changes to SWAT default values for four parameters for corn and sorghum. These results provide important preliminary parameters for modeling sweet sorghum in SWAT; both BIO_E and BLAI were greater than default values for grain sorghum. Calibrated parameters improved model performance in validation of corn but not grain sorghum, which was heavily influenced by drought conditions and possibly other management differences at the validation site. Results of this study support use of site-specific, rather than default or off-site, calibration of crop-model parameters to minimize effects on model performance of different soil, water, and nutrient management conditions. Watershed-specific, field-scale crop-yield calibration methods demonstrated in this study are recommended to reduce the plant-growth-related systematic error component of larger-scale hydrological processes (such as streamflow). © 2016","Corn; Crop model; Grain sorghum; Hydrologic modeling; SWAT; Sweet sorghum","Agriculture; Biofuels; Calibration; Grain (agricultural product); Hydrology; Plants (botany); Rain; Soils; Watersheds; Corn; Crop model; Grain sorghum; Hydrologic modeling; SWAT; Sweet sorghum; Crops; accuracy assessment; agricultural management; crop yield; growth rate; hydrological modeling; leaf area index; light use efficiency; maize; model validation; performance assessment; soil management; sorghum; water management; watershed; Sorghum bicolor bicolor; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Soil erosion, a major mechanism of land degradation, removes SOC and transfers it to the hydrosphere or the atmosphere, thereby affecting key ecosystem functions and services. The Mediterranean region is highly susceptible to land degradation because of erosion due to heavy rains following long, dry, hot summers. Although the Mediterranean landscape typically has a high altitude and incline, the soil is brittle and soft and is easily washed away by rain. Thus, vast regions in Turkey have been afflicted by this type of soil degradation. This study aimed to (1) estimate the temporal distribution of water erosion in the Seyhan River Basin, (2) assess the spatial distribution of SOC and (3) estimate the depletion of SOC through soil erosion using the Pan-European Soil Erosion Risk Assessment model, a physically based, regionally scaled soil erosion model. The annual amount of soil eroded from the Seyhan River Basin is estimated to be 7.8million tonnes per hectare (tha-1year-1). The amount of fertile soil loss from agricultural areas is ∼1.2million tonnes per year. The maximum amount of soil erosion occurs in maintenance scrubland and degraded forest areas, contributing to 68% of erosion, followed by that in agricultural land, contributing to 27% of erosion, with the remaining in forests and urban areas. © CSIRO 2017.","Mediterranean environment; PESERA; SOC; soil erosion","Agriculture; Ecology; Ecosystems; Erosion; Forestry; Organic carbon; Rain; Risk assessment; Risk perception; System-on-chip; Watersheds; Mediterranean environment; Mediterranean landscapes; Mediterranean watersheds; PESERA; Soil erosion; Soil erosion modeling; Soil erosion risk assessment; Temporal distribution; Soils; brittle deformation; ecosystem modeling; land degradation; Mediterranean environment; soil carbon; soil fertility; soil organic matter; spatial distribution; temporal distribution; water erosion; watershed; Seyhan Basin; Turkey",Article,Scopus

The MOD09A1 data, which are eight-day interval surface reflectance data, were obtained from day of the year (DOY) 89 to 337 to calculate the leaf area index (LAI). The sum of the LAI from early in the season to a given date in the season (end of DOY (EOD)) was well fitted to a logistic function and represented seasonal changes in leaf area duration (LAD). A simple phenology model was derived to estimate the dates of emergence and maturity using the LAD-logistic function parameters b1 and b2, which represented the rate of increase in LAI and the date of maximum LAI, respectively. The phenology model predicted emergence and maturity dates fairly well, with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 6.3 and 4.9 days for the validation dataset, respectively. Two simple linear regression models (YP and YF) were established using LAD as the variable to predict corn yield. The yield model YP used LAD from predicted emergence to maturity, and the yield model Yf used LAD for a predetermined period from DOY 89 to a particular EOD. When state/province corn yields for the validation dataset were predicted at DOY 321, near completion of the corn harvest, the YP model, including the predicted phenology, performed much better than the Yf model, with RMSE values of 0.68 t/ha and 0.66 t/ha for Illinois and Heilongjiang, respectively. The Yp model showed similar or better performance, even for the much earlier pre-harvest yield prediction at DOY 257. In addition, the model performance showed no difference between the two study regions with very different climates and cultivation methods, including cultivar and irrigation management. These results suggested that the approach described in this paper has potential for application to relatively wide agroclimatic regions with different cultivation methods and for extension to the other crops. However, it needs to be examined further in tropical and sub-tropical regions, which are very different from the two study regions with respect to agroclimatic constraints and agrotechnologies. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","LAD; Logistic function; MODIS; Phenology; Yield","Biology; Crops; Cultivation; Forecasting; Image reconstruction; Mean square error; Radiometers; Regression analysis; Satellite imagery; Irrigation management; Logistic functions; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer datum; MODIS; Phenology; Root mean square errors; Simple linear regression; Yield; Climate models",Article,Scopus

This can help alleviate food insecurity and the economical sustainability of farming at large. For this purpose, seasonal climate forecasts are used to generate crop forecasts. This study assesses two methods for linking seasonal climate forecasts with crop models to improve crop yield predictability in the Iberian Peninsula (IP). Crop models usually require daily weather data and therefore, we tested two methods to disaggregate seasonal climate forecasts into daily weather realizations: (1) a conditional stochastic weather generator (predictWTD) and (2) a simple forecast probability resampler (FResampler1).These methods were evaluated under three seasonal rainfall forecasts by analyzing the impacts on rainfed wheat yield and on irrigation requirements and yields of maize crop. In addition, we estimated the gross margins (€ ha− 1) and the production risks associated with contrasting scenarios of seasonal rainfall forecasts (dry and wet). Both methods provided comparable predictability and therefore, both seem feasible options for using seasonal forecasts to establish yield forecasts and irrigation requirements. The large impact of crop prices and of irrigation cost on gross margins for both crops suggests that using a combination of information on expected market prices and crop forecast based on seasonal climate forecasts can be an effective tool for farmer's decision-making, especially under dry forecast situation and/or in locations with low annual precipitation. These methods can help to quantify the benefits and risks from the seasonal weather forecasts to farmers in the IP. The anticipation of risks and the opportunity that skillful climate and crop forecast provide allows for windows of opportunity to prepare and pre-empt mitigating actions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Crop forecasts; Crop model; Iberian Peninsula; Maize; Stochastic weather generators; Wheat","agricultural market; agricultural modeling; agrometeorology; climate prediction; crop yield; cropping practice; decision making; irrigation system; maize; seasonal variation; sustainability; weather forecasting; wheat; Iberian Peninsula; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Maximum precipitation occurs over the Himalaya region, which is important for water resources and agriculture sectors over the region and also for the economy of the country. Therefore, in the present global warming era, the realistic prediction of winter precipitation over India is important for planning and implementing agriculture and water management strategies. The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) issued the operational prediction of climatic variables in monthly to seasonal scale since 2004 using their first version of fully coupled global climate model known as Climate Forecast System (CFSv1). In 2011, a new version of CFS (CFSv2) was introduced with the incorporation of significant changes in older version of CFS (CFSv1). The new version of CFS is required to compare in detail with the older version in the context of simulating the winter precipitation over India. Therefore, the current study presents a detailed analysis on the performance of CFSv2 as compared to CFSv1 for the winter precipitation over India. The hindcast runs of both CFS versions from 1982 to 2008 with November initial conditions are used and the model’s precipitation is evaluated with that of India Meteorological Department (IMD). The models simulated wind and geopotential height against the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP–NCAR) reanalysis-2 (NNRP2) and remote response patterns of SST against Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperatures version 3b (ERSSTv3b) are examined for the same period. The analyses of winter precipitation revealed that both the models are able to replicate the patterns of observed climatology; interannual variability and coefficient of variation. However, the magnitude is lesser than IMD observation that can be attributed to the model’s inability to simulate the observed remote response of sea surface temperatures to all India winter precipitation. Of the two, CFSv1 is appreciable in capturing year-to-year variations in observed winter precipitation while CFSv2 failed in simulating the same. CFSv1 has accounted for less mean bias and RMSE errors along with good correlations and index of agreements than CFSv2 for predicting winter precipitation over India. In addition, the CFSv1 is also having a high probability of detection in predicting different categories (normal, excess and deficit) of observed winter precipitation over India. © 2015, Springer International Publishing.","Climate forecast system; extremes; Indian region; remote response; seasonal prediction; winter precipitation","Agriculture; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Climatology; Forecasting; Global warming; Oceanography; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Water management; Water resources; Climate forecasts; extremes; Indian region; Remote response; Seasonal prediction; Winter precipitation; Climate models; climate modeling; climate prediction; extreme event; performance assessment; precipitation (climatology); winter; India",Article,Scopus

Two runs were performed using the standard version of RegCM4 and the modified one of the same model taking into account the incorporated forest. The reforestation significantly modifies rainfall signal over West Africa by increasing it over the reforested zone and the Fouta Jallon highlands (FJH). This rainfall increase is associated with a strengthening of the atmospheric moisture over the reforested area. This atmospheric moisture content increase associated with the wind dynamic may explain the spatiotemporal change of the rainfall and extreme precipitation events. The analysis of the impacts of the reforestation on some rainfall indices shows an increase of the 90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles over the reforested zone and off the FJH.

The CWSI varied diurnally with peaks appeared at noon, and soil water deficit led to higher CWSI values during noon. Transpiration rate (Tr), stomatal conductance (gs) and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) were high at low CWSI, and reduced with increasing CWSI. The relationship between CWSI and Pn, Tr or gs at noon was described by quadratic polynomial equations. At critical noon, CWSI values for the decline trend in Pn (0.303, 0.385 and 0.446 at tillering, panicle initiation to booting, milk to soft dough stage) were higher than for decline in Tr and gs. Assuming a 5% reduction in Pn from maximum is moderate water deficit, the critical CWSI values were 0.420, 0.472 and 0.536 at tillering, panicle initiation to booting and milk to soft dough stages. CWSI at 14:00 decreased significantly with increasing relative soil moisture contents. There was a slight difference between the linear relations under different vapor pressure deficit (VPD) conditions. The critical relative soil moisture contents for a 5% reduction in Pn were 1.57%, 1.18% and 1.27% higher under high VPD than low VPD conditions.

Developing, calibrating and validating these models require a number of critical decisions that will influence the ability of the model to represent real world conditions. Understanding how these decisions influence model performance is crucial, especially when making science-based policy decisions. This study used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in West Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) to examine the influence of several of these decisions on hydrological processes and streamflow simulations. Specifically, this study addressed the following objectives (1) demonstrate the importance of considering intra-watershed processes during model development, (2) compare and evaluated spatial calibration versus calibration at outlet and (3) evaluate parameter transfers across temporal and spatial scales. A coarser resolution (HUC-12) model and a finer resolution model (NHDPlus model) were used to support the objectives. Results showed that knowledge of watershed characteristics and intra-watershed processes are critical to produced accurate and realistic hydrologic simulations. The spatial calibration strategy produced better results compared to outlet calibration strategy and provided more confidence. Transferring parameter values across spatial scales (i.e. from coarser resolution model to finer resolution model) needs additional fine tuning to produce realistic results. Transferring parameters across temporal scales (i.e. from monthly to yearly and daily time-steps) performed well with a similar spatial resolution model.

Thus, advance and accurate information on weather variables, and their quantitative relations to the crop processes (agro-weather informatics) as well as quantification of role of climate conditions in agricultural processes (agro-climate informatics) can play critical to enabling roles in sustainable and smart (optimal in terms of planning, resource utilization and adaptability) agriculture. In particular, agro-weather-climate informatics have scopes and challenges including but beyond those in agriculture or weather informatics in isolation. This review examines principles and the scope of applications of weather and climate informatics in some of the key areas of agriculture such as crop choice, irrigation, energy management and long-term sustainability. While a serious bottleneck in application of forecast-based agro-advisories is low reliability of the forecasts, methodology combining optimization of forecast model, assimilation of data, multi-scale modelling and design of evaluation strategy for specific farm advisories is possible, so that the forecasts are risk-free and yet useful in spite of their errors. We provide a brief overview of weather and climate forecasting at different scales and the general methodology used; this is followed by an overview of status of these applications at different timescales such as daily, seasonal and beyond for a variety of issues such as precision agriculture and pro-active control of crop diseases.

Many studies have been devoted to addressing this issue. The similarity regionalization approach, a commonly used strategy, is usually limited by subjective selection of similarity measures. This paper presents an application of a partitioned update scheme based on the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to reduce the prediction uncertainties. This scheme performs real-time updating for states and parameters of a distributed hydrological model by assimilating gauged streamflow. The streamflow predictions are constrained by the physical rainfall-runoff processes defined in the distributed hydrological model and by the correlation information transferred from gauged to ungauged basins. This scheme is successfully demonstrated in a nested basin with real-world hydrological data where the subbasins have immediate upstream and downstream neighbours. The results suggest that the assimilated observed data from downstream neighbours have more important roles in reducing the streamflow prediction errors at ungauged locations. The real-time updated model parameters remain stable with reasonable spreads after short-period assimilation, while their estimation trajectories have slow variations, which may be attributable to climate and land surface changes. Although this real-time updating scheme is intended for streamflow predictions in nested basins, it can be a valuable tool in separate basins to improve hydrological predictions by assimilating multi-source data sets, including ground-based and remote-sensing observations. © 2014 Author(s).",,"Real-time updating; State parameter estimation; Streamflow prediction; data set; Kalman filter; parameterization; prediction; rainfall-runoff modeling; real time; streamflow",Article,Scopus

Despite the availability of the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) which provides remotely sensed data on crop type in the US on an annual basis, crop rotation patterns remain poorly mapped due to the lack of tools that allow for consistent and efficient analysis of multi-year CDLs. This study presents the Representative Crop Rotations Using Edit Distance (RECRUIT) algorithm, implemented as a Python software package, to select representative crop rotations by combining and analyzing multi-year CDLs. Using CDLs from 2010 to 2012 for 5 states in the US Midwest, we demonstrate the performance and parameter sensitivity of RECRUIT in selecting representative crop rotations that preserve crop area and capture land-use changes. Selecting only 82 representative crop rotations accounted for over 90% of the spatio-temporal variability of the more than 13,000 rotations obtained from combining the multi-year CDLs. Furthermore, the accuracy of the crop rotation product compared favorably with total state-wide planted crop area available from agricultural census data.

This may be partly compensated by adapted crop management, increased CO2 concentration and technological development. For food security, changes in regional to continental crop yield variability may be more important than changes in mean yields. The assessment of changes in regional and larger scale crop variability requires high resolution and spatially consistent future weather, matching a specific climate scenario. Such data could be derived from regional climate models (RCMs), which provide changes in weather patterns. In general, RCM output is heavily biased with respect to observations. Due to the strong nonlinear relation between meteorological input and crop yields, the application of this biased output may result in large biases in the simulated crop yield changes. The use of RCM output only makes sense after sufficient bias correction. This study explores how RCM output can be bias corrected for the assessment of changes in European and subregional scale crop yield variability due to climate change. For this, output of the RCM RACMO of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute was bias corrected and applied within the crop simulation model WOrld FOod STudies to simulate potential and water limited yields of three divergent crops: winter wheat, maize and sugar beets. The bias correction appeared necessary to successfully reproduce the mean yields as simulated with observational data. It also substantially improved the year-to-year variability of seasonal precipitation and radiation within RACMO, but some bias in the interannual variability remained. This is caused by the fact that the applied correction focuses on mean and daily variability. The interannual variability of growing season length, and as a consequence the potential yields too, appeared even deteriorated. Projected decrease in mean crop yields is well in line with earlier studies. No significant change in crop yield variability was found. Yet, only one RCM is analysed in this study, and it is recommended to extend this study with more climate models and a slightly adjusted bias correction taking into account the variability of larger time scales as well. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bias correction; CGMS; Climate change; Crop yields; Interannual variability; RACMO; Spatial coherence",,Article,Scopus

Two primary causes are identified: 1) more extreme and earlier storms and 2) warming temperatures that shift precipitation from snow to rain dominance over regional terrain. The simulations also show a wide range of uncertainty among different basins stemming from localized storm characteristics. While previous research using statistical downscaling suggests that many areas in the Pacific Northwest are likely to experience substantial increases in flooding in response to global climate change, these initial estimates do not adequately represent the effects of changes in heavy precipitation. Unlike statistical downscaling techniques applied to global climate model scenarios, the regional model provides an explicit, physically based simulation of the seasonality, size, location, and intensity of historical and future extreme storms, including atmospheric rivers. This paper presents climate projections from the ECHAM5/Max Planck Institute Ocean Model (MPI-OM) global climate model dynamically downscaled using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model implemented at 12-km resolution for the period 1970-2069.

In this study, the Revised SWAT model was used to evaluate the sensitivity and long-term effects of different nitrogen (N) application rates and tile drain spacing (SDRAIN) and depths (DDRAIN) on nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) losses through tile drains. Monitoring data for the 1983-1996 period measured on three experimental plots on a poorly drained Webster clay loam soil (fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Endoaquoll) in southern Minnesota was used. Sensitivity analysis covered the 1983-1996 period and long-term simulations were made for the 1915-1996 period. Sensitivity analysis showed a decrease in tile flow as DDRAIN decreased and/or SDRAIN increased. The predicted NO3-N losses in tile drain decreased by 16% (from 33.8 to 28.4kgha-1) and 14% (from 34.0 to 29.4kgha-1) when SDRAIN was increased by 122% (from 27 to 60m) and 40% (from 1.5 to 0.9m), respectively. However, NO3-N losses were decreased by 67% (from 33.8 to 11.1kgha-1) when N application rate was decreased by 50% (from 200 to 100kgha-1). Long-term simulations results indicated that much greater reductions in NO3-N losses can be achieved with reduction in the N application rates than with changing the tile drain spacing and depth. Reductions in NO3-N losses were consistent with the results reported using the Agricultural Drainage and Pesticide Transport (ADAPT) model, which was developed specifically for understanding effects of tile drainage on water quality in the Upper Midwest U.S. Overall, results from sensitivity analysis and long term simulation indicated that Revised SWAT can be used to adequately evaluate the effects of tile drain configurations on drainage and associated NO3-N losses. © 2013.","ADAPT; Drain depth; Drain spacing; Subsurface drainage","ADAPT; Agricultural drainage; Drain depth; Drain spacings; Fertilizer applications; Soil and water assessment tool; Soil moisture retentions; Subsurface drainages; Computer simulation; Cultivation; Groundwater flow; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Rain; Sensitivity analysis; Soil moisture; Water quality; Reduction; algorithm; experimental study; fertilizer application; leaching; nitrate; nitrogen; sensitivity analysis; simulation; soil management; soil moisture; tile drain; Minnesota; United States",Article,Scopus

All RCMs, except HIRHAM, replicate reasonably well the interannual rainfall anomalies over the Sahel in both sign and magnitude.

Here we describe and demonstrate multiple methods for 'calibrating' climate projections using an ensemble of AOGCM simulations in a 'perfect sibling' framework. Crucially, this type of analysis assesses the ability of each calibration methodology to produce reliable estimates of future climate, which is not possible just using historical observations. This type of approach could be more widely adopted for assessing calibration methodologies for crop modelling. The calibration methods assessed include the commonly used 'delta' (change factor) and 'nudging' (bias correction) approaches. We focus on daily maximum temperature in summer over Europe for this idealised case study, but the methods can be generalised to other variables and other regions. The calibration methods, which are relatively easy to implement given appropriate observations, produce more robust projections of future daily maximum temperatures and heat stress than using raw model output. The choice over which calibration method to use will likely depend on the situation, but change factor approaches tend to perform best in our examples. Finally, we demonstrate that the uncertainty due to the choice of calibration methodology is a significant contributor to the total uncertainty in future climate projections for impact studies.

Therefore, it is significant to understand the processes of soil erosion and sediment transport along rivers, and this can help identify the erosion prone areas and find potential measures to alleviate the environmental effects. In this study, we investigated soil erosion and identified the most seriously eroded areas in the East River Basin in southern China using a physically-based model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). We also introduced a classical sediment transport method (Zhang) into SWAT and compared it with the built-in Bagnold method in simulating sediment transport process along the river. The derived spatial soil erosion map and land use based erosion levels can explicitly illustrate the identification and prioritization of the critical soil erosion areas in this basin. Our results also indicate that erosion is quite sensitive to soil properties and slope. Comparison of Bagnold and Zhang methods shows that the latter can give an overall better performance especially in tracking the peak and low sediment concentrations along the river. We also found that the East River is mainly characterized by sediment deposition in most of the segments and at most times of a year.

DRAINMOD-NII, a carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) simulation model, was field tested for the high organic matter Drummer soil in Indiana and used to predict the effects of fertilizer application rate and drainage water management (DWM) on NO 3-N losses through subsurface drainage. The model was calibrated and validated for continuous corn (Zea mays L.) (CC) and corn-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] (CS) rotation treatments separately using 7 yr of drain flow and NO 3-N concentration data. Among the treatments, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of the monthly NO 3-N loss predictions ranged from 0.30 to 0.86, and the percent error varied from -19 to 9%. The medians of the observed and predicted monthly NO 3-N losses were not significantly different. When the fertilizer application rate was reduced ~20%, the predicted NO 3-N losses in drain flow from the CC treatments was reduced 17% (95% confidence interval [CI], 11-25), while losses from the CS treatment were reduced by 10% (95% CI, 1-15). With DWM, the predicted average annual drain flow was reduced by about 56% (95% CI, 49-67), while the average annual NO 3-N losses through drain flow were reduced by about 46% (95% CI, 32-57) for both tested crop rotations. However, the simulated NO 3-N losses in surface runoffincreased by about 3 to 4 kg ha-1 with DWM. For the simulated conditions at the study site, implementing DWM along with reduced fertilizer application rates would be the best strategy to achieve the highest NO 3-N loss reductions to surface water. The suggested best strategies would reduce the NO 3-N losses to surface water by 38% (95% CI, 29-46) for the CC treatments and by 32% (95% CI, 23-40) for the CS treatments. © 2012 by the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.",,"A-carbon; Agricultural land; Concentration data; Confidence interval; Corn (Zea mays L.); Crop rotation; Deleterious effects; Drain flow; Drainage water management; Fertilizer applications; Glycine max; High organic; Hypoxic condition; Indiana; Loss prediction; Loss reduction; Nitrate nitrogen; Northern Gulf of Mexico; Nutrient balance; Observed data; Simulation model; Study sites; Subsurface drainage system; Subsurface drainages; Water quality models; Agriculture; Amino acids; Computer simulation; Drainage; Groundwater flow; Natural water geochemistry; Nickel compounds; Nitrogen fixation; Quality assurance; Surface waters; Wastewater disposal; Water management; Water quality; Nitrogen fertilizers; carbon; fertilizer; nitrate; nitrogen; organic matter; article; model; simulation; water flow; water management; water quality; water supply; chemistry; computer simulation; environmental monitoring; maize; soil; soybean; theoretical model; water flow; water pollutant; Glycine max; Zea mays; Computer Simulation; Environmental Monitoring; Fertilizers; Models, Theoretical; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Soil; Soybeans; Water Movements; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

We evaluated the model using ten years (1996-2005) of measured data from a subsurface-drained, corn-soybean agricultural system near Story City, Iowa. Nitrogen fertilizer was applied to plots at low, medium, and high rates (57 to 67 kg N ha -1,114 to 135 kg N ha -1, and 172 to 202 kg N ha -1, respectively) during corn years, and nitrate (NO 3) losses from subsurface drains under each plot were monitored biweekly for ten years. Average annual simulated and measured NO 3 losses in drainage water were 21.9 and 20.1 kgN ha -1 for the lowN rate, 26.6 and26.5 kgN ha -1 for the medium N rate, and 36.6 and 37.0 kgN ha -1 for the high N rate, respectively. The model efficiency statistics for DRAINMOD-N II simulations of annual subsurface drain NO 3 losses were 0.89, 0.95, and 0.94 for the low, medium, and high N rates, respectively. For the same experimental dataset, a comparison of DRAINMOD-N II simulations to that of another model that simulates hydrologic and N dynamics of agricultural systems, the RZWQM-DSSAT hybrid model, demonstrated that the two models were most different in their simulations of soybean N fixation, plant N uptake, and net N mineralization. Future field investigations should focus on generating better understandings of these processes. The results suggest that DRAINMOD-N II can reasonably simulate the effects of different corn-year N rates on losses of NO 3 through subsurface drainage lines and that simulations of subsurface drainage NO 3 losses by DRAINMOD-N II are comparable to that of RZWQM-DSSAT.","DRAINMOD; DRAINMOD-NII; DSSAT; Management; Nitrogen; RZWQM; Simulation; Subsurface drainage","DRAINMOD; DRAINMOD-NII; DSSAT; RZWQM; Simulation; Subsurface drainage; Drainage; Groundwater flow; Natural water geochemistry; Nickel compounds; Nitrogen; Simulators; Wastewater disposal; Nitrogen fertilizers; agricultural technology; comparative study; computer simulation; drainage water; farming system; fertilizer application; hydrological modeling; mineralization; model test; nitrate; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen fixation; nutrient dynamics; nutrient uptake; soybean; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

This was further used to differentiate between growth characteristics for an irrigated intensive agriculture over a northern India state (e.g. Punjab) and a rainfed ill-posed agriculture over a central India state (e.g. Madhya Pradesh) using time-series data sets for five growing years (June-April): 1996-1997, 1997-1998, 1998-1999, 1999-2000, and 2000-2001. The triangular scatter between RET and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showed that the minimum RET increases linearly with NDVI producing a 'basal line' that represents relative canopy transpiration only. A clear distinction in scatter was found between the two contrasting agro-ecosystems showing a higher RET or root zone wetness in irrigated than rainfed systems. In rainfed rice-growing regions, an inverse correlation (0.6-0.75) was found between RET and the Keetch-Byram meteorological drought index (KBDI), and a substantial reduction in RET was also found in a sub-normal (2000) compared with a normal (1999) monsoon season. RET estimates were found to be most sensitive to atmospheric transmissivity followed by other land-surface radiation budget inputs, such as NDVI, LST, and albedo. Error propagation due to three surface parameters is the opposite of that for transmissivity. The maximum possible error in clear-sky NOAA PAL RET was estimated to be 12-15%. This test study would be helpful in deriving RET using optical and thermal data from a suite of current and future Indian geostationary satellite sensors for monitoring growing conditions.",,"Agriculture; Budget control; Geostationary satellites; Atmospheric transmissivity; Canopy transpirations; Growing conditions; Growth characteristic; Inverse correlation; Meteorological drought; Normalized difference vegetation index; Substantial reduction; Evapotranspiration; data set; energy balance; error analysis; estimation method; evapotranspiration; NOAA satellite; radiation budget; satellite sensor; time series; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia",Article,Scopus

Average and extreme temperature and precipitation characteristics from 3 stations in the regions were organized into annual, growing season, and phenological growth stage periods and used to assess potential impacts on vineyard and wine quality, and changes in varietal suitability. Results show an overall growing season warming of 1.0 to 2.2°C, with significant increases in heat accumulation indices that are driven mostly by increases in maximum temperature (average Tmax, number of days with Tmax > 90th percentile, and number of days with Tmax > 30°C). Changes in many temperature parameters show moderate to strong relationships with vine and wine parameters in the 3 regions, including earlier phenological events concomitant with warmer growing seasons, higher wine quality with higher ripening diurnal temperature ranges, and reduced production in the warmest vintages. While trends in annual and growing season precipitation were not evident, precipitation during the bloom to véraison period declined significantly for all 3 sites, indicating potential soil moisture stress during this critical growth stage. Shorter-term analysis of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) reveals that the current impact per 1°C of growing season (Apr to Oct) warming is an increase in water demands in the region by 6 to 14 %. These observations, combined with climate projections, indicate potential disruption of climate-variety balance, increasing water stress, and challenges in producing quality wines without the adoption of appropriate adaptive measures. © Inter-Research 2008..","Bioclimatic indices; Climate change; Precipitation; Temperature; Wine; Winegrapes","Forestry; Groundwater; Soil moisture; Water analysis; Water supply; Wine; Bioclimatic indices; Climate parameters; Climate projection; Critical growth; Crop evapotranspiration; Diurnal temperature ranges; Extreme temperatures; Growing season; Growth stages; Heat accumulation; Maximum temperature; Northeast Spain; Potential impacts; Precipitation; Precipitation characteristics; Reduced production; Temperature parameters; Term analysis; Water demand; Water stress; Wine quality; Winegrapes; Climate change; bioclimatology; climate change; climate effect; crop production; evapotranspiration; growing season; phenology; precipitation intensity; soil moisture; temperature effect; vine; warming; water demand; water stress; Eurasia; Europe; Southern Europe; Spain; Vitaceae; Vitis vinifera",Article,Scopus

In this study, a high-resolution portable spectral sensor was used to investigate the feasibility of detecting multi-diseased tomato leaves in different stages, including early or asymptomatic stages. One healthy leaf and three diseased tomato leaves (late blight, target and bacterial spots) were defined into four stages (healthy, asymptomatic, early stage and late stage) and collected from a field. Fifty-seven spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) were calculated in accordance with methods published in previous studies and established in this study. Principal component analysis was conducted to evaluate SVIs. Results revealed six principal components (PCs) whose eigenvalues were greater than 1. SVIs with weight coefficients ranking from 1 to 30 in each selected PC were applied to a K-nearest neighbour for classification. Amongst the examined leaves, the healthy ones had the highest accuracy (100%) and the lowest error rate (0) because of their uniform tissues. Late stage leaves could be distinguished more easily than the two other disease categories caused by similar symptoms on the multi-diseased leaves. Further work may incorporate the proposed technique into an image system that can be operated to monitor multi-diseased tomato plants in fields. © 2018, The Author(s).",,"metabolism; microbiology; plant disease; plant leaf; principal component analysis; procedures; spectroscopy; tomato; Lycopersicon esculentum; Plant Diseases; Plant Leaves; Principal Component Analysis; Spectrum Analysis",Article,Scopus

However, preprocessing of critical data such as soils information can be laborious and time-consuming. The objective of this work was to preprocess the Soil Landscapes of Canada (SLC) database to offer a country-level soils dataset in a format ready to be used in SWAT simulations. A twolevel screening process was used to identify critical information required by SWAT and to remove records with information that could not be calculated or estimated. Out of the 14 063 unique soil records in the SLC, 11 838 records with complete information were included in the dataset presented here. Important variables for SWAT simulations that are not reported in the SLC database (e.g., hydrologic soils groups (HSGs) and erodibility factor (K)) were calculated from information contained within the SLC database. These calculations, in fact, represent a major contribution to enabling the present dataset to be used for hydrological simulations in Canada using SWAT and other comparable models. Analysis of those variables indicated that 21.3 %, 24.6 %, 39.0 %, and 15.1% of the soil records in Canada belong to HSGs 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. This suggests that almost twothirds of the soil records have a high (i.e., HSG 4) or relatively high (i.e., HSG 3) runoff generation potential. A spatial analysis indicated that 20.0 %, 26.8 %, 36.7 %, and 16.5% of soil records belonged to HSG 1, HSG 2, HSG 3, and HSG 4, respectively. Erosion potential, which is inherently linked to the erodibility factor (K), was associated with runoff potential in important agricultural areas such as southern Ontario and Nova Scotia. However, contrary to initial expectations, low or moderate erosion potential was found in areas with high runoff potential, such as regions in southern Manitoba (e.g., Red River Valley) and British Columbia (e.g., Peace River watershed).

One way to cope with future changes in absolute as well as seasonal (irrigation) water amounts can be the adaptation of the agricultural crop pattern in a region, i.e. by planting crops which still provide high yields and so economic benefits to farmers under such varying climate conditions. To do this properly, the whole cascade starting from climate change, effects on hydrology and surface water availability, subsequent effects on crop yield, agricultural areas available, and, finally, economic value of a multi-crop cultivation pattern must be known. To that avail, a complex coupled simulation-optimization tool SWAT-LINGO-MODSIM-PSO (SLMP) has been developed here and used to find the future optimum cultivation area of crops for the maximization of the economic benefits in five irrigation-fed agricultural plains in the south of the Karkheh River Basin (KRB) southwest Iran. Starting with the SWAT distributed hydrological model, the KR-streamflow as well as the inflow into the Karkheh-reservoir, as the major storage of irrigation water, is calibrated and validated, based on 1985–2004 observed discharge data. In the subsequent step, the SWAT-predicted streamflow is fed into the MODSIM river basin Decision Support System to simulate and optimize the water allocation between different water users (agricultural, environmental, municipal and industrial) under standard operating policy (SOP) rules. The final step is the maximization of the economic benefit in the five agricultural plains through constrained PSO (particle swarm optimization) by adjusting the cultivation areas (decision variables) of different crops (wheat, barley, maize and “others”), taking into account their specific prizes and optimal crop yields under water deficiency, with the latter computed in the LINGO-sub-optimization module embedded in the SLMP-tool. For the optimization of the agricultural benefits in the KRB in the near future (2038–2060), quantile-mapping (QM) bias-corrected downscaled predictors for daily precipitation and temperatures of the HadGEM2-ES GCM-model under RCP4.5- and RCP8.5-emission scenarios are used as climate drivers in the streamflow- and crop yield simulations of the SWAT-model, leading to corresponding changes in the final outcome (economic benefit) of the SLMP-tool. In fact, whereas for the historical period (1985–2004) a total annual benefit of 94.2 million US$ for all multi-crop areas in KRB is computed, there is a decrease to 88.3 million US$ and 72.1 million US$ for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, in the near future (2038–2060) prediction period. In fact, this future income decrease is due to a substantial shift from cultivation areas devoted nowadays to high-price wheat and barley in the winter season to low-price maize-covered areas in the future summers, owing to a future seasonal change of SWAT-predicted irrigation water available, i.e. less in the winter and more in the summer. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural benefit; Climate change; Karkheh basin, Iran; Optimization; SWAT-LINGO-MODSIM-PSO","Artificial intelligence; Climate models; Constrained optimization; Crops; Cultivation; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Irrigation; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Reservoirs (water); Rivers; Stream flow; Water; Water management; Watersheds; Agricultural benefit; Crop yield simulations; Daily precipitations; Distributed hydrological model; Karkheh basin, Iran; Multi-crop planning; PSO(particle swarm optimization); SWAT-LINGO-MODSIM-PSO; Climate change; surface water; agricultural management; climate change; climate effect; computer simulation; crop yield; decision support system; future prospect; numerical model; optimization; planning process; Article; barley; calibration; climate change; crop; crop management; environmental impact; environmental policy; environmental temperature; harvest; hydrology; Iran; irrigation (agriculture); maize; nonhuman; precipitation; prediction; priority journal; process optimization; river basin; seasonal variation; simulation; species cultivation; water availability; water management; water supply; wheat; agriculture; procedures; remote sensing; river; season; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; Iran; Karkheh Basin; Khuzestan; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; Agricultural Irrigation; Agriculture; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Hydrology; Iran; Models, Theoretical; Remote Sensing Technology; Rivers; Seasons; Water Supply",Article,Scopus

Native land cover based on soil characteristics was used to simulate pre-development loading regimes using The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Loading targets were calculated for each major element of a pre-development loading regime. Simulated pre-development conditions were associated with increased retention and decreased export of sediment and nutrients when compared to observed developed conditions. Differences between simulated pre-development and observed developed maximum daily yields (loads per unit area) of suspended sediment (SS), total phosphorus (TP), and total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) ranged from 35.7 to 59.6 Mg km-2 (SS); 23.3 to 52.5 kg km-2 (TP); and, 113.2 to 200.8 kg km-2 (TIN), respectively.

Hydrologic modeling results indicated that the differences in annual maximum daily load were causally linked to land use and land cover influence on sediment and nutrient loading. The differences between SWAT simulated pre-development and observed contemporary loading regimes from this study point to a need for practical loading targets that support contemporary management and integrated flow and pollutant loading regimes. © 2018 by the authors.","Ecohydrology; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Pre-settlement; Sediment; SWAT",,Article,Scopus

Spatially explicit crop-type information can be used to estimate crop areas for a variety of monitoring and decision-making applications such as crop insurance, land rental, supply-chain logistics, and financial market forecasting. However, there is no publically available spatially explicit in-season crop-type classification information for the U.S. Corn Belt (a landscape predominated by corn and soybean). Instead, researchers and decision-makers have to wait until four to six months after harvest to have such information from the previous year. The state-of-the-art research on crop-type classification has been shifted from relying on only spectral features of single static images to combining together spectral and time-series information. While Landsat data have a desirable spatial resolution for field-level crop-type classification, the ability to extract temporal phenology information based on Landsat data remains a challenge due to low temporal revisiting frequency and inevitable cloud contamination. To address this challenge and generate accurate, cost-effective, and in-season crop-type classification, this research uses the USDA's Common Land Units (CLUs) to aggregate spectral information for each field based on a time-series Landsat image data stack to largely overcome the cloud contamination issue while exploiting a machine learning model based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) and high-performance computing for intelligent and scalable computation of classification processes. Experiments were designed to evaluate what information is most useful for training the machine learning model for crop-type classification, and how various spatial and temporal factors affect the crop-type classification performance in order to derive timely crop type information. All experiments were conducted over Champaign County located in central Illinois, and a total of 1322 Landsat multi-temporal scenes including all the six optical spectral bands spanning from 2000 to 2015 were used. Computational experiments show the inclusion of temporal phenology information and evenly distributed spatial training samples in the study domain improves classification performance. The shortwave infrared bands show notably better performance than the widely used visible and near-infrared bands for classifying corn and soybean. In comparison with USDA's Crop Data Layer (CDL), this study found a relatively high Overall Accuracy (i.e. the number of the corrected classified fields divided by the number of the total fields) of 96% for classifying corn and soybean across all CLU fields in the Champaign County from 2000 to 2015. Furthermore, our approach achieved 95% Overall Accuracy by late July of the concurrent year for classifying corn and soybean. The findings suggest the methodology presented in this paper is promising for accurate, cost-effective, and in-season classification of field-level crop types, which may be scaled up to large geographic extents such as the U.S. Corn Belt. © 2018","Crop type classification; Deep Neural Network (DNN); Machine learning; Phenology; Remote sensing","Artificial intelligence; Biology; Cost effectiveness; Crops; Decision making; Deep neural networks; Distributed computer systems; Electronic trading; Infrared devices; Learning systems; Remote sensing; Supply chains; Time series; Classification performance; Computational experiment; Crop type classification; High performance computing; Machine learning approaches; Phenology; Time series informations; Visible and near infrared; Classification (of information); accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; classification; crop performance; decision making; field method; Landsat; machine learning; methodology; phenology; satellite data; satellite imagery; time series analysis; vegetation classification; Corn Belt; United States; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Crop type mapping using RS at various temporal and spatial resolutions plays an important role spanning from environmental to economical. The main objective of the current study was to evaluate the significance of optical data in a multi-temporal crop type classification-based on very high spatial resolution and high spatial resolution imagery. With this aim, three images from WorldView-3 and Sentinel-2 were acquired over Coalville (UK) between April and July 2016. Three vegetation indices (VIs); the normalized difference vegetation index, the green normalized difference vegetation index and soil adjusted vegetation index were generated using red, green and near-infrared spectral bands; then a supervised classification was performed using ground reference data collected from field surveys, Random forest (RF) and decision tree (DT) classification algorithms. Accuracy assessment was undertaken by comparing the classified output with the reference data. An overall accuracy of 91% and κ coefficient of 0·90 were estimated using the combination of RF and DT classification algorithms. Therefore, it can be concluded that integrating very high- and high-resolution imagery with different VIs can be implemented effectively to produce large-scale crop maps even with a limited temporal-dataset.

In this study, we combined 1433 AGB field measurements and remotely sensed data with the goal of establishing a suitable model for estimating grassland AGB in the Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR) of China, which is one of the most sensitive regions to the warming climate. A back-propagation artificial neural network (BP ANN) was used to select the variables that contribute the most to the model's estimation of AGB, and then we built the model. Out of 13 variables, 5 variables were selected to build the BP ANN model, and we used cross validation for the accuracy assessment. The results show that: (1) the modeled mean AGB (2001–2016) provides a reasonable spatial distribution that is similar to the field measurements but reveals more details and has better spatial coverage than the limited field measurements are able to provide; (2) the overall trend of AGB in the TRHR is increasing more than decreasing (44.4% vs 29.2%, respectively) and has a stable area of 26.4%; and (3) the BP ANN model achieves better results than do the traditional multi-factor regression models (R2: 0.75–0.85 vs 0.40–0.64, RMSE: 355–462 vs 537–689 kg DW/ha).

Consequently, new and representative auto-irrigation algorithms were developed using 1) a uniform, single season MAD and 2) a growth stage-specific MAD with options for seasonal growth stage partitioning based on scheduled date and accumulated heat units.

To get a better understanding of the distribution of plants in wetlands and analyze their associations with environmental soil factors, the structure and types of plant communities in the eastern shore area of Lake Taihu were analyzed by two-way indicator species analysis and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) ordination. The spatial distribution patterns of vegetation and the main factors affecting the distributions were investigated.Outcomes: Sixty-six sampling sites were selected to obtain vegetation species and soil environmental factor data. Results showed that 22 species from the 66 sites could be divided into seven communities: I: Arundo donax; II: A. donax + Phragmites australis; III: Zizania latifolia + Typha orientalis; IV: P. australis + Alternanthera philoxeroides + Polygonum hydropiper; V: P. australis; VI: P. australis + Humulus scandens; and VII: Erigeron acer + Ipomoea batatas + Rumex acetosa. Plant species and soil factors in the CCA analysis showed that I. batatas, E. acer, Chenopodium album, Polygonum lapathifolium, and Acalypha australis were mainly affected by pH, whereas Echinochloa crus-galli, Setaria viridis, and H. scandens were mainly affected by soil total phosphorus. Mentha canadensis and A. donax were mainly affected by soil conductivity, A. philoxeroides was mainly affected by soil organic matter and, Z. latifolia, Metaplexis japonica and P. hydropiper were mainly affected by available phosphorus.Conclusion:These results indicated that different plants adapted to different soil environmental factors and provided basic information on the diversity of Lake Taihu wetland vegetation. . © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

Both existing grasslands and marginal croplands have been suggested as targets for conversion to switchgrass, but the resulting production potentials and hydrologic impacts are not clear. The objectives of this study were to model switchgrass production on existing grasslands (scenario-I) and on marginal croplands that have severe to very severe limitations for crop production (scenario-II) and to evaluate the effects on evapotranspiration (ET) and streamflow. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to the 1063 km2 Skeleton Creek watershed in north-central Oklahoma, a watershed dominated by grasslands (35%) and winter wheat cropland (47%). The simulated average annual yield (2002–2011) for rainfed Alamo switchgrass for both scenarios was 12 Mg ha-1. Yield varied spatially under scenario-I from 6.1 to 15.3 Mg ha-1, while under scenario-II the range was from 8.2 to 13.8 Mg ha-1. Comparison of average annual ET and streamflow between the baseline simulation (existing land use) and scenario-I showed that scenario-I had 5.6% (37 mm) higher average annual ET and 27.7% lower streamflow, representing a 40.7 million m3 yr-1 streamflow reduction. Compared to the baseline, scenario-II had only 0.5% higher ET and 3.2% lower streamflow, but some monthly impacts were larger. In this watershed, the water yield reduction per ton of biomass production (i.e. hydrologic cost-effectiveness ratio) was more than 5X greater under scenario-I than under scenario-II. These results suggest that, from a hydrologic perspective, it may be preferable to convert marginal cropland to switchgrass production rather than converting existing grasslands. © 2017, Public Library of Science.

The development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has provided a novel approach for RS, and makes it possible to acquire high spatio-temporal resolution imagery on a regional scale. In this study, the rice grain yield was predicted with single stage vegetation indices (VIs) and multi-temporal VIs derived from the multispectral (MS) and digital images. The results showed that the booting stage was identified as the optimal stage for grain yield prediction with VIs at a single stage for both digital image and MS image. And corresponding optimal color index was VARI with R2 value of 0.71 (Log relationship). While the optimal vegetation index NDVI[800,720] based on MS images showed a linear relationship with the grain yield and gained a higher R2 value (0.75) than color index did. The multi-temporal VIs showed a higher correlation with grain yield than the single stage VIs did. And the VIs at two random growth stage with the multiple linear regression function [MLR(VI)] performed best. The highest correlation coefficient were 0.76 with MLR(NDVI[800,720]) at the booting and heading stages (for the MS image) and 0.73 with MLR(VARI) at the jointing and booting stages (for the digital image). In addition, the VIs that showed a high correlation with LAI performed well for yield prediction, and the VIs composed of red edge band (720 nm) and near infrared band (800 nm) were found to be more effective in predicting yield and LAI at high level. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that both MS and digital sensors mounted on the UAV are reliable platforms for rice growth and grain yield estimation, and determined the best period and optimal VIs for rice grain yield prediction. © 2017","Digital image; Grain yield prediction; Multispectral image; Rice; UAVs","Agriculture; Forecasting; Grain growth; Image processing; Linear regression; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Agricultural remote sensing; Digital image; Grain yield; Multiple linear regressions; Multispectral images; Nondestructive assessment; Rice; Spatio-temporal resolution; Grain (agricultural product); crop yield; digital image; growth; index method; multispectral image; NDVI; prediction; remote sensing; rice; satellite imagery; satellite sensor; spatiotemporal analysis; unmanned vehicle",Article,Scopus

This attribute is particularly important as the region also plays a key role in the production of bioenergy feedstock. This study focuses on potential change in streamflow, sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus due to climate change and land management practices in the South Fork Iowa River (SFIR) watershed, Iowa. The watershed is covered primarily with annual crops (corn and soybeans). With cropland conversion to switchgrass, stover harvest, and implementation of best management practices (BMPs) (such as establishing riparian buffers and applying cover crops), significant reductions in nutrients were observed in the SFIR watershed under historical climate and future climate scenarios. Under a historical climate scenario, suspended sediment (SS), total nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) at the outlet point of the SFIR watershed could decrease by up to 56.7%, 32.0%, and 16.5%, respectively, compared with current land use when a portion of the cropland is converted to switchgrass and a cover crop is in place. Climate change could cause increases of 9.7% in SS, 4.1% in N, and 7.2% in P compared to current land use. Under future climate scenarios, nutrients including SS, N, and P were reduced through land management and practices and BMPs by up to 54.0% (SS), 30.4% (N), and 7.1% (P). Water footprint analysis further revealed changes in green water that are highly dependent on land management scenarios. The study highlights the versatile approaches in landscape management that are available to address climate change adaptation and acknowledged the complex nature of different perspectives in water sustainability. Further study involving implementing landscape design and management by using long-term monitoring data from field to watershed is necessary to verify the findings and move toward watershed-specific regional programs for climate adaptation. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","bioenergy production; BMPs; climate change; cover crops; land use and management; riparian buffer; switchgrass","Biomass; Crops; Forestry; Land use; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Plants (botany); Suspended sediments; Water quality; Watersheds; Bioenergy productions; BMPs; Cover crops; Land use and managements; Riparian buffers; Switchgrass; Climate change; adaptive management; basin management; biomass; buffer zone; climate change; cover crop; crop production; grass; land management; nitrogen; phosphorus; streamflow; suspended sediment; sustainability; water footprint; water quality; Corn Belt; Iowa; South Fork Iowa River; United States; Glycine max; Panicum virgatum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Energy crops such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and miscanthus (Miscanthus X giganteus) can grow well throughout the continental United States; however, most studies on the water quality impacts of land-use change from bioenergy policy are based in the Midwest. Insufficient research has been conducted to determine whether the results from the Midwest are applicable to other regions in the United States. This study compares water quality impacts of converting from corn to switchgrass in the Midwest (Upper Cedar watershed) and Southeast (Lumber watershed) with nitrogen loading to surface water as a proxy metric for overall water quality impacts using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The analysis shows that the fraction of nitrogen runoff compared to the fertilizer applied is 36% in Upper Cedar as compared to 6% in Lumber. Existing management practices like tile-drainage and land-cover like riparian wetlands contribute to this difference in the baseline nitrate export from each watershed. The potential reduction in nitrogen loading per potential liter of ethanol to surface waters, which account for both nitrate export and productivities, from the baseline corn-soy to switchgrass is about 40% for the Upper Cedar watershed and around 80% for the Lumber watershed. Although, the trend in reduction is similar in both watersheds, this study shows that results extrapolated from the Midwest may not be representative of other bioenergy producing regions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Land-use change; Nitrogen; Panicum virgatum L.; Switchgrass; Water quality","Crops; Cultivation; Land use; Lumber; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Plants (botany); Water quality; Watersheds; Bio-energy; Land-use change; Management practices; Miscanthus x giganteus; Panicum virgatum l; Regional differences; Soil and water assessment tool; Switchgrass; Surface waters; bioenergy; biomass power; energy crop; environmental impact assessment; grass; land use change; management practice; nitrate; nitrogen; runoff; soil and water assessment tool; water quality; wetland; Midwest; United States; Miscanthus; Miscanthus x giganteus; Panicum virgatum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Agricultural researchers use ground-based observations to identify, select and develop crops with favourable genotypes and phenotypes; however, the ability to collect rapid, high quality and high volume phenotypic data in open fields is restricting this. This study develops and assesses a method for deriving crop height and growth rate rapidly from multi-temporal, very high spatial resolution (1 cm/pixel), 3D digital surface models of crop field trials produced via Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry using aerial imagery collected through repeated campaigns flying an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with a mounted Red Green Blue (RGB) camera. We compare UAV SfM modelled crop heights to those derived from terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) and to the standard field measurement of crop height conducted using a 2 m rule. The most accurate UAV-derived surface model and the TLS both achieve a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.03 m compared to the existing manual 2 m rule method. The optimised UAV method was then applied to the growing season of a winter wheat field phenotyping experiment containing 25 different varieties grown in 27 m2 plots and subject to four different nitrogen fertiliser treatments. Accuracy assessments at different stages of crop growth produced consistently low RMSE values (0.07, 0.02 and 0.03 m for May, June and July, respectively), enabling crop growth rate to be derived from differencing of the multi-temporal surface models. We find growth rates range from -13 mm/day to 17 mm/day. Our results clearly display the impact of variable nitrogen fertiliser rates on crop growth. Digital surface models produced provide a novel spatial mapping of crop height variation both at the field scale and also within individual plots. This study proves UAV based SfM has the potential to become a new standard for high-throughput phenotyping of in-field crop heights. © 2016 by the authors.","Crop height; Phenotyping; Photogrammetry; Structure from Motion; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","Aerial photography; Agriculture; Crashworthiness; Fertilizers; Growth rate; Mean square error; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Photogrammetry; Remote sensing; Surveying instruments; Throughput; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Crop height; Ground-based observations; High-throughput phenotyping; Phenotyping; Root mean squared errors; Structure from motion; Terrestrial laser scanners; Very high spatial resolutions; Crops",Article,Scopus

Projected climate is subject to uncertainties related to climate change scenarios and Global Circulation Models (GCMs). This paper discusses the consequences of climate change on discharge. Historical climatic and gauging data were collected from different stations within a watershed. Bias correction was performed on GCMs temperature and precipitation data. After successful development of the hydrological modeling system (SWAT) for the basin, streamflow was simulated for three future periods (2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100) and compared with the baseline data (1981-2010) to explore the changes in different flow indicators such as mean flow, low flow, median flow, high flow, flow duration curves, temporal shift in peaks, and temporal shifts in center-of-volume dates. From the results obtained, an overall increase in mean annual flow was projected in the basin under both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. Winter and spring showed a noticeable increase in streamflow, while summer and autumn showed a decrease in streamflow. High flows were predicted to increase, but median flow was projected to decrease in the future under both scenarios. Flow duration curves showed that the probability of occurrence of high flow is likely to be more in the future. It was also noted that peaks were predicted to shift from May to July in the future, and the center-of-volume date of the annual flow may vary from ??11 to 23 days in the basin, under both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. As a whole, the Mangla basin will face more floods and less droughts in the future due to the projected increase in high and low flows, decrease in median flows and greater temporal and magnitudinal variations in peak flows. These outcomes suggest that it is important to consider the influence of climate change on water resources to frame appropriate guidelines for planning and management. © 2016 by the authors.","Bias correction; Climate change; Discharge; GCMs; Precipitation; RCPs; SWAT; Temperature","Climate models; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Precipitation (chemical); Reservoirs (water); Stream flow; Temperature; Water resources; Bias correction; Climate change scenarios; GCMs; Global circulation model; Hydrological modeling; Probability of occurrence; RCPs; SWAT; Climate change; air temperature; baseline conditions; climate change; climate modeling; environmental assessment; historical record; hydrological modeling; inflow; precipitation (climatology); profitability; reservoir; streamflow; temporal variation; uncertainty analysis; water resource; Azad Kashmir; Mangla Dam; Pakistan",Article,Scopus

Passive optical remote sensing and active microwave remote sensing both play an important role in the monitoring of forest biomass. However, optical spectral reflectance is saturated in relatively dense vegetation areas, and microwave backscattering is significantly influenced by the underlying soil when the vegetation coverage is low. Both of these conditions decrease the estimation accuracy of forest biomass. A new optical and microwave integrated vegetation index (VI) was proposed based on observations from both field experiments and satellite (Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and RADARSAT-2) data. According to the difference in interaction between the multispectral reflectance and microwave backscattering signatures with biomass, the combined VI (COVI) was designed using the weighted optical optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) and microwave horizontally transmitted and vertically received signal (HV) to overcome the disadvantages of both data types. The performance of the COVI was evaluated by comparison with those of the sole optical data, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, and the simple combination of independent optical and SAR variables. The most accurate performance was obtained by the models based on the COVI and optical and microwave optimal variables excluding OSAVI and HV, in combination with a random forest algorithm and the largest number of reference samples. The results also revealed that the predictive accuracy depended highly on the statistical method and the number of sample units. The validation indicated that this integrated method of determining the new VI is a good synergistic way to combine both optical and microwave information for the accurate estimation of forest biomass. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Biomass estimation; Combined vegetation index; Landsat 8 OLI; Prediction method; RADARSAT-2; Sample size","Backscattering; Biomass; Carbon; Decision trees; Electromagnetic wave backscattering; Forestry; Microwaves; Reflection; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Biomass estimation; LANDSAT; Prediction methods; Radarsat-2; Sample sizes; Vegetation index; Space-based radar",Article,Scopus

Both models have been calibrated against the observed daily runoff at the watershed outlet (Yingluoxia Hydrological Station) for the period of 1995-2004 and validated for the period of 2005-2009. Results show that both SWAT and DLBRM produced reasonable results in this study, and DLBRM performed better than SWAT. The difference in performance is mainly due to data constraints, different interpolation schemes, and spatial representations of landscape variations in the models. The tank storage-output principle used in DLBRM seems more suitable than the Soil Conservation Service curve number (SCS-CN) method used in SWAT to simulate daily flow in an arid area. Both models performed worse in simulating low flows mostly occurring in spring and winter, because of a lack of detailed representation of the impacts of snow-melting processes and frozen soils. The authors' analysis indicates that consideration of the impacts of snow melting and frozen soils on the hydrological process is key to improving performance of hydrological models in mountainous areas. Because of their simpler operations, lower data requirements, fewer input parameters, and better performances, distributed conceptual models such as DLBRM seem more suitable for hydrological modeling in data-deficient, high elevation, and topographically complex mountainous watersheds in arid regions. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Distributed large basin runoff model (DLBRM); Heihe River watershed; Model performance; Mountainous area; Soil and water assessment tool (SWAT)","Arid regions; Digital storage; Hydrology; Infiltration; Melting; Rivers; Runoff; Sea level; Snow; Soil conservation; Soils; Water resources; Watersheds; Heihe river; Large basin runoff models; Model performance; Mountainous area; Soil and water assessment tool; Frozen soils; arid region; comparative study; hydrological modeling; mountain stream; numerical model; peak flow; runoff; topographic effect; watershed; China; Gansu; Hei River",Article,Scopus

These parameters can be derived from MODIS with high accuracy, but their temporal resolution is too low to obtain high-temporal-resolution SSR retrievals. In order to obtain hourly cloud parameters, an artificial neural network (ANN) is applied in this study to directly construct a functional relationship between MODIS cloud products and Multifunctional Transport Satellite (MTSAT) geostationary satellite signals. In addition, an efficient parameterization model for SSR retrieval is introduced and, when driven with MODIS atmospheric and land products, its root mean square error (RMSE) is about 100 W m-2 for 44 Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) stations. Once the estimated cloud parameters and other information (such as aerosol, precipitable water, ozone) are input to the model, we can derive SSR at high spatiotemporal resolution. The retrieved SSR is first evaluated against hourly radiation data at three experimental stations in the Haihe River basin of China. The mean bias error (MBE) and RMSE in hourly SSR estimate are 12.0 W m-2 (or 3.5 %) and 98.5 W m-2 (or 28.9 %), respectively. The retrieved SSR is also evaluated against daily radiation data at 90 China Meteorological Administration (CMA) stations. The MBEs are 9.8 W m-2 (or 5.4 %); the RMSEs in daily and monthly mean SSR estimates are 34.2 W m-2 (or 19.1 %) and 22.1 W m-2 (or 12.3 %), respectively. The accuracy is comparable to or even higher than two other radiation products (GLASS and ISCCP-FD), and the present method is more computationally efficient and can produce hourly SSR data at a spatial resolution of 5 km. © Author(s) 2016.",,"accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; cloud; error analysis; MODIS; MTSAT; solar radiation; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Hai Basin",Article,Scopus

The objective of this ongoing study is to assess the combined impacts of climate and land use changes on hydrologic processes including precipitation, streamflow, groundwater flow, and evapotranspiration in the 6, 417 km2 Salt River Basin (SRB) in Northeast Missouri. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to characterize hydrology in the SRB under varying future climate and land use scenarios. Model parameters were calibrated using streamflow data at ten USGS stations within the SRB, with model calibration from 2004-2008 and validation from 2009-2013. For future simulation, climate data from 2014-2060 were obtained from Downscaled CMIP5 Climate Projections. Two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) reflecting the range of radiative forcing levels, RCP 8.5 and 4.5 with 20 different model outputs for each RCP, were considered. Statistical downscaling methods, including delta method for temperature and quantile mapping for precipitation, were used to further downscale these data to the climate station level. Two land use scenarios were created with worst-case and best-case scenario and mapped by CLUE-S model to produce 30m × 30m resolution land use maps for the future period. The wide range of combinations of land use and climate change scenarios were examined to indicate possible outcomes useful for local and national agency application within the near (2020-2039) and far (2040-2059) future periods.","Climate change; CLUE-S; CMIP5; Land use change; Statistical downscale; Streamflow; SWAT; Watershed","Atmospheric radiation; Climate models; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Land use; Stream flow; Water resources; Watersheds; CLUE-S; CMIP5; Land-use change; Statistical downscale; SWAT; Climate change",Conference Paper,Scopus

In this study, we assess the skill and the reliability of the Integrated Canadian Crop Yield Forecaster (ICCYF), a regional crop yield forecasting tool, at different temporal (i.e. 1-3 months before harvest) and spatial (i.e. census agricultural region - CAR, provincial and national) scales across Canada. A distinct feature of the ICCYF is that it generates in-season yield forecasts well before the end of the growing season and provides a probability distribution of the forecasted yields. The ICCYF integrates climate, remote sensing derived vegetation indices, soil and crop information through a physical process-based soil water budget model and statistical algorithms. The model was evaluated against yield survey data of spring wheat, barley and canola during the 1987-2012 period. Our results showed that the ICCYF performance exhibited a strong spatial pattern at both CAR and provincial scales. Model performance was better from regions with a good coverage of climate stations and a high percentage of cropped area. On average, the model coefficient of determination at CAR level was 66%, 51% and 67%, for spring wheat, barley and canola, respectively. Skilful forecasts (i.e. model efficiency index. >. 0) were achieved in 70% of the CARs for spring wheat and canola, and 43% for barley (low values observed in CAR with small harvested area). At the provincial scale, the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of the September forecasts ranged from 7% to 16%, 7% to14%, and 6% to 14% for spring wheat, barley and canola, respectively. For forecasts at the national scale, MAPE values (i.e. 8%, 5% and 9% for the three respective crops) were considerably smaller than the corresponding historical coefficients of variation (i.e. 17%, 10% and 17% for the three crops). Overall, the ICCYF performed better for spring wheat than for canola and barley at all the three spatial scales. Skilful forecasts were achieved by mid-August, giving a lead time of about 1 month before harvest and about 3-4 months before the final release of official survey results. As such, the ICCYF could be used as a complementary tool for the traditional survey method, especially in areas where it is not practical to conduct such surveys. © 2015 .","Barley; Canada; Canola; ICCYF; Probabilistic yield forecast; Spring wheat","agricultural land; agricultural modeling; climate change; crop yield; decision making; early warning system; growing season; prediction; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; statistical analysis; survey method; vegetation index; water budget; Canada; Brassica napus var. napus; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Development, control and maintenance of these strategies are highly dependent on temporally and spatially continuous information on crop status at the field scale. This paper introduces the application of a process-based, coupled hydro-agroecological model (PROMET) for the simulation of temporally and spatially dynamic crop growth on agriculturally managed fields. By assimilating optical remote sensing data into the model, the simulation of spatial crop dynamics is improved to a point where site-specific farming measures can be supported. Radiative transfer modeling (SLC) is used to provide maps of leaf area index from Earth Observation (EO). These maps are used in an assimilation scheme that selects closest matches between EO and PROMET ensemble runs. Validation is provided for winter wheat (years 2004, 2010 and 2011). Field samples validate the temporal dynamics of the simulations (avg. R2 = 0.93) and > 700 ha of calibrated combine harvester data are used for accuracy assessment of the spatial yield simulations (avg. RMSE = 1.15 t·ha-1). The study shows that precise simulation of field-scale crop growth and yield is possible, if spatial remotely sensed information is combined with temporal dynamics provided by land surface process models. The presented methodology represents a technical solution to make the best possible use of the growing stream of EO data in the context of sustainable land surface management. © 2015 by the authors.","Canopy reflectance modeling; Crop modeling; Data assimilation; Precision agriculture; PROMET; SLC; Winter wheat yield","Agriculture; Cultivation; Dynamics; Harvesters; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Surface measurement; Canopy reflectance model; Crop model; Data assimilation; Precision Agriculture; PROMET; SLC; Winter wheat yields; Crops",Article,Scopus

Subsurface drains were installed at three different spacings (5, 10, and 20 m). During the simulation period, all treatments were planted to corn receiving high preplant N-fertilization rates. Rainfall patterns varied significantly among the years. DRAINMOD-DSSAT predictions of monthly and annual drainage flow, and nitrate losses, were in good agreement with measured values.

However, the spatial pattern and strength of terrestrial C sinks and sources remain uncertain. In this study, we designed a spatially-explicit agroecosystem modeling system by integrating the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model with multiple sources of geospatial and surveyed datasets (including crop type map, elevation, climate forcing, fertilizer application, tillage type and distribution, and crop planting and harvesting date), and applied it to examine the sensitivity of cropland C flux simulations to two widely used soil databases (i.e. State Soil Geographic-STATSGO of a scale of 1:250,000 and Soil Survey Geographic-SSURGO of a scale of 1:24,000) in Iowa, USA. To efficiently execute numerous EPIC runs resulting from the use of high resolution spatial data (56m), we developed a parallelized version of EPIC. Both STATSGO and SSURGO led to similar simulations of crop yields and Net Ecosystem Production (NEP) estimates at the State level. However, substantial differences were observed at the county and sub-county (grid) levels. In general, the fine resolution SSURGO data outperformed the coarse resolution STATSGO data for county-scale crop-yield simulation, and within STATSGO, the area-weighted approach provided more accurate results. Further analysis showed that spatial distribution and magnitude of simulated NEP were more sensitive to the resolution difference between SSURGO and STATSGO at the county or grid scale. For over 60% of the cropland areas in Iowa, the deviations between STATSGO- and SSURGO-derived NEP were larger than 1MgCha-1yr-1, or about half of the average cropland NEP, highlighting the significant uncertainty in spatial distribution and magnitude of simulated C fluxes resulting from differences in soil data resolution. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; EPIC; Net Ecosystem Production; Parallel computing; Spatial resolution; SSURGO; STATSGO","Budget control; Carbon; Climate models; Crops; Distributed database systems; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Parallel processing systems; Scales (weighing instruments); Soil surveys; Soils; Spatial distribution; EPIC; Net ecosystem production; Spatial resolution; SSURGO; STATSGO; Climate change; carbon; carbon dioxide; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural soil; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; climate change; concentration (composition); ecosystem modeling; environmental policy; net ecosystem production; parallel computing; spatial data; spatial resolution; accuracy; article; carbon footprint; chemical analysis; climate change; concentration (parameters); controlled study; data base; environmental monitoring; environmental policy integrated climate; experimental design; geographic distribution; intermethod comparison; model; multi scale geospatial agroecosystem modeling; nonbiological model; priority journal; process development; process model; sensitivity analysis; soil analysis; soil pollution; soil survey geographic database; state soil geographic database; Climate change; EPIC; Net Ecosystem Production; Parallel computing; Spatial resolution; SSURGO; STATSGO; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Geography; Models, Theoretical; Soil",Article,Scopus

Due to the large number of parameters at the disposal of these models, circumstances may arise in which excellent global results are achieved using inaccurate magnitudes of these ""intra-watershed"" responses. When used for scenario analysis, a given model hence may inaccurately predict the global, in-stream effect of implementing land-use practices at the interior of the watershed. In this study, data regarding internal watershed behavior are used to constrain parameter estimation to maintain realistic intra-watershed responses while also matching available in-stream monitoring data. The methodology is demonstrated for the Eagle Creek Watershed in central Indiana. Streamflow and nitrate (NO3) loading are used as global in-stream comparisons, with two process responses, the annual mass of denitrification and the ratio of NO3 losses from subsurface and surface flow, used to constrain parameter estimation. Results show that imposing these constraints not only yields realistic internal watershed behavior but also provides good in-stream comparisons. Results further demonstrate that in the absence of incorporating intra-watershed constraints, evaluation of nutrient abatement strategies could be misleading, even though typical performance criteria are satisfied. Incorporating intra-watershed responses yields a watershed model that more accurately represents the observed behavior of the system and hence a tool that can be used with confidence in scenario evaluation. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.",,"Watershed models; Watershed process; Article; conservation biology; denitrification; flow; mass; no tillage; nutrient; stream (river); surface property; United States; water quality; watershed",Article,Scopus

We evaluate here whether this computationally intensive approach significantly alters projections of agricultural yield, one of the greatest concerns under climate change. Our results suggest that it does not. We simulate US maize yields under current and future CO2 concentrations with the widely used Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer crop model, driven by a variety of climate inputs including two GCMs, each in turn downscaled by two RCMs. We find that no climate model output can reproduce yields driven by observed climate unless a bias correction is first applied. Once a bias correction is applied, GCM- and RCM-driven US maize yields are essentially indistinguishable in all scenarios (&lt;10% discrepancy, equivalent to error from observations). Although RCMs correct some GCM biases related to fine-scale geographic features, errors in yield are dominated by broad-scale (100s of kilometers) GCM systematic errors that RCMs cannot compensate for. These results support previous suggestions that the benefits for impacts assessments of dynamically downscaling raw GCM output may not be sufficient to justify its computational demands.

Their impacts on non-point source pollution were simulated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the Liuxi River watershed, the only one local drinking-water-supply river basin of Guangzhou. The model was calibrated through comparing model outputs with observations to ensure reliable hydrologic, crop yield, and water quality simulations. The model results indicated that, 5% of total nitrogen (TN) load and 12% of total phosphorus (TP) load could be reduced at the watershed outlet by implementing the conservation tillage system of ""rice parachute transplanting with no-tillage and straw mulching"" for paddy rice fields which account for 9% of the watershed area. It is valuable to develop conservation tillage systems suitable for other types of agricultural land in southern China. When modeling the impacts of various fertilization levels derived from recommended fertilizer doses for medium fertility soil of the Pearl River Delta region where the watershed is located, the total crop yield was estimated to decrease by only 2% for up to 24% and 28% reduction in TN and TP loads at the watershed scale, respectively. The crop yields versus nutrient losses relationship simulated by SWAT indicated that great effects in TN and TP loads reduction could be achieved at the expense of minimal impacts on crop yield through optimal fertilization. The modeling approach presented in this study can be a useful tool for estimating the effects of policy instruments and pollution control measures. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural policy; Conservation tillage; Non-point source pollution; Optimal fertilization; SWAT; Watershed modeling","Agricultural policies; Conservation tillage; Non-point source pollution; Optimal fertilization; SWAT; Watershed modeling; Computer simulation; Cultivation; Optimization; Pollution control; Soil conservation; Soil testing; Water quality; Water supply; Watersheds; River pollution; agricultural policy; calibration; crop yield; drinking water; fertilizer application; land management; mulching; nonpoint source pollution; nutrient loss; pollution control; soil fertility; straw; sustainability; tillage; water quality; water supply; watershed; China; Guangdong; Liuxi Basin",Article,Scopus

These watersheds are increasingly facing anthropogenic and climate-related pressures that impact spatial and temporal distribution of water availability. This study evaluates temporal and spatial distribution of water availability including groundwater recharge and quality (non-point nitrate loadings) for a Himalayan watershed, namely, the Upper Yamuna watershed (part of the Ganga River basin). The watershed has an area of 11 600km2 with elevation ranging from 6300 to 600m above mean sea level. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a physically-based, time-continuous model, has been used to simulate the land phase of the hydrological cycle, to obtain streamflows, groundwater recharge, and nitrate (NO3) load distributions in various components of runoff. The hydrological SWAT model is integrated with the MODular finite difference groundwater FLOW model (MODFLOW), and Modular 3-Dimensional Multi-Species Transport model (MT3DMS), to obtain groundwater flow and NO3 transport. Validation of various modules of this integrated model has been done for sub-basins of the Upper Yamuna watershed. Results on surface runoff and groundwater levels obtained as outputs from simulation show a good comparison with the observed streamflows and groundwater levels (Nash-Sutcliffe and R2 correlations greater than +0.7). Nitrate loading obtained after nitrification, denitrification, and NO3 removal from unsaturated and shallow aquifer zones is combined with groundwater recharge. Results for nitrate modeling in groundwater aquifers are compared with observed NO3 concentration and are found to be in good agreement. The study further evaluates the sensitivity of water availability to climate change. Simulations have been made with the weather inputs of climate change scenarios of A2, B2, and A1B for end of the century. Water yield estimates under climate change scenarios have been made and implications on groundwater and groundwater quality have been assessed. The delicate groundwater resource balance that connects livelihoods of millions of people seems to be under tremendously increasing pressure due to the dynamic conditions of the natural environment of the region and the future climate changes. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Hydrology; MODFLOW; MT3DMS; Nitrate; SWAT","Aquifers; Climate change; Groundwater flow; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Hydrology; Nitrates; Nitrogen removal; Quality control; Runoff; Sea level; Stream flow; Water quality; Water supply; Watersheds; Climate change scenarios; MODFLOW; MT3DMS; Multi-species transports; Soil and water assessment tool; Spatial and temporal distribution; SWAT; Temporal and spatial distribution; Recharging (underground waters); ground water; nitrate; climate change; groundwater flow; hydrological cycle; hydrological modeling; nitrate; recharge; runoff; streamflow; water availability; water level; watershed; article; climate change; controlled study; geographic names; Himalaya; hydrology; priority journal; river basin; sea level; simulation; water availability; water flow; water quality; watershed; Himalayas; India; Yamuna Basin; Climate change; Hydrology; MODFLOW; MT3DMS; Nitrate; SWAT; Climate; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; Hydrology; India; Models, Theoretical; Nitrates; Water Cycle; Water Pollutants; Water Supply",Article,Scopus

However, many of them do not reproduce the small-scale spatial variability of precipitation exhibited by the observed meteorological data, which is an important factor for predicting hydrologic response to climatic forcing. In this study a new downscaling technique (Bias-Correction and Stochastic Analog method; BCSA) was developed to produce stochastic realizations of bias-corrected daily GCM precipitation fields that preserve both the spatial autocorrelation structure of observed daily precipitation sequences and the observed temporal frequency distribution of daily rainfall over space. We used the BCSA method to downscale 4 different daily GCM precipitation predictions from 1961 to 1999 over the state of Florida, and compared the skill of the method to results obtained with the commonly used bias-correction and spatial disaggregation (BCSD) approach, a modified version of BCSD which reverses the order of spatial disaggregation and bias-correction (SDBC), and the bias-correction and constructed analog (BCCA) method. Spatial and temporal statistics, transition probabilities, wet/dry spell lengths, spatial correlation indices, and variograms for wet (June through September) and dry (October through May) seasons were calculated for each method. Results showed that (1) BCCA underestimated mean daily precipitation for both wet and dry seasons while the BCSD, SDBC and BCSA methods accurately reproduced these characteristics, (2) the BCSD and BCCA methods underestimated temporal variability of daily precipitation and thus did not reproduce daily precipitation standard deviations, transition probabilities or wet/dry spell lengths as well as the SDBC and BCSA methods, and (3) the BCSD, BCCA and SDBC methods underestimated spatial variability in daily precipitation resulting in underprediction of spatial variance and overprediction of spatial correlation, whereas the new stochastic technique (BCSA) replicated observed spatial statistics for both the wet and dry seasons. This study underscores the need to carefully select a downscaling method that reproduces all precipitation characteristics important for the hydrologic system under consideration if local hydrologic impacts of climate variability and change are going to be reasonably predicted. For low-relief, rainfall-dominated watersheds, where reproducing small-scale spatiotemporal precipitation variability is important, the BCSA method is recommended for use over the BCSD, BCCA, or SDBC methods. © Author(s) 2013.

One of the major goals of this article is to investigate whether such simulations appropriately simulate the spatial and temporal variability of the current climate, using two simulation chains. These start from the global IPSL-CM4 climate model, using two regional models (LMDz and MM5) at moderate resolution (15-20 km), followed with a statistical downscaling method in order to reach a target resolution of 8 km. The statistical downscaling technique includes a non-parametric method that corrects the distribution by using high-resolution analyses over France. First the uncorrected simulations are evaluated against a set of high-resolution analyses, with a focus on temperature and precipitation. Uncorrected downscaled temperatures suffer from a cold bias that is present in the global model as well. Precipitations biases have a season- and model-dependent behavior. Dynamical models overestimate rainfall but with different patterns and amplitude, but both have underestimations in the South-Eastern area (Cevennes mountains) in winter. A variance decomposition shows that uncorrected simulations fairly well capture observed variances from inter-annual to high-frequency intra-seasonal time scales. After correction, distributions match with analyses by construction, but it is shown that spatial coherence, persistence properties of warm, cold and dry episodes also match to a certain extent. Another aim of the article is to describe the changes for future climate obtained using these simulations under Scenario A1B. Results are presented on the changes between current and mid-term future (2021-2050) averages and variability over France. Interestingly, even though the same global climate model is used at the boundaries, regional climate change responses from the two models significantly differ. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"climate modeling; climate prediction; climate variation; downscaling; metropolitan area; statistical analysis; France",Article,Scopus

However, it is still challenging to model crop yields based on remotely sensed data due to the variation in radiation use efficiency (RUE) across crop types and the effects of spatial heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a production efficiency model-based method to estimate corn and soybean yields with MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data by explicitly handling the following two issues: (1) field-measured RUE values for corn and soybean are applied to relatively pure pixels instead of the biome-wide RUE value prescribed in the MODIS vegetation productivity product (MOD17); and (2) contributions to productivity from vegetation other than crops in mixed pixels are deducted at the level of MODIS resolution. Our estimated yields statistically correlate with the national survey data for rainfed counties in the Midwestern US with low errors for both corn (R2 = 0.77; RMSE = 0.89 MT/ha) and soybeans (R2 = 0.66; RMSE = 0.38 MT/ha). Because the proposed algorithm does not require any retrospective analysis that constructs empirical relationships between the reported yields and remotely sensed data, it could monitor crop yields over large areas. © 2013 by the authors.","Crop yield; Modis gpp; Radiation use efficiency; Remote sensing; Spatial heterogeneity","Crops; Efficiency; Pixels; Productivity; Radiation effects; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Vegetation; Crop yield; Empirical relationships; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer datum; Modis gpp; Radiation use efficiency; Remote sensing techniques; Spatial heterogeneity; Vegetation productivity; Data handling",Article,Scopus

One of the goals of the present work is to develop a baseline scenario relative to which the impacts of land use changes on hydrological and environmental processes can be evaluated. In addition, this study can help in quantifying the potential impacts of future projected changes in land use in order to mitigate the negative impacts of these changes, especially in regard to a shift toward urbanization and second-generation bioenergy crop production derived from lignocellulosic crops. The present study explores the relationship between land use changes and hydrologic indicators within the agricultural regions of Michigan and Wisconsin. Two sets of land use data, the circa 1800 county base and the 2001 National Land Cover Dataset, were used to set up the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. First, sensitivity analyses were performed based on both pre-settlement and current land use scenarios. Results showed that parameter sensitivity analysis may not always explain how the variation in model output can be attributed to different sources of variation in the model input. Therefore, effort should be made to determine the true importance of sensitive parameters by considering their placement in model algorithms. The model was then calibrated against measured daily streamflow data obtained from eight U.S. Geological Survey gauging stations. The impacts of land use changes were studied at three scales: subwatershed, watershed, and basin. At the subwatershed scale, most of the hydrologic behavior can be described by percent change in land cover. However, the trend was more apparent for land use conversion from mixed forest to urban and agriculture lands than for other land use conversions. At the watershed scale, significant differences were observed based on the long-term average hydrologic variables under the current and presettlement scenarios. In addition, an increase in evapotranspiration (up to 16.5%) and surface runoff (up to 93.9%) contribution to streamflow, a decrease in recharge to aquifers (up to -51.5%) and baseflow (up to -50.1%), and mixed impacts on water yield (-21.5% to 24.6%) were detected. However, at the basin scale, more than 70% of the study area experienced decreased lateral subsurface flow and recharge to aquifers, while 65% of the area experienced increased overland flow and minor changes in evapotranspiration and water yield. © 2012 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Great lakes region; Hydrologic variables; Land use change; SWAT","Baseflows; Basin scale; Bio-energy; Crop production; Data sets; Environmental process; Gauging stations; Great lakes; Hydrologic modeling; Hydrologic variables; Land cover; Land-use change; Land-use scenario; Lateral subsurface flow; Michigan; Mixed forests; Model algorithms; Model inputs; Model outputs; Overland flow; Parameter sensitivities; Potential impacts; Presettlement; Sensitive parameter; Soil and water assessment tool; Sources of variation; Study areas; Surface runoffs; SWAT; U.s. geological surveys; Water yield; Watershed scale; WISCONSIN; Aquifers; Biofuels; Cultivation; Evapotranspiration; Hydrogeology; Lakes; Landforms; Rain; Recharging (underground waters); Stream flow; Water supply; Watersheds; Land use; agricultural land; algorithm; baseflow; bioenergy; cellulose; crop production; data set; energy crop; evapotranspiration; hydrological modeling; land cover; land use change; lignin; overland flow; recharge; sensitivity analysis; streamflow; subsurface flow; urbanization; watershed; Great Lakes [North America]; Michigan; United States; Wisconsin",Article,Scopus

Elevated greenhouse gases (GHG), as well as land cover/land use change (LCLUC), can influence regional climate dynamics. Biophysical factors such as topography, soil type, and seasonal rainfall can strongly affect crop yields. We used a regional climate model derived from the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) to compare the effects of projected future GHG and future LCLUC on spatial variability of crop yields in East Africa. Crop yields were estimated with a process-based simulation model. The results suggest that: (1) GHG-influenced and LCLUC-influenced yield changes are highly heterogeneous across this region; (2) LCLUC effects are significant drivers of yield change; and (3) high spatial variability in yield is indicated for several key agricultural sub-regions of East Africa. Food production risk when considered at the household scale is largely dependent on the occurrence of extremes, so mean yield in some cases may be an incomplete predictor of risk. The broad range of projected crop yields reflects enormous variability in key parameters that underlie regional food security; hence, donor institutions' strategies and investments might benefit from considering the spatial distribution around mean impacts for a given region. Ultimately, global assessments of food security risk would benefit from including regional and local assessments of climate impacts on food production. This may be less of a consideration in other regions. This study supports the concept that LCLUC is a first-order factor in assessing food production risk. © 2011 The Author(s).",,"Biophysical factors; Climate change impact; Climate impacts; Crop yield; East Africa; East africans; First-order; Food production; Food production systems; Food security; Future climate; Key parameters; Land-cover/land-use change; Land-use change; Regional atmospheric modeling systems; Regional climate; Regional climate models; Regional scale; Seasonal rainfall; Simulation model; Soil types; Spatial variability; Sub-regions; Climate models; Computer simulation; Crops; Economics; Food supply; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Climate change; assessment method; atmospheric modeling; climate change; climate modeling; crop yield; environmental factor; food production; food security; greenhouse gas; heterogeneity; land cover; land use change; numerical model; rainfall; regional climate; risk factor; seasonal variation; soil type; spatial distribution; spatial variation; topography; vulnerability; East Africa",Article,Scopus

Toward this end, we analyze and intercompare the performance of a set of four regional climate models (RCMs) driven by two global climate models (GCMs) (for a total of 4 different GCM-RCM pairs) in simulating present day and future climate over West Africa. The results show that the individual RCM members as well as their ensemble employing the same driving fields exhibit different biases and show mixed results in terms of outperforming the GCM simulation of seasonal temperature and precipitation, indicating a substantial sensitivity of RCMs to regional and local processes. These biases are reduced and GCM simulations improved upon by averaging all four RCM simulations, suggesting that multi-model RCM ensembles based on different driving GCMs help to compensate systematic errors from both the nested and the driving models. This confirms the importance of the multi-model approach for improving robustness of climate change projections. Illustrative examples of such ensemble reveal that the western Sahel undergoes substantial drying in future climate projections mostly due to a decrease in peak monsoon rainfall. Copyright © 2012 I.

Wheat production represents a main national agricultural activity in this region. Usually, regression techniques have been used in order to generate wheat yield models, at regional and subregional scales. In a whole regional analysis, using these techniques, climate and soil properties explained 64% of the spatial and interannual variability of wheat yield. Recently, an artificial neural network (ANN) approach was developed for wheat yield estimation in the region. In this chapter we compared the performance of multiple regression methods with the ANN approach as wheat yield estimation tools and propose developing productivity indexes by the latter technique. The ANN approach was able to generate a better explicative model than regression, with a lower RMSE. It could explain 76% of the interannual wheat yield variability with positive effects of harvest year, soil available water holding capacity, soil organic carbon, photothermal quotient and the ratio rainfall/crop potential evapotranspiration. Considering that the input variables required to run the ANN can be available 40-60 days before crop harvest, the model has a yield forecasting utility. The results of the ANN model can be used for estimating climate and soil productivity. A climate productivity index developed assessed the effect of the climate scenario and its changes on crop yield. A soil productivity index was also elaborated which represents the capacity to produce a certain amount of harvest grain per hectare, depending on soil characteristics. These indices are tools for characterizing climatic regions and for identifying productivity capabilities of soils at regional scale. The methodology developed can be applied in other cropping areas of the World and for different crops. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Non-destructive methods, such as satellite and proximal sensing, are widely used to estimate crop yield and quality characteristics, and spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) are commonly used to present site specific information. The aim of this study was the assessment of SVIs derived from satellite and proximal sensing at different growth stages of table grapes from veraison to harvest. The study took place in a commercial table grape vineyard (Vitis vinifera cv. Thompson Seedless) during three successive cultivation years (2015–2017). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) were calculated by employing satellite imagery (Landsat 8) and proximal sensing (Crop Circle ACS 470) to assess the yield and quality characteristics of table grapes. The SVIs exhibited different degrees of correlations with different measurement dates and sensing methods. Satellite-based GNDVI at harvest presented higher correlations with crop quality characteristics (r = 0.522 for berry diameter, r = 0.537 for pH, r = 0.629 for berry deformation) compared with NDVI. Proximal-based GNDVI at the middle of veraison presented higher correlations compared with NDVI (r = –0.682 for berry diameter, r = –0.565 for berry deformation).

It is therefore common to correct (or adjust) those simulations before using them as inputs into impact models. However, most bias correction (BC) methods are univariate and so do not account for the statistical dependences linking the different locations and/or physical variables of interest. In addition, they are often deterministic, and stochasticity is frequently needed to investigate climate uncertainty and to add constrained randomness to climate simulations that do not possess a realistic variability. This study presents a multivariate method of rank resampling for distributions and dependences (R2D2) bias correction allowing one to adjust not only the univariate distributions but also their inter-variable and inter-site dependence structures. Moreover, the proposed R2D2 method provides some stochasticity since it can generate as many multivariate corrected outputs as the number of statistical dimensions (i.e., number of grid cell × number of climate variables) of the simulations to be corrected. It is based on an assumption of stability in time of the dependence structure - making it possible to deal with a high number of statistical dimensions - that lets the climate model drive the temporal properties and their changes in time. R2D2 is applied on temperature and precipitation reanalysis time series with respect to high-resolution reference data over the southeast of France (1506 grid cell). Bivariate, 1506-dimensional and 3012-dimensional versions of R2D2 are tested over a historical period and compared to a univariate BC. How the different BC methods behave in a climate change context is also illustrated with an application to regional climate simulations over the 2071-2100 period. The results indicate that the 1d-BC basically reproduces the climate model multivariate properties, 2d-R2D2 is only satisfying in the inter-variable context, 1506d-R2D2 strongly improves inter-site properties and 3012d-R2D2 is able to account for both. Applications of the proposed R2D2 method to various climate datasets are relevant for many impact studies. The perspectives of improvements are numerous, such as introducing stochasticity in the dependence itself, questioning its stability assumption, and accounting for temporal properties adjustment while including more physics in the adjustment procedures. © Author(s) 2018.",,"Climate change; Digital storage; Sampling; Dependence structures; Historical periods; Multivariate methods; Physical variables; Realistic variability; Regional climate simulation; Statistical dependence; Univariate distributions; Climate models; climate change; climate modeling; multivariate analysis; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; sampling; sampling bias; simulation; temperature effect; France",Article,Scopus

Lake Conway Point Remove (LCPR) watershed was identified as one of the watersheds for the MRBI program implementation. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of the MRBI program in LCPR watershed using a computer simulation model. Seven best management practices (BMPs) (pond, wetland, pond and wetland, cover crops, vegetative filter strips, grassed waterways and forage and biomass planting) were modelled under four placement strategies: random placement in 30% of the watershed, random placement in 30% hydrologic response units (HRUs) of the high priority hydrological unit code (HUCs), placement in the top 30% of the high priority HUCs, and top 30% of the HRUs in the HUCs near the outlet of the watershed. The model was calibrated for flow for the period 1987–2006 and validated for the period 2007–2012. Sediment and nutrients were validated from 2011 to 2012. Out of the BMPs evaluated, grassed waterways proved to be the most effective BMP in reducing sediment and nutrient loads from row crop (soy beans) and pasture fields. Reductions at the watershed outlet ranged 0–1% for flow, 0.28–14% for sediment, 0.3–10% for TP and 0.3–9% for TN. Relatively higher reductions were observed at the subwatershed level, flow reductions ranged 0–51%, sediment reductions −1 to 79%, TP −1 to 65% and TN −0.37 to 66% depending on BMP type, placement scenario, and watershed characteristics. The results from this study provide the data to help prioritize monitoring needs for collecting watershed response data in LCPR and BMP implementation evaluations, which could be used to inform decisions in similar studies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","BMPs; Conservation practice; Modeling; MRBI; SWAT; Water quality","Conservation; Crops; Lakes; Models; Nutrients; Sediments; Water quality; Wetlands; Best management practice (BMPs); BMPs; Conservation practices; Hydrologic response units; MRBI; SWAT; USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service; Watershed characteristics; Watersheds; best management practice; calibration; computer simulation; conservation management; hydrological response; model validation; modeling; nutrient; pasture; research program; sediment; soil and water assessment tool; soybean; water quality; watershed; Arkansas; Mississippi River; United States",Article,Scopus

In these regions, inter-annual variation in climatic factors (such as rainfall) combined with anthropogenic factors (such as civil war) pose major risks to food security. Thus, an operational crop production estimation and forecasting system is required to help decision-makers to make early estimates of potential food availability. Data from NASA's MODIS with official crop statistics were combined to develop an empirical regression-based model to forecast winter wheat and barley production in Iraq. The study explores remotely sensed indices representing crop productivity over the crop growing season to find the optimal correlation with crop production. The potential of three different remotely sensed indices, and information related to the phenology of crops, for forecasting crop production at the governorate level was tested and their results were validated using the leave-one-year-out approach. Despite testing several methodological approaches, and extensive spatio-temporal analysis, this paper depicts the difficulty in estimating crop yield on an annual base using current satellite low-resolution data. However, more precise estimates of crop production were possible. The result of the current research implies that the date of the maximum vegetation index (VI) offered the most accurate forecast of crop production with an average R2 = 0.70 compared to the date of MODIS EVI (Avg R2 = 0.68) and a NPP (Avg R2 = 0.66). When winter wheat and barley production were forecasted using NDVI, EVI and NPP and compared to official statistics, the relative error ranged from − 20 to 20%, − 45 to 28% and − 48 to 22%, respectively. The research indicated that remotely sensed indices could characterize and forecast crop production more accurately than simple cropping area, which was treated as a null model against which to evaluate the proposed approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Crop yield/production forecasting; EVI; MODIS; NDVI; NPP and Iraq; Vegetation phenology","Agriculture; Arid regions; Biology; Cultivation; Decision making; Error statistics; Food supply; Forecasting; NASA; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Crop yield; MODIS; NDVI; NPP and Iraq; Vegetation phenology; Crops; arid region; barley; crop production; crop yield; MODIS; NDVI; phenology; primary production; remote sensing; semiarid region; wheat; accuracy; Article; barley; crop production; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; food insecurity; forecasting; harvest period; Iraq; priority journal; quality control; seasonal variation; vegetation; wheat; winter; article; growing season; harvest; Iraq; nonhuman; phenology; plant yield; productivity; spatiotemporal analysis; vegetation; winter wheat; Iraq; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

How such forcing alters the pattern of yield variation across different geographic scales and across large agricultural landscapes like the Canadian Prairies is less understood. Yet, such questions are of major importance in forecasting future cereal crop production. We explore the potential impact of ENSO on wheat and barley across the Canadian Prairies/Western Canada using a multi-scale, cluster-based principal component analysis (PCA) model that integrates machine-learning (K-means clustering) to predict areas of high climate risk. These risk areas are separable clusters of subregions that show similar ENSO-yield correlation response (spatial coherency). Benchmarking this spatial model to non-spatial models indicates that spatial coherency leads to gains in prediction skill. Incorporating spatial coherency increased the skill in predicting crop yield; reducing RMSE error by up to 26–34% (spring wheat) and 2–4% (barley). We infer that accounting for spatial coherency improves the accuracy and reliability of crop yield forecasts. © 2017, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada as represented by Dr. Kenna MacKenzie.","Crop yield; El-Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO); Forecasting; Regional-scale","barley; climate effect; cluster analysis; crop production; crop yield; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; forecasting method; machine learning; prediction; principal component analysis; wheat; Canada; Prairie Provinces",Article,Scopus

To reduce the potential risk and provide support for agricultural flood management, prevention, and mitigation, it is important to account for flood damage to crop production and to understand the relationship between flood characteristics and crop losses. A quantitative and effective evaluation tool is therefore essential to explore what and how flood characteristics will affect the associated crop loss, based on accurately understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of flood evolution and crop growth. Current evaluation methods are generally integrally or qualitatively based on statistic data or ex-post survey with less diagnosis into the process and dynamics of historical flood events. Therefore, a quantitative and spatial evaluation framework is presented in this study that integrates remote sensing imagery and hydraulic model simulation to facilitate the identification of historical flood characteristics that influence crop losses. Remote sensing imagery can capture the spatial variation of crop yields and yield losses from floods on a grid scale over large areas; however, it is incapable of providing spatial information regarding flood progress. Two-dimensional hydraulic model can simulate the dynamics of surface runoff and accomplish spatial and temporal quantification of flood characteristics on a grid scale over watersheds, i.e., flow velocity and flood duration. The methodological framework developed herein includes the following: (a) Vegetation indices for the critical period of crop growth from mid-high temporal and spatial remote sensing imagery in association with agricultural statistics data were used to develop empirical models to monitor the crop yield and evaluate yield losses from flood; (b) The two-dimensional hydraulic model coupled with the SCS-CN hydrologic model was employed to simulate the flood evolution process, with the SCS-CN model as a rainfall-runoff generator and the two-dimensional hydraulic model implementing the routing scheme for surface runoff; and (c) The spatial combination between crop yield losses and flood dynamics on a grid scale can be used to investigate the relationship between the intensity of flood characteristics and associated loss extent. The modeling framework was applied for a 50-year return period flood that occurred in Jilin province, Northeast China, which caused large agricultural losses in August 2013. The modeling results indicated that (a) the flow velocity was the most influential factor that caused spring corn, rice and soybean yield losses from extreme storm event in the mountainous regions; (b) the power function archived the best results that fit the velocity-loss relationship for mountainous areas; and (c) integrated remote sensing imagery and two-dimensional hydraulic modeling approach are helpful for evaluating the influence of historical flood event on crop production and investigating the relationship between flood characteristics and crop yield losses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Flood characteristics; HJ-1A/B imagery; Remote sensing; Two-dimensional hydraulic model; Yield loss","Agricultural robots; Agricultural runoff; Crops; Cultivation; Dynamics; Flood control; Floods; Flow velocity; Food supply; Hydraulic models; Infiltration; Storms; Extreme storm events; Flood characteristics; HJ-1A/B imagery; Methodological frameworks; Remote sensing imagery; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Two-dimensional hydraulic model; Yield loss; Remote sensing; crop production; crop yield; flood; flood control; flood damage; flow velocity; food security; growth rate; maize; mountain region; rainfall-runoff modeling; remote sensing; rice; runoff; satellite imagery; soybean; two-dimensional modeling; yield response; China; Jilin; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Application of pollution fate and transport models in semi-arid regions has been challenging because of unique hydrological characteristics and limited data availability. Significant temporal and spatial variability in rainfall events, complex interactions between soil, vegetation and topography, and limited water quality and hydrological data due to insufficient monitoring network make it a difficult task to develop reliable models in semi-arid regions. The performances of these models govern the final use of the outcomes such as policy implementation, screening, economical analysis, etc. In this study, a deterministic distributed fate and transport model, SWAT, is applied in Lake Mogan Watershed, a semi-arid region dominated by dry agricultural practices, to estimate nutrient loads and to develop the water budget of the watershed. To minimize the discrepancy due to limited availability of historical water quality data extensive efforts were placed in collecting site-specific data for model inputs such as soil properties, agricultural practice information and land use. Moreover, calibration parameter ranges suggested in the literature are utilized during calibration in order to obtain more realistic representation of Lake Mogan Watershed in the model. Model performance is evaluated using comparisons of the measured data with 95%CI for the simulated data and comparison of unit pollution load estimations with those provided in the literature for similar catchments, in addition to commonly used evaluation criteria such as Nash-Sutcliffe simulation efficiency, coefficient of determination and percent bias. These evaluations demonstrated that even though the model prediction power is not high according to the commonly used model performance criteria, the calibrated model may provide useful information in the comparison of the effects of different management practices on diffuse pollution and water quality in Lake Mogan Watershed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Diffuse pollution; Lake Mogan; Modelling; Nutrients; Semi-arid; SWAT","Agriculture; Arid regions; Budget control; Catchments; Lakes; Land use; Models; Nutrients; Pollution; Quality control; Water pollution; Water quality; Watersheds; Coefficient of determination; Diffuse pollution; Fate and transport modeling; Hydrological characteristics; Semi arid; Sustainable management; SWAT; Temporal and spatial variability; Lake pollution; ground water; nitrogen; phosphorus; surface water; lake pollution; modeling; nutrient enrichment; pollutant transport; semiarid region; water budget; watershed; Article; catchment; controlled study; environmental policy; evapotranspiration; hydrology; irrigation (agriculture); land use; nonbiological model; nonhuman; nutrient content; pollution fate and transport model; pollution transport; precipitation; predictive value; sediment; semiarid climate; sensitivity and specificity; soil moisture; topography; urbanization; validation process; vegetation; water pollution; water quality; watershed; Ankara [Turkey]; Mogan Lake; Turkey",Article,Scopus

This includes the sub-objectives of future projection of rainfall and minimum and maximum temperatures by LS-SVM (Least Square Support Vector Machine) and SDSM (Statistical Downscaling Model) models to estimate climate change impact, and prediction of land use change of the basin area by the Markov Chain model. The present and future climate of the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s have been projected along with the past, present and future land use projection (1990, 2000, 2011, 2020 and 2050). The individual and combined effects on water balance have been shown in 12 sub-watersheds (SW) of the basin projecting increased water yield and decreased ET in the future. Individual impact of climate change shows high water yield, surface runoff and ET, while the individual impact of land use change shows increased water yield and surface runoff but decreased ET in the future. The SW 1–7 indicate comparatively higher surface runoff and water yield due to the presence of bare lands, agricultural lands and settlements and lower ET, while southern SW of 8–12 show low water yield and surface runoff but higher ET due to the presence of more vegetation and forest areas.

ACR is caused by the fungus Colletotrichum. Since this airborne disease spreads rapidly, detection at the early stage of infection is critical. The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of detecting ACR in strawberry at its early stage under field conditions using spectroscopy technology. Hyperspectral data were collected in-field using a mobile platform on three categories of strawberry plants: infected but asymptomatic, infected and symptomatic, and healthy. As a comparison, indoor data were also collected from the same three categories of strawberry plants under a controlled laboratory setup. Three classification models, stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA), Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA), and the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithms, were investigated for their potential to differentiate the three infestation categories. Thirty-three spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) were calculated as inputs using selected spectral bands in the visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) regions to train classification models. The mean classification accuracies of in-field tests for the three infestation categories were 71.3%, 70.5%, and 73.6% for SDA, FDA, and kNN, respectively. These accuracies were approximately 15–20% lower than those of the indoor tests. The low accuracy (15.4%) of classifying healthy leaves in-field using the kNN model was possibly due to the training datasets being unbalanced. After the adjustment of sample sizes of each category, the accuracies of kNN improved greatly, especially for the healthy and symptomatic categories. Overall, SDA was the optimal classifier for both indoor and in-field tests for detection strawberry ACR. However, kNN performed better for asymptomatic leaves in the field in the case of balanced sample sizes of each category. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anthracnose crown rot; Colletotrichum; Disease detection; Hyperspectral; Strawberry; Vegetation indices","Classification (of information); Discriminant analysis; Fisher information matrix; Infrared devices; Nearest neighbor search; Plants (botany); Vegetation; Colletotrichum; Crown rot; Disease detection; HyperSpectral; Strawberry; Vegetation index; Fruits; anthracnose; crown rot; disease transmission; fruit; fungal disease; fungus; infectious disease; infectivity; numerical model; spectral analysis; vegetation index; Colletotrichum; Fragaria x ananassa; Fungi",Article,Scopus

Four years of hydroclimate and water quality data were used to validate SWAT model estimates of monthly stream flow, suspended sediment, total phosphorus, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and total inorganic nitrogen from 5 nested-scale gauging sites located in a multiple-land-use watershed of the central USA. The uncalibrated SWAT model satisfactorily simulated monthly stream flow with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values ranging from 0.50 near the headwaters, to 0.75 near the watershed outlet.

In this study, we developed a Geographic Information System (GIS) based approach for implementing targeted land use i.e. marginal lands into the SWAT model and evaluated the applicability of the approach on a 8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) watershed scale. Comparative results showed that conventional targeting approach overestimates the benefit of targeting marginal lands for Alamo switchgrass (Panicum virgatum, L) and giant miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) production due to simulation of larger area under marginal land category.

Very few studies have simulated the entire MRB, and those that have developed were at a coarser resolution of 8-digit HUCs and were minimally calibrated. The MRB was first divided into three subbasins and was further divided into eleven regions. A ""head watershed"" was selected in each region and was calibrated for crop and water yields. The parameters from the calibrated head watershed were extrapolated to other subwatersheds in the region to complete comprehensive spatial calibration. The simulated crop yields at the head watersheds were in close agreement with observed crop yields. Spatial validation of the aggregated crop yields resulted in reasonable predictions for all crops except dryland corn in a few regions. Simulated and observed water yields in head watersheds and also in the validation locations were in close agreement in naturalized streams and poor agreement in streams with high groundwater-surface water interactions and/or reservoirs found upstream of the gauges.

Nitrogen credit exchange program is a trading market to facilitate pollutant reductions and protect the environment. A simple tool suitable for eastern North Carolina (NC) was developed to quantify drainage flow and N mass reductions resulting from drainage water management (DWM); an efficient and common conservation practice for drained agricultural lands. The tool comprises a set of regression equations estimating the performance of DWM as a function of local site conditions. DRAINMOD and DRAINMOD-NII models simulations were conducted for a wide range of soil types, weather conditions, and management practices for different locations in eastern NC. Simulation results were used with SAS 9.3 software to develop a set of multi-linear regression equations to estimate DWM-caused reductions in annual drainage flow and corresponding nitrate-N (NO3-N) losses for continuous corn (CC) and corn-wheat-soybean (CWS) cropping systems. The regression model estimations of annual drainage flow were highly correlated with DRAINMOD simulated values with an adjusted coefficient of multiple determination (R2adj) equal to 0.91 or higher for different management scenarios. Similarly, the regression model estimations of annual nitrate losses achieved an R2adj of 0.88 or higher for all management scenarios. The developed regression models were further compared on a year-by-year basis to the calibrated DRAINMOD and DRAINMOD-NII models for local conditions of an experimental site in eastern NC over 25 years. Estimated annual drainage flow and NO3-N losses were in good agreement with corresponding values simulated by DRAINMOD-based models for CC and CWS under free and controlled drainage modes. In terms of DWM-induced annual reductions in drainage flow and N losses, noticeable differences occurred in several years between predictions of DRAINMOD-NII and the regression models. A comparison based on the 5-year moving average of DWM-induced reductions smoothed out the extreme year-to-year variations and indicated very similar reduction trends provided by both methods. The results presented in this case study indicated that the simple regression method provides an adequate alternative to the processes based DRAINMOD suite of models for estimating annual reductions in drainage rates and N mass losses resulting from implementation of DWM. Similar tools can be developed for other regions in the US and abroad that initiate nitrogen trading markets involving DWM. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural drainage; Controlled drainage; DRAINMOD; DRAINMOD-NII; Nitrogen trading; Regression analysis","Agriculture; Commerce; Computer software; Drainage; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Water management; Agricultural drainage; Conservation practices; Controlled drainage; Drainage water management; DRAINMOD; Local site condition; Management practices; Multi-linear regression; Regression analysis; agricultural runoff; calibration; drainage water; economic instrument; environmental protection; leachate; maize; nitrate; nitrogen; pollution control; quantitative analysis; regression analysis; software; water management; wheat; North Carolina; United States; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

However wide differences exist in the costs of the different equipment deployed to measure vegetation indices (e.g. spectroradiometers versus conventional red/green/blue cameras) or canopy temperature (infrared thermometers versus thermal cameras). In this study we compared different methodological approaches measuring vegetation indices and canopy temperature in durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum (Desf.) Husn.) and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under different water conditions. These two categories of indices were correlated against grain yield during two consecutive years and with total biomass as well as water status (evaluated as carbon isotope composition, δ13C, and stomatal conductance) and nitrogen status (nitrogen and chlorophyll content) of the flag leaf during the first year. For the two crop species, and regardless of the device used, vegetation indices (the green area and the greener area) obtained with conventional cameras and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measured with a spectroradiometer were significantly correlated with grain yield, δ13C and stomatal conductance. Moreover, while canopy temperature measured with a thermal camera was better related to grain yield and δ13C than when measured with a low cost device such as an infrared thermometer, the latter approach still performs reasonably well when assessing yield and water status.

This region is comprised of two large river basins, the intensely row-cropped Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) and Ohio-Tennessee River Basin (OTRB), which are considered the key contributing areas for the Northern Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Thus, in this area it is of utmost importance to ensure that intensive agriculture for food, feed and biofuel production can coexist with a healthy water environment. To address these objectives within a river basin management context, an integrated modeling system has been constructed with the hydrologic Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, capable of estimating river basin responses to alternative cropping and/or management strategies. To improve modeling performance compared to previous studies and provide a spatially detailed basis for scenario development, this SWAT Corn Belt application incorporates a greatly refined subwatershed structure based on 12-digit hydrologic units or 'subwatersheds' as defined by the US Geological Service. The model setup, calibration and validation are time-demanding and challenging tasks for these large systems, given the scale intensive data requirements, and the need to ensure the reliability of flow and pollutant load predictions at multiple locations. Thus, the objectives of this study are both to comprehensively describe this large-scale modeling approach, providing estimates of pollution and crop production in the region as well as to present strengths and weaknesses of integrated modeling at such a large scale along with how it can be improved on the basis of the current modeling structure and results. The predictions were based on a semi-automatic hydrologic calibration approach for large-scale and spatially detailed modeling studies, with the use of the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting algorithm (SUFI-2) and the SWAT-CUP interface, followed by a manual water quality calibration on a monthly basis. The refined modeling approach developed in this study led to successful predictions across most parts of the Corn Belt region and can be used for testing pollution mitigation measures and agricultural economic scenarios, providing useful information to policy makers and recommendations on similar efforts at the regional scale. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Corn belt; Large-scale calibration; Nonpoint source pollution; Refined modeling; SWAT","Agriculture; Calibration; Cultivation; Environmental Protection Agency; Forecasting; Pollution; River pollution; Rivers; Water management; Water quality; Watersheds; Calibration and validations; Non-point source pollution; Refined model; Scale calibration; Sequential uncertainty fittings; SWAT; US Environmental Protection Agency; Water quality calibrations; Uncertainty analysis; agricultural economics; agricultural emission; basin management; biofuel; calibration; environmental protection; hydrological modeling; integrated approach; model validation; nonpoint source pollution; policy making; pollutant source; regional pattern; water quality; Atlantic Ocean; Corn Belt; Gulf of Mexico; Mississippi Basin; Tennessee Basin; United States; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The eastern part of this region is comprised of the Ohio-Tennessee River Basin (OTRB), which is considered a key contributing area for water pollution and the Northern Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone. A point of crucial importance in this basin is therefore how intensive corn-based cropping systems for food and fuel production can be sustainable and coexist with a healthy water environment, not only under existing climate but also under climate change conditions in the future. To address this issue, a OTRB integrated modeling system has been built with a greatly refined 12-digit subbasin structure based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) water quality model, which is capable of estimating landscape and in-stream water and pollutant yields in response to a wide array of alternative cropping and/or management strategies and climatic conditions. The effects of three agricultural management scenarios on crop production and pollutant loads exported from the crop land of the OTRB to streams and rivers were evaluated: (1) expansion of continuous corn across the entire basin, (2) adoption of no-till on all corn and soybean fields in the region, (3) implementation of a winter cover crop within the baseline rotations. The effects of each management scenario were evaluated both for current climate and projected mid-century (2046-2065) climates from seven global circulation models (GCMs). In both present and future climates each management scenario resulted in reduced erosion and nutrient loadings to surface water bodies compared to the baseline agricultural management, with cover crops causing the highest water pollution reduction. Corn and soybean yields in the region were negligibly influenced from the agricultural management scenarios. On the other hand, both water quality and crop yield numbers under climate change deviated considerably for all seven GCMs compared to the baseline climate. Future climates from all GCMs led to decreased corn and soybean yields by up to 20% on a mean annual basis, while water quality alterations were either positive or negative depending on the GCM. The study highlights the loss of productivity in the eastern Corn Belt under climate change, the need to consider a range of GCMs when assessing impacts of climate change, and the value of SWAT as a tool to analyze the effects of climate change on parameters of interest at the basin scale. © 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Here we provide an assessment of near-term climate change impacts on sorghum yields in West Africa and account for uncertainties both in future climate scenarios and in crop models. Towards this goal, we use simulations of nine bias-corrected CMIP5 climate models and two crop models (SARRA-H and APSIM) to evaluate the robustness of projected crop yield impacts in this area. In broad agreement with the full CMIP5 ensemble, our subset of bias-corrected climate models projects a mean warming of +2.8 °C in the decades of 2031-2060 compared to a baseline of 1961-1990 and a robust change in rainfall in West Africa with less rain in the Western part of the Sahel (Senegal, South-West Mali) and more rain in Central Sahel (Burkina Faso, South-West Niger). Projected rainfall deficits are concentrated in early monsoon season in the Western part of the Sahel while positive rainfall changes are found in late monsoon season all over the Sahel, suggesting a shift in the seasonality of the monsoon. In response to such climate change, but without accounting for direct crop responses to CO2, mean crop yield decreases by about 16-20% and year-to-year variability increases in the Western part of the Sahel, while the eastern domain sees much milder impacts. Such differences in climate and impacts projections between the Western and Eastern parts of the Sahel are highly consistent across the climate and crop models used in this study. We investigate the robustness of impacts for different choices of cultivars, nutrient treatments, and crop responses to CO2. Adverse impacts on mean yield and yield variability are lowest for modern cultivars, as their short and nearly fixed growth cycle appears to be more resilient to the seasonality shift of the monsoon, thus suggesting shorter season varieties could be considered a potential adaptation to ongoing climate changes. Easing nitrogen stress via increasing fertilizer inputs would increase absolute yields, but also make the crops more responsive to climate stresses, thus enhancing the negative impacts of climate change in a relative sense. Finally, CO2fertilization would significantly offset the negative climate impacts on sorghum yields by about 10%, with drier regions experiencing the largest benefits, though the net impacts of climate change remain negative even after accounting for CO2. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Africa; climate change; crop","Crops; Africa; Future climate; West Africa; Climate change; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate modeling; crop yield; cultivar; ecological modeling; numerical model; seasonality; sorghum; West Africa",Article,Scopus

First, the evolution of rainfall and temperature during the twenty-first century is assessed at the local scale using 17 regional climate model (RCM) simulations. A15%-30% rainfall reduction is expected in the fall combined with a 7%-9% annual reduction by 2030-50. Based on a regression model relating yields to rainfall, residual yields (independent of the increasing trend in the present period and from the biennial fruit bearing of the olive tree) are projected to decrease by 7% and 3.5% by 2030-50 for rainfed and irrigated olive groves, respectively. Substantial uncertainties in these results are discussed. AGIS analysis shows a reduction of ground and surface water resources, which are the basis of the present adaptation to rainfall variability, and an uneven potential for adaptation to climate change in the Sierra Mágina region. Despite the important challenges faced by this rural region, there is no consensus among the local key actors regarding adaptation strategies. This is due in part to the diversity among farmers, but also to the different levels of awareness about climate change among all the stakeholders and farmers. Since the projected decline in medium-range future yields is not very high, there might be time and possibilities, especially in the northern part of the Sierra Mágina, to build a local adaptability strategy within the next 20 years that would take into account improved methods of water management and a better economic valorization of olive oil. But at longer time scales, the adaptability of the olive-growing system to yield and water resource declines seems to be threatened. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.",,"adaptive management; climate change; climate modeling; farming system; fruit; future prospect; GIS; interdisciplinary approach; Mediterranean environment; precipitation intensity; socioeconomic impact; stakeholder; timescale; water management; water resource; Andalucia; Jaen [Andalucia]; Sierra Magina Natural Park; Spain",Article,Scopus

A particular issue is the need for estimates of the stores and fluxes in soils of water, carbon, nutrients, and solutes. This review outlines progress in the development and testing of GlobalSoilMap-a digital soil map that aims to provide a fine-resolution global grid of soil functional properties with estimates of their associated uncertainties. A range of methods can be used to generate the fine-resolution spatial estimates depending on the availability of existing soil surveys, environmental data, and point observations. The system has an explicit geometry for estimating point and block estimates of soil properties continuously down the soil profile. This geometry is necessary to ensure mass balance when stores and fluxes are computed. It also overcomes some limitations with existing systems for characterizing soil variation with depth. GlobalSoilMap has been designed to enable delivery of soil data via Web services. This review provides an overview of the system's technical specifications including the minimum data set. Examples from contrasting countries and environments are then presented to demonstrate the robustness of the technical specifications. GlobalSoilMap provides the means for supplying soil information in a format and resolution compatible with other fundamental data sets from remote sensing, terrain analysis, and other systems for mapping, monitoring, and forecasting biophysical processes. The initial research phase of the core project is nearing completion and attention is now shifting toward establishing the institutional and governance arrangements necessary to complete a full global coverage and maintaining the operational version of the GlobalSoilMap.

The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model was used to simulate hydrometeorological consequences and crop yields in the Yazoo River Basin (YRB) in northwestern Mississippi. Modeling results of streamflow and soybean and corn yields during the calibration and validation periods were consistent with the observed data. The yields of bioenergy crops were predicted using the calibrated SWAT model. In order to generate future climate change data, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab (GFDL) CM2.1 global coupled climate model was selected as a general circulation model (GCM). The output of the GFDL CM2.1 with the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B emission was downscaled by LARS-WG stochastic weather generator. Eight scenarios including bioenergy crop production and climate change were evaluated using the SWAT model. The results of this study indicate that the bioenergy crops will increase annual evapotranspiration and decrease annual surface water, water yield and streamflow. Furthermore, the future climate change scenarios showed that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations will decrease annual evapotranspiration, which eventually will lead to an increase in annual surface runoff, water yield, and streamflow. However, decreased precipitation in the future periods will be the dominant cause of a decrease in annual evapotranspiration, surface runoff, water yield, and streamflow. Comparison of all scenarios showed that climate change is likely to affect hydrometeorology more significantly than bioenergy crop production, and the scenarios of the conversion of soybean and corn to miscanthus are more significant than the switchgrass scenarios.

The average annual streamflow was simulated to be roughly 124.6mm with relatively small interannual variation during 1974-2010. The seasonal distribution of streamflow was uneven with a maximum in summer and a minimum in winter. Snowmelt, which was mainly produced in April-May, accounted for 4.0% of annual streamflow. Correlations and regression analysis between the interannual variations of major climatic and hydrological variables indicated that precipitation (temperature) had positive (negative) influence on the annual streamflow variation. For the interannual streamflow variations, warmer temperature was slightly more important than the variation of winter precipitation. Comparing streamflow changes in the current years (1980-99) with the future (2030-49), streamflow variations were more sensitive to changing climate in winter and spring than in the other two seasons.

The performance indicators used, the annual relative irrigation supply (ARIS) and the irrigation water productivity (IWP), required ET input data which were calculated using either METRIC or standard FAO methodology. The new procedure that used METRIC detected overirrigation (ARIS of 1.27) in situations where the ARIS calculated with the standard FAO methodology indicated near-optimal irrigation (ARIS of 0.98). Additionally, the proposed methodology allows the estimation of the volume of applied water at the field scale. Comparisons between the ARIS and IWP values obtained from actual applied water records against those calculated with the new methodology resulted in good agreement. It is concluded that the integration of the METRIC method to calculate actual ET with a water balance model allowed the determination of performance indicators in an irrigation scheme in a reliable and accurate fashion, requiring only very limited information at the field level. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",,"Actual evapotranspiration; Field level; Field scale; Input datas; Irrigation performance; Irrigation schemes; Irrigation waters; Limited information; Performance assessment; Performance indicators; Remote sensing techniques; Southern Spain; Water balance models; Benchmarking; Climate models; Remote sensing; Water management; Water supply; Irrigation; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; model test; performance assessment; remote sensing; water budget; Spain",Article,Scopus

Irrigation scheduling has the potential to incorporate real-time feedback from soil moisture and climatic sensors. However, for robust closed-loop decision support, models of the soil moisture dynamics are essential in order to predict crop water needs while adapting to external perturbation and disturbances. This paper presents a Dynamic Neural Network approach for modelling of the temporal soil moisture fluxes. The models are trained to generate a one-day-ahead prediction of the volumetric soil moisture content based on past soil moisture, precipitation, and climatic measurements. Using field data from three sites, a R2 value above 0.94 was obtained during model evaluation in all sites. The models were also able to generate robust soil moisture predictions for independent sites which were not used in training the models. The application of the Dynamic Neural Network models in a predictive irrigation scheduling system was demonstrated using AQUACROP simulations of the potato-growing season. The predictive irrigation scheduling system was evaluated against a rule-based system that applies irrigation based on predefined thresholds. Results indicate that the predictive system achieves a water saving ranging between 20 and 46% while realizing a yield and water use efficiency similar to that of the rule-based system. © 2018 by the authors.

The major datasets used are: first, surface reflectance and vegetation indices (VI) by fusing the optical observations from the Landsat sensors and the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer; and second, the L-band radar data from the PALSAR-2 sensor onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2. We find that although the fused VI time series are not necessarily beneficial for paddy rice mapping, the fusion datasets reduce observational gaps and allow us to better identify peak VI values and derive their empirical relationships with crop-cutting yield data (R^{2}= {\text{0.4}} for all the rice types, and R^{2}= {\text{0.69}} for the dominant rice type -58% of all the sampled fields). The L-band radar data have slightly lower performance in rice mapping than the optical satellite data, while it has much less contribution to yield estimation than the optical data. Furthermore, our study suggests the geolocation errors of satellite images be taken into account when selecting small sample areas for crop cutting. This practice will ensure the representativeness of crop-cutting sample areas with regard to satellite observations and thus better linkages between field data and satellite pixels for yield modeling. We also highlight the need of crop-cutting data from multiple years and/or at different regions to account for the spatial and temporal variations of harvest index to improve the spatially explicit rice yield estimates through satellite observations. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2); agriculture; crop yield; image fusion; Landsat; moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS); paddy rice; Viet Nam","Agriculture; Crops; Earth (planet); Image fusion; Mapping; Optical sensors; Production; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Spectrometers; Advanced land observing satellites; Crop yield; LANDSAT; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; MODIS; Paddy rice; Viet Nam; Space-based radar; agricultural application; ALOS; crop yield; cropping practice; growing season; image processing; Landsat; MODIS; paddy field; PALSAR; satellite data; vegetation mapping; Thai Binh; Viet Nam",Article,Scopus

In this study, Random Forests statistical analysis was used on a database of 499 surveyed inland valleys in four study zones in three West African countries. The goal of the study was to assess parameters that indicate (are predictors for) high potential for development of rice-based systems in inland valleys. These parameters are related to the biophysical (hydrology, soil, climate, and topography) and socio-economic (demography, accessibility, and markets) environments. Farmer group surveys and secondary data from existing publicly available spatial data sets were used. The analysis revealed that, across the four research areas, the following parameters were relevant predictors for rice development: (1) distance from the inland valley to the nearest market; (2) distance from the inland valley to the nearest rice mill; (3) population density in the immediate environment of the inland valley; (4) total nitrogen in the top 20 cm of the soil profile; (5) land elevation; and (6) soil texture on the upper slope of the inland valley. Several predictors were highly important for specific research areas, but not for all, thus showing the diversity in the studied agricultural landscapes. These predictors included soil fertility management, source of irrigation water, and the percentage of female farmers in the inland valley. The identified relevant predictors will be used to map the potential rice production development of the inland valleys. This will help development agencies to assess their zones based on quantitative analysis for inland valley potential development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Inland valley; Predictor; Random forests; Relevant variable selection; Rice production","alternative agriculture; data set; paddy farming; socioeconomic indicator; valley",Article,Scopus

We applied a scaling approach to capture changes in climate extremes with increase in global mean temperature in several subregions within the WAF domain: Western Sahel, Central Sahel, Eastern Sahel, Guinea Coast and Central Africa including Congo Basin. While there are several uncertainties and large ensemble spread in the projections of temperature and precipitation indices, most models show high-impact changes in climate extremes at subregional scale. At these smaller scales, temperature increases within the WAF domain are projected to be higher than the global mean temperature increase (at 1.5 °C and at 2 °C) and heat waves are expected to be more frequent and of longer duration. The most intense warming is observed over the drier regions of the Sahel, in the central Sahel and particularly in the eastern Sahel, where the precipitation and the soil moisture anomalies have the highest probability of projected increase at a global warming of 1.5 °C. Over the wetter regions of the Guinea Coast and Central Africa, models project a weak change in total precipitation and a decrease of the length of wet spells, while these two regions have the highest increase of heavy rainfall in the WAF domain at a global warming of 1.5 °C. Western Sahel is projected by 80% of the models to experience the strongest drying with a significant increase in the length of dry spells and a decrease in the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index.

This paper explores the performance of the pollen calendar as the most basic observation-oriented model for predicting daily concentrations of airborne Ambrosia, Betula and Poaceae pollen. Pollen calendars were calculated as the mean or median value of pollen concentrations on the same date in previous years of the available historic dataset, as well as the mean or median value of pollen concentrations of the smoothed dataset, pre-processed using moving mean and moving median. The performance of the models was evaluated by comparing forecasted to measured pollen concentrations at both daily and 10-day-average resolutions. This research demonstrates that the interpolation of missing data and pre-processing of the calibration dataset yields lower prediction errors. The increase in the number of calibration years corresponds to an improvement in the performance of the calendars in predicting daily pollen concentrations. However, the most significant improvement was obtained using four calibration years. The calendar models correspond well to the shape of the pollen curve. It was also found that daily resolution instead of 10-day averages adds to their value by emphasising variability in pollen exposure, which is important for personal assessment of dose-response for pollen-sensitive individuals. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Airborne pollen; Birch; Data-driven predictive modelling; Grass; Ragweed","analytical error; Article; birch; calibration; concentration (parameters); information processing; nonhuman; Poaceae; pollen analysis; pollination; prediction; priority journal; ragweed; seasonal variation",Article,Scopus

Few studies have evaluated long-term impacts of DWM, and the simulation of controlled drainage (CD) with the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) is limited, while shallow drainage (SD) has not been examined. We tested RZWQM using nine years (2007-2015) of field data from southeast Iowa for CD, SD, conventional drainage (DD), and undrained (ND) systems and simulated the long-term (1971-2015) impacts. RZWQM accurately simulated N loss in subsurface drainage, and the simulations agreed with field data that CD and SD substantially reduced N loss to drainage. As indicated by the field data, the SD N concentration was predicted to be greater than DD and CD, likely due to reduced time of travel to shallower drains. The long-term simulations show that CD and SD reduced annual N lost via tile drainage by 26% and 40%, respectively. Annual reductions in N lost via tile drainage ranged from 28% in the driest years to 22% in the wettest years for CD and from 56% in the driest years to 35% in the wettest years for SD. Considering spring N loading for the purpose of addressing hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico, CD was found to be less effective than SD, and in many years CD exported more N in the spring than DD. Spring N loading (April through June) was indicated by the EPA Science Advisory Board to have the greatest impact on hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Therefore, improvement of CD systems within the months of April through June to reduce N loss via drainage across the upper Midwest landscape may be required. Limited research in the upper Midwest has addressed spring N loading under controlled drainage systems (CD). This research will help model developers, model users, and agricultural scientists more clearly understand N transport under different systems, including CD, SD, and ND, which will aid in developing the design and management of drainage systems to reduce N transport from tile-drained agriculture to surface waters. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Agricultural simulation model; Drainage water management; Nonpoint-source pollution; Northern Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone; Nutrient reduction; Subsurface drainage","Agricultural runoff; Agriculture; Cultivation; Groundwater flow; Nitrogen; Quality control; River pollution; Wastewater disposal; Water management; Water pollution; Water quality; Drainage water management; Non-point source pollution; Northern Gulf of Mexico; Nutrient reduction; Simulation model; Subsurface drainages; Drainage; agricultural modeling; drainage water; hypoxic conditions; long-term change; model; nitrogen; nonpoint source pollution; nutrient; simulation; subsurface flow; tile drain; water footprint; water management; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico; Iowa; Midwest; United States",Conference Paper,Scopus

Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, we recently developed a Scalable satellite-based Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM) that integrates crop simulations with satellite imagery and gridded weather data to generate 30 m resolution yield estimates for multiple crops in different regions. Existing versions of SCYM typically capture one-third to half of the variation in reported county-scale yields. Using rainfed maize in the US Midwest as an example, this study tested multiple approaches for improving SCYM's accuracy, including (i) calibrating the phenology parameters of the crop model (APSIM) used to generate training samples for SCYM; (ii) using an ensemble of three crop models (APSIM-Maize, CERES-Maize, and Hybrid-Maize) instead of a single model; (iii) using simulated biomass from the crop models instead of simulated yields to train SCYM, with the former assuming a constant harvest index (HI). Results show substantial improvement in performance, as assessed using reported county yields by USDA-NASS, both from calibrating APSIM phenology parameters and from training SCYM on simulated biomass rather than yields. Using a multi-model ensemble further improves SCYM, although the benefit is limited. The proposed preferred version of SCYM on average captures 75% of the yield variation for 2001–2015 in the 3I states (i.e. Illinois, Indiana and Iowa) where SCYM is trained, with RMSE typically less than 1 t/ha, and explains 41% to 83% of multi-year yield variations when tested across nine Midwestern US states for 2008–2015. This level of accuracy is particularly notable given that only data from 2014 were used to calibrate phenology parameters. The yield estimates for multiple years in multiple states utilized 1184 Landsat tiles, but could be completed in about 2 h per year by using the GEE platform. All approaches tested in this study do not require any site-specific measurements, and thus can be readily extended to other regions and crops. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Google earth engine; Landsat; Maize; Yield estimation","accuracy assessment; agricultural modeling; calibration; computer simulation; crop yield; data processing; data set; information technology; Landsat; maize; phenology; phytomass; rainfed agriculture; resolution; satellite data; satellite imagery; weather; Illinois; Indiana; Iowa; Midwest; United States; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The aim is to improve our understanding of the water-food nexus in such schemes. With a special reference to the Gezira Irrigation Scheme (GeIS) in Sudan during the period 2000–2014, the tool devised herein is well suited for cases where validation data are absent. First, it introduces an index, referred to as the Crop Water Consumption Index (CWCI), to assess the efficiency of water policies. The index is defined as the ratio of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) over agricultural areas to total ETa for the whole scheme where ETa is estimated using the Simplified Surface Energy Balance model (SSEB). Second, the tool uses integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (iNDVI), as a proxy for crop productivity, and ETa to assess the WUE. Third, the tool uses SSEB ETa and NDVI in an attempt to detect wastage of water. Four key results emerged from this research as follows: 1) the WUE has not improved despite the changing agricultural and water policies, 2) the seasonal ETa can be used to detect the drier areas of GeIS, i.e. areas with poor irrigation water supply, 3) the decreasing trends of CWCI, slope of iNDVI-ETa linear regression and iNDVI are indicative of inefficient utilization of irrigation water in the scheme, and 4) it is possible to use SSEB ETa and NDVI to identify channels with spillover problems and detect wastage of rainwater that is not used as a source for irrigation. In conclusion, the innovative tool developed herein has provided important information on the efficiency of a large-scale irrigation scheme to help rationalize laborious water management processes and increase productivity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Actual evapotranspiration; Crop Water Consumption Index; Integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; Irrigation efficiency indicators; Irrigation water management; Simplified Surface Energy Balance model","Agriculture; Crops; Energy balance; Evapotranspiration; Interfacial energy; Productivity; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Water; Water management; Water supply; Water supply systems; Actual evapotranspiration; Crop water consumption; Irrigation efficiency; Irrigation water management; Normalized difference vegetation index; Surface energy balance modeling; Irrigation; energy balance; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; NDVI; remote sensing; satellite data; water management; water supply; Sudan",Article,Scopus

Five erosion and SSL algorithms were applied within a common LSM framework to quantify uncertainties and evaluate predictability in two steep, forested catchments (&gt;1,000 km2). The algorithms were chosen from among widely used sediment models, including empirically based: monovariate rating curve (MRC) and the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE); stochastically based: the Load Estimator (LOADEST); conceptually based: the Hydrologic Simulation Program—Fortran (HSPF); and physically based: the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM). The algorithms were driven by the hydrologic fluxes and meteorological inputs generated from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) LSM. A multiobjective calibration was applied to each algorithm and optimized parameter sets were validated over an excluded period, as well as in a transfer experiment to a nearby catchment to explore parameter robustness. Algorithm performance showed consistent decreases when parameter sets were applied to periods with greatly differing SSL variability relative to the calibration period. Of interest was a joint calibration of all sediment algorithm and streamflow parameters simultaneously, from which trade-offs between streamflow performance and partitioning of runoff and base flow to optimize SSL timing were noted, decreasing the flexibility and robustness of the streamflow to adapt to different time periods. Parameter transferability to another catchment was most successful in more process-oriented algorithms, the HSPF and the DHSVM. This first-of-its-kind multialgorithm sediment scheme offers a unique capability to portray acute episodic loading while quantifying trade-offs and uncertainties across a range of algorithm structures. © 2017.

However, a shift in land use from cotton to perennial grasses and a change in land management such as the harvesting of mesquite for biofuel production can significantly affect regional hydrology and water quality. In this study, APEX and SWAT models were integrated to assess the impacts of replacing cotton with Alamo switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and Miscanthus × giganteus in the upstream subwatershed and harvesting mesquite in the downstream subwatershed on water and nitrogen balances in the Double Mountain Fork Brazos watershed in the SHP and TRP regions. Simulated average (1994–2009) annual surface runoff from the baseline cotton areas decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) by 88%, and percolation increased by 28% under the perennial grasses scenario compared to the baseline cotton scenario. The soil water content enhanced significantly under the irrigated switchgrass scenario compared to the baseline irrigated cotton scenario from January to April and August to October. However, the soil water content was depleted significantly under the dryland Miscanthus scenario from April to July relative to the baseline dryland cotton scenario. The nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and organic-N loads in surface runoff and NO3-N leaching to groundwater reduced significantly by 86%, 98%, and 100%, respectively, under the perennial grasses scenario. Similarly, surface runoff, and NO3-N and organic-N loads through surface runoff reduced significantly by 98.9%, 99.9%, and 99.5%, respectively, under the post-mesquite-harvest scenario. Perennial grasses exhibited superior ethanol production potential compared to mesquite. However, mesquite is an appropriate supplementary bioenergy source in the TRP region because of its standing biomass and rapid regrowth characteristics. © 2017 The Authors.

However, the existing models usually focus on the cycles of one or more elements (e.g., water, carbon, or nitrogen). For example, hydrological models such as Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) focus on the water cycle and nutrient loadings at watershed scale, whereas biogeochemical models such as DayCent (i.e., daily CENTURY) emphasize carbon/nitrogen storage and fluxes of ecosystems at landscape scale. Therefore, using either one of the two categories of models is not enough for understanding/solving the current complex environmental issues that involve multiple aspects. Although use of both models (SWAT and DayCent) could be an expedient way toward treating the problem, creating separate model projects for a single area could be challenging and time consuming, and integration/analyses of model results have some limitations due to the non-uniformity of input spatial data between models. To overcome this issue, we developed an integrated model implementation coupler that aims to drive SWAT and DayCent—the two representative models in hydrology and biogeochemistry, respectively—just using a user's SWAT project without the need of any extra efforts such as developing a framework or preparing input data for DayCent modeling. This software is easy to use and would be promising for conducting comprehensive environmental impact assessment involving hydrological and biogeochemical cycles at watershed scale. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon cycle; DayCent; Model integration; SWAT; Water cycle","Biogeochemistry; Digital storage; Ecology; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Hydrology; Watersheds; Carbon cycles; DAYCENT; Model integration; SWAT; Water cycle; Integration; biogeochemical cycle; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; environmental impact assessment; hydrological modeling; nitrogen cycle; numerical model; software; soil and water assessment tool; watershed",Article,Scopus

Climate change is likely to have an impact on the availability of water and therefore on sediment yield in catchments. In this context, quantifying the sediment response to an increased atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate change is of utmost importance to the proper management of rural catchments. However, quantitative assessment of climate change impact remains a complex task. In this study, the potential medium (2031-2060) and long-term (2069-2098) impacts of projected changes of temperature, rainfall and CO2 concentration on sediment yield in a small rural catchment located in NW Spain were evaluated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Climate change scenarios were created using future climate data projected by regional climate models from the ENSEMBLES project and two CO2 concentration scenarios (550 and 660 ppm). The results showed that climate change would have a noticeable impact on suspended sediment if the forecast temperature, rainfall and CO2 concentration changes included in this study were met. Overall, suspended sediment is expected to decrease (2031-2060: -11%, 2069-2098: -8%) compared to the baseline period (1981-2010), mainly due to decreased streamflow. However, an increase in sediment transport in winter is predicted, possibly associated with increased erosion in cultivated areas (11%-17%), suggesting that, at this time of the year, the effect of soil detachment prevails over sediment transport capacity. Consequently, management practices aimed at reducing soil erosion in cultivated areas should be carried out, because these are the main source of sediment in the study area. © 2016 by the authors.","Climate change; Rural catchment; Suspended sediment; SWAT model","Atmospheric composition; Carbon dioxide; Catchments; Climate models; Erosion; Rain; Runoff; Rural areas; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Sediments; Soils; Suspended sediments; Climate change scenarios; Quantitative assessments; Regional climate models; Rural catchments; Sediment transport capacity; Soil and water assessment tool; Suspended sediment yields; SWAT model; Climate change; carbon dioxide; catchment; climate change; concentration (composition); quantitative analysis; sediment transport; sediment yield; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; suspended sediment; water availability; Corbeira Stream; Galicia [Spain]; La Coruna [Galicia]; Spain",Article,Scopus

However, the most significant factors and their contribution rate remain debatable. Selecting Hunan Province, which is one of the largest paddy rice producing regions in China as the research area, the marginal contributions of climatic and technological factors to late paddy yield change are estimated using a county-level panel data regression model with explicit consideration of technological variables during 2000–2011. The results indicate that the mean daily temperature and adoption rate of hybrid rice have significant positive impacts on late paddy rice yield. During the research period, 1 °C temperature increase will cause 7.220 t/km2 increase in late paddy rice yield, and 1 % increase in the adoption rate of hybrid rice will cause 0.212 t/km2 increase. Climatic factors, especially their annual variability, exhibit a stronger overall linkage to changes in late paddy rice yield in the study area compared with the technological factors. Climatic factors accounted for 67.645 and 74.585 % of the trend and variability in late paddy rice yield, respectively.

However, model simulated sediment yield results indicated a large difference among the tillage practices from the corn and soybean crop fields. The simulated future average maximum temperature showed as high as 4.8 °C increase in the BSRW. Monthly precipitation patterns will remain un-changed based on simulated future climate scenarios except for an increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall events occurring in the watershed.

This study performed a comparative analysis of multitemporal Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference index (NDVI) data for estimating rice crop yields in the Mekong River Delta (MRD), Vietnam. We processed the data for a 10-year period (2002-2011) following three main steps: (1) create a smooth time series of EVI and NDVI data, (2) formulate crop yield models, and (3) validate the model. The comparison results between EVI/NDVI-based estimated yields and the government's yield statistics indicated a significant relationship between the two datasets (p-value&lt;0.001). The estimated results produced from EVI-based models were slightly more accurate than those from NDVI-based models, with the correlation coefficients (R2) ranging from 0.62 to 0.71 for spring-winter and 0.4 to 0.56 for summer-autumn rice crops, respectively. The root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) used to measure the model accuracy revealed the consistency between EVI-based estimated yields and the government's yield statistics. The RMSE values for winter-spring and summer-autumn crops were, respectively, 6.9-8.1% and 5.4-6.7%, and MAE values were 5.4-6.7% and 6.5-9.5%. There was, however, a significant correlation between the estimated yields obtained from EVI- and NDVI-based models (p-value&lt;0.001), indicating no significant difference in the estimated yields between these two models. This study demonstrates advantages of using multitemporal MODIS EVI data for large-scale estimation of rice crop yields using the heading date in the MRD prior to the harvest period, and thus the methods could be transferable to other regions. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Mekong River Delta; MODIS; Rice crop; Smoothing; Yield estimation","comparative study; crop yield; food security; MODIS; NDVI; rice; satellite data; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam",Article,Scopus

The method devises a multivariate statistical model to compute bias and uncertainty in forecasted yield at the Census of Agricultural Region (CAR) scale across the Canadian Prairies. The method uses robust variable-selection to select the best predictors within spatial subregions. Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and random forest-tree machine learning techniques are then integrated to generate sequential forecasts through the growing season. Cross-validation of the model was performed by hindcasting/backcasting and comparing forecasts against available historical data (1987-2011) for spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The model was also validated for the 2012 growing season by comparing forecast skill at the CAR, provincial and Canadian Prairie region scales against available statistical survey data. Mean percent departures between wheat yield forecasted were under-estimated by 1-4% in mid-season and over-estimated by 1% at the end of the growing season. This integrated methodology offers a consistent, generalizable approach for sequentially forecasting crop yield at the regional-scale. It provides a statistically robust, yet flexible way to concurrently adjust to data-rich and data-sparse situations, adaptively select different predictors of yield to changing levels of environmental uncertainty, and to update forecasts sequentially so as to incorporate new data as it becomes available. This integrated method also provides additional statistical support for assessing the accuracy and reliability of model-based crop yield forecasts in time and space. © 2014 Newlands, Zamar, Kouadio, Zhang, Chipanshi, Potgieter, Toure and Hill.","Agriculture; Bayesian; Climate; Crop yield; Forecasting; Regional; Uncertainty",,Article,Scopus

An integrated, process-based model was developed to simulate the impacts of the changing environment and different water and farming management practices on the hydrology, water quality, and crop growth and yield for artificially drained cropping systems. The new model; named DRAINMOD-DSSAT, was developed by integrating three different process based models: the hydrological model, DRAINMOD; the soil carbon and nitrogen (N) dynamics model; DRAINMOD-NII, and selected crop modules of the DSSAT-CSM model; CROPGRO and CERES-Maize. The integration of the three component models is implemented at the source code level and allows for daily interactions and feedback among simulated climatic conditions, soil water and nitrogen, and crop growth. DRAINMOD-DSSAT performance was evaluated using a 10-yr dataset collected from a corn-soybean production system on a subsurface drained field in Iowa, with corn receiving low, medium, and high N fertilization rates. The model was calibrated using the data collected from the high-N treatment, and validated for the other two treatments. Annual and monthly subsurface drainage outflows were predicted with modeling efficiencies (NSE) of 0.95 and 0.83, respectively. The NSE's for annual and monthly NO3-N mass losses were 0.87 and 0.70 for the high N-treatment, 0.93 and 0.86 for the medium N-treatment, 0.94 and 0.67 for the low N-treatment, respectively. Predicted and measured crop yields were accurately predicted with an absolute percent error less than 8% in 27 of the 30 simulated plot-years (3 plots×10yrs). Nitrogen removal in crop grain was reasonably predicted. This first model application suggested the potential capability of DRAINMOD-DSSAT of simulating the hydrology, water quality, and crop growth and yield for corn and soybean production on artificially drained fields in response to varying climatic conditions and nutrient management practices. Further research, using more intense field measurements, is needed to validate the model for its intended use. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","CERES-Maize; CROPGRO agricultural system modeling; Drainage; DRAINMOD; DRAINMOD-NII; DSSAT","Agricultural system; CERES maizes; DRAINMOD; DRAINMOD-NII; DSSAT; Carbon; Crops; Drainage; Groundwater flow; Hydrology; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Soil moisture; Water quality; Computer simulation; agricultural management; agricultural modeling; agronomy; crop production; crop yield; fertilizer application; maize; model validation; nitrate; numerical model; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; soil nutrient; soybean; water quality",Article,Scopus

In the Midwestern United States, urban area, farmland, and dedicated energy crop (e.g., switchgrass) cultivation are predicted to expand in the coming decades, which will lead to changes in hydrological processes. This study is designed to (1) project the land use and land cover (LULC) by mid-century using the FORecasting SCEnarios of future land-use (FORE-SCE) model under the A1B greenhouse gas emission scenario (future condition) and (2) assess its potential impacts on the water cycle and water quality against the 2001 baseline condition in the Cedar River Basin using the physically based soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). We compared the baseline LULC (National Land Cover data 2001) and 2050 projection, indicating substantial expansions of urban area and pastureland (including the cultivation of bioenergy crops) and a decrease in rangeland. We then used the above two LULC maps as the input data to drive the SWAT model, keeping other input data (e.g., climate) unchanged to isolate the LULC change impacts. The modeling results indicate that quick-response surface runoff would increase significantly (about 10.5%) due to the projected urban expansion (i.e., increase in impervious areas), and the baseflow would decrease substantially (about 7.3%) because of the reduced infiltration. Although the net effect may cause an increase in water yield, the increased variability may impede its use for public supply. Additionally, the cultivation of bioenergy crops such as switchgrass in the newly added pasture lands may further reduce the soil water content and lead to an increase in nitrogen loading (about 2.5% increase) due to intensified fertilizer application. These study results will be informative to decision makers for sustainable water resource management when facing LULC change and an increasing demand for biofuel production in this area. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.","biofuel production; hydrological process; land cover change; SWAT; water quantity and quality","Biofuels; Climate models; Crops; Digital storage; Earth (planet); Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Input output programs; Land use; Plants (botany); Rain; Soil moisture; Water conservation; Water management; Water quality; Watersheds; Biofuel production; Hydrological process; Land-cover change; SWAT; Water quantities; Climate change; atmospheric forcing; biofuel; cultivation; energy crop; environmental impact; fertilizer application; human activity; infiltration; land cover; land use change; numerical model; oil production; pasture; rangeland; runoff; water management; water resource; Cedar Basin; United States; Panicum virgatum",Article,Scopus

Since impact models are highly sensitive to input climate data, GCM skill is crucial for getting better short-, medium- and long-term outlooks for agricultural production and food security. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) phase 5 ensemble is likely to underpin the majority of climate impact assessments over the next few years. We assess 24 CMIP3 and 26 CMIP5 simulations of present climate against climate observations for five tropical regions, as well as regional improvements in model skill and, through literature review, the sensitivities of impact estimates to model error. Climatological means of seasonal mean temperatures depict mean errors between 1 and 18 ° C (2-130% with respect to mean), whereas seasonal precipitation and wet-day frequency depict larger errors, often offsetting observed means and variability beyond 100%. Simulated interannual climate variability in GCMs warrants particular attention, given that no single GCM matches observations in more than 30% of the areas for monthly precipitation and wet-day frequency, 50% for diurnal range and 70% for mean temperatures. We report improvements in mean climate skill of 5-15% for climatological mean temperatures, 3-5% for diurnal range and 1-2% in precipitation. At these improvement rates, we estimate that at least 5-30 years of CMIP work is required to improve regional temperature simulations and at least 30-50 years for precipitation simulations, for these to be directly input into impact models. We conclude with some recommendations for the use of CMIP5 in agricultural impact studies. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.","adaptation; agriculture; climate change; climate model; skill","Agriculture; Climate change; Computer simulation; Errors; Food supply; Isomers; adaptation; Agricultural productions; Climate impact assessment; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Interannual climate variability; Seasonal precipitations; skill; Temperature simulations; Climate models; adaptive management; agricultural practice; annual variation; climate modeling; climate variation; climatology; ecological impact; global climate; literature review; technological development",Article,Scopus

As a result, many laboratories have developed high-throughput SNP assays and built high-density genetic maps. However, the number of markers may, by orders of magnitude, exceed the resolution of recombination for a given population size so that only a minority of markers can accurately be ordered. Another issue attached to the so-called ‘large p, small n’ problem is that high-density genetic maps inevitably result in many markers clustering at the same position (cosegregating markers). While there are a number of related papers, none have addressed the impact of co-segregating markers on genetic maps. In the present study, we investigated the effects of co-segregating markers on high-density genetic map length and marker order using empirical data from two populations of wheat, Mohawk × Cocorit (durum wheat) and Norstar × Cappelle Desprez (bread wheat). The maps of both populations consisted of 85% co-segregating markers. Our study clearly showed that excess of co-segregating markers can lead to map expansion, but has little effect on markers order. To estimate the inflation factor (IF), we generated a total of 24,473 linkage maps (8,203 maps for Mohawk × Cocorit and 16,270 maps for Norstar × Cappelle Desprez). Using seven machine learning algorithms, we were able to predict with an accuracy of 0.7 the map expansion due to the proportion of co-segregating markers. For example in Mohawk × Cocorit, with 10 and 80% co-segregating markers the length of the map inflated by 4.5 and 16.6%, respectively. Similarly, the map of Norstar × Cappelle Desprez expanded by 3.8 and 11.7% with 10 and 80% co-segregating markers. With the increasing number of markers on SNP-chips, the proportion of co-segregating markers in high-density maps will continue to increase making map expansion unavoidable. Therefore, we suggest developers improve linkage mapping algorithms for efficient analysis of high-throughput data. This study outlines a practical strategy to estimate the IF due to the proportion of co-segregating markers and outlines a method to scale the length of the map accordingly. © 2017 N’Diaye, Haile, Fowler, Ammar and Pozniak.","Genetic map; High-density; Inflation factor; Machine learning; Map expansion; Prediction; Single nucleotide polymorphism; Wheat",,Article,Scopus

A simulation at 50 km grid spacing is performed with the standard version of the RegCM4.5 model (control run), followed by three vegetation change experiments at the Sahel-Sahara interface (15° N and 20° N): forest, tall grass, and short grass savanna. The impacts of land cover change are assessed by analyzing the difference between the altered runs and the control one in different sub-domains (western Sahel, central Sahel, eastern Sahel, and Guinea). Results show that the presence of forest, tall grass, and short grass savanna at the Sahel-Sahara interface tends to decrease the mean summer surface temperature in the whole domain. Nevertheless, this decrease is more pronounced over the Central Sahel when considering the forest experiment. This temperature decrease is associated with a weakening (strengthening) of the sensible (latent) heat flux in the whole domain. An analysis of the radiation field is performed to better explain the changes noted in the latent heat flux, the sensible heat flux, and the surface temperature. When considering the rainfall signal, the analysis shows that the afforestation options tend to alter the precipitation in the considered sub-domains substantially by increasing it in the whole Sahel region, with strong interannual variability. This rainfall increase is associated with an increase of the atmospheric moisture. Finally, we investigated the impacts of the afforestation options on some features of the rainfall events, and on the atmospheric dynamics during wet and dry years. All afforestation options tend to increase the frequency of the number of rainy days in regions located south of 18° N during both periods. Nevertheless, this increase is stronger over the Central and Eastern Sahel during wet years in the forest case. All afforestation experiments induce an increase (decrease) of the low-levels monsoon flux in the Eastern Sahel (western Sahel) during both periods. At the mid-levels, the three afforestation options tend to move northward and to decrease the intensity of the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) south of 13° N during wet and dry years.The intensity of the AEJ is weaker during the wet period. The vegetation change experiments also affect the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ), especially during wet years, by increasing its intensity over the southern Sahel. The analysis of the activity of African EasterlyWaves (AEWs) patterns exhibits a decrease of the intensity of these disturbances over the Sahel during both periods. This may be due to the weakening of the meridional temperature contrast between the continent and the Gulf of Guinea due to the Sahel-Sahara surface temperature cooling induced by the afforestation. In summary, this study shows that during both periods, the increase of the atmospheric moisture due to the afforestation is associated with favorable AEJ/TEJ configurations (weaker and northward position of the AEJ; stronger TEJ) which in turn may create a stronger convection and then, an increase in the Sahel rainfall. This Sahel rainfall increase is associated with a strengthening of the intense and heavy rainfall events which may impact diversely local populations. © 2018 by the authors.","Interannual variability; Rainfall; Reforestation; RegCM4; Temperature; West Africa; Wind dynamics",,Article,Scopus

Statistical models have been used to estimate or forecast crop yield from weather information. In this paper, a general statistical framework is developed in order to rank and quantify the information content of weather information. The methodology is tested over the US, for corn yield. The weather sensitivity of different corn production areas is first analyzed. More than fifty agro-climatic indices have been compared. The study shows that variability in yield is more likely to be due to weather variability in medium and low production areas. The two best yield predictors are the temperature and then the Standardized Precipitation–Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) in July. While corn in the north Eastern regions is not significantly affected by weather variation, on the East coast, the weather-based mixed model is able to explain about 32% (corr = 0.57) of the yield variability, but in some particularly weather-sensitive states, such as Virginia, this number can reach 64% (corr = 0.80). Two applications are tested: yield estimation at the end of the year for monitoring purpose, and seasonal prediction. It is shown that some agro-climatic indices can significantly improve crop yield modeling when compared to simpler direct weather information (average correlation increase of 0.12 at the US scale). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Agro-climate indices; Corn yield; Statistical model; Weather impact model","agricultural modeling; agrometeorology; assessment method; climate effect; crop yield; forecasting method; index method; maize; statistical analysis; United States; Virginia; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

This study reports on mathematical modeling and testing of growth status for Chinese cabbage and white radish using unmanned aerial vehicle-red, green and blue (UAV-RGB) imagery for measurement of their biophysical properties. Chinese cabbage seedlings and white radish seeds were planted at 7-10-day intervals to provide a wide range of growth rates. Remotely sensed digital imagery data were collected for test fields at approximately one-week intervals using a UAV platform equipped with an RGB digital camera flying at 2 m/s at 20 m above ground. Radiometric calibrations for the RGB band sensors were performed on every UAV flight using standard calibration panels to minimize the effect of ever-changing light conditions on the RGB images. Vegetation fractions (VFs) of crops in each region of interest from the mosaicked ortho-images were calculated as the ratio of pixels classified as crops segmented using the Otsu threshold method and a vegetation index of excess green (ExG). Plant heights (PHs) were estimated using the structure from motion (SfM) algorithm to create 3D surface models from crop canopy data. Multiple linear regression equations consisting of three predictor variables (VF, PH, and VF × PH) and four different response variables (fresh weight, leaf length, leaf width, and leaf count) provided good fits with coefficients of determination (R2) ranging from 0.66 to 0.90. The validation results using a dataset of crop growth obtained in a different year also showed strong linear relationships (R2 &gt; 0.76) between the developed regression models and standard methods, confirming that the models make it possible to use UAV-RGB images for quantifying spatial and temporal variability in biophysical properties of Chinese cabbage and white radish over the growing season. © 2018 by the authors.","Crop surface model; Plant height; RGB; Structure from motion; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vegetation fraction","Antennas; Crops; Image segmentation; Linear regression; Seed; Three dimensional computer graphics; Vegetation; Multiple linear regression equations; Plant height; Radiometric calibrations; Spatial and temporal variability; Structure from motion; Structure from motion algorithm; Surface modeling; Vegetation fractions; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)",Article,Scopus

It is important to study biomass production of bioenergy crops and the impacts of these crops on water quantity and quality to identify environment-friendly and productive biofeedstock systems. SWAT2012 with a new tile drainage routine and improved perennial grass and tree growth simulation was used to model long-term annual biomass yields, streamflow, tile flow, sediment load, and nutrient losses under various bioenergy scenarios in an extensively agricultural watershed in the Midwestern US. Simulated results from bioenergy crop scenarios were compared with those from the baseline. The results showed that simulated annual crop yields were similar to observed county level values for corn and soybeans, and were reasonable for Miscanthus, switchgrass and hybrid poplar. Removal of 38% of corn stover (3.74 Mg/ha/yr) with Miscanthus production on highly erodible areas and marginal land (17.49 Mg/ha/yr) provided the highest biofeedstock production (279,000 Mg/yr). Streamflow, tile flow, erosion and nutrient losses were reduced under bioenergy crop scenarios of bioenergy crops on highly erodible areas and marginal land. Corn stover removal did not result in significant water quality changes. The increase in sediment and nutrient losses under corn stover removal could be offset with the combination of other bioenergy crops. Potential areas for bioenergy crop production when meeting the criteria above were small (10.88 km2), thus the ability to produce biomass and improve water quality was not substantial. The study showed that corn stover removal with bioenergy crops both on highly erodible areas and marginal land could provide more biofuel production relative to the baseline, and was beneficial to water quality at the watershed scale, providing guidance for further research on evaluation of bioenergy crop scenarios in a typical extensively tile-drained watershed in the Midwestern U.S. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biofeedstock production; Hydrologic modeling; Perennial grasses; Short rotation woody crops; Tile drainage; Water quality modeling","Agricultural robots; Biofuels; Biomass; Cultivation; Ecology; Forestry; Nutrients; Quality control; Stream flow; Water quality; Watersheds; Hydrologic modeling; Perennial grass; Short-rotation woody crops; Tile drainage; Water quality modeling; Crops; bioenergy; crop plant; grass; growth rate; hydrological modeling; perennial plant; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; water quality; watershed; Article; bioenergy; biomass production; controlled study; energy yield; environmental impact; grass; hybrid; maize; Miscanthus; nonhuman; nutritional parameters; Panicum virgatum; perennial plant; plant growth; Populus; priority journal; quality control procedures; sediment; simulation; soybean; statistical model; tree growth; United States; water flow; water quality; watershed; United States; Glycine max; Miscanthus; Panicum virgatum; Poaceae; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Traditionally, forest AGB is spatially estimated by integrating satellite images, in particular, optical data, with field plots from forest inventory programs. However, field data are limited in remote and unmanaged areas. In addition, optical reflectance usually saturates at high-density biomass level and is subject to cloud contaminations. Thus, this study aimed to develop a deep learning based workflow for mapping forest AGB by integrating Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1A images with airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. A reference AGB map was derived from the wall-to-wall LiDAR data and field measurements. The LiDAR plots - stratified random samples of forest biomass extracted from the LiDAR simulated strips in the reference map - were adopted as a surrogate for traditional field plots. In addition to the deep learning model, i.e., stacked sparse autoencoder network (SSAE), five different prediction techniques including multiple stepwise linear regressions, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, back propagation neural networks, and random forest were individually used to establish the relationship between LiDAR-derived forest biomass and the satellite predictors. Optical variables (Landsat 8 OLI), SAR variables (Sentinel-1A), and their combined variables were individually input to the six prediction models. Results showed that the SSAE model had the best performance for the forest biomass estimation. The combined optical and microwave dataset as explanatory variables improved the modeling performance compared to either the optical-only or microwave-only data, regardless of prediction algorithms. The best mapping accuracy was obtained by the SSAE model with inputs of optical and microwave integrated metrics that yielded R2 of 0.812, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 21.753 Mg/ha, and relative RMSE (RMSEr) of 14.457%. Overall, the SSAE model with inputs of combined Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-1A information could result in accurate estimation of forest biomass by using the stratification-sampled and LiDAR-derived AGB as ground reference data. The modeling workflow has the potential to promote future forest growth monitoring and carbon stock assessment across large areas. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Biomass; deep learning (DL); Landsat 8; light detection and ranging (LiDAR); Sentinel-1A; stacked sparse autoencoder network (SSAE)","Backpropagation; Biomass; Carbon; Data integration; Decision trees; Deep learning; Forecasting; Forestry; Imaging techniques; Learning systems; Mapping; Mean square error; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Optical image storage; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Satellites; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Auto encoders; Biomedical optical imaging; LANDSAT; Light detection and ranging; Optical imaging; Optical saturation; Sentinel-1; Optical radar; aboveground biomass; forest inventory; lidar; machine learning; mapping; modeling; satellite imagery; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar",Article,Scopus

The objective of this study was to assess the impacts of climate change on streamflow and therefore on hydropower potential of the Grande river basin headwater region, Southeast Brazil. For this purpose, the SWAT model was used to simulate the hydrological behaviour of the headwaters under the Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, obtained from the Regional Climate Models Eta-HadGEM-ES and Eta-MIROC5 between the years 2007 and 2099. Through power duration curves we estimated the hypothetical average annual energy production at three hydropower plants installed in cascade in the region, being, from upstream to downstream, Camargos, Itutinga and Funil. These plants account for a potential of 277 MW. SWAT was able to simulate the streamflow of the Grande river basin headwaters and, therefore, to reproduce the observed monthly streamflow from the baseline period (1961–2005) reasonably well for all three hydropower plants. In general, the results indicated a significant streamflow reduction and therefore reductions in runoff during all the simulated periods and all radiative forcing analysed, when compared to the baseline period. Thus, these results led to reductions in hydropower potential and hence decreases of the annual energy production varying from 6.1 to 58.6% throughout the 21st Century. © 2017 Royal Meteorological Society","Eta-HadGEM-ES; Eta-MIROC5; headwater basin; hydrological simulation; hydropower potential; SWAT model","Atmospheric radiation; Climate models; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Rivers; Stream flow; Water resources; Watersheds; Eta-MIROC5; Headwater basins; Hydrological simulations; Hydropower potential; SWAT model; Climate change; climate change; computer simulation; headwater; hydroelectric power; hydroelectric power plant; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; numerical model; streamflow; twenty first century; Brazil; Rio Grande Basin [Brazil]",Article,Scopus

CO2 fluxes were measured using the dynamic closed chamber system, while spectral vegetation indices were determined using SKYE multispectral sensors. Based on spectral data collected in 2011 and 2013, various models to estimate net ecosystem productivity and gross ecosystem productivity were developed. These models were then verified based on data collected in 2012. The R2 for the best model based on spectral data ranged from 0.71 to 0.83 and from 0.78 to 0.92, for net ecosystem productivity and gross ecosystem productivity, respectively.

Many studies have been undertaken globally to estimate grassland biomass by using satellite remote sensing data, but rarely in systems like Ireland's intensively managed, but small-scale pastures, where grass is grazed as well as harvested for winter fodder. Multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models were developed to estimate the grassland biomass (kg dry matter/ha/day) of two intensively managed grassland farms in Ireland. For the first test site (Moorepark) 12 years (2001-2012) and for second test site (Grange) 6 years (2001- 2005, 2007) of in situ measurements (weekly measured biomass) were used for model development. Five vegetation indices plus two raw spectral bands (RED=red band, NIR=Near Infrared band) derived from an 8-day MODIS product (MOD09Q1) were used as an input for all three models. Model evaluation shows that the ANFIS (R2 Moorepark = 0.85, RMSEMoorepark = 11.07; R2 Grange = 0.76, RMSEGrange = 15.35) has produced improved estimation of biomass as compared to the ANN and MLR.

It has received limited attention compared to other sources of ISIS revenues such as oil, looting, ransom, foreign donations and various forms of taxation. We estimate winter crops production of wheat and barley in ISIS-controlled areas in both Syria and Iraq for the years 2014–2015 and irrigated summer crops production (cotton) in Northeast Syria. We show that remote sensing can give a credible estimation of agricultural production in the absence of statistics. With evidence from MODIS Aqua and Terra Satellites as well as Landsat imagery, we find that agricultural production in ISIS-controlled Syrian and Iraqi zones has been sustained in 2014 and 2015, despite the detrimental impact of conflict. After a drought in 2014 production was able to capitalize on improved rainfalls in 2015. First indications show that the winter grain harvest of 2016 in Iraqi territories of ISIS was significantly above pre-conflict mean and below pre-conflict mean in its Syrian territories. We also show how water flows along the Euphrates have impacted production. We estimate the revenue that ISIS can derive from wheat and barley production and the likely magnitude of an exportable surplus. Agricultural production gives the group a degree of resilience, although its economy is not sustainable in the longer run and could be affected by military collapse. Taxation of recurrent income streams such as agriculture will become more important for ISIS as its extractive sources of revenues show signs of dwindling. Beside non-grain food imports, agricultural production is crucial for its political legitimacy by ensuring food provision to the broader population.

Three methodologies are compared-the “direct approach” (DA), the “Threshold Adaptation” approach (TA), and the “Positive Approach” (Pos)-as well as a method called “Singularity Stochastic Removal” (SSR) specifically developed for precipitation, all based on the same adjustment technique. Unlike the three other models, SSR allows dealing in the same way with the situations where the precipitation model has too many wet days or not with respect to the reference data. SSR also avoids separating the correction of the occurrence from that of the intensity, which constitutes a flexible tool. First, the four approaches are applied to a historical regional climate model precipitation run. Evaluations are realized through occurrence- and intensity-related criteria. Although SSR, DA, and Pos may be close to each other depending on the criterion, in general, SSR provides the best results when all criteria are accounted for. This is even more true when the classical assumption that “the model precipitation had too many wet days” does not hold. The BC methods are also intercompared over the 2071-2100 period. The different BC methods are in agreement with previous studies, with relatively equivalent evolutions from 1976-2005 to 2071-2100, although nuances are present from one BC method to another. As a global conclusion, the SSR method for precipitation is a good compromise to correct both occurrences and intensities. © 2016. American Geophysical Union.

Simulation models provide excellent instruments for researchers to gain more insight into relevant processes and best agricultural practices and provide tools for planners for decision making support. The extent to which models are capable of reliable extrapolation and prediction is important for exploring new farming systems or assessing the impacts of future land and climate changes.A performance assessment was conducted by testing six detailed state-of-the-art models for simulation of nitrate leaching (ARMOSA, COUPMODEL, DAISY, EPIC, SIMWASER/STOTRASIM, SWAP/ANIMO) for lysimeter data of the Wagna experimental field station in Eastern Austria, where the soil is highly vulnerable to nitrate leaching.Three consecutive phases were distinguished to gain insight in the predictive power of the models: 1) a blind test for 2005-2008 in which only soil hydraulic characteristics, meteorological data and information about the agricultural management were accessible; 2) a calibration for the same period in which essential information on field observations was additionally available to the modellers; and 3) a validation for 2009-2011 with the corresponding type of data available as for the blind test. A set of statistical metrics (mean absolute error, root mean squared error, index of agreement, model efficiency, root relative squared error, Pearson's linear correlation coefficient) was applied for testing the results and comparing the models.None of the models performed good for all of the statistical metrics. Models designed for nitrate leaching in high-input farming systems had difficulties in accurately predicting leaching in low-input farming systems that are strongly influenced by the retention of nitrogen in catch crops and nitrogen fixation by legumes. An accurate calibration does not guarantee a good predictive power of the model.

Inconsistencies are demonstrated in the current indicators used for assessment of waterlogging potential across agricultural landscapes as well as in parameters measured in waterlogging studies. It is suggested that predictions of waterlogging potential for landscapes should be based on a minimum dataset that includes pedological, topographical, and climate data for the defined area, as well as observations of plant morphological appearance and visible surface water. The review also summarises the effects of low oxygen concentration in soil on rhizosphere processes, and discusses evidence for direct effects on plant physiology of reductions in soil oxygen caused by waterlogging. Finally, the review describes current crop growth, water use, and yield simulation models used in Australia (SWAGMAN, DRAINMOD, and APSIM) that incorporate waterlogging stress. It is suggested that there is scope for modifications to these models based on recent improved understanding of plant physiological responses to waterlogging and on further research. The review concludes that improvements in modelling waterlogging outcomes to assist growth and yield predictions should ultimately enhance management capacity for growers. © 2013 CSIRO.","aquaporin; drainage; economics.; hydraulic conductivity; raised bed; soil aeration","agricultural land; agricultural production; climate; data set; drainage; hydraulic conductivity; oxygen; remediation; rhizosphere; soil-vegetation interaction; surface water; water use; waterlogging; Australia",Review,Scopus

The uncertainty is quantified using the Cramer-von Mises score (CvM) to measure the ""distance"" between the simulated and observed CDFs. The ability of the three RCMs and CDF-t to simulate the ""climate"" variability is quantified with the explained variance, variance ratio and extreme occurrence. The study shows that despite their differences, the three RCMs display very similar performance. In terms of global distributions (i.e. CvM), all models perform better than ERA-40 for both seasons and variables. However, looking at variance criteria, RCMs are not always much better than ERA-40 reanalyses, whereas CDF-t produces accurate results when applied to ERA-40. In a second step, a combined statistical/dynamical downscaling approach has been used, consisting in applying CDF-t to the RCM outputs. It shows that CDF-t applied to the RCM outputs does not necessarily produce better results than those from CDF-t directly applied to ERA-40. It also shows that CDF-t applied to RCMs generally improves the downscaled CDFs and that the ""additional"" added value of CDF-t applied to the RCMs is independent of the performance of the RCMs in terms of CvM, explained variance, variance ratio and extreme occurrence. © 2012 Author(s).",,"assessment method; climate modeling; downscaling; rainfall; regional climate; statistical analysis; temperature effect; wind forcing; Mediterranean Sea",Article,Scopus

The location and quantity of BMPs were obtained from the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service National Conservation Planning (NCP) database. A Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was built and calibrated for this predominantly agricultural Eagle Creek watershed, incorporating NCP BMPs and monitoring data at the watershed outlet, an edge-of-field (EOF), and tile monitoring sites. Input air temperature modifications were required to induce simulated tile flow to match monitoring data. Calibration heavily incorporated tile monitoring data to correctly proportion surface and subsurface flow, but calibration statistics were unsatisfactory at the EOF and tile monitoring sites. At the watershed outlet, satisfactory to very good calibration statistics were achieved over a 2-year calibration period, and satisfactory statistics were found in the 2-year validation period. SWAT fixes parameters controlling nutrients primarily at the watershed level; a refinement of these parameters at a smaller-scale could improve field-level calibration. Field-scale modeling results indicate that filter strips (FS) are the most effective single BMPs at reducing dissolved reactive phosphorus, and FS typically decreased sediment and nutrient yields when added to any other BMP or BMP combination. Cover crops were the most effective single, in-field practice by reducing nutrient loads over winter months. Watershed-scale results indicate BMPs can reduce sediment and nutrients, but reductions due to NCP BMPs in the Eagle Creek watershed for all water-quality constituents were less than 10%. Hypothetical scenarios simulated with increased BMP acreages indicate larger investments of the appropriate BMP or BMP combination can decrease watershed level loads. © 2018 by the authors.","Best management practices (BMPs); Edge-of-field (EOF); Field-scale; Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI); Nutrients; Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT); Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB)","Agriculture; Calibration; Conservation; Lakes; Monitoring; Nutrients; Restoration; Water quality; Best management practice (BMPs); Edge-of-field (EOF); Field scale; Great lakes; Lake Erie; Soil and water assessment tool; Watersheds",Article,Scopus

The final model accounts for ~70% of the variation in winter wheat yield and can be used to forecast yields 1 mo before harvest.

Recent observations and modeling studies have suggested that the ice sheet contribution to future sea level rise could have been underestimated in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. The ensuing freshwater discharge coming from ice sheets could have significant impacts on global climate, and especially on the vulnerable tropical areas. During the last glacial/deglacial period, megadrought episodes were observed in the Sahel region at the time of massive iceberg surges, leading to large freshwater discharges. In the future, such episodes have the potential to induce a drastic destabilization of the Sahelian agro-ecosystem. Using a climate modeling approach, we investigate this issue by superimposing on the Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 (RCP8.5) baseline experiment a Greenland flash melting scenario corresponding to an additional sea level rise ranging from 0.5 m to 3 m. Our model response to freshwater discharge coming from Greenland melting reveals a significant decrease of the West African monsoon rainfall, leading to changes in agricultural practices. Combined with a strong population increase, described by different demography projections, important human migration flows could be potentially induced. We estimate that, without any adaptation measures, tens to hundreds million people could be forced to leave the Sahel by the end of this century. On top of this quantification, the sea level rise impact over coastal areas has to be superimposed, implying that the Sahel population could be strongly at threat in case of rapid Greenland melting.","Climate change; Ice sheet melting; Impact; Sahel; Vulnerability","fresh water; rain; sea water; Article; climate change; demography; Greenland; human; ice sheet; melting point; migration; population density; population migration; precipitation; priority journal; rural population; Sahel; surface area; vulnerable population; climate change; computer simulation; freezing; greenhouse effect; ice cover; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; time factor; water flow; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Freezing; Fresh Water; Global Warming; Greenland; Humans; Ice Cover; Models, Theoretical; Seawater; Time Factors; Water Movements",Article,Scopus

This study investigated the influence of soil factors variability on the suitability of 12 Mediterranean crops in southern Spain. To represent the variability in elevation, lithology, and soil, two latitudinal and longitudinal soil transects (TA and TB) were considered and sampled in 63 representative points at regular 4. km intervals. This research also aimed to determine how to maximize soil potential by improving limiting factors as drainage, carbonate content, salinity, and sodium saturation. Soil suitability evaluation ranged between optimum and not suitable classes along TA and TB. The decrease in the severity of soil limiting factors in the improved scenario leads to an increase in soil suitability for the 12 crops along TA and TB transects, except in segments with shallow soils and very coarse texture. Soil evaluation and spatial analyses of soil suitability for the 12 crops under current situation and improved scenario, including optimum and not suitable soils, are helpful to achieve a sustainable land management in the studied area.

The performances of the crop model for two different assimilation methods were compared by employing particle filters (PF) and the proper orthogonal decomposition-based ensemble four-dimensional variational (POD4DVar) strategies. The uncertainties of wheat yield estimates due to different assimilation temporal scales (phenological stages and temporal frequencies) and spatial scale were also analyzed. The results showed that, compared with the crop model without assimilation and with PF-based assimilation, a better yield estimate performance resulted when the POD4DVar-based strategy was used at the field scale. When using this strategy, root mean square errors (RMSE) of 523 kg·ha-1, 543 kg·ha-1 and 172 kg·ha-1 and relative errors (RE) of 5.65%, 5.91% and 7.77% were obtained at the field plot scale, a pixel scale of 1 km and the county scale, respectively. Although the best yield estimates were obtained when all of the observed LAIs were assimilated into the crop model, an acceptable estimate of crop yield could also be achieved by assimilating fewer observations between jointing and anthesis periods of the crop growth season. With decreasing assimilation frequency and pixel resolution, the accuracy of the crop yield estimates decreased; however, the computation time decreased. Thus, it is important to consider reasonable spatio-temporal scales to obtain tradeoffs between accuracy and effectiveness in regional wheat estimates. © 2017 by the authors.","Assimilation; Crop model; Four-dimensional variational; Leaf area index; Particle filter; Spatio-temporal; Uncertainties","Agriculture; Distributed computer systems; Mean square error; Monte Carlo methods; Pixels; Principal component analysis; Target tracking; Uncertainty analysis; Assimilation; Crop model; Four dimensional variational; Leaf Area Index; Particle filter; Spatio temporal; Uncertainties; Crops",Article,Scopus

Despite their importance, limited attention has been given to these uncertainty sources. We compare 27 projected temperature and precipitation indices over 22 regions of the world (including the global land area) in the near (2021-2060) and distant future (2061-2100), calculated using four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), five GCMs, two bias-correction methods, and three reference forcing data sets. To widen the variety of forcing data sets, we developed a new forcing data set, S14FD, and incorporated it into this study. The results show that S14FD is more accurate than other forcing data sets in representing the observed temperature and precipitation extremes in recent decades (1961-2000 and 1979-2008). The use of different bias-correction methods and forcing data sets contributes more to the total uncertainty in the projected precipitation index values in both the near and distant future than the use of different GCMs and RCPs. However, GCM appears to be the most dominant uncertainty source for projected temperature index values in the near future, and RCP is the most dominant source in the distant future. Our findings encourage climate risk assessments, especially those related to precipitation extremes, to employ multiple bias-correction methods and forcing data sets in addition to using different GCMs and RCPs. © 2017.

In this work, we analyze if and to what extent the bias in the simulated crop yield can be reduced by using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model to downscale ERA-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis) rainfall and radiation data. Then, we evaluate the uncertainties resulting from both the choice of the physical parameterizations of the WRF model and its internal variability. Impact assessments were performed at two sites in Sub-Saharan Africa and by using two crop models to simulate Niger pearl millet and Benin maize yields. We find that the use of the WRF model to downscale ERA-Interim climate data generally reduces the bias in the simulated crop yield, yet this reduction in bias strongly depends on the choices in the model setup. Among the physical parameterizations considered, we show that the choice of the land surface model (LSM) is of primary importance. When there is no coupling with a LSM, or when the LSM is too simplistic, the simulated precipitation and then the simulated yield are null, or respectively very low; therefore, coupling with a LSM is necessary. The convective scheme is the second most influential scheme for yield simulation, followed by the shortwave radiation scheme. The uncertainties related to the internal variability of the WRF model are also significant and reach up to 30% of the simulated yields. These results suggest that regional models need to be used more carefully in order to improve the reliability of impact assessments. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.","crop model; EPIC; regional climate model; SARRA-H; West Africa; WRF","Agriculture; Climate change; Crops; Weather forecasting; Crop model; EPIC; Regional climate modeling; SARRA-H; West Africa; WRF; Climate models; assessment method; climate effect; climate modeling; crop yield; error analysis; regional climate; uncertainty analysis; weather forecasting; West Africa; Pennisetum glaucum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

This LMDZ5B version includes a mass-flux representation of the thermal plumes or rolls of the convective boundary layer, coupled to a bi-Gaussian statistical cloud scheme, as well as a parameterization of the cold pools generated below cumulonimbus by re-evaporation of convective precipitation. The triggering and closure of deep convection are now controlled by lifting processes in the sub-cloud layer. An available lifting energy and lifting power are provided both by the thermal plumes and by the spread of cold pools. The individual parameterizations were carefully validated against the results of explicit high resolution simulations. Here we present the work done to go from those new concepts and developments to a full 3D atmospheric model, used in particular for climate change projections with the IPSL-CM5B coupled model. Based on a series of sensitivity experiments, we document the differences with the previous LMDZ5A version distinguishing the role of parameterization changes from that of model tuning. Improvements found previously in single-column simulations of case studies are confirmed in the 3D model: (1) the convective boundary layer and cumulus clouds are better represented and (2) the diurnal cycle of convective rainfall over continents is delayed by several hours, solving a longstanding problem in climate modeling. The variability of tropical rainfall is also larger in LMDZ5B at intraseasonal time-scales. Significant biases of the LMDZ5A model however remain, or are even sometimes amplified. The paper emphasizes the importance of parameterization improvements and model tuning in the frame of climate change studies as well as the new paradigm that represents the improvement of 3D climate models under the control of single-column case studies simulations. © 2012 The Author(s).","Climate change projections; Climate modeling; Deep convection; Physical parameterizations; Shallow convection","atmospheric convection; atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; climate modeling; cold pool; convective boundary layer; cumulonimbus; cumulus; diurnal variation; parameterization; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; turbulence",Article,Scopus

Historic simulations for winter wheat and silage maize from 1991 to 2010 were used to examine the model performance at the county level in reproducing the county statistics for crop yields. The focus laid on the replication of mean yield levels and interannual crop yield variability. Simulations of silage maize performed better than simulations of winter wheat with R2-values for interannual yield variability of 0.72 and 0.26 respectively at the national level. In particular, silage maize showed a tendency to perform better in areas of lower soil water availability. The reasons for the clear superiority of silage maize were supposedly the short growing season, the lower susceptibility to pests and diseases and, hence, the direct translation of water stress into yield reductions. This signal was less evident for winter wheat and was additionally superposed of climate induced biotic and abiotic stresses – primarily originating in the cold season - which were not implemented in the model. Overall, the simulation bias seemed to originate rather from unconsidered processes than from uncertainties of input data or in model parameterisation. © 2018","Eco-hydrological modelling; EPIC; Germany; Regional crop modelling; Silage maize; SWIM; Winter wheat","agricultural modeling; annual variation; crop yield; ecohydrology; hydrological modeling; integrated approach; maize; parameterization; silage; simulation; water stress; winter; Germany; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Production efficiency models (PEMs) estimate Gross Primary Production (GPP) as a function of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy, which is derived from Earth observation. GPP can be summed over the growing season and adjusted by a crop-specific harvest index to estimate yield. Although PEMs have many advantages over other crop yield models, they are not widely used, because performance is relatively poor. Here, a new PEM is presented that addresses deficiencies for macro-scale application: Production Efficiency Model Optimized for Crops (PEMOC). It was developed by optimizing functions from the literature with GPP estimated by eddy covariance flux towers in the United States. The model was evaluated using newly developed Earth observation products and county-level yield statistics for major crops. PEMOC generally performed better at the field and county level than another commonly used PEM, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer GPP (MOD17). PEMOC and MOD17 estimates of GPP had an R2 and root mean squared error (RMSE) over the growing season of 0.71–0.89 (9.87–17.47 g CO2 d−1) and 0.59–0.83 (6.86–22.20 g CO2 d−1) with flux tower GPP. PEMOC produced R2s and RMSE of 0.70 (0.52), 0.60 (0.61), and 0.62 (0.59), while MOD17 produced R2s and RMSE of 0.65 (0.57), 0.53 (0.66), and 0.65 (0.57) with corn, soybean, and winter wheat crop yield anomalies. The sample size of rice was small, so yields were compared directly. PEMOC and MOD17 produced R2s and RMSE of 0.53 (3.42 t ha−1) and 0.40 (4.89 t ha−1). The most sizeable model improvements were seen for C3 and C4 crops during emergence/senescence and peak season, respectively. These improvements were attributed to C3 and C4 partitioning, optimized temperature and moisture constraints, and an evapotranspiration-based soil moisture index. © 2018","Biomass; Earth observation; Evapotranspiration; NPP; WUE","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Efficiency; Evapotranspiration; Macros; Mean square error; Observatories; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Earth observation data; Earth observation products; Earth observations; Fraction of photosynthetically active radiations; Gross primary production; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Physiological informations; Root mean squared errors; Crops; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural modeling; biomass; crop yield; Earth; ecophysiology; eddy covariance; efficiency measurement; estimation method; evapotranspiration; flux measurement; growing season; MODIS; net primary production; optimization; primary production; remote sensing; water use efficiency; United States; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Although water issues alone have not been the sole trigger for warfare in the past, tensions over freshwater management and use represent one of the main concerns in political relations between riparian states and may exacerbate existing tensions, increase regional instability and social unrest. Previous studies made great efforts to understand how international water management problems were addressed by actors in a more cooperative or confrontational way. In this study, we analyze what are the pre-conditions favoring the insurgence of water management issues in shared water bodies, rather than focusing on the way water issues are then managed among actors. We do so by proposing an innovative analysis of past episodes of conflict and cooperation over transboundary water resources (jointly defined as “hydro-political interactions”). On the one hand, we aim at highlighting the factors that are more relevant in determining water interactions across political boundaries. On the other hand, our objective is to map and monitor the evolution of the likelihood of experiencing hydro-political interactions over space and time, under changing socioeconomic and biophysical scenarios, through a spatially explicit data driven index. Historical cross-border water interactions were used as indicators of the magnitude of corresponding water joint-management issues. These were correlated with information about river basin freshwater availability, climate stress, human pressure on water resources, socioeconomic conditions (including institutional development and power imbalances), and topographic characteristics. This analysis allows for identification of the main factors that determine water interactions, such as water availability, population density, power imbalances, and climatic stressors. The proposed model was used to map at high spatial resolution the probability of experiencing hydro-political interactions worldwide. This baseline outline is then compared to four distinct climate and population density projections aimed to estimate trends for hydro-political interactions under future conditions (2050 and 2100), while considering two greenhouse gases emission scenarios (moderate and extreme climate change). The combination of climate and population growth dynamics is expected to impact negatively on the overall hydro-political risk by increasing the likelihood of water interactions in the transboundary river basins, with an average increase ranging between 74.9% (2050 – population and moderate climate change) to 95% (2100 - population and extreme climate change). Future demographic and climatic conditions are expected to exert particular pressure on already water stressed basins such as the Nile, the Ganges/Brahmaputra, the Indus, the Tigris/Euphrates, and the Colorado. The results of this work allow us to identify current and future areas where water issues are more likely to arise, and where cooperation over water should be actively pursued to avoid possible tensions especially under changing environmental conditions. From a policy perspective, the index presented in this study can be used to provide a sound quantitative basis to the assessment of the Sustainable Development Goal 6, Target 6.5 “Water resources management”, and in particular to indicator 6.5.2 “Transboundary cooperation”. © 2018 The Authors","Hydro-political risk; Random Forest regression; Transboundary water interactions; Water cross-border issues","climate change; climate conditions; data set; political boundary; population density; population dynamics; population growth; regression analysis; resource management; risk assessment; river basin; socioeconomic conditions; spatial resolution; sustainable development; transboundary cooperation; water availability; water management; water resource; Brahmaputra River; Colorado River [North America]; Euphrates River; Ganges River; Indus River; Tigris River",Article,Scopus

Predicting water quality as affected by land use and management requires using dynamic agro-hydrogeological models. In this study, an agronomic model (STICS) and a hydrogeological model (MODCOU) have been associated in order to simulate nitrogen fluxes in the Seine-Normandie Basin, which is affected by nitrate pollution of groundwater due to intensive farming systems. This modeling platform was used to predict and understand the spatial and temporal evolution of water quality over the 1971–2013 period. A quality assurance protocol (Refsgaard et al. Environ Model Softw 20: 1201–1215, 2005) was used to qualify the reliability of STICS outputs. Four iterative runs of the model were carried out with improved parameterization of soils and crop management without any change in the model. Improving model inputs changed much more the spatial distribution of simulated N losses than their mean values. STICS slightly underestimated the crop yields compared to the observed values at the administrative district scale. The platform also slightly underestimated the nitrate concentration at the outlet level with a mean difference ranging from −1.4 to −9.2 mg NO3 L−1 according to the aquifer during the last decade.

The management of salinization and drainage problems at the regional level are considerably hindered due to lack of good quality data because the regional studies entail distributed data, while usual hydrological measurements offer only point data. With the emergence of new geospatial techniques and tools such as GIS and remote sensing, the regional salinization and drainage studies have become easier in recent times. The GIS and remote sensing techniques are vital means and provide a better alternative to the conventional techniques in monitoring and assessment of poor-drainage affected salinized areas. These geospatial techniques present apt solutions to map the degree and severity of drainage-induced land salinization, mainly in large regions. This paper provides an overview of GIS and remote sensing techniques used for the management of salinization and drainage problems of water resources in irrigated areas. The indication of the salinization and drainage problems of water resources along with the importance of the study is presented.

This paper aims to report select recent advancements in the field of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing of crops. In order to make the paper comprehensive and more meaningful for the readers, an attempt has also been made to include discussion on various technologies of SAR sensors used for remote sensing of agricultural crops viz. basic SAR sensor, SAR interferometry (InSAR), SAR polarimetry (PolSAR) and polarimetric interferometry SAR (PolInSAR). The paper covers all the methodologies used for various agricultural applications like empirically based models, machine learning based models and radiative transfer theorem based models. A thorough literature review of more than 100 research papers indicates that SAR polarimetry can be used effectively for crop inventory and biophysical parameters estimation such are leaf area index, plant water content, and biomass but shown less sensitivity towards plant height as compared to SAR interferometry. Polarimetric SAR Interferometry is preferable for taking advantage of both SAR polarimetry and SAR interferometry. Numerous studies based upon multi-parametric SAR indicate that optimum selection of SAR sensor parameters enhances SAR sensitivity as a whole for various agricultural applications. It has been observed that researchers are widely using three models such are empirical, machine learning and radiative transfer theorem based models. Machine learning based models are identified as a better approach for crop monitoring using radar remote sensing data.

A network of land-based National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) weather stations has been typically used as a primary source of climate input for agro-ecosystem models. However, the network may lack the density to adequately capture spatial climate variability throughout large watersheds. High-resolution weather datasets based on 4 km × 4 km grid, such as Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) and Parameter–Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM), have become increasingly available as alternatives to conventional land-based networks. The goal of this study was to evaluate impacts of the three weather datasets, NCDC, NEXRAD, and PRISM, on hydrologic processes in an agricultural catchment in Kansas. A method of collecting and processing three sets of weather input datasets was developed and applied to a calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for the Smoky Hill River watershed (SHRW) in west-central Kansas, which is sparsely covered by NCDC weather stations with fair to poor range of NEXRAD coverage. SHRW is a typical agricultural catchment in the Central Great Plains; research findings here may be applicable to large areas of the US with similar topography and climate conditions. The SWAT model based on PRISM dataset was able to capture daily streamflow alterations with a greater accuracy compared to NCDC and NEXRAD based SWAT models. With three different weather inputs, SWAT with NCDC consistently overestimated monthly stream discharges, while the SWAT models based on NEXRAD and PRISM datasets tended to underestimate monthly high flows of over 8 m3 s− 1 and overestimate monthly low flows of below 1 m3 s− 1. In general, all models overestimated streamflow in dry years and underestimated streamflow in wet years, however, the PRISM-based model generated smaller bias than the models utilizing NEXRAD or NCDC. The use of PRISM resulted in better statistical performance metrics for streamflow. The conducted study suggests that gridded weather datasets can significantly improve simulated streamflow at daily, monthly and yearly scales as compared to traditional land-based networks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate data; Kansas; NCDC; NEXRAD; PRISM; SWAT","agricultural catchment; air temperature; climate effect; comparative study; data set; discharge; hydrological response; NEXRAD; precipitation (climatology); soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; Great Plains; Kansas; United States",Article,Scopus

This work investigates the biophysical and hydrological effects of future climate change, including trends in CO2, in the St. Joseph River watershed, Eastern Corn Belt. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was first modified to take dynamic CO2 concentration as input. A regional crop leaf development curve from Landsat TM imagery was also used to adjust model performance in corn leaf area development for the historical period. A multi-objective calibration strategy was employed to ensure acceptable simulation of streamflow, seasonal crop growth and interannual crop yield simultaneously. The model was then driven by future climate change and CO2 data from three Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs), which are GFDL-CM2.1.1, NCAR-PCM1.3, and UKMO-HADCM3.1, under three Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES), including B1, A1 B and A2 to investigate crop and streamflow response in two future periods: the near future (2021–2050) and the far future (2061–2090). The St. Joseph River watershed is expected to experience more winter and spring precipitation, but slightly decreasing summer precipitation. Due to increasing temperature and decreasing summer moisture, more drought stress is predicted. Both annual total aeration and drought stress are projected to be more variable in both future periods. Although future CO2 enhancement will benefit the crop growth and final yield by improving radiation use efficiency (RUE) and reducing drought stresses, simulated corn yield still decreased by 6% in the near future period, and 16% in the far future period due to the combined effect of both climate change and CO2 enhancement. Streamflow redistribution is also predicted in the future. Stream discharge is projected to increase for the whole flow range in the near future period. For the far future period, high flows are expected to decrease, while low flows are expected to increase, indicating more hydrologic drought and flood events in the St. Joseph River watershed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; CO2; Crop modeling; Hydrology; SWAT","Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Crops; Drought; Floods; Hydrology; Moisture; Plants (botany); Rivers; Stream flow; Watersheds; Atmosphere ocean general circulation models; Crop model; Increasing temperatures; Multi-objective calibration; Radiation use efficiency; Soil and water assessment tool; Special report on emissions scenarios; SWAT; Climate change; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

In the Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB), complex hydrological models have been applied at various scales to help describe relationships between land use and water, nutrient, and sediment dynamics. This manuscript evaluated the capacity of the current Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to predict hydrological and water quality processes within WLEB at the finest resolution watershed boundary unit (NHDPlus) along with the current conditions and conservation scenarios. The process based SWAT model was capable of the fine-scale computation and complex routing used in this project, as indicated by measured data at five gaging stations. The level of detail required for fine-scale spatial simulation made the use of both hard and soft data necessary in model calibration, alongside other model adaptations. Limitations to the model's predictive capacity were due to a paucity of data in the region at the NHDPlus scale rather than due to SWAT functionality. Results of treatment scenarios demonstrate variable effects of structural practices and nutrient management on sediment and nutrient loss dynamics. Targeting treatment to acres with critical outstanding conservation needs provides the largest return on investment in terms of nutrient loss reduction per dollar spent, relative to treating acres with lower inherent nutrient loss vulnerabilities. Importantly, this research raises considerations about use of models to guide land management decisions at very fine spatial scales. Decision makers using these results should be aware of data limitations that hinder fine-scale model interpretation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation practice; Lake Erie; Model calibration; NHDPlus model; Soft data; Swat-SAS","Economics; Gaging; Lakes; Land use; Nutrients; Soil conservation; Water quality; Watersheds; Conservation practices; Lake Erie; Model calibration; Soft data; Swat-SAS; Decision making; conservation management; hydrological modeling; spatial data; water quality; watershed; Article; calibration; environmental protection; hydrology; land use; nutrient; priority journal; river basin; sediment; simulation; validation process; water quality; watershed; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Erie",Article,Scopus

Evaluation of hydrological responses and biofuel production potential of hypothetical land use change from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) to cellulosic bioenergy crops enables better understanding of the associated key agroecosystem processes and provides for the feasibility assessment of the targeted land use change in the SHP. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to assess the impacts of replacing cotton with perennial Alamo switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), Miscanthus × giganteus (Miscanthus sinensis Anderss. [Poaceae]), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and annual biomass sorghum on water balances, water use efficiency and biofuel production potential in the Double Mountain Fork Brazos watershed. Under perennial grass scenarios, the average (1994–2009) annual surface runoff from the entire watershed decreased by 6–8% relative to the baseline cotton scenario. In contrast, surface runoff increased by about 5% under the biomass sorghum scenario. Perennial grass land use change scenarios suggested an increase in average annual percolation within a range of 3–22% and maintenance of a higher soil water content during August to April compared to the baseline cotton scenario. About 19.1, 11.1, 3.2 and 8.8 Mg ha−1 of biomass could potentially be produced if cotton area in the watershed would hypothetically be replaced by Miscanthus, switchgrass, big bluestem and biomass sorghum, respectively.

Because automated sensors provide information about crop development and performance across time, we examined the hypothesis that ground-based canopy reflectance data might define crop phenology in new ways over the course of the season that can better forecast crop yield, protein, biomass, and grain nitrogen at harvest. This study examines the utility of daily Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data to monitor crop phenology over two complete growing seasons. Spectral reflectance data was collected at a total of sixteen plots under four different applied nitrogen (N) and soil water availability scenarios in rainfed soft white spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Using NDVI at solar noon, four phenological periods were derived from the data using a non-parametric regression locally weighted smoothing parameter (loess) to account for day to day variability, and piecewise linear regression to determine inflection points in the seasonal NDVI curve. The NDVI derived phenological metrics (i.e. the change in NDVI per day, and duration (in days) of each phenological period) were compared against daily NDVI values throughout the season to predict harvest metrics. Daily NDVI data were generally poor predictors of harvest metrics early in the growing season, and reached maximum predictive power at the onset of heading, and the middle of ripening for biomass and yield (R2~0.50 and ~0.25 during heading, respectively, and R2~0.50 during early ripening). Conversely, using both simple and multiple regression analysis, we found that harvest metrics were better explained using the rate and duration of NDVI derived phenological periods. Simple regressions between NDVI derived phenological metrics revealed several physiologically and management relevant correlations including strong, statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) relationships between the rate of tillering and stem extension and total biomass (R2=0.63 and 0.54, respectively), the duration of heading and yield (R2=0.67), the rate of ripening and grain protein concentration (R2=0.45), and the duration of ripening and grain N content (R2=0.43), for example. Using multiple regression analysis, 83% of the variance in yield, 67% in protein concentration, 87% in total biomass, and 80% in grain N was explained by two to three NDVI derived phenological metrics. Further, multiple regression analysis using NDVI derived phenological metrics from the early season (tillering and stem extension) substantially improved early prediction of yield and biomass as compared to daily NDVI data, whereas protein and grain N were primarily driven by metrics associated with the reproductive development of the crop (heading and ripening). This work has implications for improving in-season management decisions and understanding of the phenological drivers of harvest metrics using daily NDVI data as an evaluation tool. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Agronomy; Grain quality; Normalized difference vegetation index; Phenology; Phenotyping; Proximal remote sensing; Spectral reflectance sensors; Yield prediction","agronomy; automation; concentration (composition); crop performance; crop yield; growing season; hypothesis testing; NDVI; phenology; phenotype; phytomass; protein; regression analysis; remote sensing; ripening; soil water; wheat; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Particularly in regions that experience seasonal water scarcity, land use scenario assessments provide a valuable basis for the evaluation of possible future water shortages. The objective of this study is to dynamically integrate land use model projections with a hydrologic model to analyze potential future impacts of land use change on the water resources of a rapidly developing catchment upstream of Pune, India. For the first time projections from the urban growth and land use change model SLEUTH are employed as a dynamic input to the hydrologic model SWAT. By this means, impacts of land use changes on the water balance components are assessed for the near future (2009-2028) employing four different climate conditions (baseline, IPCC A1B, dry, wet). The land use change modeling results in an increase of urban area by + 23.1% at the fringes of Pune and by + 12.2% in the upper catchment, whereas agricultural land (- 14.0% and - 0.3%, respectively) and semi-natural area (- 9.1% and - 11.9%, respectively) decrease between 2009 and 2028. Under baseline climate conditions, these land use changes induce seasonal changes in the water balance components. Water yield particularly increases at the onset of monsoon (up to + 11.0 mm per month) due to increased impervious area, whereas evapotranspiration decreases in the dry season (up to - 15.1 mm per month) as a result of the loss of irrigated agricultural area. As the projections are made for the near future (2009-2028) land use change impacts are similar under IPCC A1B climate conditions. Only if more extreme dry years occur, an exacerbation of the land use change impacts can be expected. Particularly in rapidly changing environments an implementation of both dynamic land use change and climate change seems favorable to assess seasonal and gradual changes in the water balance. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Hydrologic modeling; India; Land use change; SLEUTH; SWAT","Agriculture; Catchments; Land use; Runoff; Urban growth; Water resources; Water supply; Hydrologic modeling; India; Land-use change; SLEUTH; SWAT; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; hydrological modeling; land cover; land use change; urban growth; water budget; water resource; agricultural land; Article; catchment; climate change; dry season; dynamics; environmental change; environmental impact; evapotranspiration; fluid balance; hydrology; India; irrigation (agriculture); land use; priority journal; season; seasonal variation; statistical model; urban area; urbanization; water supply; India; Maharashtra; Pune",Article,Scopus

Assessing the impact of LULC and climate changes on streamflow is typically done with a calibrated and validated watershed model. However, there is a debate on the degree of calibration required. The objective of this study was to quantify the variation in estimated relative and absolute changes in streamflow associated with LULC and climate changes with different calibration approaches. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied in an uncalibrated (UC), single outlet calibrated (OC), and spatially-calibrated (SC) mode to compare the relative and absolute changes in streamflow at 14 gaging stations within the Santa Cruz River Watershed in southern Arizona, USA. For this purpose, the effect of 3 LULC, 3 precipitation (P), and 3 temperature (T) scenarios were tested individually. For the validation period, Percent Bias (PBIAS) values were >100% with the UC model for all gages, the values were between 0% and 100% with the OC model and within 20% with the SC model. Changes in streamflow predicted with the UC and OC models were compared with those of the SC model. This approach implicitly assumes that the SC model is ""ideal"". Results indicated that the magnitude of both absolute and relative changes in streamflow due to LULC predicted with the UC and OC results were different than those of the SC model. The magnitude of absolute changes predicted with the UC and SC models due to climate change (both P and T) were also significantly different, but were not different for OC and SC models. Results clearly indicated that relative changes due to climate change predicted with the UC and OC were not significantly different than that predicted with the SC models. This result suggests that it is important to calibrate the model spatially to analyze the effect of LULC change but not as important for analyzing the relative change in streamflow due to climate change. This study also indicated that model calibration in not necessary to determine the direction of change in streamflow due to LULC and climate change. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Calibration; Climate change; LULC change; Santa cruz watershed; Streamflow; SWAT","Calibration; Climate models; Gaging; Land use; Stream flow; Watersheds; Land use/land cover; LULC change; Model calibration; River watersheds; Soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; Validation periods; Watershed modeling; Climate change; calibration; climate change; forecasting method; land cover; land use change; numerical model; prediction; streamflow; temperature effect; Argentina; Santa Cruz River [Santa Cruz]; Santa Cruz [Argentina]",Article,Scopus

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model has been applied worldwide to support sustainable land and water management in a changing climate. However, the inadequacies of the existing carbon algorithm in SWAT limit its application in assessing impacts of human activities on CO2 emission, one important source of greenhouse gasses (GHGs) that traps heat in the earth system and results in global warming. In this research, we incorporate a revised version of the CENTURY carbon model into SWAT to describe dynamics of soil organic matter (SOM)-residue and simulate land-atmosphere carbon exchange. We test this new SWAT-C model with daily eddy covariance (EC) observations of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and evapotranspiration (ET) and annual crop yield at six sites across the U.S. Midwest. Results show that SWAT-C simulates well multi-year average NEE and ET across the spatially distributed sites and capture the majority of temporal variation of these two variables at a daily time scale at each site. Our analyses also reveal that performance of SWAT-C is influenced by multiple factors, such as crop management practices (irrigated vs. rainfed), completeness and accuracy of input data, crop species, and initialization of state variables. Overall, the new SWAT-C demonstrates favorable performance for simulating land-atmosphere carbon exchange across agricultural sites with different soils, climate, and management practices. SWAT-C is expected to serve as a useful tool for including carbon flux into consideration in sustainable watershed management under a changing climate. We also note that extensive assessment of SWAT-C with field observations is required for further improving the model and understanding potential uncertainties of applying it across large regions with complex landscapes. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon; Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Net ecosystem exchange; Spatial and Temporal Variation; Watershed modeling","Crop management practices; Management practices; Net ecosystem exchange; Soil and water assessment tool; Soil and Water assessment tools; Spatial and temporal variation; Sustainable watershed management; Watershed modeling; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Environmental engineering; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Rain; Water management; Water supply; Climate models; carbon; carbon dioxide; rain; soil organic matter; algorithm; carbon flux; climate change; crop yield; evapotranspiration; global warming; greenhouse gas; modeling; net ecosystem exchange; soil organic matter; soil water; spatial variation; temporal variation; article; atmosphere; carbon cycle; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; crop management; cropland; dynamics; evapotranspiration; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; harvest; human activities; human impact (environment); irrigation (agriculture); landscape; priority journal; simulation; Soil and Water Assessment Tool; soil management; United States; water management; watershed management; Carbon; Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Net ecosystem exchange; Spatial and Temporal Variation; Watershed modeling; Agriculture; Biomass; Carbon Cycle; Climate; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Midwestern United States; Models, Theoretical; Soil; Water Quality",Article,Scopus

In order to estimate poppy capsule volume accurately using remotely sensed imagery, the selection of most appropriate models and predictor variables is essential. Multiple spectral indices with random forest (RF) regression were tested to estimate poppy capsule volume using an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). Data were collected from field-based physical measurements, in-field spectral measurements and from UAS flights with multispectral sensors over two poppy crops at Cambridge and Sorell in Tasmania, Australia. Field measured spectral signatures were convolved to the multispectral bands of a UAS mounted sensor. These convolved UAS spectral signatures were used to compute multiple spectral indices to develop the RF model, and select optimal model parameters based on root mean squared error (RMSE). In addition, the RF variable importance scores were used to rank the model variables, and to identify the best performing vegetation indices. In Cambridge, an RF model based on convolved UAS spectral signatures predicted capsule volume with an RMSE values ranging from 15.60 cm3 (10.27%) to 25.63 cm3 (14.45%) from training and validation dataset, respectively, indicating a strong relationship between SVIs and field measured capsule volume. An RF model trained on UAS multispectral data (measure not simulated) resulted an RMSE value of 19.39 cm3 (12.80%) based on training data set and an RMSE value of 26.85 cm3 (17.77%) with validation dataset. The Cambridge site model parameters and optimal variables were applied to the Sorell data, which showed a significant relationship between measured and predicted capsule volume (R2 0.72), with relative error of 26.25%. The results showed that the RF model developed using selected variables can help to predict capsule volume 2–3 weeks prior to harvest. © 2018","Precision agriculture; Random forest; UAS; Yield prediction","aircraft; algorithm; crop yield; multispectral image; precision agriculture; regression analysis; remote sensing; unmanned vehicle; Australia; Tasmania; Papaver",Article,Scopus

This article presents the hydrological modeling of the Mahanadi catchment up to Hirakud, located in the states of Chhattisgarh and Odisha in India, using the modified version of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with an interface of ArcView Geographic Information System software to predict soil erosion and sediment transport to the reservoir for improving its useful life. The data sources used in the study were: terrain data 90 m resolution of Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, Land Use and Land Cover derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, soil map published by National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning, India and meteorological data collected from India Meteorological Department, India. The study involves the analysis of sensitive parameters of the simulated data (discharge 15, sediment load 6); 5-year calibration and 3-year validation on daily basis to predict the discharge and sediment load. The sensitivity analysis was carried out using the Latin Hypercube and One-factor-At-a-Time. The results also show that the prediction of sediment yield is highly sensitive to the sizes of different sub-basins due to the sensitivity of topographic factors used in the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation. The graphical as well as statistical results achieved in this study indicate that the model is capable to identify critical erosion-prone areas within the watershed on the scale of sub-watershed which helps the hydrologists to introduce effective management practices at the lowest cost. The study shows that about 34% area of total catchment falls under high or above soil erosion zones with combination of coarse loamy type of soil and agricultural type of land use and land cover condition. The results of this study also identify regions of high sediment yield and sediment delivery ratio. To enhance the SWAT model performance, it is recommended to use sub-daily data and to prioritize soil erosion at the Hydrological Response Units level for improvement of watershed management. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Erosion; Hirakud reservoir; Prioritization; Sediment delivery ratio; Sediment yield; SWAT","Agricultural robots; Catchments; Digital storage; Erosion; Forecasting; Interface states; Land use; Meteorology; Reservoirs (water); Runoff; Sediment transport; Sensitivity analysis; Soil conservation; Soil surveys; Topography; Water conservation; Water management; Watersheds; Enhanced thematic mappers; Geographic information system software; Hydrological response unit; Modified universal soil loss equations; Reservoir storage capacity; Sediment delivery ratio; Shuttle radar topography mission; Soil and water assessment tool; Soils; modeling; prioritization; sediment transport; sediment yield; software; soil and water assessment tool; soil erosion; topography; Hirakud Reservoir; India; Odisha",Article,Scopus

The West African population is expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years. The responses of crops to short-term climate change is critical to the population and the decision makers tasked with food security. This leads to three questions: how will crop yields change in the near future? What influence will climate change have on crop failures? Which adaptation methods should be employed to ameliorate undesirable changes? An ensemble of near-term climate projections are used to simulate maize, millet and sorghum in West Africa in the recent historic period (1986-2005) and a near-term future when global temperatures are 1.5K above pre-industrial levels to assess the change in yield, yield variability and crop failure rate. Four crop models were used to simulate maize, millet and sorghum in West Africa in the historic and future climates. Across the majority of West Africa the maize, millet and sorghum yields are shown to fall. In the regions where yields increase, the variability also increases. This increase in variability increases the likelihood of crop failures, which are defined as yield negative anomalies beyond 1 standard deviation during the historic period. The increasing variability increases the frequency of crop failures across West Africa. The return time of crop failures falls from 8.8, 9.7 and 10.1 years to 5.2, 6.3 and 5.8 years for maize, millet and sorghum respectively. The adoption of heat-resistant cultivars and the use of captured rainwater have been investigated using one crop model as an idealized sensitivity test. The generalized doption of a cultivar resistant to high-temperature stress during flowering is shown to be more beneficial than using rainwater harvesting. © Author(s) 2018.",,"Agriculture; Climate models; Crops; Decision making; Failure analysis; Food supply; Adaptation methods; Climate projection; Global temperatures; High temperature stress; Pre-industrial levels; Rain water harvesting; Short-term climate changes; Standard deviation; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; decision making; food security; high temperature; maize; millet; sorghum; temperature effect; West Africa; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The aims of this study were to validate APSIM for prediction of stover and grain yield of corn in four contrasting soils with varied N fertilizer applications (156–269 kg N ha−1) and to predict timing and volume from artificial subsurface drains in continuous corn and corn-soybean rotations in a silty clay loam soil at West Lafayette, IN. The APSIM validation was carried-out using a long-term dataset of corn stover and grain yields from the North Central Region of IN. The CCC (Concordance Correlation Coefficient) and SB (Simulation Bias) were used to statistically evaluate the model performance. The CCC integrates precision through Pearson's correlation coefficient and accuracy by bias, and SB indicates the bias of the simulation from the measurement. The model demonstrated very good (CCC = 0.96; SB = 0%) and satisfactory (CCC = 0.85; SB = 2%) ability to simulate stover and grain yield, respectively. Grain yield was better predicted in continuous corn (CCC = 0.73–0.91; SB = 19–21%) than in corn-soybean rotations (CCC = 0.56–0.63; SB = 17–18%), while stover yield was well predicted in both crop rotations (CCC = 0.85–0.98; SB = 1–17%). The model demonstrated acceptable ability to simulate annual subsurface drainage in both rotations (CCC = 0.63–0.75; SB = 2–37%) with accuracy being lower in the continuous corn system than in corn-soybean rotation system (CCC = 0.61-0.63; SB = 9–12%). Daily subsurface drainage events were well predicted by APSIM during late spring and summer when crop water use was high, but under-predicted during fall, winter and early spring when evapotranspiration was low. Occasional flow events occurring in summer when soils were not saturated were not predicted by APSIM and may represent preferential flow paths currently not represented in the model.

The adoption of corn stover removal, switchgrass, and/or Miscanthus biofuel cropping systems was simulated to assess the impact of cellulosic biofuel production on pollutant losses. The stover removal results indicate removal of 20 or 50% of corn stover in the BRW would have negligible effects on streamflow and relatively minor or negligible effects on sediment and nutrient losses, even on higher sloped cropland. Complete cropland conversion into switchgrass or Miscanthus, resulted in reductions of streamflow, sediment, nitrate, and other pollutants ranging between 23-99%. The predicted nitrate reductions due to Miscanthus adoption were over two times greater compared to switchgrass, with the largest impacts occurring for tile-drained cropland. Targeting of switchgrass or Miscanthus on cropland ≥2% slope or ≥7% slope revealed a disproportionate amount of sediment and sediment-bound nutrient reductions could be obtained by protecting these relatively small areas of higher sloped cropland. Overall, the results indicate that all biofuel cropping systems could be effectively implemented in the BRW, with the most robust approach being corn stover removal adopted on tile-drained cropland in combination with a perennial biofuel crop on higher sloped landscapes.

RegCM4 was driven for the period 1970–2100 by the HadGEM2-ES and the MPI-ESM Global Climate Models (GCMs) under the RCP8.5 greenhouse gas concentration pathway. RegCM4 accurately simulates the WAM characteristics in terms of seasonal mean, seasonal cycle, interannual variability and extreme events of rainfall. Overall, both RegCM4 experiments are able to reproduce the large-scale atmospheric circulation for the reference period (i.e. present-day), and in fact show improved performance compared to the driving GCMs in terms of precipitation mean climatology and extreme events, although different shortcomings in the various models are still evident. Precipitation is projected to decrease (increase) over western (eastern) Sahel, although with different spatial detail between RegCM4 and the corresponding driving GCMs. Changes in extreme precipitation events show patterns in line with those of the mean change. The models project different changes in water budget over the Sahel region, where the MPI projects an increased deficit in local moisture supply (E < P) whereas the rest of models project a local surplus (E > P). The E–P change is primarily precipitation driven. The precipitation increases over the eastern and/or central Sahel are attributed to the increase of moisture convergence due to increased water vapor in the boundary layer air column and surface evaporation. On the other hand, the projected dry conditions over the western Sahel are associated with the strengthening of moisture divergence in the upper level (850–300 hPa) combined to both a southward migration of the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) and a weakening of rising motion between the core of the AEJ and the Tropical Easterly Jet. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Climate change; CORDEX; Dynamical downscaling; Hydrological cycle; Precipitation extreme; RegCM4; West African summer monsoon climate","climate change; climate prediction; downscaling; extreme event; hydrological cycle; monsoon; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; summer; West Africa",Article,Scopus

However, extracting patterns and features from this large corpus of data requires the use of machine learning (ML) tools to enable data assimilation and feature identification for stress phenotyping. Four stages of the decision cycle in plant stress phenotyping and plant breeding activities where different ML approaches can be deployed are (i) identification, (ii) classification, (iii) quantification, and (iv) prediction (ICQP). We provide here a comprehensive overview and user-friendly taxonomy of ML tools to enable the plant community to correctly and easily apply the appropriate ML tools and best-practice guidelines for various biotic and abiotic stress traits. High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) has unlocked new prospects for non-destructive field-based phenotyping. Autonomous, semi-autonomous, or manual platforms equipped with single or multiple sensors collect spatial and temporal data, resulting in massive amounts of data for analysis and storage.The enormous volume, variety, and velocity of HTP data generated by such platforms make it a 'big data' problem. Big data generated by these near real-time platforms must be efficiently archived and retrieved for analysis. The analysis and interpretation of these large datasets is quite challenging.Sophisticated data collection, storage, and processing are becoming ubiquitous, and newer areas of application are emerging constantly. One such relatively new domain is plant stress analytics.ML algorithms are a very promising approach for faster, more efficient, and better data analytics. ML being inherently multidisciplinary draws inspiration and utilizes concepts from probability theory, statistics, decision theory, optimization, and visualization.Most current applications of ML tools in plant sciences have focused on using a limited set of ML tools (SVM, ANN). A good understanding of which, when, and how various ML tools can be applied will be very informative to the plant community to leverage these ML tools. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Abiotic stress; Biotic stress; High-throughput phenotyping; Imaging; Machine learning; Plant breeding","breeding; high throughput screening; machine learning; metabolism; phenotype; physiological stress; plant; Breeding; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Machine Learning; Phenotype; Plants; Stress, Physiological",Review,Scopus

However, extrapolating site-scale observations to regional scales represents a major challenge confronting the agricultural modeling community. This study introduces a novel geospatial agricultural modeling system (GAMS) exploring the integration of the mechanistic Environmental Policy Integrated Climate model, spatially-resolved data, surveyed management data, and supercomputing functions for cropland C budgets estimates. This modeling system creates spatially-explicit modeling units at a spatial resolution consistent with remotely-sensed crop identification and assigns cropping systems to each of them by geo-referencing surveyed crop management information at the county or state level. A parallel computing algorithm was also developed to facilitate the computationally intensive model runs and output post-processing and visualization. We evaluated GAMS against National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) reported crop yields and inventory estimated county-scale cropland C budgets averaged over 2000-2008. We observed good overall agreement, with spatial correlation of 0.89, 0.90, 0.41, and 0.87, for crop yields, Net Primary Production (NPP), Soil Organic C (SOC) change, and Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), respectively. However, we also detected notable differences in the magnitude of NPP and NEE, as well as in the spatial pattern of SOC change. By performing crop-specific annual comparisons, we discuss possible explanations for the discrepancies between GAMS and the inventory method, such as data requirements, representation of agroecosystem processes, completeness and accuracy of crop management data, and accuracy of crop area representation. Based on these analyses, we further discuss strategies to improve GAMS by updating input data and by designing more efficient parallel computing capability to quantitatively assess errors associated with the simulation of C budget components. The modularized design of the GAMS makes it flexible to be updated and adapted for different agricultural models so long as they require similar input data, and to be linked with socio-economic models to understand the effectiveness and implications of diverse C management practices and policies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Agriculture; Carbon; Climate change; EPIC; Geospatial modeling; Parallel computing","Agriculture; Budget control; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Crops; Economics; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Input output programs; Parallel architectures; Parallel processing systems; Surveys; Accurate quantifications; Environmental policy integrated climate models; EPIC; Geospatial model; National agricultural statistics services; Net primary production; Parallel computing algorithms; Spatially-explicit models; Information management; agricultural land; agricultural land; algorithm; carbon budget; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; climate modeling; concentration (composition); crop yield; crop yield; environmental policy; environmental policy; error analysis; error analysis; estimation method; forest inventory; regional pattern; regional pattern; remote sensing; remote sensing; simulation; statistical analysis",Article,Scopus

The dynamical downscaling model used in this study is the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with varying land-surface models and resolutions (20 and 50 km) and the statistical tool is the Cumulative Distribution Function-transform (CDF-t). To achieve a spatially resolved downscaling over the Mediterranean basin, the European Climate Assessment and Dataset (ECA&D) gridded dataset is used for calibration and evaluation of the downscaling models. In the frame of HyMeX and MED-CORDEX international programs, the downscaling is performed on ERA-I reanalysis over the 1989-2008 period. The results show that despite local calibration, CDF-t produces more accurate spatial variability of near-surface temperature and rainfall with respect to ECA&D than WRF which solves the three-dimensional equation of conservation. This first suggests that at 20-50 km resolutions, these three-dimensional processes only weakly contribute to the local value of temperature and precipitation with respect to local one-dimensional processes. Calibration of CDF-t at each individual grid point is thus sufficient to reproduce accurately the spatial pattern. A second explanation is the use of gridded data such as ECA&D which smoothes in part the horizontal variability after data interpolation and damps the added value of dynamical downscaling. This explains partly the absence of added-value of the 2-stage downscaling approach which combines statistical and dynamical downscaling models. The temporal variability of statistically downscaled temperature and rainfall is finally strongly driven by the temporal variability of its forcing (here ERA-Interim or WRF simulations). CDF-t is thus efficient as a bias correction tool but does not show any added-value regarding the time variability of the downscaled field. Finally, the quality of the reference observation dataset is a key issue. Comparison of CDF-t calibrated with ECA&D dataset and WRF simulations to local measurements from weather stations not assimilated in ECA&D, shows that the temporal variability of the downscaled data with respect to the local observations is closer to the local measurements than to ECA&D data. This highlights the strong added-value of dynamical downscaling which improves the temporal variability of the atmospheric dynamics with regard to the driving model. This article highlights the benefits and inconveniences emerging from the use of both downscaling techniques for climate research. Our goal is to contribute to the discussion on the use of downscaling tools to assess the impact of climate change on regional scales. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Climate extremes; CORDEX; Downscaling; HyMeX; MED-CORDEX; Mediterranean climate; Seasonal variability","accuracy assessment; calibration; climate change; climate modeling; downscaling; Mediterranean environment; performance assessment; precipitation assessment; regional climate; research work; seasonal variation; spatial variation; temperature profile; three-dimensional modeling; weather forecasting; Mediterranean Region",Article,Scopus

Many parameters and input variables, required by crop models but usually poorly known, can be supplied through the remote sensing technique. In the past decades, integration of remote sensing data and CSMs has gained increasing attention in both scientific communities and agricultural practice. This chapter starts with a general introduction of the procedure to assimilate remote sensing data into CSMs, followed by a brief description of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) model (Hoogenboom et al., 1999, 2004). Several assimilation methods of various degrees of complexity and integration are described, including the direct input, sequential, and variational assimilation techniques. Remote sensing data in solar, microwave, and thermal domains are presented for their capabilities in assimilating with crop growth models. Regional application examples are presented to illustrate the procedure of sensitivity study, cost function construction, crop yield estimation, and the hydrological simulation process.

This specifically relates to sub-humid to semi-arid ecosystems, where agricultural change in grazing lands can only be detected based on long time series. By integrating data from different sensors it is theoretically possible to construct NDVI time series back to the early 1980s. However, such integration is hampered by uncertainties in the comparability between different sensor products. To be able to rely on vegetation trends derived from integrated time series it is therefore crucial to investigate whether vegetation trends derived from NDVI and phenological parameters are consistent across products. In this paper we analyzed several indicators of vegetation change for a range of agricultural systems in Inner Mongolia, China, and compared the results across different satellite archives. Specifically, we compared two of the prime NDVI archives-AVHRRGlobal Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) and SPOT Vegetation (VGT) NDVI. Because a true accuracy assessment of long time series is not possible, we further compared SPOT VGT NDVI with NDVI from MODIS Terra as a benchmark. We found high similarities in interannual trends, and also in trends of the seasonal amplitude and integral between SPOT VGT and MODIS Terra (r > 0.9). However, we observed considerable disagreements in NDVI-derived trends between AVHRR GIMMS and SPOT VGT. We detected similar discrepancies for trends based on phenological parameters, such as amplitude and integral of NDVI curves corresponding to seasonal vegetation cycles.Inconsistencies were partially related to land cover and vegetation density. Different pre-processing schemes and the coarser spatial resolution of AVHRR GIMMS introduced further uncertainties. Our results corroborate findings from other studies thatvegetation trends derived from AVHRR GIMMS data not always reflect true vegetation changes. A more thorough understanding of the factors introducing uncertainties in AVHRR GIMMStime series is needed, and we caution against using AVHRR GIMMS data in regional studies without applying regional sensitivity analyses. © 2012 by the authors.","Agriculture; AVHRR GIMMS; Inner mongolia; MODIS terra; NDVI; SPOT VGT; Trend analysis","AVHRR GIMMS; Inner Mongolia; MODIS terra; NDVI; SPOT VGT; Trend analysis; Agricultural engineering; Agriculture; Phenols; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Time series; Vegetation",Article,Scopus

These LULC changes have a substantial impact on soil and water. This study focus on impacts of LULC changes on hydrological processes governing the Tons River Basin (TRB). Landsat satellite images based on seven land use classes which were defined for this basin are forest deciduous (FRSD), forest mixed (FRST), mixed crop (RWSW), barren land (BARN), hay (HAY), residential (URBN) and water body (WATR). The LULC (1985–2035) result showed an increase in URBN from 0.29 to 2.81% while the rate of change (RoC) for URBN was calculated to be 8.71%. A continuous reduction was seen in FRSD from 15.57 to 9.77% giving the RoC as − 0.37%. The FRST increased at the RoC of 1.95% from 0.6 to 1.77% while the mixed crop (RWSW) increased from 72.68 to 78.27% at the RoC of 0.77%. The other LULC classes showed similar results. The hydrologic impacts were analyzed by running SWAT for the LULC changes in order to predict the corresponding changes in the hydrologic process. In this consequence SWAT was run for five decades from 1985 to 1995, 1995–2005, 2005–2015 (before baseline scenario) and 2015–2025, 2025–2035 (after baseline scenario) assuming 2015 as a baseline scenario. Evaluation of the impact of LULC changes revealed that there was decrease in surface runoff, from 62.29 to 62.14% and lateral flow from 2.39 to 0.261% for the period of 2015 to 2035. The groundwater flow showed a slight increment from 37.42 to 37.62% while the total water yield increased from 774.74 to 776.74 mm. The simulated results for TRB showed that the hydrological processes in the watershed were minimally influenced by LULC changes. It was concluded that the basin’s LULC change was not pronounced and was minimally affected by natural and artificial changes. The hydrological changes were not correlated with LULC changes. It is recommended that in order to manage the water resources and to properly develop the entire catchment, a rational regulation policy for land use patterns is vitally important in order to assist stakeholders and policy makers. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Ecological system; Hydrological modeling; LULC; Stream flow; SWAT","hydrological change; hydrological modeling; land cover; land use change; runoff; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; water availability; India; Madhya Pradesh; Tons River",Article,Scopus

Calibration and validation (C/V) are fundamental processes used to demonstrate that an H/WQ model can produce suitable results in a particular application. However, the lack of comprehensive guidelines has led to the use of ad hoc, inconsistent, and incomplete C/V processes, which have made it difficult to interpret the myriad of published modeling studies, reduced the utility of many modeling applications, and slowed the advancement of H/WQ modeling. The objective of this article is to provide a generalized structure and process to assist modelers in developing a C/V strategy for H/WQ modeling applications. These best practice recommendations were developed based on an expansive review of the modeling literature, including a special collection of articles on H/WQ model calibration, validation, and use, as well as extensive discussion and debate among the authors. The model C/V recommendations include careful consideration, execution, and documentation of the following elements: (1) goals of model use, (2) data and parameters used in C/V, and (3) model C/V processes. Considerations in element 3 include the warm-up period, C/V strategy complexity, C/V process staging, spatiotemporal allocation of C/V comparison data, manual vs. automatic C/V, and additional diagnostics. Notable examples from the literature are provided for each strategy element.

This study reported a comprehensive global sensitivity analysis for DRAINMOD-FOREST, an integrated model for simulating water, carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) cycles and plant growth in lowland forests. The analysis was carried out for multiple long-term model predictions of hydrology, biogeochemistry, and plant growth. Results showed that long-term mean hydrological predictions were highly sensitive to several key plant physiological parameters. Long-term mean annual soil organic C content and mineralization rate were mainly controlled by temperature-related parameters for soil organic matter decomposition. Mean annual forest productivity and N uptake were found to be mainly dependent upon plant production-related parameters, including canopy quantum use efficiency and carbon use efficiency. Mean annual nitrate loss was highly sensitive to parameters controlling both hydrology and plant production, while mean annual dissolved organic nitrogen loss was controlled by parameters associated with its production and physical sorption. Parameters controlling forest production, C allocation, and specific leaf area highly affected long-term mean annual leaf area. Results of this study could help minimize the efforts needed for calibrating DRAINMOD-FOREST. Meanwhile, this study demonstrates the critical role of plants in regulating water, C, and N cycles in forest ecosystems and highlights the necessity of incorporating a dynamic plant growth model for comprehensively simulating hydrological and biogeochemical processes. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Biogeochemistry; DRAINMOD-FOREST; Forest ecosystem model; Forest hydrology; Global sensitivity analysis; Plant growth","Biogeochemistry; Carbon; Ecosystems; Forecasting; Forestry; Hydrology; Physiological models; Sensitivity analysis; DRAINMOD-FOREST; Forest ecosystem; Forest hydrologies; Global sensitivity analysis; Plant growth; Process control; biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; dissolved organic nitrogen; forest canopy; forest ecosystem; growth rate; hydrology; mineralization; nitrate; nitrogen cycle; organic carbon; sensitivity analysis; soil carbon; soil organic matter; Carbon; Ecosystems; Forecasts; Forestry; Process Control",Article,Scopus

This paper analyses an ensemble of simulations from six regional climate models (RCMs) taking part in the coordinated regional downscaling experiment, the ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis (ERAI) and three satellite-based and observationally-constrained daily precipitation datasets, to assess the performance of the RCMs with regard to the intraseasonal variability. A joint analysis of seasonal-mean precipitation and the total column water vapor (also called precipitable water—PW) suggests the existence of important links at different timescales between these two variables over the Sahel and highlights the relevance of using PW to follow the monsoon seasonal cycle. RCMs that fail to represent the seasonal-mean position and amplitude of the meridional gradient of PW show the largest discrepancies with respect to seasonal-mean observed precipitation. For both ERAI and RCMs, spectral decompositions of daily PW as well as rainfall show an overestimation of low-frequency activity (at timescales longer than 10 days) at the expense of the synoptic (timescales shorter than 10 days) activity. Consequently, the effects of the African Easterly Waves and the associated mesoscale convective systems are substantially underestimated, especially over continental regions. Finally, the study investigates the skill of the models with respect to hydro-climatic indices related to the occurrence, intensity and frequency of precipitation events at the intraseasonal scale. Although most of these indices are generally better reproduced with RCMs than reanalysis products, this study indicates that RCMs still need to be improved (especially with respect to their subgrid-scale parameterization schemes) to be able to reproduce the intraseasonal variance spectrum adequately. © 2016, The Author(s).","Intraseasonal variability; Precipitation indices; Regional climate modeling; West African monsoon","climate modeling; convective system; easterly wave; ensemble forecasting; monsoon; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; West Africa",Article,Scopus

Several calibration techniques have been developed for SWAT, including manual calibration procedures and automated procedures using the shuffled complex evolution method and other common methods. In addition, SWAT-CUP was recently developed and provides a decision-making framework that incorporates a semi-automated approach (SUFI2) using both manual and automated calibration and incorporating sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. In SWAT-CUP, users can manually adjust parameters and ranges iteratively between autocalibration runs. Parameter sensitivity analysis helps focus the calibration and uncertainty analysis and is used to provide statistics for goodness-of-fit. The user interaction or manual component of the SWAT-CUP calibration forces the user to obtain a better understanding of the overall hydrologic processes (e.g., baseflow ratios, ET, sediment sources and sinks, crop yields, and nutrient balances) and of parameter sensitivity. It is important for future calibration developments to spatially account for hydrologic processes; improve model run time efficiency; include the impact of uncertainty in the conceptual model, model parameters, and measured variables used in calibration; and assist users in checking for model errors.

However, their impacts and links to terrestrial water storage (TWS) in general, have not been studied. This study presents the pioneer results of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) of TWS derived from both global reanalysis data (1980–2015) and GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) (2002–2014) with SST fields. The main issues discussed include, (i) oceanic hot spots that impact on TWS over tropical West Africa (TWA) based on CCA, (ii) long term changes in model and global reanalysis data (soil moisture, TWS, and groundwater) and the influence of climate variability on these hydrological indicators, and (iii) the hydrological characteristics of the Equatorial region of Africa (i.e., the Congo basin) based on GRACE-derived TWS, river discharge, and precipitation. Results of the CCA diagnostics show that El-Niño Southern Oscillation related equatorial Pacific SST fluctuations is a major index of climate variability identified in the main portion of the CCA procedure that indicates a significant association with long term TWS reanalysis data over TWA (r = 0.50, ρ &lt; 0.05). Based on Mann-Kendall's statistics, the study found fairly large long term declines (ρ &lt; 0.05) in TWS and soil moisture (1982 − 2015), mostly over the Congo basin, which coincided with warming of the land surface and the surrounding oceans. Meanwhile, some parts of the Sahel show significant wetting (rainfall, soil moisture, groundwater, and TWS) trends during the same period (1982–2015) and aligns with the ongoing narratives of rainfall recovery in the region. Results of singular spectral analysis and regression confirm that multi-annual changes in the Congo River discharge explained a considerable proportion of variability in GRACE-hydrological signal over the Congo basin (r = 0.86 and R2 = 0.70, ρ &lt; 0.05). Finally, leading orthogonal modes of MERRA and GRACE-TWS over TWA show significant association with global SST anomalies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Canonical correlation analysis; Climate variability; Congo basin; ENSO; Land water storage; Rainfall","Atmospheric pressure; Climate models; Climatology; Correlation methods; Digital storage; Groundwater; Moisture; Oceanography; Rain; Soil moisture; Soils; Spectrum analysis; Surface waters; Wetting; Canonical correlation analysis; Climate variability; Congo basins; ENSO; Land water storage; Climate change",Article,Scopus

Forty percent of this water is derived from groundwater. Approximately 20%-30% of the groundwater sources are saline and 20%-50% of global irrigation water is salinized. Salinization reduces crop yields and the number of crop varieties which can be grown on an arable holding. Structured ZVI (zero valent iron, Fe0 pellets desalinate water by storing the removed ions as halite (NaCl) within their porosity. This allows an ""Aquifer Treatment Zone"" to be created within an aquifer, (penetrated by a number of wells (containing ZVI pellets)). This zone is used to supply partially desalinated water directly from a saline aquifer. A modeled reconfigured aquifer producing a continuous flow (e.g., 20 m3/day, 7300 m3/a) of partially desalinated irrigation water is used to illustrate the impact of porosity, permeability, aquifer heterogeneity, abstraction rate, Aquifer Treatment Zone size, aquifer thickness, optional reinjection, leakage and flow by-pass on the product water salinity. This desalination approach has no operating costs (other than abstraction costs (and ZVI regeneration)) and may potentially be able to deliver a continuous flow of partially desalinated water (30%-80% NaCl reduction) for $0.05-0.5/m3. © 2017 by the authors.","Aquifer; Desalination; Irrigation; Salinization; Zero valent iron (ZVI, Fe0)",,Article,Scopus

This need for high-resolution data leads to apply projection techniques called downscaling. Downscaling can be performed according to two approaches: dynamical and statistical models. The latter approach is constituted by various statistical families conceptually different. If several studies have made some intercomparisons of existing downscaling models, none of them included all those families and approaches in a manner that all the models are equally considered. To this end, the present study conducts an intercomparison exercise under the EURO- and MED-CORDEX initiative hindcast framework. Six Statistical Downscaling Models (SDMs) and five Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are compared in terms of precipitation outputs. The downscaled simulations are driven by the ERAinterim reanalyses over the 1989–2008 period over a common area at 0.44° of resolution. The 11 models are evaluated according to four aspects of the precipitation: occurrence, intensity, as well as spatial and temporal properties. For each aspect, one or several indicators are computed to discriminate the models. The results indicate that marginal properties of rain occurrence and intensity are better modelled by stochastic and resampling-based SDMs, while spatial and temporal variability are better modelled by RCMs and resampling-based SDM. These general conclusions have to be considered with caution because they rely on the chosen indicators and could change when considering other specific criteria. The indicators suit specific purpose and therefore the model evaluation results depend on the end-users point of view and how they intend to use with model outputs. Nevertheless, building on previous intercomparison exercises, this study provides a consistent intercomparison framework, including both SDMs and RCMs, which is designed to be flexible, i.e., other models and indicators can easily be added. More generally, this framework provides a tool to select the downscaling model to be used according to the statistical properties of the local-scale climate data to drive properly specific impact models. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","CORDEX; Dynamical downscaling; Intercomparison; Precipitation; Statistical downscaling","climate modeling; downscaling; hindcasting; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; spatial variation; statistical analysis; temporal variation",Article,Scopus

Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) in its geographic information system (GIS) dictionary denes remote sensing as “collecting and interpreting information about the environment and the surface of the earth from a distance, primarily by sensing radiation that is naturally emitted or reaected by the earth's surface or from the atmosphere, or by sending signals transmitted from a device and re-ected back to it (ESRI, 2014).” Ye usual source of passive remote sensing data is the measurement of re-ected, or transmitted electromagnetic radiation (EMR) from the sun across the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS); this can also include acoustic or sound energy, gravity, or the magnetic eld from or of the objects under consideration. In this context, the simple act of reading this text is considered remote sensing. In this case, the eye acts as a sensor and senses the light re-ected from the object to obtain information about the object. It is the same technology used by a handheld camera to take a photograph of a person or a distant scenic view. Active remote sensing, however, involves sending a pulse of energy and then measuring the returned energy through a sensor (e.g., Radio Detection and Ranging [RADAR], Light Detection and Ranging [LiDAR]). Yermal sensors measure emitted energy by dierent objects. Yus, in general, passive remote sensing involves the measurement of solar energy re-ected from the Earth's surface, while active remote sensing involves synthetic (man-made) energy pulsed at the environment and the return signals are measured and recorded. © 2016 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"Aerial photography; Agriculture; Air navigation; Aircraft detection; Altitude control; Antenna arrays; Atmospheric temperature; Band structure; Broadcasting; Climatology; Color photography; Communication satellites; Control system synthesis; Digital radio; Electromagnetic waves; Electronic document exchange; Geodetic satellites; Green computing; Image enhancement; Image recording; Infrared detectors; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Mapping; Marine communication; Marine navigation; Marine radar; Mass spectrometers; Microwave sensors; Microwaves; Mobile antennas; Multispectral scanners; NASA; Oceanography; Optical radar; Orbits; Planetary surface analysis; Public administration; Quality control; Radar imaging; Radar measurement; Radio navigation; Radiometers; Rain gages; Remote sensing; Satellite communication systems; Satellite imagery; Scanning; Signal to noise ratio; Soil conservation; Soil surveys; Solar energy; Space flight; Space optics; Surface topography; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Underwater acoustics; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle to vehicle communications; Water quality; Weather satellites; Environmental systems research institutes; Medium resolution imaging spectrometers; Microwave imaging radiometer with aperture synthesis; National center for atmospheric researches; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; National polar orbiting environmental satellite systems; Phased array type l-band synthetic aperture radars; Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager; Space-based radar",Book Chapter,Scopus

In remote sensing information retrieval, the space-ground-network integrated technical system has emerged because of the rapid development of Earth observation satellites, the booming of unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as the extensive and intensive application of wireless sensor networks and the Internet of Things in China. In quantitative remote sensing, various agricultural parameters, including LAI, soil moisture, and crop nutrients have been inverted from remote sensing data via statistical and/or mechanical models. In crop acreage estimation and crop mapping by remote sensing, considerable progress in algorithms and operational system development has been made in the past 20 years in China. In crop growth monitoring and yield estimation/prediction, quantitative remote sensing data products as well as various remote sensing indexes have been used with in-situ data. Various empirical models have also been investigated. Remote sensing data assimilation with crop growth models is a prevailing issue in this research field. For agricultural disaster monitoring and assessment with remote sensing, drought, flood, pests, plant disease, and so on have been studied with different types of remote sensing data and quantitative data products with various models. Some of these research outcomes and systems have been operational. In remote sensing for agricultural land resources, the research foci is shifting from land resources quantity research to spatial patterns and their dynamics, as well as to specific elements of agricultural lands, e.g., facility agriculture land and plastic-mulching cropland. The classification methods are more diverse, and novel methods, including object-oriented methods, machine learning methods, knowledge-based algorithms, and so on, are investigated. In the past 20 years, significant progress has been made in the research and application of agricultural remote sensing in China. In the future, an increasing number of Earth observation satellites will be in orbit with the application of the China High Resolution Earth Observation System and National Spatial Infrastructure. Sensor technology, Internet plus, big data, and artificial intelligence, among other technologies, are expected to develop rapidly. In this new era, the agriculture development pattern will change with the upgrade of the national economy and social development in China. Many new demands and opportunities will occur in agricultural remote sensing research and application. First, the space-ground-network integrated technical system for agricultural information retrieval will be applied more extensively to meet diverse demands in various agricultural sectors. Second, new techniques, including artificial intelligence, big data, and so on, will play important roles in solving critical problems in agricultural remote sensing research and applications. Third, remote sensing is expected to be applied more extensively in new sub-disciplines of agronomy, which will not only improve agricultural research but also enrich the theory and techniques in remote sensing. © 2016, Science Press.

Without N constraint in ecosystem models, the simulated benefits from CO2 fertilization and CO2-induced increases in water use efficiency (WUE) may be overestimated. In this study, satellite observations of a relative measure of chlorophyll content are used as a proxy for leaf photosynthetic N content globally for 2003–2011. Global gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration are estimated under elevated CO2 and N-constrained model scenarios. Results suggest that the rate of global GPP increase is overestimated by 85% during 2000–2015 without N limitation. This limitation is found to occur in many tropical and boreal forests, where a negative leaf N trend indicates a reduction in photosynthetic capacity, thereby suppressing the positive vegetation response to enhanced CO2 fertilization. Based on our carbon-water coupled simulations, enhanced CO2 concentration decreased stomatal conductance and hence increased WUE by 10% globally over the 1982 to 2015 time frame. Due to increased anthropogenic N application, GPP in croplands continues to grow and offset the weak negative trend in forests due to N limitation. Our results also show that the improved WUE is unlikely to ease regional droughts in croplands because of increases in evapotranspiration, which are associated with the enhanced GPP. Although the N limitation on GPP increase is large, its associated confidence interval is still wide, suggesting an urgent need for better understanding and quantification of N limitation from satellite observations. ©2017.

As a result, drought hydrology has been receiving much attention. A variety of concepts have been applied to modeling droughts, ranging from simplistic approaches to more complex models. It is important to understand different modeling approaches as well as their advantages and limitations. This paper, supplementing the previous paper (Mishra and Singh, 2010) where different concepts of droughts were highlighted, reviews different methodologies used for drought modeling, which include drought forecasting, probability based modeling, spatio-temporal analysis, use of Global Climate Models (GCMs) for drought scenarios, land data assimilation systems for drought modeling, and drought planning. It is found that there have been significant improvements in modeling droughts over the past three decades. Hybrid models, incorporating large scale climate indices, seem to be promising for long lead-time drought forecasting. Further research is needed to understand the spatio-temporal complexity of droughts under climate change due to changes in spatio-temporal variability of precipitation. Applications of copula based models for multivariate drought characterization seem to be promising for better drought characterization. Research on decision support systems should be advanced for issuing warnings, assessing risk, and taking precautionary measures, and the effective ways for the flow of information from decision makers to users need to be developed. Finally, some remarks are made regarding the future outlook for drought research. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change scenarios; Drought forecasting; Drought planning; Land data assimilation systems; Probability based modeling; Spatio-temporal drought analysis","Climate change scenarios; Climate index; Complex model; Decision makers; Drought planning; Global climate model; Hybrid model; Land data assimilation systems; Leadtime; Modeling approach; Precautionary measures; Spatio-temporal; Spatio-temporal complexity; Spatiotemporal analysis; Spatiotemporal variability; Water demand; Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Climate models; Data processing; Decision making; Decision support systems; Research; Risk assessment; Weather forecasting; Drought; climate change; climate modeling; data assimilation; decision support system; drought; global climate; hydrometeorology; precautionary principle; research work; spatiotemporal analysis; water demand; weather forecasting",Review,Scopus

In order to fulfill the requirement of global coverage, existing products integrate satellite-derived retrievals from many sensors with direct ground observations (gauges, disdrometers, radars), which are used as reference for the satellites. While the resulting product can be deemed as the best-available source of quality validation data, awareness of the limitations of such data sets is important to avoid extracting wrong or unsubstantiated conclusions when assessing climate model abilities.

This paper reviews some of the latest achievements in agricultural robotics, specifically those that are used for autonomous weed control, field scouting, and harvesting. Object identification, task planning algorithms, digitalization and optimization of sensors are highlighted as some of the facing challenges in the context of digital farming. The concepts of multi-robots, human-robot collaboration, and environment reconstruction from aerial images and ground-based sensors for the creation of virtual farms were highlighted as some of the gateways of digital farming. It was shown that one of the trends and research focuses in agricultural field robotics is towards building a swarm of small scale robots and drones that collaborate together to optimize farming inputs and reveal denied or concealed information. For the case of robotic harvesting, an autonomous framework with several simple axis manipulators can be faster and more efficient than the currently adapted professional expensive manipulators. While robots are becoming the inseparable parts of the modern farms, our conclusion is that it is not realistic to expect an entirely automated farming system in the future. © 2018, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Meeting increasing demand for meat and other dairy products in a sustainable manner is a big challenge. At a field scale, Global Positioning System and groundbased sensor technologies provide promising tools for grassland and herd management with high precision. With the growth in availability of spaceborne remote sensing data, it is therefore important to revisit the relevant methods and applications that can exploit this imagery. In this article, we have reviewed the (i) current status of grassland monitoring/observation methods and applications based on satellite remote sensing data, (ii) the technological and methodological developments to retrieve different grassland biophysical parameters and management characteristics (i.e. degradation, grazing intensity) and (iii) identified the key remaining challenges and some new upcoming trends for future development. Important Findings The retrieval of grassland biophysical parameters have evolved in recent years from classical regression analysis to more complex, efficient and robust modeling approaches, driven by satellite data, and are likely to continue to be the most robust method for deriving grassland information, however these require more high quality calibration and validation data. We found that the hypertemporal satellite data are widely used for time series generation, and particularly to overcome cloud contamination issues, but the current low spatial resolution of these instruments precludes their use for field-scale application in many countries. This trend may change with the current rise in launch of satellite constellations, such as RapidEye, Sentinel-2 and even the microsatellites such as those operated by Skybox Imaging. Microwave imagery has not been widely used for grassland applications, and a better understanding of the backscatter behaviour from different phenological stages is needed for more reliable products in cloudy regions. The development of hyperspectral satellite instrumentation and analytical methods will help for more detailed discrimination of habitat types, and the development of tools for greater end-user operation.","Agricultural grassland; Grassland biomass; Grazing intensity; Pasture management; Remote sensing",,Article,Scopus

This knowledge has facilitated the development and use of various remote sensing methods for non-destructive monitoring of plant growth and development and for the detection of many environmental stresses which limit plant productivity. Coupled with rapid advances in computing and position-locating technologies, remote sensing from ground-, air-, and space-based platforms is now capable of providing detailed spatial and temporal information on plant response to their local environment that is needed for site specific agricultural management approaches. This manuscript, which emphasizes contributions by ARS researchers, reviews the biophysical basis of remote sensing; examines approaches that have been developed, refined, and tested for management of water, nutrients, and pests in agricultural crops; and assesses the role of remote sensing in yield prediction.

In this context, better knowledge of how climate will change in West Africa and how such changes will impact crop productivity is crucial to inform policies that may counteract the adverse effects. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of climate change impacts on agriculture inWest Africa based on the recent scientific literature.West Africa is nowadays experiencing a rapid climate change, characterized by a widespread warming, a recovery of the monsoonal precipitation, and an increase in the occurrence of climate extremes. The observed climate tendencies are also projected to continue in the twenty-first century under moderate and high emission scenarios, although large uncertainties still affect simulations of the future West African climate, especially regarding the summer precipitation. However, despite diverging future projections of the monsoonal rainfall, which is essential for rain-fed agriculture, a robust evidence of yield loss in West Africa emerges. This yield loss is mainly driven by increased mean temperature while potential wetter or drier conditions as well as elevated CO2 concentrations can modulate this effect. Potential for adaptation is illustrated for major crops in West Africa through a selection of studies based on process-based crop models to adjust cropping systems (change in varieties, sowing dates and density, irrigation, fertilizer management) to future climate. Results of the cited studies are crop and region specific and no clear conclusions can be made regarding the most effective adaptation options. Further efforts are needed to improve modeling of the monsoon system and to better quantify the uncertainty in its changes under a warmer climate, in the response of the crops to such changes and in the potential for adaptation. © 2016 Sultan and Gaetani.","Adaptation; Agriculture; Climate change; Impacts; West African monsoon",,Review,Scopus

We reviewed 215 papers found in the literature that contained field observed data where the CERES models were tested. Over 30 simulated variables of the CERES models have been tested in 43 different countries under various experimental treatments. Across all testing conditions, the CERES models simulated grain yield with a root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 1400 kg/ha (~10% relative error, RE), 1200 kg/ha (~20% RE) and 800 kg/ha (~10% RE) for maize, wheat, and rice, respectively. Phenological development was simulated with less than 7 days difference from the observations in most studies. The CERES models simulated aboveground biomass, harvest index, evapotranspiration, and soil water reasonably well too. The simulations of grain number (up to 4340 root mean square error, RMSE), grain weight (up to 22% error), intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR, up to 0.41 MJ/plant), leaf area index (LAI, 31.9% error), soil temperature (over 10°C difference), and nitrogen (N) dynamics (up to 80% error) were less accurate.

While substantial progress has been made since the early days of climate modeling, many challenges remain. A problem common to most coupled ocean-Atmosphere general circulation models (GCMs) is the cold sea surface temperature (SST) bias in the tropics. Despite this cold SST bias GCMs tend to produce too much precipitation over the tropical oceans, particularly south of the equator. Due to the close link between convection and surface winds, the precipitation biases in GCMs are also accompanied by surface wind biases. Particularly on the equator this strongly affects the simulated ocean currents and vertical temperature stratification. Precipitation biases over land surfaces likely contribute to biases over the equatorial oceans through their influence on the Walker circulation. This influence is particularly strong for the Atlantic basin, where GCMs typically overpredict precipitation over tropical South America and underpredict it over tropical Africa. Despite cold SST biases over much of the tropical oceans, warm SST biases dominate in the southeastern tropical Pacific and Atlantic. These warm biases appear to be due to a combination of surface wind biases (both on the equator and locally), excessive shortwave solar radiation due to insufficient low-level cloud, and weak oceanic stratification reducing the cooling effect of upwelling. The failure to capture the equatorial thermocline (the sharp temperature gradient separating the deep ocean from the warm surface layer) is also an important error source in coupled GCMs.. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Co.

While increased model resolution can solve some of the problems of current GCMs, it certainly cannot solve all of them. Additionally, long-term climate simulations will likely have to rely on convective and other parametrizations for a long time to come. Further improving these parametrizations must therefore remain one of the main targets for model development. Such efforts should increase model performance but, on the other hand, many issues will probably remain. Effort should therefore be spent on understanding how model biases affect seasonal forecasts and climate change projections, in order to maximize their utility as predictive tools. © 2016 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

DL represents significant progress in the ability of neural networks to automatically engineer problem-relevant features and capture highly complex data distributions. I argue that DL can help address several major new and old challenges facing research in water sciences such as interdisciplinarity, data discoverability, hydrologic scaling, equifinality, and needs for parameter regionalization. This review paper is intended to provide water resources scientists and hydrologists in particular with a simple technical overview, transdisciplinary progress update, and a source of inspiration about the relevance of DL to water. The review reveals that various physical and geoscientific disciplines have utilized DL to address data challenges, improve efficiency, and gain scientific insights. DL is especially suited for information extraction from image-like data and sequential data. Techniques and experiences presented in other disciplines are of high relevance to water research. Meanwhile, less noticed is that DL may also serve as a scientific exploratory tool. A new area termed AI neuroscience, where scientists interpret the decision process of deep networks and derive insights, has been born. This budding subdiscipline has demonstrated methods including correlation-based analysis, inversion of network-extracted features, reduced-order approximations by interpretable models, and attribution of network decisions to inputs. Moreover, DL can also use data to condition neurons that mimic problem-specific fundamental organizing units, thus revealing emergent behaviors of these units. Vast opportunities exist for DL to propel advances in water sciences. ©2018.

Both 50nm Fe 0 and 20-40μm Fe 0 can be used to reduce the water salinity by between 20% and 90%.

This paper briefly examines the history of crop modelling by international crop research centres of the CGIAR (formerly Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research but now known simply as CGIAR), whose primary focus is on less developed countries. Basic principles of crop modelling building up to a Genotype × Environment × Management × Socioeconomic (G × E × M × S) paradigm, are explained. Modelling has contributed to better understanding of crop performance and yield gaps, better prediction of pest and insect outbreaks, and improving the efficiency of crop management including irrigation systems and optimization of planting dates. New developments include, for example, use of remote sensed data and mobile phone technology linked to crop management decision support models, data sharing in the new era of big data, and the use of genomic selection and crop simulation models linked to environmental data to help make crop breeding decisions. Socio-economic applications include foresight analysis of agricultural systems under global change scenarios, and the consequences of potential food system shocks are also described. These approaches are discussed in this paper which also calls for closer collaboration among disciplines in order to better serve the crop research and development communities by providing model based recommendations ranging from policy development at the level of governmental agencies to direct crop management support for resource poor farmers. © 2018 by the authors.","Agri-food-systems; Big data; CGIAR; Crop management; Crop modelling; Data sharing; Food security; Foresight; Global phenotyping networks; International agricultural research",,Article,Scopus
