This paper presents a deep learning framework using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for crop yield prediction based on environmental data and management practices. The proposed CNN-RNN model, along with other popular methods such as random forest (RF), deep fully connected neural networks (DFNN), and LASSO, was used to forecast corn and soybean yield across the entire Corn Belt (including 13 states) in the United States for years 2016, 2017, and 2018 using historical data. The new model achieved a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) 9% and 8% of their respective average yields, substantially outperforming all other methods that were tested. The CNN-RNN has three salient features that make it a potentially useful method for other crop yield prediction studies. (1) The CNN-RNN model was designed to capture the time dependencies of environmental factors and the genetic improvement of seeds over time without having their genotype information. (2) The model demonstrated the capability to generalize the yield prediction to untested environments without significant drop in the prediction accuracy.

How to improve crop breeding to feed the growing population is a significant challenge. The traditional crop breeding is resource-intensive and time-consuming. Predictive modeling on crop yield can speed up the breeding process and make it resource-efficient. In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA)-assisted deep learning solution method is proposed for the crop yield prediction. The proposed method consists of two phases, i.e., the global search phase and the local search phase. In the global search phase, GA is used to search for the best initial weights of the neural network. In the local search phase, random perturbation is added to avoid the local optimum and vanishing gradient problems. A case study of crop yield prediction is conducted to compare the proposed method and other gradient-based methods. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the gradient-based methods in terms of convergence speed and prediction accuracy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Crop yield prediction; Genetic algorithm; Gradient descent; Neural network","Agricultural robots; Crops; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Local search (optimization); Predictive analytics; Random processes; Agriculture productions; Convergence speed; Gradient-based method; Learning approach; Prediction accuracy; Predictive modeling; Random perturbations; Vanishing gradient; Deep learning",Article,Scopus

Due to the spatiotemporal nonlinear characteristic of crop yields, recent studies have actively used various machine learning approaches to predict crop yields. However, there are few studies that have compared these approaches, and even in those cases, the comparison was restricted to one or two crops or a specific region. In this study, we evaluated seven popular machine learning approaches, for the same input variables, over three crops: paddy rice in South Korea and corn and soybean in Illinois and Iowa, USA. Based on the data from April to September, six time-series scenarios of different range of months for each crop were tested for prediction accuracy with 14-year (2003-2016). The time-series data include vegetation indices from Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), weather data, crop yield statistics, and a land cover map of county-level spatial resolution and 16-day-aggregated temporal resolution. In the results, regardless of crop type, support vector machine (SVM) presented the most accurate result with the lowest average root mean square error (RRMSE), in comparison with a decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), stacked-sparse autoencoder (SSAE), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM). Also, we derived best cases for each crop yield prediction out of six time-series scenarios, which were May – September data for rice and corn and June – August data for soybean for the test sites. Considering all of the findings together, SVM is an appropriate method for crop yield prediction based on MODIS-based vegetation indices and weather data of county-level spatial resolution and approximately one-half-month temporal resolution. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Crop yield prediction; Machine learning; MODIS; Weather data","artificial nest; artificial neural network; comparative study; crop yield; data set; earthquake prediction; land cover; machine learning; MODIS; prediction; Illinois; Iowa; South Korea; United States; Glycine max",Article,Scopus

Recent studies on crop yield production are limited to regional-scale predictions. The regional-scale crop yield predictions usually face challenges in capturing local yield variations based on farm management decisions and the condition of the field. For this research, we identified the need to create a large and reusable farm-scale crop yield production dataset, which could provide precise farm-scale ground-truth prediction targets. Therefore, we utilise multi-temporal data, such as Sentinel-2 satellite images, weather data, farm data, grain delivery data, and cadastre-specific data. We introduce a deep hybrid neural network model to train this multi-temporal data. This model combines the features of convolutional layers and recurrent neural networks to predict farm-scale crop yield production across Norway. The proposed model could efficiently make the target predictions with the mean absolute error of 76 kg per 1000 m2.

Extensive research in agricultural domain has been carried out to predict better crop yield using the machine learning algorithm Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and statistical model Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). This article examines the intrinsic relationship between MLR and ANN. A hybrid MLR-ANN model has been proposed in this research work for efficient crop yield prediction. The proposed hybrid model is modeled to analyze the prediction accuracy when MLR intercept and coefficients were applied to initialize the ANN's input layer weights and bias. Feed Forward Artificial Neural Network with Back Propagation training algorithm was used for predicting accurate paddy crop yield. In conventional ANN model, the weights and bias of input and hidden layer are initilized randomly. This hybrid MLR-ANN model, instead of random weights and bias initialization, the input layer weights and bias are initialized by using MLR's coefficients and bias. The hybrid model prediction accuracy is compared with ANN, MLR, Support Vector Regression (SVR), k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) models by using performance metrics. The computational time for both hybrid MLR-ANN and conventional ANN was calculated.

Most research has focused on excavating fixed spectral information from remote sensing images. However, the growth of crops is a highly complex trait determined by diverse features. To maximally explore these heterogeneous features, we aim to simultaneously exploit spatial, spectral, and temporal information from multi-spectral and multi-temporal remotely sensed imagery. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel deep learning architecture for crop yield prediction, namely, SSTNN (Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Neural Network), which combines 3D convolutional and recurrent neural networks to exploit their complementarity. Specifically, the SSTNN incorporates a spatial-spectral learning module and a temporal dependency capturing module into a unified convolutional network to recognize the joint spatial-spectral-temporal representation. The novel spatial-spectral feature learning module first exploits sufficient spatial-spectral features from the multi-spectral images. Then, the temporal dependency capturing module is concatenated on top of the spatial-spectral feature learning module to mine the temporal relationship from the long time-series images. Furthermore, we introduce a new loss function that eliminates the influence of an imbalanced distribution of crop yield labels. Finally, the proposed SSTNN is validated on winter wheat and corn yield predictions from China. The results are compared with widely used machine learning methods as well as state-of-art deep learning methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can provide better prediction performance than the competitive methods. © 2021","3D convolutional neural network; Crop yield prediction; Long short-term memory; Multi-temporal images","artificial neural network; crop yield; image processing; imagery; maize; remote sensing; China",Article,Scopus

The main objectives are crop and weed detection, biomass evaluation and yield prediction. Evaluating machine learning methods for remote sensing based yield prediction requires availability of yield mapping devices, which are still not very common among farmers. In this study Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) – a deep learning methodology showing outstanding performance in image classification tasks – are applied to build a model for crop yield prediction based on NDVI and RGB data acquired from UAVs. The effect of various aspects of the CNN such as selection of the training algorithm, depth of the network, regularization strategy, and tuning of the hyperparameters on the prediction efficiency are tested. Using the Adadelta training algorithm, L2 regularization with early stopping and a CNN with 6 convolutional layers, mean absolute error (MAE) in yield prediction of 484.3 kg/ha and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 8.8% was achieved for data acquired during the early period of the growth season (i.e., in June of 2017, growth phase &lt;25%) with RGB data. When using data acquired later in July and August of 2017 (growth phase &gt;25%), MAE of 624.3 kg/ha (MAPE: 12.6%) was obtained.

One of the main benefits of using reliable forecasting tools is generating more income from grown crops. Information on the amount of crop yielding before harvesting helps to guide the adoption of an appropriate strategy for managing agricultural products. The difficulty in creating forecasting models is related to the appropriate selection of independent variables. Their proper selection requires a perfect knowledge of the research object. The following article presents and discusses the most commonly used independent variables in agricultural crop yield prediction modeling based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). Particular attention is paid to environmental variables, such as climatic data, air temperature, total precipitation, insolation, and soil parameters. The possibility of using plant productivity indices and vegetation indices, which are valuable predictors obtained due to the application of remote sensing techniques, are analyzed in detail. The paper emphasizes that the increasingly common use of remote sensing and photogrammetric tools enables the development of precision agriculture. In addition, some limitations in the application of certain input variables are specified, as well as further possibilities for the development of non-linear modeling, using artificial neural networks as a tool supporting the practical use of and improvement in precision farming techniques. © 2021 by the authors.

Crop production is predicted using machine learning techniques based on parameters such as rainfall, crop, and meteorological conditions. The most popular and powerful supervised machine learning algorithm, Random Forest, can do both classification and regression tasks. They are used in crop selection to reduce crop yield output losses, regardless of the distracting environment. Weather, climate, and other related environmental elements have posed a significant danger to agriculture's long-Term viability. Machine learning (ML) is significant since it offers a decision-support tool for Crop Yield Prediction (CYP), which may help with decisions like which crops to cultivate and what to do during the crop's growing season. Crop yield estimation's major purpose is to boost agricultural crop production, and it does so using a variety of well-established models. Machine learning is increasingly widely used around the world due to its success in a range of disciplines such as forecasting, fault detection, pattern identification, and so on. A key agricultural concern is a yield prediction. Farmers will be able to determine the yield of their crop before growing on the agricultural field using the results of this study, allowing them to make informed decisions.

Historically, the requirements for satellites to successfully monitor crop growth and yield differed depending on the extent of the area being monitored. Diverging imaging capabilities can be reconciled by blending images from high-temporal-frequency (HTF) and high-spatial-resolution (HSR) sensors to produce images that possess both HTF and HSR characteristics across large areas. We evaluated the relative performance of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat, and blended imagery for crop yield estimates (2009-2015) using a carbon-turnover yield model deployed across the Australian cropping area. Based on the fraction of missing Landsat observations, we further developed a parsimonious framework to inform when and where blending is beneficial for nationwide crop yield prediction at a finer scale (i.e., the 25-m pixel resolution). Landsat provided the best yield predictions when no observations were missing, which occurred in 17% of the cropping area of Australia. Blending was preferred when <42% of Landsat observations were missing, which occurred in 33% of the cropping area of Australia. MODIS produced a lower prediction error when ≥42% of the Landsat images were missing (~50% of the cropping area). By identifying when and where blending outperforms predictions from either Landsat or MODIS, the proposed framework enables more accurate monitoring of biophysical processes and yields, while keeping computational costs low. © 2020 by the authors.","Crop yield prediction; Data blending; Gap-filling; Landsat; MODIS","Crops; Forecasting; Radiometers; Biophysical process; Computational costs; Crop growth and yields; High spatial resolution; High temporal frequency; Imaging capabilities; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Relative performance; Image processing",Article,Scopus

The state-of-the-art classifiers are used for predicting the yield quality of any one crop whereas it takes more time to simultaneously train multiple types of crops for predicting their yield quality. For a specific crop yield prediction using soil parameters, a Krill-Herd (KH)-based feature selection with Dynamic Neupper (DNeupper) rule-based classifier has been proposed. However, multiple types of crops were not simultaneously predicted within a single classifier since it creates a multi-class classification problem. Hence in this article, KH with Dynamic Multi-Class Neupper (KHDMCNeupper) rule-based classification algorithm is proposed to predict all three crops such as rice, wheat and maize together with increased prediction accuracy. In this model, the most optimal soil parameters for all crops and their relative weights are computed based on KH and Rough Set (RS) theory. Then, these weight values are combined with soil parameters and given as input to the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) which is used to construct a tree in DNeupper classifier. By constructing a tree, the classification rules for all three crops are generated to predict the yield quality. Thus, the proposed classification technique can support simultaneous prediction of multiple crops with high accuracy. Finally, the experimental results show the efficiency of the KHDMCNeupper classifier compared to the KHDNeupper classifier in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and f-measure. © BEIESP.","Crop yield prediction; DNeupper rule-based classifier; KH; Multi-class classification",,Article,Scopus

Agricultural data can be a significant area of big data applications. The big data analysis for agricultural data can comprise the various data from both internal systems and outside sources like weather data, soil data, and crop data. Though big data analysis has led to advances in different industries, it has not yet been extensively used in agriculture. Several machine learning techniques are developed to cluster the data for the prediction of crop yield. However, it has low accuracy and low quality of the clustering. To improve clustering accuracy with less complexity, a Proximity Likelihood Maximization Data Clustering (PLMDC) technique is developed for both sparse and densely distributed agricultural big data to enhance the accuracy of crop yield prediction for farmers. In this process, unnecessary data is cleansed from the sparse and dense based agricultural data using a logical linear regression model. After that, the presented clustering method is executed depending on the similarity and weight-based Manhattan distance. The genetic algorithm (GA) is applied with a good fitness function to select the features from the clustered data. Finally, the decision support system is computed by the A-FP growth algorithm to predict the crop yields according to their selected features such as weather features and crop features. The results of the proposed PLMDC technique are better in case of clustering accuracy of both spare and densely distributed data with minimum time and space complexity.

As a result, an objective arises from the investigation of the accessible information and incorporating them with processes like foreseeing crop yield, plant diseases examination, crops enhancement, etc. Machine learning has grown with tremendous processing methods to conceive new innovations in the multi-disciplinary agricultural sector. In experimenting with machine learning models, there exist certain limitations like improvident nonlinear mapping between the raw data and crop yield values. Hence, deep learning models are comprehensively used to extricate critical crop parameters for prediction. Foreseeing the crop yield depending on climate, soil and water parameters has been a potential research subject. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning-based crop yield prediction system using deep belief network (DBN) and fuzzy neural networks system (FNN). DBN is a combination of statistics and probability with neural networks. Though DBN performs better for nonlinear systems, the algorithm alone cannot provide satisfactory results in terms of robustness, model accuracy and learning speed, which is predominantly due to gradient diffusion. Hence, a DBN along with FNN has been proposed to overcome the nonlinearity and gradient diffusion problems. The proposed model initially performs an efficient pre-training technique by DBN for enhanced model development and feature vector generation. This characteristic feature vector is fed as an input to the FNN for further processing. The superiority of the proposed fuzzy neural network-based deep belief network is analyzed by comparing it with other deep learning algorithms.

Satellite-based Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) products have revealed hot spots of photosynthesis over global croplands, such as in the U.S. Midwest. However, to what extent these satellite-based SIF products can enhance the performance of crop yield prediction when benchmarking against other existing satellite data remains unclear. Here we assessed the benefits of using three satellite-based SIF products in yield prediction for maize and soybean in the U.S. Midwest: gap-filled SIF from Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2), new SIF retrievals from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and the coarse-resolution SIF retrievals from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). The yield prediction performances of using SIF data were benchmarked with those using satellite-based vegetation indices (VIs), including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and land surface temperature (LST). Five machine-learning algorithms were used to build yield prediction models with both remote-sensing-only and climate-remote-sensing-combined variables. We found that high-resolution SIF products from OCO-2 and TROPOMI outperformed coarse-resolution GOME-2 SIF product in crop yield prediction. Using high-resolution SIF products gave the best forward predictions for both maize and soybean yields in 2018, indicating the great potential of using satellite-based high-resolution SIF products for crop yield prediction. However, using currently available high-resolution SIF products did not guarantee consistently better yield prediction performances than using other satellite-based remote sensing variables in all the evaluated cases. The relative performances of using different remote sensing variables in yield prediction depended on crop types (maize or soybean), out-of-sample testing methods (five-fold-cross-validation or forward), and record length of training data. We also found that using NIRv could generally lead to better yield prediction performance than using NDVI, EVI, or LST, and using NIRv could achieve similar or even better yield prediction performance than using OCO-2 or TROPOMI SIF products. We concluded that satellite-based SIF products could be beneficial in crop yield prediction with more high-resolution and good-quality SIF products accumulated in the future. © 2020 The Authors","crop yield; forecasting; machine learning; prediction; Solar-induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence","chlorophyll; crop yield; fluorescence; forecasting method; machine learning; maize; NDVI; prediction; satellite imagery; soybean; Midwest; United States; Glycine max",Article,Scopus

This indicates that corn and soybean yields for a given year can be forecasted in advance, at the beginning of September, approximately a month or more ahead of harvesting time. A combination of the optimized DNN model and spatial statistical methods should be investigated in future work, to mitigate partly clustered errors in some regions. © 2019 by the authors.","Artificial intelligence; Crop yield; Meteorological dataset; Satellite product",,Review,Scopus

The timely and accurate crop yield predictions can be of great help for policy makers and farmers in planning and decision making. Generally, statistical models are employed to predict the crop yield which is time consuming and tedious. Emerging trends of deep learning and machine learning has come up as a major breakthrough in the arena. Deep learning models have the inherent ability to perform feature extraction in large dataset thus more suitable for predictions. In this paper, a deep learning-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model is employed to predict wheat crop yield of northern region of India. The present study also employed LSTM to unravel the vanishing gradient problem inherent in RNN model. Experiments were conducted using 43 years benchmark dataset and proposed model results were compared with three machine learning models. Evidently, the results obtained from RNN-LSTM model(RMSE: 147.12,MAE: 60.50), Artificial Neural Network(RMSE: 732.14,MAE: 623.13), Random Forest (RMSE: 540.88, MAE: 449.36) and Multivariate Linear Regression (RMSE: 915.64,MAE: 796.07), proved the efficacy of model.

Integrating the power of optimization, machine learning, and agronomic insight, we present a new predictive model (referred to as the interaction regression model) for crop yield prediction, which has three salient properties. First, it achieved a relative root mean square error of 8% or less in three Midwest states (Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa) in the US for both corn and soybean yield prediction, outperforming state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Second, it identified about a dozen environment by management interactions for corn and soybean yield, some of which are consistent with conventional agronomic knowledge whereas some others interactions require additional analysis or experiment to prove or disprove. Third, it quantitatively dissected crop yield into contributions from weather, soil, management, and their interactions, allowing agronomists to pinpoint the factors that favorably or unfavorably affect the yield of a given location under a given weather and management scenario. The most significant contribution of the new prediction model is its capability to produce accurate prediction and explainable insights simultaneously. This was achieved by training the algorithm to select features and interactions that are spatially and temporally robust to balance prediction accuracy for the training data and generalizability to the test data. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"algorithm; article; harvest; Illinois; Indiana; Iowa; machine learning; nonhuman; plant yield; prediction; soil management; soybean; weather",Article,Scopus

Feature selection can impact a machine learning model’s performance by defining a significant feature subset for increasing the performance and identifying the variability. This paper explains a novel hybrid feature extraction procedure, which is an aggregation of the correlation-based filter (CFS) and random forest recursive feature elimination (RFRFE) wrapper framework. The proposed feature extraction approach aims to identify an optimal subclass of features from a collection of climate, soil, and groundwater characteristics for constructing a crop-yield forecasting machine learning model with better performance and accuracy.

Digitization in the field of Indian agriculture is in the initial stage. Indian farmers are suffering from various issues such as ignorance about soil parameters and inability to predict the yield of crops. Also, various agriculture-related information from the government agencies is not communicated to the farmers. To address the above-said issues, we have built a cloud-based agricultural framework which enables the Indian farmers, agricultural departments, and agro industries to extract useful agricultural information. The designed agricultural cloud framework is providing two services, i.e., soil classification as a service and crop yield prediction as a service. For soil classification, hybrid support vector machine (M-SVM) and for wheat yield prediction, customized artificial neural network (M-ANN) was developed. To store the agricultural data, we are using Amazon S3 and for deployment of the services, we have used Heroku cloud. The performance improvements in the range of 2&#x2013;43%, 4&#x2013;35%, and 1&#x2013;11% were observed for M-SVM with respect to k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Na&#x00EF;ve Bayes (NB), and standard SVM classifiers, respectively. M-ANN performed with an improvement of 2% over standard artificial neural network (ANN) and 5% over multiple linear regression (MLR) models.

Due to uncertain climatic changes, farmers are struggling to attain a satisfactory amount of yield from the crops. Many researchers have studied on the prediction of weather, prediction of yield rate of crop, crop classification and soil classification for agriculture planning using statistical methods or machine learning techniques.

The main objectives are to explore whether a hybrid approach (crop modeling + ML) would result in better predictions, investigate which combinations of hybrid models provide the most accurate predictions, and determine the features from the crop modeling that are most effective to be integrated with ML for corn yield prediction. Five ML models (linear regression, LASSO, LightGBM, random forest, and XGBoost) and six ensemble models have been designed to address the research question. The results suggest that adding simulation crop model variables (APSIM) as input features to ML models can decrease yield prediction root mean squared error (RMSE) from 7 to 20%. Furthermore, we investigated partial inclusion of APSIM features in the ML prediction models and we found soil moisture related APSIM variables are most influential on the ML predictions followed by crop-related and phenology-related variables. Finally, based on feature importance measure, it has been observed that simulated APSIM average drought stress and average water table depth during the growing season are the most important APSIM inputs to ML.

Data-driven models use spatiotemporal information that relate to plant growth and can be correlated with yield. Such data is available at different spatial resolutions so a decision is needed about what spatial resolution we should model at which can be determined based on the required management resolution; however, this does not always match the resolution of the input data. Prediction quality can change with spatial resolution. Therefore, this work focused on exploring changes in prediction quality with changes in the spatial resolution of predictors and the predictions. More specifically, this study investigated whether inputs should be resampled prior to modeling or the modeling implemented first with aggregation of predictions happening as a final step. The study consisted of 59 fields over six years in the south-west region of Australia. Rainfed canola, barley and wheat were used for this study. Data used for modeling were acquired from different sources. These data consisted of interpolated yield monitor data and soil sensor data, Landsat 8 data, elevation data, digital soil maps, and weather data. The first approach was based on resampling the inputs to four spatial resolutions (10, 30, 90 m and whole-field-average).

Crop prediction methods are employed by detecting different soil parameters and factors connected to the atmosphere for predicting the appropriate crop. The unstable climate exposes farmers to danger in the environment. Therefore the correct history data must be maintained is essential. The data stored may be evaluated to predict agricultural production. In a cloud server, experts analyze sensed data, land type, land, climate, and farmers' economies with a prediction effect. The method forecasts the use of artificial intelligence algorithms for appropriate crops and fertilizers. A crucial strategy for handling numerous challenges connected to agriculture is the domain of artificial intelligence with its high-quality learning capacity. Technologies to help farmers find better solutions around the world are being created. To benefit from the parallel computational and storage management of huge data sets, the agricultural community must establish an architectural design that would enable the identification of new statistical structures to extract valuable information from data structures. These processes assist to explore the field and different challenges and effectively respond to certain challenges. In the improved integration of diverse data collection types from multiple sources, artificial intelligence offers attractive computing and analytical methods.

The results of sensitivity analysis showed that the yields of maize and soybean were both extremely sensitive to the reference harvest index (HI0) and the parameters of canopy growth and root growth. The difference was that maize was more sensitive to the canopy decline coefficient (CDC), while soybean was more sensitive to the shape factor for water stress coefficient for canopy expansion (Pexshp). Maize was more sensitive to the maximum effective rooting depth (Zx) because of its deep root, while soybean was more sensitive to the shape factor describing root zone expansion (Rexshp) because of its short roots. Maize was extremely sensitive to the crop coefficient before canopy formation and senescence (KcTr,x) and the normalized water productivity (WP*) due to the large water demand, while soybean was only generally sensitive. After calibrated the high sensitivity parameters with experiment data, the regression coefficient of simulated yield and measured yield of maize increased from 0.34 to 0.89, and the regression coefficient of simulated yield and measured yield of soybean increased from 0.80 to 0.88.

The objective of this paper is to provide an accurate and reliable prediction of crop yield. This will help farmers make decisions that can make their farming more efficient and profitable. We propose a novel deep learning model-an ensemble neural network model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) and one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We used crop data for over 30 crops from 1997-2015 of all Indian districts. Our model substantially outperforms all other models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) Regressor, Feed-forward Neural Network (FFNN)) that were tested on accuracy in predicting crop yields. We achieve a correlation coefficient value of over 0.90 and 0.92 for our model for train and test datasets.Our model has several advantages compared to other models. Firstly, it is able to capture the time dependency on temperature and rainfall. Secondly, it is able to work on a large and diverse dataset, unlike most models which only perform well in small regions. Lastly, it is able to use several diverse features-geographical, social, and economic to make a prediction. © 2021 IEEE.",,"Convolutional neural networks; Decision trees; Deep learning; Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Large dataset; Agricultural sector; Convolutional neural network; Crop yield; Ensemble neural network; Gradient boosting; Learning models; Neural network model; One-dimensional; Random forests; Yield prediction; Crops",Conference Paper,Scopus

The objective of this study is to analyse the contribution of intra seasonal rainfall indicators, namely dry and wet spells, for predicting millet yields at regional scale in Senegal using multiple linear regression. Using dry and wet spells with traditional indicators i.e. proxies of crop biomass and cumulated rainfall, hereafter called remote sensing indicators (NDVI, SPI3, WSI and RG), we analysed the ability of dry and wet spells alone or combined with these remote sensing indicators to provide intraseasonal forecasts covering the period 1991–2010. We analysed all 12 regions producing millet and found that results vary strongly between regions and also during the season, as a function of the dekad of prediction. At the spatial scale, the strongest performing combinations include the dry spell indicators DSC20 and DSxl in the peanut basin. While in the south of the country, the combination of wet period indicators WS1 or WSC5 with the RG is fairly reliable. Focussing on Thies, our best region in the groundnut basin, we showed that dry and wet spells indicators can explain up to 80% of yield variations, alone or in combination with remote sensing indicators. Regarding the timing of prediction, millet yield can be forecast as early as July with an accuracy of 40% of the mean yield but the best forecast is obtained in early September, at the peak of crop development (accuracy of 100 kg/ha i.e. 20% of the mean yield).

In previous studies, remote sensing data or climate data are often used alone in statistical yield estimation models. In this study, we synthetically used agrometeorological indicators and remote sensing vegetation parameters to estimate maize yield in Jilin and Liaoning Provinces of China. We applied two methods to select input variables, used the random forest method to establish yield estimation models, and verified the accuracy of the models in three disaster years (1997, 2000, and 2001). The results show that the R2 values of the eight yield estimation models established in the two provinces were all above 0.7, Lin’s concordance correlation coefficients were all above 0.84, and the mean absolute relative errors were all below 0.14. The mean absolute relative error of the yield estimations in the three disaster years was 0.12 in Jilin Province and 0.13 in Liaoning Province. A model built using variables selected by a two-stage importance evaluation method can obtain a better accuracy with fewer variables. The final yield estimation model of Jilin province adopts eight independent variables, and the final yield estimation model of Liaoning Province adopts nine independent variables. Among the 11 adopted variables in two provinces, ATT (accumulated temperature above 10◦C) variables accounted for the highest proportion (54.54%). In addition, the GPP (gross primary production) anomaly in August, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) anomaly in August, and standardized precipitation index with a two-month scale in July were selected as important modeling variables by all methods in the two provinces. This study provides a reference method for the selection of modeling variables, and the results are helpful for understanding the impact of climate on potential yield. © 2021 by the authors.

However, crop growth is a complex process, which makes it quite difficult to achieve better performance. To address this problem, a novel 3-D convolutional neural multikernel network is proposed to capture hierarchical features for predicting crop yield. First, a full 3-D convolutional neural network is constructed to maximally explore deep spatial-spectral features from multispectral images. Then, a multikernel learning (MKL) approach is proposed for fusion of intraimage deep spatial-spectral features and intersample spatial consistency features. Specifically, we assign a group of nonlinear kernels for each feature in the MKL framework, which provides a robust way to fit features extracted from different domains. Finally, the probability distribution of prediction results is obtained by a kernel-based method. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on China wheat yield prediction and offer detailed and systematic analyses of the performance of the proposed method.

The agencies require advance estimates of production of major crops at a regional scale for taking various policy decisions. Hence, it is necessary to develop operational systems for crop monitoring and yield forecasting. Unlike the traditional annual crop yield estimates based on the statistics-based framework, remote sensing techniques are recognized as an effective approach for yield forecasting. In particular, the microwave remote sensing data have gained importance due to its all-weather imaging capability and sensitivity to crop phenological changes. In this present work, an integrated framework ‘SASYA-Space technology for Agricultural Systems and Yield forecasting Algorithm’ is introduced for crop yield forecasting using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing images. SASYA incorporates a model inversion scheme to estimate crop biophysical parameters (Leaf Area Index–LAI and wet biomass) simultaneously using a multi-output support vector regression (MSVR). The framework cross-link the MSVR based inversion module with a yield prediction module, which utilizes the WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) crop simulation model. The robustness of the framework is assessed for estimation of winter barley yield using L-band NISAR data simulated using full-pol L-band E-SAR airborne SAR data acquired during AgriSAR 2006 campaign over DEMMIN test site in Germany. The simulated NISAR data in HH-HV-VV, HH-HV, and VV-HV modes are first compared by investigating accuracies to estimate crop biophysical parameters with the inversion of Water Cloud Model. These LAI and wet biomass estimates are then used in SASYA framework to assimilate with WOFOST crop yield model to estimate grain yield. Different polarization modes HH-HV-VV, HH-HV, and VV-HV are also assessed to investigate best performance in grain yield estimation. Also, different test cases are considered to find the suitable acquisition dates based on crop phenological stages, which returns the best potential yield estimation. The SAR images during heading and early fruit development stage are found to be most important for yield prediction with lowest RMSE error in the range of 0.57–1.612 ton/ha. The LAI, biomass and potential yield map indicate promising results, which can be used further for crop risk assessment for that region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Crop production; LAI; model inversion; NISAR; SAR; Wet biomass",,Article,Scopus

The results compared with the government’s yield statistics indicated good predictions, with the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) values between 7.1% and 11.8%, and Willmott’s index of agreement (d) values between 0.81 and 0.84 for the first crop, and 5.6% and 11.3% and d values between 0.91 and 0.95 for the second crop, respectively. A slight underestimation of yield predictions was observed for both crops, with the relative error (RE) values of −6.5% to −8.2% and −3.8% to −6% for the first and second crops, respectively. The results of regression analysis also confirmed a close agreement between these two datasets, with the correlation coefficient (r) higher than 0.84 (p-value <0.05), in both cases. Although some factors, including mixed-pixel issues, boundary effects, and cloud cover potentially affected the modelling results, our study demonstrated the effectiveness of ML methods for regional rice yield predictions from MODIS NDVI data in Taiwan. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Crops; Decision trees; Error statistics; Errors; Forecasting; Learning systems; Mean square error; Radiometers; Regression analysis; Support vector machines; Time series; Correlation coefficient; Data preprocessing; Index of agreements; Machine learning approaches; Mean absolute error; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer datum; Root mean square errors; Timeseries Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); Predictive analytics; crop yield; data processing; machine learning; MODIS; NDVI; prediction; rice; satellite data; satellite imagery; support vector machine; time series analysis; Taiwan",Article,Scopus

The full potential of these precision agriculture technologies may be exploited in combination with innovative methods of data processing such as machine learning (ML) algorithms for the extraction of useful information responsible for controlling crop yield. Four ML algorithms, namely linear regression (LR), elastic net (EN), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and support vector regression (SVR), were used to predict potato (Solatium tuberosum) tuber yield from data of soil and crop properties collected through proximal sensing. Six fields in Atlantic Canada including three fields in Prince Edward Island (PE) and three fields in New Brunswick (NB) were sampled, over two (2017 and 2018) growing seasons, for soil electrical conductivity, soil moisture content, soil slope, normalized-difference vegetative index (NDVI), and soil chemistry. Data were collected from 39-40 30 x 30 m2 locations in each field, four times throughout the growing season, and yield samples were collected manually at the end of the growing season. Four datasets, namely PE-2017, PE-2018, NB-2017, and NB-2018, were then formed by combing data points from three fields to represent the province data for the respective years. Modeling techniques were employed to generate yield predictions assessed with different statistical parameters. The SVR models outperformed all other models for NB-2017, NB-2018, PE-2017, and PE-2018 dataset with RMSE of 5.97, 4.62, 6.60, and 6.17 t/ha, respectively.

The study also showed that large datasets are required to generate useful results using either model.

In Brazil soybean yield data generally demand various revisions through the following months after harvest suggesting that there is space for improving the accuracy and the time of yield predictions. This study presents a novel model to perform in-season (“near real-time”) soybean yield forecasts in southern Brazil using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Neural Networks, satellite imagery and weather data. The objectives of this study were to: (i) compare the performance of three different algorithms (multivariate OLS linear regression, random forest and LSTM neural networks) for forecasting soybean yield using NDVI, EVI, land surface temperature and precipitation as independent variables, and (ii) evaluate how early (during the soybean growing season) this method is able to forecast yield with reasonable accuracy. Satellite and weather data were masked using a non-crop-specific layer with field boundaries obtained from the Rural Environment Registry that is mandatory for all farmers in Brazil. Main outcomes from this study were: (i) soybean yield forecasts at municipality-scale with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.24 Mg ha−1 at DOY 64 (march 5) (ii) a superior performance of the LSTM neural networks relative to the other algorithms for all the forecast dates except DOY 16 where multivariate OLS linear regression provided the best performance, and (iii) model performance (e.g., MAE) for yield forecast decreased when predictions were performed earlier in the season, with MAE increasing from 0.24 Mg ha−1 to 0.42 Mg ha−1 (last values from OLS regression) when forecast timing changed from DOY 64 (March 5) to DOY 16 (January 6).

As a result, it is of great importance to construct powerful predictive models for phenotype prediction based on Genotype and Environment data (so-called G by E problem). The objective of the G by E analysis is to understand how genotype and the environment jointly determine the phenotype (such as crop yield and disease resistance) of plant or animal species. In this research, deep neural networks are trained and used as predictive models. Deep neural networks have become a popular tool in supervise learning due to considerable ability in training nonlinear features [5]. Recent articles have stated that the network depth is a vital factor in decreasing classification or regression error. But, deeper networks have a so-called vanishing/exploding gradients problem which makes the training and optimizing deeper networks difficult. He et al. proposed residual learning method which alleviates this problem very well and showed that deep residual networks are significantly better and more efficient than previous typical networks [5]. As a result, residual training has been used in this research to prevent gradient degradation and ease the optimization process. Finally, since it is difficult to predict the yield difference directly, two separate residual neural networks have been trained to predict yield and check yield. After training the networks, the RMSE for check yield and yield are 8.23 and 10.52, respectively, which are very good because of considerable amount of missing values, uncertainty, and complexity in the datasets. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Deep neural networks; G-by-E interaction analysis; Machine learning; Supervised learning",,Conference Paper,Scopus

In the 2018 Syngenta Crop Challenge, Syngenta released several large datasets that recorded the genotype and yield performances of 2,267 maize hybrids planted in 2,247 locations between 2008 and 2016 and asked participants to predict the yield performance in 2017. As one of the winning teams, we designed a deep neural network (DNN) approach that took advantage of state-of-the-art modeling and solution techniques. Our model was found to have a superior prediction accuracy, with a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) being 12% of the average yield and 50% of the standard deviation for the validation dataset using predicted weather data. With perfect weather data, the RMSE would be reduced to 11% of the average yield and 46% of the standard deviation. We also performed feature selection based on the trained DNN model, which successfully decreased the dimension of the input space without significant drop in the prediction accuracy. Our computational results suggested that this model significantly outperformed other popular methods such as Lasso, shallow neural networks (SNN), and regression tree (RT). The results also revealed that environmental factors had a greater effect on the crop yield than genotype. © 2019 Khaki and Wang.","Deep learning; Feature selection; Machine learning; Weather prediction; Yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

However, few studies focus specifically on fundamental issues encountered in developing a high-performance statistical crop model for yield prediction. Such issues include: how to select predictors and fitting functions, how to effectively address the spatiotemporal scale issue, weather it is beneficial to include satellite data as explanatory variables, and how to reconcile different model evaluation procedures. In this study, we present our statistical modeling practices for predicting rainfed corn yield in the Midwest U.S. and address the aforementioned issues through comprehensive diagnostic analysis. Our results show that vapor pressure deficit and precipitation at a monthly scale, in spline form with customized knots, define the “Best Climate-only” model among alternative climate variables (e.g., air temperature) and fitting functions (e.g., linear or polynomial), with an out-of-sample (leave-one-year-out) median R 2 of 0.79 and RMSE of 1.04 t/ha (16.6 bu/acre) from 2003 to 2016. Satellite variables, such as MODIS land surface temperature and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), when used as predictors alone, reduce the model's RMSE to 0.93 t/ha (14.8 bu/acre). Adding satellite variables (i.e., EVI in polynomial form) to the “Best Climate-only” model gives the “Best Climate + EVI” model, which has the highest prediction performance of this study, with a median R 2 of 0.85 and RMSE of 0.90 t/ha (14.3 bu/acre). Such a model trained using all data (so-called “global model”) in most cases leads to better predictions than the state-specific trained models. However, the global model's prediction performance exhibits considerable regional and interannual variations. The regional-varying performance is related to states’ spatiotemporal variability in yield, where states with larger spatial yield variability show higher R 2 , and states with smaller temporal yield variability show lower RMSE. Interannual variations in prediction performance are linked to yield variability and degree of wetness, with higher R 2 in years with larger yield variability but increasingly larger RMSE toward wetter years and extreme dry years. These identified spatial and temporal variations of model's performance, together with inconsistent evaluation practices undermine the comparability between statistical modeling studies. Alleviating such comparability issues requires more transparency and open data practices. The statistical model presented in this study provides a benchmark for further development and can be applied to future research related to yield prediction or assessment of climate change impact. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Corn; Statistical model; Yield forecast; Yield prediction","agricultural modeling; agriculture; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; forecasting method; land surface; maize; model; MODIS; prediction; rainfed agriculture; spatiotemporal analysis; statistical analysis; surface temperature; vapor pressure; vegetation index; Midwest; United States; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The selection of crops will depend upon the different parameters such as market price, production rate and the different government policies. Many changes are required in the agriculture field to improve changes in our Indian economy.

In order to optimally control greenhouses’ environmental parameters, one indispensable requirement is to accurately predict crop yields based on given environmental parameter settings. In addition, crop yield forecasting in greenhouses plays an important role in greenhouse farming planning and management, which allows cultivators and farmers to utilize the yield prediction results to make knowledgeable management and financial decisions. It is thus important to accurately predict the crop yield in a greenhouse considering the benefits that can be brought by accurate greenhouse crop yield prediction. In this work, we have developed a new greenhouse crop yield prediction technique, by combining two state-of-the-arts networks for temporal sequence processing—temporal convolutional network (TCN) and recurrent neural network (RNN). Comprehensive evaluations of the proposed algorithm have been made on multiple datasets obtained from multiple real greenhouse sites for tomato growing. Based on a statistical analysis of the root mean square errors (RMSEs) between the predicted and actual crop yields, it is shown that the proposed approach achieves more accurate yield prediction performance than both traditional machine learning methods and other classical deep neural networks. Moreover, the experimental study also shows that the historical yield information is the most important factor for accurately predicting future crop yields. © 2021 by the authors.

Information mining from multi-channel geo-spatiotemporal data however poses great challenges to many computational sustainability applications. Most existing approaches adopt various dimensionality reduction techniques without fully taking advantage of the spatiotemporal nature of the data. In addition, the lack of labeled training data raises another challenge for modeling such data. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised attention-based deep representation model that learns context-aware spatiotemporal representations for prediction tasks. A combination of convolutional neural networks with a hybrid attention mechanism is adopted to extract spatial and temporal variations in the geo-spatiotemporal data. Recognizing the importance of capturing more complete temporal dependencies, we propose the hybrid attention mechanism which integrates a learnable global query into the classic self-attention mechanism. To overcome the data scarcity issue, sampled spatial and temporal context that naturally reside in the largely-available unlabeled geo-spatiotemporal data are exploited to aid meaningful representation learning. We conduct experiments on a large-scale real-world crop yield prediction task.

Numerous models have been presented to explain such variability in crop yield using data from multiple sources with varying temporal and spatial resolutions. Some of these models are data driven, which focus on approximating the complex relationship between explanatory variables and crop yield from massive data sets. Others are knowledge driven, which focus on integrating scientific understanding of crop growth mechanism in the modeling structure. We propose a new model that leverages the computational efficiency and prediction accuracy of data driven models and incorporates agronomic insights from knowledge driven models.

WHO states that there are three pillars of food security: availability, access, and usage. Among these three pillars, availability is the most important one. Ensuring food for the entire population of a country is achieved only through an increase in crop production. Accurate and timely forecasting of the weather can help to increase the yield production. Early prediction of crop yield has a vital role in food availability measure. Researchers monitor different parameters that affect the crop yield regularly. Yield prediction did through either statistical data or spatial data. Crop monitoring through remote sensing can cover a vast land area. Therefore, spatial data-based prediction is widespread in recent decades. Satellite images such as multispectral, hyperspectral, and radar images were used to calculate crop area, soil moisture, field greenness, etc. Among these imaging modalities, hyperspectral images give more accurate results, but its higher dimensionality is a challenging issue. Optimal band selection from hyperspectral images helps to reduce this curse of dimensionality problem. Crop area is one of the essential parameters for yield prediction. The exact crop area measure can be achieved only through the best crop discrimination methods. This paper provides a comprehensive review of crop yield prediction using hyperspectral images.

There are several changes faced by the farmers due to various factors such as water shortage, undefined price owing to demand–supply, weather uncertainties, and inaccurate crop prediction. The prediction of crop yield, notably paddy yield, is an intricate assignment owing to its dependency on several factors such as crop genotype, environmental factors, management practices, and their interactions. Researchers are used to predicting the paddy yield using statistical approaches, but they failed to attain higher accuracy due to several factors. Therefore, machine learning methods such as support vector regression (SVR), general regression neural networks (GRNNs), radial basis functional neural networks (RBFNNs), and back-propagation neural networks (BPNNs) are demonstrated to predict the paddy yield accurately for the Cauvery Delta Zone (CDZ), which lies in the eastern part of Tamil Nadu, South India. The performance of each developed model is examined using assessment metrics such as coefficient of determination (R2 ), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of variance (CV), and normalized mean squared error (NMSE). The observed results show that the GRNN algorithm delivers superior evaluation metrics such as R2, RMSE, MAE, MSE, MAPE, CV, and NSME values about 0.9863, 0.2295 and 0.1290, 0.0526, 1.3439, 0.0255, and 0.0136, respectively, which ensures accurate crop yield prediction compared with other methods. Finally, the performance of the GRNN model is compared with other available models from several studies in the literature, and it is found to be high while comparing the prediction accuracy using evaluation metrics. © 2021 by the authors.

The data and methods they used may not be transferable to other crops and locations. On the other hand, operational large-scale systems, such as the European Commission's MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS), do not use machine learning. Machine learning is a promising method especially when large amounts of data are being collected and published. We combined agronomic principles of crop modeling with machine learning to build a machine learning baseline for large-scale crop yield forecasting. The baseline is a workflow emphasizing correctness, modularity and reusability. For correctness, we focused on designing explainable predictors or features (in relation to crop growth and development) and applying machine learning without information leakage. We created features using crop simulation outputs and weather, remote sensing and soil data from the MCYFS database. We emphasized a modular and reusable workflow to support different crops and countries with small configuration changes. The workflow can be used to run repeatable experiments (e.g. early season or end of season predictions) using standard input data to obtain reproducible results. The results serve as a starting point for further optimizations. In our case studies, we predicted yield at regional level for five crops (soft wheat, spring barley, sunflower, sugar beet, potatoes) and three countries (the Netherlands (NL), Germany (DE), France (FR)). We compared the performance with a simple method with no prediction skill, which either predicted a linear yield trend or the average of the training set. We also aggregated the predictions to the national level and compared with past MCYFS forecasts. The normalized RMSE (NRMSE) for early season predictions (30 days after planting) were comparable for NL (all crops), DE (all except soft wheat) and FR (soft wheat, spring barley, sunflower). For example, NRMSE was 7.87 for soft wheat (NL) (6.32 for MCYFS) and 8.21 for sugar beet (DE) (8.79 for MCYFS). In contrast, NRMSEs for soft wheat (DE), sugar beet (FR) and potatoes (FR) were twice as much compared to MCYFS. NRMSEs for end of season were still comparable to MCYFS for NL, but worse for DE and FR.

Timely and reliable wheat yield prediction in Australia is important for regional and global food security. Prior studies use either climate data, or satellite data, or a combination of these two to build empirical models to predict crop yield. However, though the performance of yield prediction using empirical methods is improved by combining the use of climate and satellite data, the contributions from different data sources are still not clear. In addition, how the regression-based methods compare with various machine-learning based methods in their performance in yield prediction is also not well understood and needs in-depth investigation. This work integrated various sources of data to predict wheat yield across Australia from 2000 to 2014 at the statistical division (SD)level. We adopted a well-known regression method (LASSO, as a benchmark)and three mainstream machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, and neural network)to build various empirical models for yield prediction. For satellite data, we used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI)from MODIS and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF)from GOME-2 and SCIAMACHY as metrics to approximate crop productivity. The machine-learning based methods outperform the regression method in modeling crop yield. Our results confirm that combining climate and satellite data can achieve high performance of yield prediction at the SD level (R2 ˜ 0.75). The satellite data track crop growth condition and gradually capture the variability of yield evolving with the growing season, and their contributions to yield prediction usually saturate at the peak of the growing season. Climate data provide extra and unique information beyond what the satellite data have offered for yield prediction, and our empirical modeling work shows the added values of climate variables exist across the whole season, not only at some certain stages. We also find that using EVI as an input can achieve better performance in yield prediction than SIF, primarily due to the large noise in the satellite-based SIF data (i.e. coarse resolution in both space and time). In addition, we also explored the potential for timely wheat yield prediction in Australia, and we can achieve the optimal prediction performance with approximately two-month lead time before wheat maturity. The proposed methodology in this paper can be extended to different crops and different regions for crop yield prediction. © 2019","Crop yield prediction; Enhanced vegetation index; Machine learning; Solar-induced fluorescence; Wheat","climate change; crop yield; fluorescence; machine learning; MODIS; prediction; satellite data; SCIAMACHY; solar activity; vegetation index; wheat; Australia; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Early crop yield predictions assist the farmers, decision-makers in making timely decisions during the actual growing season. In many developing countries such as India, the process of crop yield prediction is done manually, based on surveys and field visits which are time-consuming, expensive and prone to human error. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a hybrid prediction strategy which can be applied to predict agricultural information such as crop yield and air temperature with a critical focus on crop yield prediction. The weighted principal component analysis (w-PCA) is used as the feature extraction strategy to extract the relevant features. A hybrid prediction strategy integrating artificial neural network (ANN) with modified-particle swarm optimization (m-PSO) is proposed. Initial parameters of ANN are selected using m-PSO with modified inertia weight and velocity update equations. This hybridized ANN then performs prediction on the selected features. This proposed prediction model which we call as hybrid-ANN (H-ANN) comprises of w-PCA as feature extractor, m-PSO for selecting initial weights and biases of ANN. Experiments were performed on eight real world and two benchmark agriculture data sets for crop yield and air temperature prediction. Results show that the proposed prediction model (H-ANN) performed with improvements in the range of 2 to 30%, 0.2 to 4% and 0.12 to 3% with respect to R-squared (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) respectively when compared to other prediction models such as ANN, ANN trained using GA (GA-ANN), ANN trained using standard PSO (SPSO-ANN), multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR) and ensemble of bagged regression trees (ET) on benchmark and real-world agricultural datasets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; ANN; Hybrid; Prediction; PSO","Agricultural robots; Atmospheric temperature; Crops; Decision making; Developing countries; Errors; Linear regression; Mean square error; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Predictive analytics; Support vector regression; Agricultural informations; Mean absolute error; Modified particle swarm optimization; Multiple linear regressions; Root mean square errors; Support vector regression (SVR); Velocity update equation; Weighted principal component analysis; Forecasting",Article,Scopus

Remote sensing is becoming increasingly important in crop yield prediction. Based on remote sensing data, great progress has been made in this field by using machine learning, especially the Deep Learning (DL) method, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Recent experiments in this area suggested that CNN can explore more spatial features and LSTM has the ability to reveal phenological characteristics, which both play an important role in crop yield prediction. However, very few experiments combining these two models for crop yield prediction have been reported. In this paper, we propose a deep CNN-LSTM model for both end-of-season and in-season soybean yield prediction in CONUS at the county-level. The model was trained by crop growth variables and environment variables, which include weather data, MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) data, and MODIS Surface Reflectance (SR) data; historical soybean yield data were employed as labels. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), all these training data were combined and transformed into histogram-based tensors for deep learning. The results of the experiment indicate that the prediction performance of the proposed CNN-LSTM model can outperform the pure CNN or LSTM model in both end-of-season and in-season. The proposed method shows great potential in improving the accuracy of yield prediction for other crops like corn, wheat, and potatoes at fine scales in the future. © 2019 by the authors.

Previous studies using either climate or satellite data or both to build empirical or statistical models have prevailed for decades. However, to what extent climate and satellite data can improve yield prediction is still unknown. In addition, fertilizer information may also improve crop yield prediction, especially in regions with different fertilizer systems, such as cover crop, min-eral fertilizer, or compost. Machine learning (ML) has been widely and successfully applied in crop yield prediction. Here, we attempted to predict maize yield from 1994 to 2007 at the plot scale by integrating multi-source data, including monthly climate data, satellite data (i.e., vegetation indices (VIs)), fertilizer data, and soil data to explore the accuracy of different inputs to yield prediction. The results show that incorporating all of the datasets using random forests (RF) and AB (adaptive boosting) can achieve better performances in yield prediction (R2: 0.85~0.98). In addition, the com-bination of VIs, climate data, and soil data (VCS) can predict maize yield more effectively than other combinations (e.g., combinations of all data and combinations of VIs and soil data). Furthermore, we also found that including different fertilizer systems had different prediction accuracies. This paper aggregates data from multiple sources and distinguishes the effects of different fertilization scenarios on crop yield predictions. In addition, the effects of different data on crop yield were an-alyzed in this study. Our study provides a paradigm that can be used to improve yield predictions for other crops and is an important effort that combines multi-source remotely sensed and environ-mental data for maize yield prediction at the plot scale and develops timely and robust methods for maize yield prediction grown under different fertilizing systems. © 2021 by the authors.

However, STARMA cannot process nonlinear spatiotemporal relationships in datasets. Alternately, Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) is a most popular machine learning algorithm to model the nonlinear pattern in data. To overcome these limitations, two-stage STARMA approach was developed to predict rice yield in some of the most intensive national rice agroecosystems in India.

In this study, the ET-based indicators were computed using two different approaches: (i) a prognostic model, SoilClim, which computes the water balance based on ground weather observations and information about soil and land cover; (ii) the diagnostic Atmosphere–Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) model based primarily on remotely sensed land surface temperature data. The capability of both sets of indicators to predict yields of spring barley and winter wheat was tested using artificial neural networks (ANNs) applied to the adjusting number and timeframe of inputs during the growing season. Yield predictions based on ANNs were computed for both crops for all districts together, as well as for individual districts. The root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) between observed and predicted yields varied with date within the growing season and with the number of ANN inputs used for yield prediction. The period with the highest predictive capability started from early-June to mid-June. This optimal period for yield prediction was identifiable already at the lower number of ANN inputs, nevertheless, the accuracy of the prediction improved as more inputs were included within ANNs.The RMSE values for individual districts varied between 0.4 and 0.7 t ha–1 while R2 reached values of 0.5–0.8 during the optimal period.

The prediction of the optimal crop includes production of the crop, marketing, supply chain, storage, transportation, etc., along with the constraints and satisfying the risk associated with it. In this current research, firefly algorithm has been used for optimizing maize crop yield by considering the various constraints and risks. This research investigates the development of new firefly algorithm module for predicting the optimal climatic conditions and predicts the crop cultivation output. As the pre-processing, the maize crop cultivation data for 96 months have been collected and provided as response to Minitab software to formulate the relational equation. The collected data have been stored in the cloud using IoT and the cloud has to be updated periodically for obtaining accurate results from the algorithm. This equation has been used fitness function to deliver precise forecast of crop yield. The considered noteworthy variables are average amount of rainfall, irrigation facility and atmospheric air temperature to identify best combination which can yield higher maize crop cultivation.

Its main purpose is reducing the risk in the decision-making process affecting the yield in terms of quantity and quality. The aim of the following study was to generate a linear and non-linear model to forecast the tuber yield of three very early potato cultivars: Arielle, Riviera, and Viviana. In order to achieve the set goal of the study, data from the period 2010–2017 were collected, coming from official varietal experiments carried out in northern and northwestern Poland. The linear model has been created based on multiple linear regression analysis (MLR), while the non-linear model has been built using artificial neural networks (ANN). The created models can predict the yield of very early potato varieties on 20th June. Agronomic, phytophenological, and meteorological data were used to prepare the models, and the correctness of their operation was verified on the basis of separate sets of data not participating in the construc-tion of the models. For the proper validation of the model, six forecast error metrics were used: i.e., global relative approximation error (RAE), root mean square error (RMS), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). As a result of the conducted analyses, the forecast error results for most models did not exceed 15% of MAPE. The predictive neural model NY1 was characterized by better values of quality measures and ex post forecast errors than the regression model RY1. © 2021 by the authors.

However, regrettable is the yield per hectare of crops in comparison to international standards. This is one of the possible causes for a higher suicide rate among marginal farmers in India. This paper proposes a viable and user-friendly yield prediction system for the farmers. The proposed system provides connectivity to farmers via a mobile application. GPS helps to identify the user location. The user provides the area and soil type as input.

The novelty of this work is Borda Count based fusion strategy on the ranked features obtained from various ranking methodologies. Proposed prediction model works in three phases; in the first phase, three feature ranking approaches such as; Random Forest, Support Vector Regression-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVR-RFE) and F-Test are applied individually on the two datasets of three coastal areas and features are ranked as per the their algorithm. In the second phase; Borda Count as a fusion method has been implemented on those ranked features from the above phase to obtain top five best features. The multiquadratic activation function based Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has been used to predict the rice crop yield using those ranked features obtained from fusion based raking strategy and the number of varying features are obtained which gives prediction accuracy above 99% in the third phase of experimentation. Finally, the statistical paired T-test has been used to evaluate and validate the significance of proposed fusion based ranking prediction model.

This paper titled: ‘Prediction Through Real & Effective, Enhanced Technological Intelligence (PREETI) Model Using Spatial Feature Vector for Analyzing Geo Spatial Data’focuses on the prediction of crop yield, where two models of machine learning are developed for this work. One is Modified Convolutional Neural Network(MCNN), and the other is hybrid model-TLBO (Teacher Learning Based Optimization), a Genetic algorithm which reduces the input size of data. In this work, some spatial information used for analysis is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Standard Precipitation Index and Vegetation Condition Index. TLBO finds some best feature value set in the data that represents the specific yield of the crop. So, these selected features valued set is passed in the Error Back Propagation Neural Network for learning. Here, the training was done in such a way that all set of features were utilized in pair with their yield value as output.

Data assimilation (DA) provides a way of blending the monitoring properties of EO data with the predictive and explanatory abilities of crop growth models. In this paper, we first provide a critique of both the advantages and disadvantages of both EO data and crop growth models.

This treatment allows us to provide some recommendation on the choice of DA method for particular applications.

The goal is to find the optimum cultivation and harvest period such that farmers' income is maximized. To make our study realistic, the actual climatic data from each district in Thailand together with the actual rice yields were used to construct the yield estimator where the decision tree with Adaboost was employed. Next, we constructed the simulated farming environments for different districts in Thailand and employed the deep Q-learning neural network to find the optimum actions.

The precise and prompt spatial categorization of the soil varieties and the forecast of crop yield rooted in the spatial big data have emerged as significant factors for the realistic purposes. In this regard, the spatially explicit crop-type information may be fruitfully utilized so as to evaluate the crop areas for a host of monitoring and decision-making applications like the crop insurance, land rental, supply-chain logistics, and the financial market forecasting. The underlying motive behind the current investigation is to effectively describe a modified support vector machine (MSVM) technique to effectively classify the soil type. The recommended crop and crop yield forecast is solely dependent on the soil type. In this regard, it is highly essential for the effective farm management to have appropriate output forecast in accordance with the amalgamation of several factors having a corresponding impact. In the document, three key functions like the big data decrease, soil categorization, and the crop recommendation including output forecast are performed. As a matter of fact, the crop changes from one farm to another on the basis of the planting dates, diversity, soil environment and the crop organization. With the result, it becomes indispensable to have an effective determination on the category of soil to be used. In the paper, the input is represented by the big data. The category of soil is ascertained by means of the procedure of the map reduce framework. The map reduction, in turn, is effectively attained with the help of the kernel principle component analysis (KPCA). Incidentally, the map reduction involves two key procedures such as the mapper and reducer. While the soil category is decided in the mapper side, the investigating procedure occurs in reducer side. Further, the innovative technique takes due consideration of the recommendation and output forecast of the crop, by elegantly employing an Optimal Artificial Neural Network classifier (OANN). In the document, the crop is recommended and the output forecast is carried out for the future years. © BEIESP.","Crop Yield prediction; KPCA; MSVM; OANN and Map reduction; Soil; Spatial big data",,Article,Scopus

Simple linear bias correction methods are used for temperature, and non-linear corrections are used for other meteorological variables. The WOFOST and CROPWAT models are used to predict the crop yield and water requirement of cassava using the scenarios of 2030, 2050, and 2070 for the representative concentration pathway 4.5 derived from the Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG). The percentage change in crop yield predictions with and without bias corrections of meteorological variables ranges from 7.6 to 10.8%, 1.6 to 5.4%, and − 3.0 to 4.0% respectively for 2030, 2050, and 2070. The bias corrections made an increment in the gross irrigation requirements of cassava with 16.5, 17.8, and 16.0% in 2030, 2050, and 2070 respectively, compared to the values without bias corrections. The outcome of this study indicates that raw meteorological variables directly from the climate models result over-/underestimation of yield and irrigation requirements of cassava, and the bias corrections help to issue reliable crop yield predictions. Results show zero yield reductions of cassava until 2050, and beyond that, there can be reductions in the crop yield. The gross irrigation requirements of cassava increase in the future to achieve higher productivity. However, this study needs to extend to other major growing regions in India to derive a general conclusion. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Biases; Climate model; Crop model; Future scenario; Gross irrigation; Yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

Though successful, machine learning models generated within a specific spatial domain often lose their validity when directly applied to new regions. To address this issue, we designed an unsupervised adaptive domain adversarial neural network (ADANN). Specifically, through domain adversarial training, the ADANN model reduced the impact of domain shift by projecting data from different domains into the same subspace. Also, the ADANN model was designed to be trained in an adaptive way, which guaranteed the model can learn the domain-invariant features and perform accurate yield prediction simultaneously. Informative variables including time-series vegetation indices and sequential weather observations were first collected from multiple data sources and aggregated to the county level. Then, we trained the ADANN model with the extracted features and corresponding reported county-level corn yield from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Finally, the trained model was evaluated in four testing years 2016–2019. The U.S. corn belt was used as the study area and counties under study were grouped into two diverse ecological regions. The experimental results showed that the developed ADANN model had better performance than three other state-of-the-art machine learning models in both local experiments (train and test in the same region) and transfer experiments (train and test in different regions).

There are increasing concerns with respect to how to integrate multi-source data and employ machine learning techniques to establish a simple, timely, and accurate crop yield prediction model at an administrative unit. Many previous studies were mainly focused on the whole crop growth period through expensive manual surveys, remote sensing, or climate data. However, the effect of selecting different time window on yield prediction was still unknown. Thus, we separated the whole growth period into four time windows and assessed their corresponding predictive ability by taking the major winter wheat production regions of China as an example in the study. Firstly we developed a modeling framework to integrate climate data, remote sensing data and soil data to predict winter wheat yield based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The results show that the models can accurately predict yield 1~2 months before the harvesting dates at the county level in China with an R2 &gt; 0.75 and yield error less than 10%. Support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and random forest (RF) represent the top three best methods for predicting yields among the eight typical machine learning models tested in this study. In addition, we also found that different agricultural zones and temporal training settings affect prediction accuracy. The three models perform better as more winter wheat growing season information becomes available. Our findings highlight a potentially powerful tool to predict yield using multiple-source data and machine learning in other regions and for crops. © 2020 by the authors.","Google Earth Engine (GEE); Machine learning; Multi-source data; Triticum aestivum L.; Wheat yield prediction","Crops; Decision trees; Earth (planet); Engines; Food supply; Forecasting; Random forests; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Different time windows; Gaussian process regression; Google earths; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Multisource data; Triticum aestivum L; Wheat yield; Learning systems",Article,Scopus

Yet, modeling crop yield is challenging because of the complexity of the relationships between crop growth and the interrelated predictor variables. This research work employed artificial intelligence (AI) technique for rice and potato crop yield prediction model in the region of Tarakeswar block, Hooghly District, West Bengal, for rice and potato. The major variables used were climatic factors, static soil parameters, available soil nutrient, agricultural practice parameters, farm mechanization, terrain distribution and socioeconomic condition. The analyzed datasets covered 2017 to 2018 seasons and were split into two parts with seventy percent data used for model training and the remaining thirty percent for validation. The mean rice and potato yield obtained from the seventy-farm plot location was about 4.68 t/ha and 18.67 t/ ha, whereas the artificial neural networks (ANN) model estimated with 97% accuracy and R2 value of both the crop is 0.93 and 0.94 with an RMSE of 0.29 t/ha and 1.34 t/ha, respectively. Deep neural networks (DNN) outperformed among the three model, where only support vector machine (SVM) had a sound performance for the training data but low for the validation dataset due to overfitting problem within RMSE and R2 value. The optimized DNN model produced the highest prediction accuracy 98% for rice and potato crop (RMSE = 0.20 ton/ha and 0.95 t/ ha; R2 = 0.98 and 0.97, respectively), which indicates good correlation between the field-measured crop yield and estimated yield.

China contributes nearly one-fifth of the total production alone with its decreasing arable land. Timely and accurate prediction of maize yield in China is critical for ensuring global food security. Previous studies primarily used either visible or near-infrared (NIR) based vegetation indices (VIs), or climate data, or both to predict crop yield. However, other satellite data from different spectral bands have been underutilized, which contain unique information on crop growth and yield. In addition, although a joint application of multi-source data significantly improves crop yield prediction, the combinations of input variables that could achieve the best results have not been well investigated. Here we integrated optical, fluorescence, thermal satellite, and environmental data to predict county-level maize yield across four agro-ecological zones (AEZs) in China using a regression-based method (LASSO), two machine learning (ML) methods (RF and XGBoost), and deep learning (DL) network (LSTM). The results showed that combining multi-source data explained more than 75% of yield variation. Satellite data at the silking stage contributed more information than other variables, and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) had an almost equivalent performance with the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) largely due to the low signal to noise ratio and coarse spatial resolution. The extremely high temperature and vapor pressure deficit during the reproductive period were the most important climate variables affecting maize production in China. Soil properties and management factors contained extra information on crop growth conditions that cannot be fully captured by satellite and climate data. We found that ML and DL approaches definitely outperformed regression-based methods, and ML had more computational efficiency and easier generalizations relative to DL.

It also explores that application of big data technologies can help farmer to weather forecasting, crop selection, irrigation management, crop diseases and pest management, crop yield prediction, agricultural marketing, and agricultural policy decision. But farmer needs help from an expert team to implement the facilities at field level. The study argues that a commercial implementation of big data technologies requires government initiatives, private sector’s involvement and a public-private partnership to supply related facilities to farmers in time. © 2020, IJSTR.","Agricultural development; Digital agriculture; Digital farm; Precision agriculture; Smart agriculture; Smart farming; Sustainable agriculture",,Article,Scopus

Seventy percent of population in India is dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. With the available resources and infrastructure villagers are able to produce the crop not to the fullest potential yield. In order to augment the efforts of farmers to get higher yields a predictive model was developed. This will help farmers by predicting the yield of the upcoming season by using machine learning and deep learning algorithms such as Deep Neural Network Regressor, Gaussian Process Regressor, Linear Regression and Lasso Regression. This can be done by understanding the relationship between factors that affect crop production (like area, seasonal monthly average temperature, seasonal monthly average humidity, seasonal monthly average rainfall, seasonal monthly average wind speed, seasonal monthly average UV index, seasonal monthly average sun hours, and seasonal monthly average pressure) and crop yield. Prediction will be performed on rice as it is one of the major crops produced in India.

The Simple Algorithm for Yield Estimation (SAFY) has been applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based data to provide high spatial yield prediction and estimation for winter wheat. However, this crop model relies on the relationship between crop leaf weight and biomass, which only considers the contribution of leaves on the final biomass and yield calculation. This study developed the modified SAFY-height model by incorporating an allometric relationship between ground-based measured crop height and biomass. A piecewise linear regression model is used to establish the relationship between crop height and biomass. The parameters of the modified SAFY-height model are calibrated using ground measurements. Then, the calibrated modified SAFY-height model is applied on the UAV-based photogrammetric point cloud derived crop height and effective leaf area index (LAIe) maps to predict winter wheat yield. The growing accumulated temperature turning points of an allometric relationship between crop height and biomass is 712 °C. The modified SAFY-height model, relative to traditional SAFY, provided more accurate yield estimation for areas with LAI higher than 1.01 m2/m2.

Land Surface Models (LSMs) are important components of the climate models, which help to capture the water, energy, and momentum exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere, providing lower boundary conditions to the atmospheric models. The objectives of this review paper are to highlight the areas of improvement in land modeling using ML and discuss the crucial ML techniques in detail. Literature searches were conducted using the relevant key words to obtain an extensive list of articles. The bibliographic lists of these articles were also considered. To date, ML-based techniques have been able to upgrade the performance of LSMs and reduce uncertainties by improving evapotranspiration and heat fluxes estimation, parameter optimization, better crop yield prediction, and model benchmarking. Widely used ML techniques used for these purposes include Artificial Neural Networks and Random Forests. We conclude that further improvements in land modeling are possible in terms of high-resolution data preparation, parameter calibration, uncertainty reduction, efficient model performance, and data assimilation using ML.

This paper first investigates an innovative approach of yield forecasting using a dynamic factor model. Based on the proposed approach, we then design an enhanced weather index-based insurance (IBI) policy. The dynamic factor approach is motivated by its ability to effectively summarize the information in a large set of explanatory variables with common factors of a much lower dimension. This makes it possible to use an extensive set of variables in crop yield prediction without worrying about identification issues. Using both county-level and state-level crop production data from the state of Illinois, U.S., the empirical results show that the dynamic factor approach produces more accurate in- and out-of-sample forecasting results compared to the classical statistical models. The empirical results also support that the proposed IBI policy based on the dynamic forecasting model has small basis risk. This, in turn, greatly improves the IBI's hedge effectiveness against agricultural production as well as increases its practicality as an insurance policy for agriculture. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Basis risk; Crop yield forecasting; Dimension reduction; Factor model; Index-based insurance ‘",,Article,Scopus

Successful production of crops is a need to ensure whether a particular crop will yield in a specific soil. Ph value, alkalinity, basicity directly affect the growth of the plant. Soil preparation is the most crucial process before plantation. All these factors of the soil can be determined by using the color image processing techniques. All farmers are interested in knowing how much yield can be expected. In the past days, yield prediction was performed by considering farmer’s experience for a particular field. The crop yield prediction is a major issue that is unsolved based on available data with some limitations. If the crop is not yielding correctly, that means it must have some drawbacks. The proposed pH value prediction of 40 soil images is carried out. Using these color models, pH factor of each soil image is calculated. Different classifiers are applied to each color space model, and accuracy and RMSE values are obtained. So, the system primarily focuses on predicting the appropriate pH of a soil so that the crop will be predicted by using the pH values of the soil.

Assimilating remote sensing information into the crop growth model has demonstrative to be the effective approach for crop yield prediction. However, it remains a challenge to determine the crop growth model of input parameters and initial conditions at the spatial regional scale. In the paper, we proposed a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and 4DVAR hierarchical data assimilation scheme, which enables the winter wheat yield forecasting at the 500 m grid size ahead of harvest time in Henan province. This approach applies data assimilation algorithms at two spatial scales. At the county scale, the MCMC algorithm was used to recalibrate the uncertain and sensitive parameters of the WOFOST model using the county-level statistical yield. Then, we assimilated time-series MODIS reflectance into WOFOST-PROSAIL coupled model using the 4DVAR method for each 500 m pixel across the entire Henan province of China. The results show that the simulated yield was strong positive correlated with the statistical yield at county-level scale with R2 = 0.81 and RMSE = 877 kg/hm2, which demonstrated the potential usage of the MCMC-4DVAR based large area yield estimation with remote sensed data and yield statistics. © 2020 IEEE.","data assimilation; MCMC; winter wheat; WOFOST model; Yield forecasting","Agricultural robots; Crops; Forecasting; Geology; Markov chains; Monte Carlo methods; Uncertainty analysis; Data assimilation algorithms; Effective approaches; Four dimensional variational approach; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Remote sensing information; Sensitive parameter; Spatially distribution; Winter wheat yields; Remote sensing",Conference Paper,Scopus

The study was carried out from 2008 to 2017. Aerobiological data were obtained with a Lanzoni VPPS-2000 volumetric sampler, following the Spanish Aerobiological Network protocol. The pollen and flower production was studied on ten vines of the Godello grapevine cultivar. A HOBO Micro Station and a MeteoGalicia station were used to obtain meteorological information. We observed the detrimental effect of rain on airborne pollen presence, and we statistically corroborated the negative effect of high temperatures on fruit set and ripening. We developed an accurate multiple regression model to forecast the grape yield, applying a Spearman’s correlation test to identify the most influential variables.

We jointly model multiple functional predictors that are cross-correlated using multivariate functional principal component analysis (mFPCA), and model the nonparametric effects of the principal component scores as additive components in the PLFAM. To address the high-dimensional nature of functional data, we let the number of mFPCA components diverge to infinity with the sample size, and adopt the component selection and smoothing operator (COSSO) penalty to select relevant components and regularize the fitting. A fundamental difference between our framework and the existing high-dimensional additive models is that the mFPCA scores are estimated with error, and the magnitude of measurement error increases with the order of mFPCA. We establish the asymptotic convergence rate for our estimator, while allowing the number of components diverge. When the number of additive components is fixed, we also establish the asymptotic distribution for the partially linear coefficients.

The results indicated the system is more accurate for wheat relative to the other crops. Also, we found that different strategies would be useful in improving the system, depending on the crop.

Yield anticipating is essential for farmers nowadays, which especially adds to the appropriate selection of yield for sowing. There is no framework set up to recommend farmers what type of crops to develop. It is an essential and challenging task to take right farming decisions at a future steady cost and yield balance.

Generally, Default-ANN has only one hidden layer but in this work, we designed a Personalized Artificial Neural Network (P-ANN) approach by varying number of hidden layers, number of neurons and learning rate. P-ANN model accuracy is computed in terms of R-Square (R2) and Percentage Forecast Error (PFE).

With the increase of population, frequent changes in climatic conditions and limited resources, it becomes a challenging task to fulfil the food requirement of the present population. Precision agriculture also known as smart farming have emerged as an innovative tool to address current challenges in agricultural sustainability. The mechanism that drives this cutting edge technology is machine learning (ML). It gives the machine ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML together with IoT (Internet of Things) enabled farm machinery are key components of the next agriculture revolution. In this article, authors present a systematic review of ML applications in the field of agriculture. The areas that are focused are prediction of soil parameters such as organic carbon and moisture content, crop yield prediction, disease and weed detection in crops and species detection. ML with computer vision are reviewed for the classification of a different set of crop images in order to monitor the crop quality and yield assessment. This approach can be integrated for enhanced livestock production by predicting fertility patterns, diagnosing eating disorders, cattle behaviour based on ML models using data collected by collar sensors, etc. Intelligent irrigation which includes drip irrigation and intelligent harvesting techniques are also reviewed that reduces human labour to a great extent.

By blending markup from human annotators to algorithmic classifiers, the accuracy and reproducability of image segmentation can be raised to very high levels. At least, that is the promise of this approach, but the reality is less than clear. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art in semi-automated image segmentation performance assessment and demonstrate it to be lacking the level of experimental rigour needed to ensure that claims about algorithm accuracy and reproducability can be considered valid. We follow this review with two experiments that vary the type of markup that annotators make on images, either points or strokes, in tightly controlled experimental conditions in order to investigate the effect that this one particular source of variation has on the accuracy of these types of systems. In both experiments, we found that accuracy substantially increases when participants use a stroke-based interaction. In light of these results, the validity of claims about algorithm performance are brought into sharp focus, and we reflect on the need for a far more control on variables for benchmarking the impact of annotators and their context on these types of systems. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

The study based on the drip-irrigated sweet corn yielded the data obtained in the field experiment held in the semi-arid climate on dark-chestnut soil in the South of Ukraine. The suitability of the LAI and NDVI for the simulation of sweet corn yields was estimated by the regression analysis of the yielding data by correlation (R) and determination (R2) coefficients. Additionally, mathematical models for the crop yields estimation based on the regression analysis were developed. It was determined that LAI is a more suitable index for the crop yield prediction: the R2 value was 0.92 and 0.94 against 0.85 for the NDVI-based models. I It was determined that it is better to use the LAI values obtained at the stage of flowering, when R2 averaged to 0.94, and the NDVI-based models does not depend on the crop stage (the R2 was 0.85 both for the flowering and ripening stages of the plant development). The combined NDVI-LAI model showed that there is no necessity in the complication of the LAI-based model through introduction of the remotely sensed index because of insignificant improvement in the performance (R2 was 0.94 and 0.92). © 2020.","Direct measurements; Mathematical model; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Sweet corn; Yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

Several studies have recently been conducted to estimate crop LAI using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral and hyperspectral data. However, there are few studies on estimating the LAI of winter wheat using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) RGB images. In this study, we estimated the LAI of winter wheat at the jointing stage on simple farmland in Xinjiang, China, using parameters derived from UAV RGB images. According to gray correlation analysis, UAV RGB-image parameters such as the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI), the Red Green Blue Vegetation Index (RGBVI), the Digital Number (DN) of Blue Channel (B) and the Green Leaf Algorithm (GLA) were selected to develop models for estimating the LAI of winter wheat. The results showed that it is feasible to use UAV RGB images for inverting and mapping the LAI of winter wheat at the jointing stage on the field scale, and the partial least squares regression (PLSR) model based on the VARI, RGBVI, B and GLA had the best prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.776, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.468, residual prediction deviation (RPD) = 1.838) among all the regression models. To conclude, UAV RGB images not only have great potential in estimating the LAI of winter wheat, but also can provide more reliable and accurate data for precision agriculture management. © 2019 by the authors.","Grey correlation analysis; Jointing stage; Leaf area index; UAV; Vegetation indices","accuracy assessment; correlation; crop yield; estimation method; image analysis; leaf area index; parameter estimation; spectral analysis; unmanned vehicle; vegetation index; wheat; winter; China; Xinjiang Uygur; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Because the reliability of crop yield predictions based on seasonal weather forecasts depends on the quality of the forecasts, it is essential to evaluate forecasts prior to agricultural applications. This study analyses the potential of Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) in predicting the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) for producing meteorological variables relevant to crop modeling. The focus area was Nepal’s Terai region, and the local hindcasts were compared with weather station and reanalysis data. The results showed that the CFSv2 model accurately predicts monthly anomalies of daily maximum and minimum air temperature (Tmax and Tmin) as well as incoming total surface solar radiation (Srad). However, the daily climatologies of the respective CFSv2 hindcasts exhibit significant systematic biases compared to weather station data. The CFSv2 is less capable of predicting monthly precipitation anomalies and simulating the respective intra-seasonal variability over the growing season. Nevertheless, the observed daily climatologies of precipitation fall within the ensemble spread of the respective daily climatologies of CFSv2 hindcasts. These limitations in the CFSv2 seasonal forecasts, primarily in precipitation, restrict the potential application for predicting the interannual variability of crop yield associated with weather variability. Despite these limitations, ensemble averaging of the simulated yield using all CFSv2 members after applying bias correction may lead to satisfactory yield predictions. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","CFSv2; ISM; Nepal; Terai","agricultural management; climate prediction; crop yield; decision making; ensemble forecasting; monsoon; seasonal variation; summer; weather forecasting; Nepal; Tarai",Article,Scopus

A multi-site-year study was conducted across eastern Canada with the objectives to (1) construct machine-learning random forest regression (RFR) models for canola yield prediction; and (2) develop site-specific N recommendations using the RFR modelling approach. Soil characteristics, weather, plant growth and spectral index data collected from 2013 to 2015 were used to train the RFR models and the 2016 data for model validation in terms of making N decisions. Results showed that canola yields responded positively to N application rates in 16 out of the 18 site-year environments, with sometimes higher yields and an average of 8% higher N use efficiency for the split-N strategy than for the same amount of N applied only at preplant. Heat stress and precipitation distribution were identified as of critical importance in total yield variation. The RFR model by combining weather, soil and plant growth features with the spectral indices displayed highly improved prediction reliability, up to 85%, with 53–57% lower root mean square errors, compared with the model based only on leaf chlorophyll or normalized difference vegetation index. Based on the RFR algorithm, an average economic optimum N rate of 150 kg N ha−1 was recommended for most canola production scenarios in the test year. This study demonstrated that the machine learning-based RFR modelling approach can be used to implement optimal nutrient management strategies for sustainable crop production, which is sensitive and better adapted to environment-induced abiotic stresses. © Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada 2021 as represented by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.","Brassica napus; Precision N fertilization; Random forest regression model; Vegetation index; Yield estimation","canola; chlorophyll; crop production; crop yield; detection method; fertilizer application; growth; machine learning; model validation; soil nitrogen; Canada; Brassica napus; Brassica napus var. napus",Article,Scopus

However, the effects of soil on crop-climate responses are often ignored in crop yield prediction. We investigated the effects of soil texture and soil organic carbon concentration (SOC) on the yield responses of seven major crops (corn, winter wheat, soybean, cotton, barley, oats, rice) to growing season precipitation and temperature between 1958 and 2019 across the conterminous US. We also evaluated the effects of irrigation and groundwater depth on crop-climate responses. Crop yields were most sensitive to precipitation and temperature variability in coarse-textured soils and less responsive to these weather parameters in medium- and fine- textured soils. Increasing SOC concentration (> 2%) contributed to crop yields being less sensitive to precipitation – due to increased water retention, and less responsive to temperature – presumably due to increased buffering capacity against increased water lost through evapotranspiration. Irrigation and an intermediate depth to groundwater increase the resilience of crops to precipitation and temperature changes and these effects were also dependent on soil texture and SOC. To enhance food security for a rapidly growing global population under a changing climate, best management practices should be adopted that improve soil structure and carbon stocks that can increase soil available water storage (“Green Water”) and nutrient retention and promote energy conservation. The spatial-temporal variations of soil texture, SOC, and depth to groundwater should be considered in agricultural and ecosystem modeling to more accurately capture crop yield response to climate variations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","4 per 1000; Best management practice (BMPs); Climate change; Soil carbon stock; Soil texture; Sustainable development goals","best management practice; climate change; crop plant; crop yield; evapotranspiration; food security; groundwater; growing season; irrigation system; organic carbon; precipitation (climatology); soil carbon; yield response; United States; Glycine max; Gossypium hirsutum; Hordeum; Matthiola",Article,Scopus

The main factors are obstruction of cloud, identification of phenology, demand for high computing infrastructure and the complexity of statistical methods. In this research, we created a novel approach by combining four methods. First, we implemented the cloud restoration algorithm called gapfill to restore missed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values derived from Sentinel-2 sensor (S2) due to cloud obstruction. Second, we created square tiles as a solution for high computing infrastructure demand due to the use of high-resolution sensor. Third, we implemented gapfill following critical crop phenology stage. Fourth, observations from restored images combined with original (from cloud-free images) values and applied for winter wheat prediction. We applied seven base machine learning as well as two groups of super learning ensembles. The study successfully applied gapfill on high-resolution image to get good quality estimates for cloudy pixels. Consequently, yield prediction accuracy increased due to the incorporation of restored values in the regression process. Base models such as Generalized Linear Regression (GLM) and Random Forest (RF) showed improved capacity compared to other base and ensemble models. The two models revealed RMSE of 0.001 t/ha and 0.136 t/ha on the holdout group. The two models also revealed consistent and better performance using scatter plot analysis across three datasets.

Large-scale forecasts became possible owing to the introduction of remote sensing technologies in the systems of precision agriculture, providing the information on crops conditions both on a certain field and large croplands. The study on the forecasting of major oil crop yields, namely, sunflower (Helianthus annuus L), winter rape (Brassica napus) and soybean (Glycine max), on the regional level in Kherson oblast of Ukraine was conducted using historical yielding data and monthly MODIS Terrain NDVI smoothed time series imagery with 250 m resolution of the period from 2012 to 2019. The statistical data on the crop yields were linked to the corresponding values of monthly NDVI to determine the type of inter-relationship and work out the regression models for the oil crops yield prediction based on the remotely sensed vegetation index. The highest correlation between the yields of the oil crops and NDVI with the best prediction accuracy were obtained by using the index values at the period of April for winter rape, July for sunflower, and August for soybean. The developed regression models have reasonable accuracy with the mean absolute percentage errors of predictions reaching 25.23 percent for sunflower, 18.28 percent for winter rape, and 13.24 percent for soybean.

Yield forecasting gives an alert regarding economic trading, food production monitoring, and global food security. This research was conducted to investigate whether active optical sensors could be utilized for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) yield prediction at the mid.le of the growing season. Three potato cultivars (Russet Burbank, Superior, and Shepody) were planted and six rates of N (0, 56, 112, 168, 224, and 280 kg ha−1), ammonium sulfate, which was replaced by ammonium nitrate in the 2nd year, were applied on 11 sites in a randomized complete block design, with four replications. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and chlorophyll index (CI) measurements were obtained weekly from the active optical sensors, GreenSeeker (GS) and Crop Circle (CC). The 168 kg N ha−1 produced the maximum potato yield. Indices measurements obtained at the 16th and 20th leaf growth stages were significantly correlated with tuber yield. Multiple regression analysis (potato yield as a dependent variable and vegetation indices, NDVI and CI, as independent variables) could make a remarkable improvement to the accuracy of the prediction model and increase the determination coefficient. The exponential and linear models showed a better fit of the data. Soil organic matter content increased the yield significantly but did not affect the prediction models.

The primary design drivers of TRISHNA are the monitoring of (i) terrestrial water stress and use, and of (ii) coastal and continental water. A suit of four TIR bands and six optical bands is planned. The TIR bands will be centred at 8.6μm, 9.1μm, 10.3μm and 11.5μm to provide noon-night global observations at 57m nadir resolution over land and coastal regions. The field of view (FOV) is r34q and the orbit of 761 km altitude was designed to allow 3 sub-cycle acquisitions during the 8- day cycle. The optical bands correspond to blue, green, red, and NIR plus two SWIR bands at 1.38μm and 1.61μm. The green, red, NIR and the 1.61μm SWIR bands will have better radiometry quality than those of AWiFS. ISRO and CNES will develop optical and TIR payloads, respectively. Assessing evapotranspiration and furthermore Gross and Net Primary Productivity (GPP and NPP) will in turn assist in quantifying water use in rainfed and irrigated agriculture, water stress and water use efficiency, with expected applications to agricultural drought and early warning, crop yield prediction, water allocation, implementation of water rights, crop insurance business and agro-advisories to farmers. The other scientific objectives of TRISHNA are also briefly described. TRISHNA instrument will fly aboard a ISRO spacecraft scheduled to be launched from 2024 for a minimum period of 5 years' mission lifetime. © Authors 2019.

Although various statistical models and machine learning models have been developed to enhance prediction accuracy, spatial and temporal non-stationarity, an intrinsic attribute of many geographical processes, is still rarely considered in crop yield modeling. From a statistical point of view, this study respectively provided evidence for the existence of spatial non-stationarity and temporal non-stationarity in winter wheat yield prediction based on geographically weighted regression (GWR) and temporally weighted regression (TWR). Then, a geographically and temporally weighted neural network (GTWNN) model was proposed by integrating artificial neural network (ANN) into geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) using publicly available data sources, including satellite imagery and climate data. For a more credible evaluation, the leave-one-year-out strategy was adopted to make out-of-sample prediction resulting in a total of 12 test years from 2008 to 2019. The experiment results showed that the proposed GTWNN outperformed ANN, GTWR and support vector regression (SVR) achieving the average coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.766, 0.759 and 0.720 at the three prediction times of end of July, end of June and end of May. Moreover, an extended Moran's I was adopted to assess the degree of spatiotemporal autocorrelation of the prediction errors. The error aggregation of GTWNN was lower than other models, indicating that GTWNN is applicable to addressing spatial non-stationarity in modeling the relationship between predictors and yield response. The methodology proposed in this paper can be extended to handle spatiotemporal non-stationarity in other crop yield predictions and even other environmental phenomena. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Geographically and temporally weighted neural network; Remote sensing; Spatiotemporal non-stationarity; Winter wheat; Yield prediction","Climate models; Food supply; Forecasting; Learning systems; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Risk management; Satellite imagery; Crop yield; Geographically and temporally weighted neural network; Neural-networks; Non-stationarities; Remote-sensing; Spatiotemporal non-stationarity; Weighted regression; Winter wheat; Winter wheat yields; Yield prediction; Crops; agricultural market; artificial neural network; crop yield; experimental study; food security; machine learning; prediction; wheat; winter",Article,Scopus

Rice is one of the major crops of this state, and it contributes a significant proportion to the rice production of India. The present study deals with the prediction of Kharif rice over Gangetic West Bengal using forecast products from IITM-IMD extended range prediction (ERP) system. It is a multi-model ensemble prediction system that comprises 16 different ensemble members obtained from the Climate Forecast System (CFSv2) and the stand-alone atmospheric component of CFSv2 (i.e., GFSv2). The performance of ERP rainfall forecast has been assessed over a relatively larger domain covering Indian landmass before its utilization in crop yield prediction. Satisfactory skills, e.g., higher correlation and lower normalized root mean squared error (nRMSE), have been found in ERP rainfall forecast during the first 3 weeks for most of the initial conditions (ICs). Next, bias-corrected ERP weekly forecast data of incoming solar radiation, rainfall, and maximum and minimum temperatures have been incorporated into a process-based crop model (CERES-rice) available in the Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT). ERP-driven crop model has performed better to reproduce inter-annual variability of observed rice yield compared to yield simulated using crop model driven by climatology alone. Also, the ERP-driven model has been able to capture the below- and above-normal yield categories relatively better than the climatology-driven model. Hence, the incorporation of ERP in crop models may provide value-added prediction, which will be helpful for the stakeholders and decision-makers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"climate prediction; correlation; crop production; crop yield; decision support system; paddy field; rainfall; India; West Bengal",Article,Scopus

The goal of this study is to explore spatial and temporal variability of a summer crop (maize)and a winter crop (wheat)yields and its linkages with influential climate oscillations in the United States. The county level yield data over 1960–2016 for maize and winter wheat were aggregated into each of the 260 climate divisions in the rainfed regions of the United States, with the linear yield trend being removed. The rotated Principal Component Analysis (PCA)reveals that the first five principal components explain 79% (maize)and 72% (winter wheat)of the spatial and temporal variability of crop anomalies. The first principal component of crop yield variability is strongly associated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). The results of multiple linear regressions for predicting yield anomalies using climate indices show that, climate indices during the reproductive period of maize explained final yield better than the vegetation period (30% versus 26%), while climate indices for winter wheat during the dormant and reproductive growth periods are similar and not significant (25% versus 28%). Categorical yield forecasts using random forecast techniques show that the low (below 30th percentile)and high (above 70th percentile)yields are well predicted by climate indices. Spatially, AMO is identified as the most important predictor for maize in 46% climate divisions and for wheat in 33% climate divisions. The results from this study may contribute to understanding the risks of large-scale climate oscillations to local-scale crop production and improving crop yield predictions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation; Climate index; Climate oscillation; Crop yields; Principal component analysis; Random Forest","algorithm; Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation; climate change; climate oscillation; crop yield; index method; maize; prediction; principal component analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; wheat; United States; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

We quantified the response of maize yield to projected climate changes in three main maize growing areas of South Africa (Bloemfontein, Lichtenburg and Nelspruit) using two crop modelling solutions: existing (EMS) and modified (MMS) CropSyst. The MMS considers explicitly the impact of extreme heat and drought. Both solutions were run with climate data generated from two radiative forcing scenarios using six general circulation models and three time horizons representing baseline (1990–2020), near future (2021–2050) and far future (2051–2080) time periods. Reduced yields were projected with both modelling solutions especially under far future time period. Simulated maize yield using EMS with high radiative forcing for far future decreased (compared with the simulated baseline for EMS) by 30%, 25.9% and 18.3% at Bloemfontein, Lichtenburg and Nelspruit, respectively. Simulated grain yield with MMS showed reductions of 27.6%, 24.3% and 18.7%, respectively (compared with the simulated baseline for MMS). Grain yield differences between the EMS and MMS ranged between 9 and 21%. This difference showed an increasing trend as time progressed from the baseline to the far future and varied across locations. Accounting explicitly for the impact of extreme weather events (MMS) resulted in lower simulated yields compared with the model without (EMS). Findings from this study warrant the need for location-specific model simulation using MMS-type models to improve crop yield predictions under climate change for better food security planning and policy formulation. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change scenario; Food security; Maize production; Modified CropSyst; Radiative forcing",,Article,Scopus

Developing more sustainable production systems requires long-term measurements and assessment of climate change impacts on yields, especially over such a vulnerable region. Providing accurate yield predictions plays a key role in addressing a critical sustainability gap. The goal of this study is the development of effective crop yield predictions to allow for a better-informed cropland management and future production potential, and to develop climate-smart adaptation strategies for increased food security. The objectives were to (1) identify the most important climate variables that significantly influence and can be used to effectively predict yield, (2) evaluate the advantage of using remotely sensed data alone and in combination with climate variables for yield prediction, and (3) determine the significance of using short compared to long historical data records for yield prediction. This study focused on yield prediction for corn, sorghum, alfalfa, and wheat using climate and remotely sensed data for the 1920–2019 period. The results indicated that the use of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) alone is less accurate in predicting crop yields. The combination of climate and NDVI variables provided better predictions compared to the use of NDVI only to predict wheat, sorghum, and corn yields. However, the use of a climate only model performed better in predicting alfalfa yield. Yield predictions can be more accurate with the use of shorter data periods that are based on region-specific trends. The identification of the most important climate variables and accurate yield prediction pertaining to New Mexico’s agricultural systems can aid the state in developing climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies to enhance the sustainability of these systems. © 2021 by the authorsLicensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Alfalfa; Averaging periods; Corn; NDVI; Sorghum; Statistical analysis; Sustainable agriculture systems; Wheat",,Article,Scopus

The yield of a crop may vary from year to year depending on the variations in climate, soil parameters and fertilizers used. Automation in the agricultural industry moderates the usage of resources and can increase the quality of food in the post-pandemic world. Agricultural robots have been developed for crop seeding, monitoring, weed control, pest management and harvesting. Physical counting of fruitlets, flowers or fruits at various phases of growth is labour intensive as well as an expensive procedure for crop yield estimation. Remote sensing technologies offer accuracy and reliability in crop yield prediction and estimation. The automation in image analysis with computer vision and deep learning models provides precise field and yield maps. In this review, it has been observed that the application of deep learning techniques has provided a better accuracy for smart farming. The crops taken for the study are fruits such as grapes, apples, citrus, tomatoes and vegetables such as sugarcane, corn, soybean, cucumber, maize, wheat. The research works which are carried out in this research paper are available as products for applications such as robot harvesting, weed detection and pest infestation. The methods which made use of conventional deep learning techniques have provided an average accuracy of 92.51%. This paper elucidates the diverse automation approaches for crop yield detection techniques with virtual analysis and classifier approaches. Technical hitches in the deep learning techniques have progressed with limitations and future investigations are also surveyed.

In this study, a phenological approach based on a remote sensing vegetation index was explored to predict the yield in 314 counties within the US Corn Belt, divided into semi-arid and non-semi-arid regions. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data product MOD09Q1 was used to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. According to the NDVI time series, we divided the corn growing season into four growth phases, calculated phe-nological information metrics (duration and rate) for each growth phase, and obtained the maximum correlation NDVI (Max-R2). Duration and rate represent crop growth days and rate, respec-tively. Max-R2 is the NDVI value with the most significant correlation with corn yield in the NDVI time series. We built three groups of yield regression models, including univariate models using phenological metrics and Max-R2, and multivariate models using phenological metrics, and multivariate models using phenological metrics combined with Max-R2 in the whole, semi-arid, and non-semi-arid regions, respectively, and compared the performance of these models. The results show that most phenological metrics had a statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) relationship with corn yield (maximum R2 = 0.44). Models established with phenological metrics realized yield prediction before harvest in the three regions with R2 = 0.64, 0.67, and 0.72. Compared with the univariate Max-R2 models, the accuracy of models built with Max-R2 and phenology metrics improved. Thus, the phe-nology metrics obtained from MODIS-NDVI accurately reflect the corn characteristics and can be used for large-scale yield prediction. Overall, this study showed that phenology metrics derived from remote sensing vegetation indexes could be used as crop yield prediction variables and pro-vide a reference for data organization and yield prediction with physical crop significance. © 2021 by the authors.

Yet, modeling crop yield is challenging because of the complexity of the relationships between crop growth and predictor variables, especially at the field scale. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) method was used: (1) to evaluate the relative importance of predictor variables for the prediction of within-field corn and soybean end-of-season yield and (2) to evaluate the performance of the ANN models with a minimal optimized variable dataset for their capacity to predict corn and soybean yield over multiple years at the within-field level. Several satellite derived vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index-NDVI, red edge NDVI and simple ratio-SR) and elevation derived variables (slope, flow accumulation, aspect) were used as crop yield predictor variables, hypothesizing that the different variables reflect different crop and site conditions. The study identified the SR index and the slope as the most important predictor variables for both crop types during two training and testing years (2011, 2012). The dates of the most important SR images, however, were different for the two crop types and corresponded to their critical crop developmental stages (phenology). The relative mean absolute errors were overall smaller for corn compared to soybean: all of the 2011 corn study fields had errors below 10%; 75% of the fields had errors below 10% in 2012. The errors were more variable for soybean. In 2011, 37% of the fields had errors below 10%, while in 2012, 100% of the fields had errors below 20%.

Improving crop management could be an effective solution for this challenge.However, due to the associated cost and time to perform field works, researchers are widely rely on agricultural systems modeling to examine the impacts of different crop management scenarios. Meanwhile, due to the complexity of agricultural systems modeling, their applications in producing practical knowledge for producers are limited. Meanwhile, deep learning techniques have been recognized as the preferred method compared to other machine learning techniques, especially when dealing with large datasets. In addition, deep learning techniques are easily adopted by non-experts due to the feature of learning ability that can automatically discover the classifications from raw data.Meanwhile, one of the drawbacks of using deep learning techniques is the training time, which can last anywhere from a couple of weeks to even a few months. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine the applicability of deep learning techniques to compute a numerical model of crop growth. In this study, an agricultural systems model known as the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) is used to evaluate the impacts of irrigation amount and time of application on crop yield. A deep learning network is utilized and trained by incorporating the large amounts of DSSAT models inputs (i.e., precipitation date, precipitation amount, irrigation date irrigation amount) and output (i.e., maize yield at the end of the growing season). However, in order to simplify the process, we combined the amount of irrigation and rainfall together and presented them in the form of the amount of water per day.

The assumption of this comparison is that the different years' crops were at the same growing stage on the same day. However, this assumption is often violated in reality. This paper proposes to combine remotely sensed data and meteorological data to assess corn growth conditions at the same growth stages at county level. The proposed approach uses the active accumulated temperature (AAT) computed from Daymet, a daily weather data product, to align different years of NDVI time series at the same growth stages estimated from AATs. The study area covers Carroll County, Iowa. The best index slope extraction (BISE) method and Savitzky-Golay filter are used to filter noise and to reconstruct 11 years of corn growing season NDVI time series from 250 m MODIS daily surface reflectance data product (MOD09GQ). The corn growth stages are identified every year with precise Julian dates from AAT time series. The corn growth conditions are assessed based on the aligned growth stages. The validation of the assessed crop conditions is performed based on National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) reports. The study indicates that the crop condition assessment results based on aligned growth stages are consistent with the NASS reported results and they are more reliable than the results based on the same calendar days. The proposed method provides not only crop growth condition information but also crop phenology information. Potentially, it can help improve crop yield prediction since it can effectively measure crop growth changes with NDVI and AAT data. © 2019 by the authors.","Active accumulated temperature (AAT); Crop condition comparison; Crop growth monitoring; Crop phenology; Daymet; Growing degree unit (GDU); MODIS NDVI","Biology; Condition monitoring; Meteorology; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Time series; Accumulated temperatures; Crop condition; Crop growth; Crop phenology; Daymet; Modis ndvi; Crops",Article,Scopus

Subsurface water retention technology (SWRT) is a stable approach that preserves water in sandy soils using water saving membranes. An optimal use of SWRT depends on its shape, location and other factors. In order to predict crop yield for different irrigation schedule, we require at least two computational processes: (i) a crop growth modeling process and (ii) a water and nutrient permeation process through soil to the root system. Validation of software parameters to suit properties of specific field becomes increasingly hard since they involve a coordination with field data and coordination between two software. In this paper, we propose a computationally fast approach that utilizes HYDRUS-2D software for water and nutrient flow simulation and DSSAT crop simulation software with an evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) procedure in a coordinated manner to minimize water utilization and maximize crop yield prediction. Our proposed method consists of training one-dimensional crop model (DSSAT) on data generated by two dimensional model calibrates and validates (HYDRUS-2D), that accounts for water accumulation in the SWRT membranes. Then we used DSSAT model to find the best irrigation schedules for maximizing crop yield with the highest plant water use efficiency (Tambussi et al., 2007; Blum, 2009) using for the EMO methodology. The optimization procedure minimizes water usage with the help of rainfall water and increases corn yield prediction as much as six times compare to a non-optimized and random irrigation schedule without any SWRT membrane. Our framework also demonstrates an integration of latest computing software and hardware technologies synergistically to facilitate better crop production with minimal water requirement. © 2019","crop yield; DSSAT; HYDRUS-2D; Irrigation rate; Multi-objective optimization","Computer software; Cultivation; Forecasting; Irrigation; Multiobjective optimization; Nutrients; One dimensional; Plants (botany); Water conservation; Crop yield; Crop yield simulations; DSSAT; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; HYDRUS-2D; Irrigation rates; Optimization procedures; Sustainable agriculture; Crops; crop production; crop yield; flow modeling; growth modeling; irrigation system; maize; optimization; precision agriculture; software; technological development; water retention; water use efficiency; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

For crop yield predictions, the skill in generating realistic distributions of weather for the crop growing season matters more than the skill of forecasting the mean seasonal climate itself. In this regard, the ensemble of daily fields of the Seasonal Prediction Systems (SPSs) output could be a potential alternative to other methods that are available to generate daily weather from the monthly or seasonal mean forecasts. However, the SPSs are not expected to forecast individual weather events at a given grid point (deterministic forecast), but if the statistics of the predicted weather are correct, an ensemble of yield predictions using individual realizations of the ensemble seasonal forecast may produce a more skillful yield forecast. So far, the potential of this new approach has not been tested. The goal of this study was to determine the potential applicability of using daily data from SPSs to predict rice yield through a case study of Nepal's Terai. The study used 28 years (1983–2010) daily hindcasts of the coupled forecast system model version 2 (CFSv2) SPS into a Cropping System Model (CSM)-CERES-Rice. The hindcasts of the CFSv2, initialized at different lead times, were used in various ways to simulate rice yield, which were then compared to the reference yield and to the simulated yield using climatology alone to examine the predictive skill at different lead times. The results from this study indicate that unlike the typical ensemble averaging approach commonly used in seasonal climate forecasting, averaging the simulated yield using individual member does not guarantee better yield prediction. Further analyses should be made, including alternative downscaling methods as well as a similar analysis for an area where quality meteorological and agricultural data are available and where the seasonal forecasts exhibit better skill. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","CFSv2; Climate variability; Daily data; DSSAT","agricultural modeling; climate change; climatology; crop yield; data assimilation; downscaling; ensemble forecasting; forecasting method; growing season; prediction; rice; seasonal variation; Tarai",Article,Scopus

However, weather conditions and relatively long revisit cycles often result in an insufficient number of continuous medium-high resolution images over large areas for many years. In addition, the cropland pattern changes frequently in the fallow rotation area. A novel rapid mapping model for winter wheat based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series coefficient of variation (NDVI_COVfp) and peak-slope difference index (PSDI) is proposed in this study. NDVI_COVfp uses the time-series index volatility to distinguish cultivated land from background land-cover types. PSDI combines the key growth stages of winter wheat phenology and special bimodal characteristics, substantially reducing the impact of abandoned land and other crops. Taking the Heilonggang as an example, this study carried out a rapid mapping of winter wheat for four consecutive years (2014–2017), and compared the proposed COV_PSDI with two state-of-the-art methods and traditional methods (the Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM) and the Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm (ISODATA)). The verification results revealed that the COV_PSDI model improved the overall accuracy (94.10%) by 4% compared with the two state-of-art methods (90.80%, 89.00%) and two traditional methods (90.70%, 87.70%). User accuracy was the highest, which was 93.74%. Compared with the other four methods, the percentage error (PE) of COV_PSDI for four years was the lowest in the same year, with the minimum variation range of PE being 1.6–3.6%. The other methods resulted in serious overestimation. This demonstrated the effectiveness and stability of the method proposed in the rapid and accurate extraction of winter wheat in a large area of fallow crop rotation region.

Compared to most wheat producing areas, this island is characterized by wet climate owing to greater annual precipitation and abundant snowmelt water supply in spring. Based on yield statistics collected from 119 municipalities for 14 years (N = 1,516) and high-resolution surface meteorological data, correlation analyses showed that precipitation, daily minimum air temperature, and irradiance during the grain-filling period had significant effects on the yield throughout the island while the effect of snow depth in early winter and spring was dependent on sites. Using 10-d mean meteorological data within a certain period between seeding and harvest as predictor variables and one-year-leave-out cross-validation procedure, performance of machine learning models based on neural network (NN), random forest (RF), support vector machine regression (SVR), partial least squares regression (PLS), and cubist regression (CB) were compared to a multiple linear regression model (MLR) and a null model that returns an average yield of the municipality. The root mean square errors of PLS, SVR, and RF were 872, 982, and 1,024 kg ha−1 and were smaller than those of MLR (1,068 kg ha−1) and null model (1,035 kg ha−1). These models outperformed the controls in other metrics including Pearson's correlation coefficient and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. Variable importance analysis on PLS indicated that minimum air temperature and precipitation during the grain-filling period had major roles in the prediction and excluding predictors in this period (i.e. yield forecast with a longer lead-time) decreased forecast performance of the models. These results were consistent with our understanding of meteorological impacts on wheat yield, suggesting usefulness of explainable machine learning in meteorological crop yield prediction under wet climate.

A typical machine learning algorithm often uses real data to predict crop yield. In this study, we used data generated by the Wild Blueberry Pollination Model, a spatially explicit simulation model validated by field observation and experimental data collected in Maine USA during the last 30 years. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the relative importance of bee species composition and weather factors in regulating wild blueberry agroecosystems. Specifically, we sought to reveal how bee species composition and weather affect yield and to predict optimal bee species composition and weather conditions that achieve the best yield using computer simulation and machine learning algorithms. Multiple linear regression (MLR), boosted decision trees (BDT), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were evaluated as predictive tools. We also performed a predictor selection before submitting our data to the learning algorithms. In this way, we are able to reduce the dimension of the input without a significant drop in prediction accuracy. As a result, clone size, honeybee, bumblebee, Andrena bee species, Osmia bee species, maximum of upper-temperature ranges, and the number of days with precipitation were chosen as the best predictor variable subset. The results showed that the XGBoost outperformed other algorithms in all measures of model performance for predicting the yield of wild blueberry by achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.938, root mean square error (RMSE) of 343.026, mean absolute error (MAE) of 206 and relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of 5.444%. The results are consistent with previous work on predicting wild blueberry fruit yield using digital color photography by (Zaman et al., 2008). This study showed that crop yield predictions can be based on computer simulation modeling datasets. Therefore, if a reasonable prediction can be reached, this study should have a significant impact, especially when data collection in the field is challenging. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Boosted decision tree; Meta-model; Random forest; Wild blueberry; XGBoost; Yield prediction","Agricultural robots; Color photography; Crops; Decision trees; Errors; Forecasting; Linear regression; Machine learning; Mean square error; Predictive analytics; Agricultural sector; Boosted decision trees; Multiple linear regressions; Predictor selections; Predictor variables; Root mean square errors; Spatially-explicit simulations; Wild blueberry fruits; Learning algorithms; algorithm; bee; color; computer simulation; crop yield; fruit production; machine learning; Maine; United States; Apis mellifera; Apoidea; Osmia; Vaccinium",Article,Scopus

The objectives of this study were to develop minimum dataset (MDS) variable selection methods that reflects the total dataset (TDS) of soil properties for SQ assessment and crop yield prediction in Yucheng County, a major grain-producing region in the North China Plain. Critical values of soil properties for standardized scoring functions were established based on local crop yields in field condition and the key restricting indicators limiting crop productivity were evaluated. In this study, 99 topsoil (0–20 cm) samples were collected and 14 soil properties including pH, electrical conductivity, clay content, soil organic matter, cation exchangeable capacity, total nitrogen, phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), available P, K, Cu, Mn, Mo and Zn were analyzed. Three MDSs were created by different variable selection methods using principal component analysis (PCA) of soil properties. Among these MDSs, the indicator of norm values derived from the total principal component loadings was considered to be the most suitable method for evaluating SQ. The MDS-based soil quality index (SQI) had higher correlations with the TDS-based SQI and crop yield. The critical values of soil properties were identified by regressing soil variables with local yields of maize and wheat in the field condition. The SQIs calculated using measured critical values were more accurate than that based on published empirical values. The evaluation results revealed that the calculated SQI accounted for 28% of the variation in crop yields, and there probably are some strong limitations for crop yield through soil characteristics (soil texture, salinization, and nutrient supply, etc.). Thus, management practices and amelioration of the above soil-limiting factors should be comprehensively considered in agricultural production. The finding can enable policy making and policy implementation in relation to SQ in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Crop yield; Minimum data set; Restricting indicators; Soil quality index; Standardized scoring function","Agricultural robots; Crops; Cultivation; Grain (agricultural product); Principal component analysis; Productivity; Soil quality; Textures; Agricultural productions; Electrical conductivity; Management practices; Policy implementations; Principal Components; Soil characteristics; Soil organic matters; Variable selection methods; Quality control; agricultural land; cation exchange capacity; clay mineral; crop yield; electrical conductivity; integrated approach; maize; principal component analysis; soil chemistry; soil organic matter; soil quality; wheat; China; North China Plain; Shandong; Yucheng; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Timely and reliable wheat yield prediction at a large scale is essential for the agricultural supply chain and global food security, especially in China as an important wheat producing and consuming country. The conventional approach using either climate or satellite data or both to build empirical and crop models has prevailed for decades. However, to what extent climate and satellite data can improve yield prediction is still unknown. In addition, socio-economic (SC) factors may also improve crop yield prediction, but their contributions need in-depth investigation, especially in regions with good irrigation conditions, sufficient fertilization, and pesticide application. Here, we performed the first attempt to predict wheat yield across China from 2001 to 2015 at the county-level by integrating multi-source data, including monthly climate data, satellite data (i.e., Vegetation indices (VIs), and SC factors. The results show that incorporating all the datasets by using three machine learning methods (Ridge Regression (RR), Random Forest (RF), and Light Gradient Boosting (LightGBM) can achieve the best performance in yield prediction (R2: 0.68~0.75), with the most individual contributions from climate (~0.53), followed by VIs (~0.45), and SC factors (~0.30). In addition, the combinations of VIs and climate data can capture inter-annual yield variability more effectively than other combinations (e.g., combinations of climate and SC, and combinations of VIs and SC), while combining SC with climate data can better capture spatial yield variability than others. Climate data can provide extra and unique information across the entire growing season, while the peak stage of VIs (Mar.~Apr.) do so. Furthermore, incorporating spatial information and soil proprieties into the benchmark models can improve wheat yield prediction by 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. The optimal wheat prediction can be achieved with approximately a two-month leading time before maturity. Our study develops timely and robust methods for winter wheat yield prediction at a large scale in China, which can be applied to other crops and regions. © 2020 by the authors.

Early estimation of yield at field or plot scale also contributes to high-throughput plant phenotyping and precision agriculture. New developments in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms and sensor technology facilitate cost-effective data collection through simultaneous multi-sensor/multimodal data collection at very high spatial and spectral resolutions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the power of UAV-based multimodal data fusion using RGB, multispectral and thermal sensors to estimate soybean (Glycine max) grain yield within the framework of Deep Neural Network (DNN). RGB, multispectral, and thermal images were collected using a low-cost multi-sensory UAV from a test site in Columbia, Missouri, USA. Multimodal information, such as canopy spectral, structure, thermal and texture features, was extracted and combined to predict crop grain yield using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), input-level feature fusion based DNN (DNN-F1) and intermediate-level feature fusion based DNN (DNN-F2). The results can be summarized in three messages: (1) multimodal data fusion improves the yield prediction accuracy and is more adaptable to spatial variations; (2) DNN-based models improve yield prediction model accuracy: the highest accuracy was obtained by DNN-F2 with an R2 of 0.720 and a relative root mean square error (RMSE%) of 15.9%; (3) DNN-based models were less prone to saturation effects, and exhibited more adaptive performance in predicting grain yields across the Dwight, Pana and AG3432 soybean genotypes in our study. Furthermore, DNN-based models demonstrated consistent performance over space with less spatial dependency and variations.

However, inappropriate land selection decisions limit cassava yields and increase production-related costs to farmers. As a root crop, yield prediction using vegetation indices and biophysical properties is essential to maximize the yield of cassava before harvesting. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to develop a yield prediction model based on suitable areas that assess with land suitability analysis (LSA). For LSA, the priority indicators were identified using a fuzzy expert system combined with a multicriteria decision method including ecological categories. Furthermore, the yield prediction method was developed using satellite remote sensing datasets. In this analysis, Sentinel-2 datasets were collected and analyzed in SNAP® and ArcGIS® environments. The multisource database of ecological criteria for cassava production was built using the fuzzy membership function. The results showed that 42.17% of the land area was highly suitable for cassava production. Then, in the highly suitable area, the yield prediction model was developed using the vegetation indices based on Sentinel-2 datasets with 10 m resolution for the accuracy assessment. The vegetation indices were used to predict cassava growth, biophysical condition, and phenology over the growing seasons. The NDVI, SAVI, IRECI, LAI, and fAPAR were used to develop the model for predicting cassava growth. The generated models were validated using regression analysis between observed and predicted yield. As the vegetation indices, NDVI showed higher accuracy in the yield prediction model (R2 = 0.62) compared to SAVI and IRECI. Meanwhile, LAI had a higher prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.70) than other biophysical properties, fAPAR. The combined model using NDVI, SAVI, IRECI, LAI, and fAPAR reported the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.77). The ground truth data were used for the evaluation of satellite remote sensing data in the comparison between the observed and predicted yields.

The spectral information such as vegetation indices (VIs) calculated from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based images have shown the potential for crop yield prediction, but the reliability and the accuracy haven't been satisfied yet. This study was aimed to explore the potential of fusion of UAV images-based spectral and structural information extracted from the entire growth period of rice crop to improve the grain yield prediction. Field experiments with different nitrogen (N) applications were conducted in 2017 and 2018, and ground measurements including leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), aboveground biomass (AGB) and grain yield were performed. A UAV platform carrying RGB and multispectral cameras was employed to collect high spatial-temporal resolution images of rice crops. The VIs, canopy height and canopy coverage were then extracted from RGB and multispectral images, which was used to develop random forest (RF) prediction models for grain yield. The results showed that combining normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference yellowness index (NDYI), canopy height and canopy coverage achieved the best prediction of grain yield with the determination coefficient (r2) of 0.85, prediction of root mean square error (RMSEP) of 0.39 t/ha, and relative RMSE (rRMSE) of 3.56% in 2017, and r2 of 0.83, RMSEP of 0.33 t/ha, and rRMSE of 2.75% in 2018, respectively, which outperformed the results in the reported studies. Furthermore, the initial heading stage was proved to be the optimal stage to evaluate the grain yield, and a model transfer strategy at the initial heading stage in 2017 was successfully implemented to predict the grain yield in 2018 with the rRMSE of 6.71%. These findings demonstrated that fusion of canopy spectral and structure information obtained from UAV-based RGB and multispectral images can improve the prediction accuracy of grain yield as well as achieve a dynamic monitoring of crop growth status.

Here we examined both bacterial and fungal communities across soils, epiphytic and endophytic niches of leaf and root, and plastic leaf of fake plant (representing environment-originating microbes) at three developmental stages of maize at two contrasting sites, and further explored the potential function of phylloplane microbiomes based on metagenomics. Results: Our results suggested that plant developmental stage had a much stronger influence on the microbial diversity, composition and interkingdom networks in plant compartments than in soils, with the strongest effect in the phylloplane. Phylloplane microbiomes were co-shaped by both plant growth and seasonal environmental factors, with the air (represented by fake plants) as its important source. Further, we found that bacterial communities in plant compartments were more strongly driven by deterministic processes at the early stage but a similar pattern was for fungal communities at the late stage. Moreover, bacterial taxa played a more important role in microbial interkingdom network and crop yield prediction at the early stage, while fungal taxa did so at the late stage. Metagenomic analyses further indicated that phylloplane microbiomes possessed higher functional diversity at the early stage than the late stage, with functional genes related to nutrient provision enriched at the early stage and N assimilation and C degradation enriched at the late stage. Coincidently, more abundant beneficial bacterial taxa like Actinobacteria, Burkholderiaceae and Rhizobiaceae in plant microbiomes were observed at the early stage, but more saprophytic fungi at the late stage. Conclusions: Our results suggest that host developmental stage profoundly influences plant microbiome assembly and functions, and the bacterial and fungal microbiomes take a differentiated ecological role at different stages of plant development. This study provides empirical evidence for host exerting strong effect on plant microbiomes by deterministic selection during plant growth and development. These findings have implications for the development of future tools to manipulate microbiome for sustainable increase in primary productivity.

In this study, five vegetation indices were derived from the Copernicus-Sentinel 2 satellite to investigate their performance monitoring winter wheat growth in a Mediterranean environment in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley. Among those indices, the fraction of canopy cover was integrated into the AquaCrop model to simulate biomass and yield of wheat grown under rainfed conditions and fully irrigated regimes. The experiment was conducted during three consecutive growing seasons (from 2017 to 2019), characterized by different precipitation patterns. The AquaCrop model was calibrated and validated for different water regimes, and its performance was tested when coupled with remote sensing canopy cover. The results showed a good fit between measured canopy cover and Leaf Area Index (LAI) data and those derived from Sentinel 2 images. The R2 coefficient was 0.79 for canopy cover and 0.77 for LAI. Moreover, the regressions were fitted to relate biomass with Sentinel 2 vegetation indices. In descend-ing order of R2, the indices were ranked: Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC), LAI, the fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Notably, FVC and LAI were highly correlated with biomass. The results of the AquaCrop calibration showed that the modeling efficiency values, NSE, were 0.99 for well-watered treatments and 0.95 for rainfed conditions, confirming the goodness of fit between measured and simulated values. The validation results confirmed that the simulated yield varied from 2.59 to 5.36 t ha−1, while the measured yield varied from 3.08 to 5.63 t ha−1 for full irrigation and rainfed treatments. After integrating the canopy cover into AquaCrop, the % of deviation of simulated and measured variables was reduced. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for yield ranged between 0.08 and 0.69 t ha−1 before coupling and between 0.04 and 0.42 t ha−1 after integration. This result confirmed that the presented integration framework represents a promising method to improve the prediction of wheat crop growth in Mediterranean areas. Further studies are needed before being applied on a larger scale. © 2021 by the authors.

Cotton cultivation in this region is facing severe challenges due to an increase in the frequency of droughts, monsoon variability and dry spells during critical growth stages of crop. Use of seasonal forecast products extended range forecast system (ERFS) in crop models is investigated for improving the seed cotton yield prediction skill for the ensuing monsoon season at Parbhani in Maharashtra. A stochastic disaggregation is used to downscale seasonal and monthly forecast products in daily weather sequences. These weather series are taken as input in the Decision Support System for Agro technology Transfer (DSSAT) Cropping System Model (CSM) CROPGRO-Cotton model for the crop yield prediction at different stages of forecast: June-September (4 month forecast), July-September (3 month forecast), August-September (2 month forecast) and monthly forecast for September (1 month forecast) and correlation between observed versus disaggregated monthly frequency and intensity of rainfall for June, July, August and September as a function of the number of stochastic realizations (1000) from 1980 to 2017 was undertaken. To avoid a technological trend in historical yield data, yields simulated with observed weather data have been used as the benchmark (observed seed cotton yield) to evaluate the yields simulated using ERFS forecasts. Identification of drought years after the validation of predicted yield with observed yield and special interventions was made at critical growth stages to enhance the yield of cotton. The findings recommend the efficiency of forecast products to capture year-to-year variability in observed seed cotton yield at parbhani. The correlation value corresponding to the rainfall intensity showed a continuous increase with the number of realizations and reached an almost constant value at around 200 realizations. Rainfall intensity was best reproduced during the month of July (correlation co-efficient = 0.89). The maximum correlation attained for the months of June, August and September were ∼0.84, 0.81 and 0.57, respectively. The outcomes are useful for taking decisions well in advance for sowing of cotton as well as for other input management, interventions and farm activities during different stages of the crop growing season. © 2021, India Meteorological Department.

High-resolution radar data can be combined with optical remote-sensing data to provide a new approach to estimate high-resolution soil moisture over vegetated areas. In this paper, the Sentinel-1A data and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are combined to retrieve soil moisture over agricultural fields. The advanced integral equation model (AIEM) is utilized to calculate the scattering contribution of the bare soil surface. The water cloud model (WCM) is applied to model the backscattering coecient of vegetated areas, which use two vegetation parameters to parameterize the scattering and attenuation properties of vegetation. Four dierent vegetation parameters extracted from MODIS products are combined to predict the scattering contribution of vegetation, including the leaf area index (LAI), the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), normalized dierence vegetation index (NDVI), and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI). The eective roughness parameters are chosen to parameterize the AIEM. The Sentinel-1A and MODIS data in 2017 are used to calibrate the coupled model, and the datasets in 2018 are used for soil moisture estimation. The calibration results indicate that the Sentinel-1A backscattering coecient can be accurately predicted by the coupled model with the Pearson correlation coecient (R) ranging from 0.58 to 0.81 and a root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.996 to 1.401 dB. The modeled results show that the retrieved soil moisture can capture the seasonal dynamics of soil moisture with R ranging from 0.74 to 0.81. With the dierent vegetation parameter combinations used for parameterizing the scattering contribution of the canopy, the importance of suitable vegetation parameters for describing the scattering and attenuation properties of vegetation is confirmed. The LAI is recommended to characterize the scattering properties. There is no obvious clue for selecting vegetation descriptors to characterize the attenuation properties of vegetation. These promising results confirm the feasibility and validity of the coupled model for soil moisture retrieval from the Sentinel-1A and MODIS data. © 2020, The authors.","Agricultural fields; AIEM; MODIS; Sentinel-1A; Soil moisture retrieval; WCM","Agricultural robots; Backscattering; Correlation methods; Crops; Integral equations; Mean square error; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Soil surveys; Vegetation; Advanced integral equations; Enhanced vegetation index; Fraction of photosynthetically active radiations; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer datum; Optical remote sensing data; Root mean square errors; Soil moisture estimation; Soil moisture retrievals; Soil moisture; accuracy assessment; bare soil; calibration; crop yield; drought; land surface; leaf area index; MODIS; parameterization; photosynthetically active radiation; satellite data; Sentinel; vegetation index",Article,Scopus

However, it still remains unclear the ability of satellite SIF data to predict crop yields at the regional scale, comparing to widely used satellite vegetation index (VI), such as the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Additionally, few attempts have been made to verify if SIF products from the new Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite could be applied for regional corn and soybean yield estimates. With the deep neural networks (DNN) approach, this study investigated the ability of OCO-2 SIF, MODIS EVI, and climate data to estimate county-level corn and soybean yields in the U.S. Corn Belt. Monthly mean and maximum SIF and MODIS EVI during the peak growing season showed similar correlations with corn and soybean yields. The DNNs with SIF as predictors were able to estimate corn and soybean yields well but performed poorer than MODIS EVI and climate variables-based DNNs. The performance of SIF and MODIS EVI-based DNNs varied with the areal dominance of crops while that of climate-based DNNs exhibited less spatial variability. SIF data could provide useful supplementary information to MODIS EVI and climatic variables for improving estimates of crop yields. MODIS EVI and climate predictors (e.g., VPD and temperature) during the peak growing season (from June to August) played important roles in predicting yields of corn and soybean in the Midwestern 12 states in the U.S. The results highlighted the benefit of combining data from both satellite and climate sources in crop yield estimation. Additionally, this study showed the potential of adding SIF in crop yield prediction despite the small improvement of model performances, which might result from the limitation of current available SIF products. The framework of this study could be applied to different regions and other types of crops to employ deep learning for crop yield forecasting by combining different types of remote sensing data (such as OCO-2 SIF and MODIS EVI) and climate data. © 2020, by the authors.","Corn; Crop yield; Deep neural network; Soybean; Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence","Chlorophyll; Crops; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Fluorescence; Forecasting; Orbits; Remote sensing; Satellites; Vegetation; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Crop yield forecasting; Enhanced vegetation index; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Remote sensing data; Satellite vegetation; Spatial variability; Supplementary information; Radiometers",Article,Scopus

Earth observation (EO) remote sensing data provides a unique source of information to monitor crops in a temporally resolved and spatially explicit way. In this study, we propose the combination of multisensor (optical and microwave) remote sensing data for crop yield estimation and forecasting using two novel approaches. We first propose the lag between Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from MODIS and Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) derived from SMAP as a new joint metric combining the information from the two satellite sensors in a unique feature or descriptor. Our second approach avoids summarizing statistics and uses machine learning to combine full time series of EVI and VOD. This study considers two statistical methods, a regularized linear regression and its nonlinear extension called kernel ridge regression to directly estimate the county-level surveyed total production, as well as individual yields of the major crops grown in the region: corn, soybean and wheat. The study area includes the US Corn Belt, and we use agricultural survey data from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA-NASS) for year 2015 for quantitative assessment. Results show that (1) the proposed EVI-VOD lag metric correlates well with crop yield and outperforms common single-sensor metrics for crop yield estimation; (2) the statistical (machine learning) models working directly with the time series largely improve results compared to previously reported estimations; (3) the combined exploitation of information from the optical and microwave data leads to improved predictions over the use of single sensor approaches with coefficient of determination R≥20.76; (4) when models are used for within-season forecasting with limited time information, crop yield prediction is feasible up to four months before harvest (models reach a plateau in accuracy); and (5) the robustness of the approach is confirmed in a multi-year setting, reaching similar performances than when using single-year data. In conclusion, results confirm the value of using both EVI and VOD at the same time, and the advantage of using automatic machine learning models for crop yield/production estimation. © 2019 The Authors","Agro-ecosystems; Crop yield estimation; Enhanced vegetation index; Kernel ridge regression; Machine learning; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS); Soil moisture active passive (SMAP); Vegetation optical depth","Crops; Forecasting; Learning systems; Machine learning; Optical properties; Radiometers; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Surveys; Time series; Vegetation; Video on demand; Agro ecosystems; Crop yield; Enhanced vegetation index; Kernel ridge regressions; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Soil moisture active passive (SMAP); Vegetation optical depth; Microwave sensors; agricultural ecosystem; crop yield; index method; machine learning; MODIS; multiple regression; optical depth; phenology; regression analysis; satellite data; satellite sensor; soybean; Corn Belt; United States; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The SCYP consists of an image preprocessing module (IPM) to determine crop diseases through the Google Vision API and image resizing, a crop disease diagnosis module (CDDM) based on CNN to diagnose the types and extent of crop diseases through photographs, and a crop yield prediction module (CYPM) based on ANN by using information of crop diseases, remaining time until harvest (based on the date), current temperature, humidity and precipitation (amount of snowfall) in the area, sunshine amount, ground temperature, atmospheric pressure, moisture evaporation in the ground, etc. Four experiments were conducted to verify the efficiency of the SCYP. In the CDMM, the accuracy and operation time of each model were measured using three neural network models: CNN, region-CNN(R-CNN), and you only look once (YOLO). In the CYPM, rectified linear unit (ReLU), Sigmoid, and Step activation functions were compared to measure ANN accuracy. The accuracy of CNN was about 3.5% higher than that of R-CNN and about 5.4% higher than that of YOLO. The operation time of CNN was about 37 s less than that of R-CNN and about 72 s less than that of YOLO. The CDDM had slightly less operation time, but in this paper, we prefer accuracy over operation time to diagnose crop diseases efficiently and accurately. When the activation function of the ANN used in the CYPM was ReLU, the accuracy of the ANN was 2% higher than that of Sigmoid and 7% higher than that of Step. The CYPM prediction was about 34% more accurate when using multiple diseases than when not using them. Therefore, the SCYP can predict farm yields more accurately than traditional methods. © 2019 by the authors.","ANN; CNN; Crop disease diagnosis; Image preprocessing; Yield prediction","algorithm; artificial neural network; crop yield; detection method; image processing; prediction; yield response",Article,Scopus

The remote sensing data and technique have been widely used for the estimation of crop yield and production in the world. For the current research, nine remote sensing indices were tested that include normalized difference drought index (NDDI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature condition index (TCI), vegetation health index (VHI), normalized multi-band drought index (NMDI), visible and shortwave infrared drought index (VSDI), and vegetation supply water index (VSWI). These nine indices derived from MODIS/Terra satellite have so far not been used for crop yield prediction in Mongolia. The primary objective of this study was to determine the best remote sensing indices in order to develop an estimation model for spring wheat yield using correlation and regression method. The spring wheat yield data from the ground measurements of eight meteorological stations in Darkhan and Selenge provinces from 2000 to 2017 have been used. The data were collected during the period of the growing season (June-August). Based on the analysis, we constructed six models for spring wheat yield estimation. The results showed that the range of the root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of estimated spring wheat yield was between 4.1 (100 kg ha-1) to 4.8 (100 kg ha-1), respectively. The range of the mean absolute error (MAE) values was between 3.3 to 3.8 and the index of agreement (d) values was between 0.74 to 0.84, respectively. The conclusion was that the best model would be (R2 = 0.55) based on NDWI, VSDI, and NDVI out of the nine indices and could serve as the most effective predictor and reliable remote sensing indices for monitoring the spring wheat yield in the northern part of Mongolia. Our results showed that the best timing of yield prediction for spring wheat was around the end of June and the beginning of July, which is the flowering stage of spring wheat in this study area. This means an accurate yield prediction for spring wheat can be achieved two months before the harvest time using the regression model. © 2019 by the authors.","MODIS; Northern Mongolia; Remote sensing indices; Spring wheat; Yield estimation","Crops; Drought; Forecasting; Mean square error; Radiometers; Regression analysis; Vegetation; MODIS; Mongolia; Remote sensing index; Spring wheat; Yield estimation; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

A number of vegetation indices (VIs) have been proposed to estimate crop biomass, but they perform poorly at high biomass levels and are easily affected by background materials. Texture analysis has been proved to be an efficient approach in forest biomass estimation, but has never been applied to crops with low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. The objective of this study was to improve rice AGB estimation by combining textural and spectral analysis of UAV imagery. A two-year rice experiment was conducted in 2015 and 2016, involving different nitrogen (N) rates, planting densities and rice cultivars with three replicates. A six-band multispectral (MS) camera was mounted on a UAV to acquire rice canopy images at critical stages during the rice growing seasons and concurrent field samplings were taken. Simple regression and stepwise multiple linear regression models were developed between biomass data from the two-year experiment and image parameters derived from four different types of feature sets. These features represented commonly used VIs, texture parameters, normalization of texture measurements (normalized difference texture index, NDTI) and combinations of VIs and NDTIs. Finally, all the regression models were evaluated by cross-validation over pooled data with the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). Results demonstrated that the optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) exhibited the best relationship with AGB for the whole season (R2 = 0.63) and post-heading stages (R2 = 0.65). Red-edge-based indices yielded best performance (R2 &gt; 0.70) only for the growth stages before heading. The texture measurement mean (MEA) from the NIR band was the best among the eight candidates in AGB estimation. Texture index (NDTI (MEA800, MEA550)) was superior to all the evaluated VIs in estimating AGB for the whole season (R2 = 0.75) and pre-heading stages (R2 = 0.84). Further improvement was obtained across the whole season by combining NDTIs and VIs through a multiple linear regression. This multivariate model produced the highest estimation accuracy for all stages (R2 = 0.78 and RMSE = 1.84 t ha−1) and different stage groups (R2 = 0.84 and RMSE = 1.06 t ha−1 for pre-heading stages and R2 = 0.65 and RMSE = 1.94 t ha−1 for post-heading stages). The findings imply that the integration of textural information with spectral information significantly improves the accuracy for rice biomass estimation compared to the use of spectral information alone. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Aboveground biomass; Rice; Texture index; UAV multispectral imagery; Vegetation index","aboveground biomass; accuracy assessment; bioindicator; crop yield; estimation method; experimental study; growing season; image analysis; index method; plant breeding; rice; satellite imagery; spectral analysis; texture; unmanned vehicle; vegetation index",Article,Scopus

This paper presented an application for cotton yield prediction based on the remote visual and spectral images captured by a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) remote sensing system. Field experiments were carried out at a cotton field approximately 5 hm2. Images of the cotton field were captured by the UAV remote sensing system at a 50 m flight height before fully blooming. One RGB panoramic image and one CIR (color-infrared) panoramic image were obtained by stitching the collected partial images with 75% overlap. Yield data with GPS (global position system) information were registered respectively to the RGB and CIR images according to the GCPs (ground control points). Then 3 features including color feature, coverage rate and vegetation index were extracted from the images and used to develop predication models. Color feature was the hue channel in HSV (hue, saturation, value) color model. Coverage rate was calculated by using Excess Green value based on RGB (red, green, blue) color model. Vegetation index was NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) value usually used to monitor the crop growth. The datasets including yield data and 3 features were randomly divided into training data (90% of raw data) for modeling and test data (10% of raw data) for evaluating the model accuracy. The training data were preprocessed though removing 10% partial outliers based on probability distribution of yield data and being smoothed by mean filter respectively. Then multiple linear regression models were built to predict cotton yield, and parameters of the models were estimated based on the least square method and calculated by SAS software. 3 parameters were used to evaluate the models including P value in F-test statistic, coefficient of determination R2, and MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) between predicted values and the ground truth data in acre area level. The results showed that 7 linear regression models built by 1 variable (color feature, coverage rate or vegetation index), 2 variables (color feature and coverage rate, color feature and vegetation index or coverage rate and vegetation index) and 3 variables (color feature, coverage rate and vegetation index) were all statistically significant at significance level 5%. However, the adequacy of the multiple linear regression model with 3 variables was the best due to the highest R2=0.977 3 compared to other 6 regression models built by 1 variable and 2 variables. So the multiple linear regression model with 3 variables was used to predict yield. And the average MAPEs on the multiple linear regression models built by 3 variables was 4.0% in acre area level.

The prediction of crop yield includes the extensive manual sampling or the use of remote sensing images at present. Particularly, the remote sensing is preferred to predict the large-scale crop yield, providing a large number of satellite images with long time and high spatial resolution. Much effort has been made on the crop yield prediction using remote sensing images and deep learning. However, the yield generally presents nonlinear spatio-temporal characteristics, due mainly to the growth status of crops changes with the time. A single deep learning cannot make full use of crop growth characteristics in multi-temporal images. In this study, a Convolutional Neural Networks - Gated Recurrent Unit (CNN-GRU) estimation model was proposed to extract rich spatial-spectral features from multi-spectral remote sensing images. The time dependence in the phase remote sensing image was also adaptively learned among the various stages in the growth period of winter wheat. As such, the growth characteristics of winter wheat were integrated from multiple scales, further to predict the yield. Furthermore, the main production areas of winter wheat in the country were taken as the research area, including 1 713 districts and counties. The forecast dataset of winter wheat production was finally constructed using the statistical output of winter wheat, MODIS surface reflectance, day and night surface temperature images, and land cover data from 2001 to 2018, thereby to verify the performance of CNN-GRU production estimation model. The results showed that: 1) The annual average root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of the CNN-GRU production estimation model from 2016 to 2018 were 818.3 and 560 kg/hm2, respectively, where the annual average RMSE was reduced by 20.13%, 18.81%, 29.51%, 34.84%, and 36.57%, respectively, compared with the CNN, GRU, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT). Therefore, the CNN-GRU yield estimation model can be expected to accurately predict the winter wheat yield, further to effectively extract the space-spectrum-time information in the entire growth period of winter wheat from multi-temporal remote sensing images. 2) Six time windows were divided during the whole growth period of winter wheat, including the sowing-emergence, tillering-overwintering, green-rising, jointing-booting, heading-flowering, and filling-maturity period. Among them, the highest accuracy of CNN-GRU estimation model was found in the filling-maturation period. Specifically, the annual averages of RMSE and MAE were 817 and 556 kg/hm2, respectively, and R2 was greater than 0.7. However, the annual averages of RMSE and MAE during the heading-flowering period were 823 and 560 kg/hm2, respectively, where the annual average RMSE was 0.7% lower than the filling-maturation period. Therefore, the proposed CNN-GRU yield estimation model can accurately predict the output of winter wheat in the middle and late stages of growth period, particularly for the national yield of winter wheat two months in advance. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

LAI can be used in field crop growth monitoring and verification of remote sensing products. Therefore, accurate, rapid and large-scale estimation of LAI is not only conducive to better monitoring crops, but also conducive to its application in modeling, crop management and precision agriculture. Remote sensing technique has become a promising method to detect and monitor the crop LAI due to its many advantages. In this paper, Banjiequan Village, Wumachang Township, Qitai County, Xinjiang, China was selected as the study area. In order to rapidly and extensively retrieve LAI of winter wheat using domestic remote sensing images, 17 common vegetation indices were extracted from the GF-1/2 images, which was synchronized with field sampling, and observation at intervals of 20 m in the east-west direction and 30 m in the north-south direction in a 130 m × 420 m block. A total of 78 sampling points were taken from a small area of 4 rows × 50 cm. Sampling width was measured by tape ruler and coordinates of sampling points were given by GPS. Based on the vegetation indices extracted from GF-1/2 image and LAI data measured at erecting stage, jointing stage and flowering stage, we established univariate (linear, exponential, power, quadratic polynomials) and multivariate (partial least squares regression, PLSR) empirical models for inversion of winter wheat LAI, and validated them. The correlation coefficients of LAI with MSR (modified simple ratio), GNDVI (green normalized difference vegetation index), EVI (enhanced vegetation index) extracted from the erecting, jointing and flowering stages of GF-1 were the maximum, which were 0.708, 0.671, and 0.743, respectively, indicating that the correlation between these vegetation indices and LAI of winter wheat was significant. The univariate model R2 based on MSRGF-1, NDVIGF-2 (normalized difference vegetation index), GNDVIGF-1 at jointing stage and EVIGF-1 at flowering stage were all greater than 0.7. Compared with different image data at the same growth stage, the quadratic polynomial model based on NDVIGF-2 and PLSR model based on NDVIGF-2, MSRGF-2, and SAVIGF-2 (soil-adjusted vegetation index) were more precise than those based on GF-1, with R2 of 0.768 and 0.809 respectively. Compared with the models with the same data (GF-1) at different growth stages, the quadratic polynomial model based on GNDVIGF-1 at jointing stage and the PLSR model based on EVIGF-1, GSRGF-1 (green simple ratio) and NDVIGF-1 at flowering stage had the maximum value of R2, which was 0.783. The RMSE of the PLSR model was smaller than that of the quadratic polynomial model, indicating the stability of the multivariate model was better than univariate model. Analyzing the LAI distribution maps inverted from different growth stages, it was found that the LAI inversion values basically coincided with the measured LAI values. The above results show that the domestic high-resolution remote sensing image has certain application value in crop physiological parameter inversion, and provides some references for related researches in the future. © 2020, Science Press.

Crop growth models have been widely used for crop growth process description and yield prediction. In particular, the accurate simulation of important state variables, such as leaf area index (LAI) and root zone soil moisture (SM), is of great importance for yield estimation. Data assimilation is a useful tool that combines a crop model and external observations (often derived from remote sensing data) to improve the simulated crop state variables and consequently model outputs like crop total biomass, water use and grain yield. In spite of its effectiveness, applying data assimilation for monitoring crop growth at the regional scale in China remains challenging, due to the lack of high spatiotemporal resolution satellite data that can match the small field sizes which are typical for agriculture in China. With the accessibility of freely available images acquired by Sentinel satellites, it becomes possible to acquire data at high spatiotemporal resolution (10–30 m, 5–6 days), which offers attractive opportunities to characterize crop growth. In this study, we assimilated remotely sensed LAI and SM into the Word Food Studies (WOFOST) model to estimate winter wheat yield using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) algorithm. The LAI was calculated from Sentinel-2 using a lookup table method, and the SM was calculated from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 based on a change detection approach. Through validation with field data, the inverse error was 10% and 35% for LAI and SM, respectively. The open-loop wheat yield estimation, independent assimilations of LAI and SM, and a joint assimilation of LAI + SM were tested and validated using field measurement observation in the city of Hengshui, China, during the 2016–2017 winter wheat growing season. The results indicated that the accuracy of wheat yield simulated by WOFOST was significantly improved after joint assimilation at the field scale. Compared to the open-loop estimation, the yield root mean square error (RMSE) with field observations was decreased by 69 kg/ha for the LAI assimilation, 39 kg/ha for the SM assimilation and 167 kg/ha for the joint LAI + SM assimilation. Yield coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.41, 0.65, 0.50, and 0.76 and mean relative errors (MRE) of 4.87%, 4.32%, 4.45% and 3.17% were obtained for open-loop, LAI assimilation alone, SM assimilation alone and joint LAI + SM assimilation, respectively. The results suggest that LAI was the first-choice variable for crop data assimilation over SM, and when both LAI and SM satellite data are available, the joint data assimilation has a better performance because LAI and SM have interacting effects. Hence, joint assimilation of LAI and SM from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 at a 20 m resolution into the WOFOST provides a robust method to improve crop yield estimations. However, there is still bias between the key soil moisture in the root zone and the Sentinel-1 C band retrieved SM, especially when the vegetation cover is high. By active and passive microwave data fusion, it may be possible to offer a higher accuracy SM for crop yield prediction. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

After extensive research and verification, it is found that different fitting reconstruction methods have different suitability for different geographical environments. A large number of studies on comparative analysis methods mainly focus on qualitative analysis based on sample curve analysis and visual comparison, and quantitative analysis based on root mean square error, correlation coefficient, Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information standard. However, the evaluation indexes that quantitative analyses adopt are mostly the mean value, the maximum value, and the minimum value, which ignore the influence of abnormal values and spatial pattern differences on reconstruction result. In this study, the unchanging areas of cultivated land, forests, grasslands and shrubs in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region were extracted through the spatial analysis tool in ArcGIS. Then, weights to all pixels were assigned in combination with the quality reliability of VI pixel. Next, the fitting reconstruction of the time series data of MDOSI EVI 16 d in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2001 to 2015 were finished by asymmetric Gaussian function fitting method (AG), double logistic function fitting method (DL), and SG filtering method (SG). Before analyzing the fitting results, the fitted and original vegetation growth curves of Beijing station in 2006 were firstly extracted, then the start and end time of growing season were extracted by the dynamic threshold method. Verification was made combined with China National Specimen Information Infrastructure data and typical plant phenological observation dataset of Chinese phenological observation network. The results illustrated that the fitted vegetation growth curve by the three methods was consistent with the field observation data. The fitting result of the sampling point curve in the past 15 years was analyzed based on the analysis result of the relationship between noise ratio and fitting method. Combined with correlation coefficient, root mean square error, Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information standard, the spatial pattern of fitting result was analyzed. Finally, the method of mathematical statistics was used to quantitatively analyze the fitting result. The results showed that there was no significant difference between AG fitting and DL fitting in the denoising result. AG fitting showed better fitting reconstruction result at some pixel points, while SG filtering can preserve the original vegetation features more effectively. The reconstruction results of the three methods showed the difference related to the spatial distribution of land types. For the long-term time series data of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, AG fitting showed better reconstruction result in grassland, forest and shrub areas with less human disturbance, and the result of SG filtering was better in the reconstruction of cultivated areas with stronger human activities. This study can provide reference for the fitting of time series data of vegetation in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, and provide more objective and clear method support for the evaluation of the result of fitting reconstruction of time series data. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

With the development of accurate and high-throughput plant phenotyping techniques, big phenotypic data of various plants especially image data can be collected. There is an urgent need to develop effective approaches to dealing with large-scale image data analysis to explore the biological and physiological mechanisms which can be eventually used from the laboratory to the field. This research was entering a new era called 'smart phenomics'. Deep Learning (DL) provided an opportunity to extract useful traits from the complicated phenotypic dataset, which could bridge the knowledge gap between genotype and phenotype for fundamental research and engineering applications in a breeding program and precision farming. Recently, a series of phenotyping related research supported by DL had been published all around the plant fundamental mechanism as well as the agricultural engineering applications. This study investigated the latest publications focused on phenotyping relating to the following algorithms: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), Auto Encoder (AE), Sparse Coding (SC) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), both of the achievements and problems were introduced and summarized in the following aspects. The published researches involved the phenotypic identification and classification over various crops from tissues, organs, and plant scales singly or combined. Not like DBN, SC, or other earlier algorithms, CNN could extract the features without image preprocessing or feature design, its capability also grew rapidly since it was proposed and now had been the first-choice for image identification and classification scenarios. While deep learning applications in biotic/abiotic plant stress analysis mainly focused on the identification and classification of different phenotypic traits of various common crops under typical stresses. Recent studies CNN showed the most potential capability for stress identification and classification, and the predictions by CNN was an irrelevance to the type of stress. Studies also found that the qualitative analysis of abiotic stress could be diagnosed by transfer learning to reduce training time without affecting the prediction capability of the model, especially network architectures with mature applications scenarios manifested stable performance in terms of adaptability and migration based on CNN or integrated with CNN, Besides, yield prediction accuracy had been greatly improved through color, geometric shapes, textures and multiple phenotypic coupling features, which could be divided into the following three scenarios, including fruit yield prediction based on fruit identification and counting, field crop yield prediction by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing and multi-dimensional yield prediction based on multi-scale, multi-source, and multi-factor data. Moreover, deep learning had shown the potential for precision breeding and precision management. The precise identification of crop-specific phenotypes is the basis for accurate breeding and phenotypic management, and it can be summarized as two categories, including quantitative index counts after target detection and target segmentation under complex field conditions. In summary, a large number of proposed network architectures applied in plant phenotyping have been reviewed, and future efforts should be made on improving the efficiency and accuracy in production scenarios. Finally, the trend and future perspective in the multi-disciplinary research field of deep learning in plant phenotype research were also discussed. © 2020, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Agriculture is a risliy business and the reliance on reliable crop harvests is important in decisions related to agricultural risii management. We often see farmers suffer losses because of improper selection of the crops they grow without taking into account climatic and environmental boundaries. Crop prediction is a tough task because it depends on a variety of factors such as region, season, rainfall, etc. So a system is needed to recommend reliable crops to a farmer by considering climatic conditions, region of cultivation, etc. The proposed work uses the random forest algorithm to solve agricultural problems by recommending the good crop and its average yield to a farmer by analyzing climatic and agricultural parameters like state, season and rainfall. © 2021 IEEE","agriculture; Cropyieldprediction; Machine learning; Random forest","Cultivation; Decision trees; Machine learning; Rain; Random forests; Average yield; Climatic conditions; Crop yield forecasting; Cropyieldprediction; Environmental boundaries; Forecasting system; Gross domestic products; Random forest algorithm; Random forests; Crops",Conference Paper,Scopus

Even though agriculture plays a vital role, there are still several major complications to be addressed. Some of the major complications are lack of knowledge about yield and price resulting in the farmers selecting crops based on experience. Machine learning has a great potential to solve these complications. To this end, this paper proposes a novel system comprises of a mobile application, SMS (Short Message Service), and API (Application Programming Interface) with yield prediction, price prediction, and crop optimization. Several machine learning algorithms were used for yield and price predictions while a generic algorithm was used to optimize crops. The yield was predicted considering the environmental factors while the price was predicted considering supply and demand, import and export, and seasonal effect. To select the best suitable crops to cultivate, the output of yield and price prediction have been used. Yield prediction has been implemented using elastic net, ridge, and multilinear regression. R2 of yield prediction is varied from 0.74 to 0.89 while RMSE value is between 15.69 and 35.05.

The system builds a deep recurrent Q-network (DRQN) with the Q-DRL algorithm. The layers of CNNRNN were stacked in series, and then given the input variables. Based on these variables, the Q-learning network creates a rubber yield estimation model during training, by linearly mapping CNNRNN outputs to Q-factors. Then, the RL agent combines parametric attributes with a threshold to assist with rubber yield prediction. Further, the agent accepts an overall rate for the actions executed to minimize error and maximize forecast accuracy. If the time series is too long, however, the DRL-based RNN might suffer vanishing gradients. To solve the problem, probabilistic modeling schemes, such as data analytics, and probabilistic bias-difference decomposition, were introduced to the DRL to deal with the inherent ambiguity in geometric estimations. After that, the model predictive control (MPC) learns a probabilistic shift method utilizing Gaussian processes (GPs).

It is one of the highest employing sectors in the Indian scenario. Unlike other sectors agriculture is highly dependent on the quality and the quantity of both the external factors like rainfall, climate, pH of the soil, fertilizers and insecticides used, and internal factors like the quality of seeds. This paper predicts the production of crops as a function of rainfall for four Indian States. This knowledge can be implemented in generating a rough overview of how the production is based on rainfall and how much can a specific crop production for the amount of rainfall it receives. Two crops each belonging to four different states are chosen and the best regression model for the crop of the state is chosen. There is no research done solely on how rainfall affects crops of particular states. The proposed method of evaluation is better than other existing methods of evaluation as it evaluates all the regression techniques (Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest, and XGBRegression) for two crops of four individual states. For balanced evaluation, two states of North India and two states of South India are selected.

This study aims to implement the ANFIS method to predict paddy plant height based on the treatment of vermicompost organic fertilizer. The dataset used for ANFIS training was taken directly from the observation data on the height of the paddy plant and the results of soil laboratory tests. The ANFIS process consists of 5 inputs consisting of fertilizer treatment, pH, N, P, K, and one output, namely paddy plant height. The results obtained from the training data process are that there are 486 rules and the error rate using MAPE is 3.53%, or the accuracy level of the prediction results is 96.47%. © 2021 IEEE.","ANFIS; Paddy; Prediction; Vermicompost","Fertilizers; Fuzzy inference; Soil testing; Soils; Statistical tests; ANFIS method; Crop yield; Local resources; Organic fertilizers; Paddy; Paddy yields; Plant height; Soil acidity; Soil conditions; Vermicomposts; Forecasting",Conference Paper,Scopus

The developed data set is a combination of management, environment, and historical corn yields from 1980 to 2019. Two scenarios for ensemble creation are considered: homogenous and heterogenous ensembles. In homogenous ensembles, the base CNN-DNN models are all the same, but they are generated with a bagging procedure to ensure they exhibit a certain level of diversity. Heterogenous ensembles are created from different base CNN-DNN models which share the same architecture but have different hyperparameters. Three types of ensemble creation methods were used to create several ensembles for either of the scenarios: Basic Ensemble Method (BEM), Generalized Ensemble Method (GEM), and stacked generalized ensembles. Results indicated that both designed ensemble types (heterogenous and homogenous) outperform the ensembles created from five individual ML models (linear regression, LASSO, random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM). Furthermore, by introducing improvements over the heterogenous ensembles, the homogenous ensembles provide the most accurate yield predictions across US Corn Belt states. This model could make 2019 yield predictions with a root mean square error of 866 kg/ha, equivalent to 8.5% relative root mean square and could successfully explain about 77% of the spatio-temporal variation in the corn grain yields. The significant predictive power of this model can be leveraged for designing a reliable tool for corn yield prediction which will in turn assist agronomic decision makers. © Copyright © 2021 Shahhosseini, Hu, Khaki and Archontoulis.","CNN-DNN; heterogenous ensemble; homogenous ensemble; US Corn Belt; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

However, to yield prediction, how much this technique may be improved with the adoption of a ranking-based strategy is still an unknown issue. Here we propose a ranking-based approach to potentialize the RF method for maize yield prediction. This approach is based on the correlation parameter of individual vegetation indices (VIs). The VIs were individually ranked based on a merit metric that measures the improvement on the Pearson's correlation coefficient by using RF against a baseline method. As a result, only the most relevant VIs were considered as input features to the RF model. We used 33 VIs extracted from multispectral UAV-based (unmanned aerial vehicle) imagery. The multispectral data were generated with two different sensors: Sequoia and MicaSense; during the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 crop seasons, respectively. Amongst all the evaluated indices, NDVI, NDRE, and GNDVI were the top three in the ranking-based analysis, and their combination with RF increased the maize yield prediction. Our approach also outperformed other known machine learning methods, like support vector machine and artificial neural network. Additive regression, using the RF as the base weak learner, provided a higher accuracy with a correlation coefficient and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of 0.78 and 853.11 kg ha−1, respectively. We conclude that the ranking-based strategy of VIs is appropriate to predict maize yield using machine learning methods and data derived from multispectral images. We demonstrated that our approach reduces the number of VIs needed to determine a high accuracy and relative low MAE, and the approach may contribute to decision-making actions, resulting in accurate management of maize fields. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Multispectral images; Precision agriculture; Random Forest; Shallow learner","Agricultural robots; Antennas; Correlation methods; Decision making; Decision trees; Forecasting; Random forests; Support vector machines; Turing machines; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Correlation coefficient; Correlation parameters; Machine learning methods; Machine learning techniques; Multi-spectral data; Multispectral images; Pearson's correlation coefficients; Ranking-based analysis; Learning systems; agricultural application; algorithm; artificial neural network; crop yield; decision making; maize; multispectral image; NDVI; prediction; satellite imagery; unmanned vehicle; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The main benefits of the proposed system are as follows: Yielding the right crop at the right time, balancing crop production, economy growth, and planning to reduce crop scarcity. Initially, the database is collected, and the input dataset is preprocessed. Feature selection is carried out followed by feature extraction techniques. The best features were then optimized using the recurrent cuckoo search optimization algorithm, then the optimized output can be given as an input for the process of classification. The classification process is conducted using the Discrete DBN‐ VGGNet classifier. The performance estimation is made to prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2021 by the authors.

However, there exists a major threat in the crop yield due to unpredictable and uncontrolled climatic changes, traditional farming methods, and poor irrigation services. In the past, crop yield was predicted based on farmer's experience. At present, the challenge is to increase the crop yield to meet the needs of the growing population. Currently, Machine Learning (ML) techniques are being used in multiple fields to accomplish practical and productive solutions. There are various algorithms in ML based on classification, clustering, and neural networks which can be used to predict the crop yield. In this work, we propose a method based on K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm which detects the soil quality and predicts the suitable crop for cultivation. We consider temperature and soil quality as inputs to our algorithm. In addition, our method suggests the fertilizer based on the crop predicted. The test results show that our method accurately predicts the crop selection and yield which helps the farmers to great extent. © 2021 IEEE.","Crop prediction; crop yield; K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) Algorithm; soil quality","Clustering algorithms; Cultivation; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Membership functions; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Soils; Classification networks; Classification/clustering; Climatic changes; Crop prediction; Crop yield; K-near neighbor algorithm; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Nearest-neighbor algorithms; Soils qualities; Crops",Conference Paper,Scopus

It is an economic sector that plays an essential role in the overall development of the country. Thus, the modernization of agriculture is significant and thus will lead the farmers of our country toward profit. Earlier, the sowing of crops was performed by considering the farmer's knowledge in a particular field and about a specific crop. However, as the weather conditions change very rapidly, farmers cultivate more and more crops that do not give an expected yield, thereby reducing their profits. Being this as the current situation, many of them do not have enough knowledge about the new crops and are not entirely aware of the benefits they get while farming them. Also, farm productivity can be increased by understanding and forecasting crop performance in a variety of environmental conditions. The proposed system applies machine learning and prediction algorithms to identify the pattern among data and then process it as per input conditions. This in turn will propose the best feasible crops according to given environmental conditions. Thus, this system will only require the land area of the user, and it will suggest a number of profitable crops providing a choice directly to the farmer about which crop to cultivate.

In this direction, predicting the sell quantity of chemical fertilizer is an important issue because most of the farmers highly depend on these fertilizers for their successful crop yield production. In the past, various conventional tools and techniques are applied on agriculture dataset. However, these tools and techniques could not be getting succeeded to achieve their goals. The regression techniques have capability to model the relationship among two or more variables and could be helpful for successful prediction.

Feature selection (FS) and feature extraction (FeExt) form significant components of data pre-processing. FS is the identification of relevant features that enhances the accuracy of a model. Since, agricultural data contain diverse features related to climate, soil, fertilizer, FS attains significant importance as irrelevant features may adversely impact the prediction of the model built. Likewise, FeExt involves the derivation of new attributes from the prevailing attributes. All the information that the original attributes possess is present in these new features minus the duplicity. Keeping these points in mind, this work proposes a hybrid feature selection and feature extraction strategy for selecting features from the agricultural data set. A modified-Genetic Algorithm (m-GA) was developed by designing a fitness function based on “Mutual Information” (MutInf), and “Root Mean Square Error” (RtMSE) to choose the best features that affected the target attribute (crop yield in this case). These selected features were then subjected to feature extraction using “weighted principal component analysis” (wgt-PCA). The extracted features were then fed into different ML models viz. “Regression” (Reg), “Artificial Neural Networks” (ArtNN), “Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System” (ANFIS), “Ensemble of Trees” (EnT), and “Support Vector Regression” (SuVR). Trials on 3 benchmark and 8 real-world farming datasets revealed that the developed hybrid feature selection and extraction technique performed with significant improvements with respect to Rsq2, RtMSE, and “mean absolute error” (MAE) in comparison to FS and FeExt methods such as Correlation Analysis (CA), Singular Valued Decomposition (SiVD), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and wgt-PCA on “benchmark” and “real-world” farming datasets. © 2021","Feature extraction; Feature selection; Genetic Algorithm; Hybrid; Weighted-Principal Component Analysis","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Climate models; Data handling; Extraction; Feature extraction; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Mean square error; Principal component analysis; Data preprocessing; Feature selection and extractions; Features extraction; Features selection; Hybrid; Hybrid feature selections; Modified genetic algorithms; Real-world; Root mean square errors; Weighted principal component analysis; Genetic algorithms",Article,Scopus

Nearly 65 percent of the population of India lives in villages with the main occupation being agriculture. The diverse climatic conditions in the country result in the production of a large number of agricultural items. Many surveys have proved that the suicide rate of farmers is proliferating over years due to the selection of the wrong crop resulting in less yield. In some areas, farmers lack information about the composition of soil and weather conditions and may choose the wrong crop to sow which results in lesser yield. Production of crops depends on geographical parameters like humidity, rainfall, and properties of soil such as pH, and NPK content. Integration of technology with agriculture helps the farmer to improve his production. The main goal of agricultural planning is to achieve the maximum yield rate of crops by using a limited number of land resources.

These regulations require that growers apply nitrogen to meet, but not exceed, the annual N demand for crop and tree growth and nut production. To accurately predict seasonal nitrogen demand, therefore, growers need to estimate block-level almond yield early in the growing season so that timely N management decisions can be made. However, methods to predict almond yield are not currently available. To fill this gap, we have developed statistical models using the Stochastic Gradient Boosting, a machine learning approach, for early season yield projection and mid-season yield update over individual orchard blocks. We collected yield records of 185 orchards, dating back to 2005, from the major almond growers in the Central Valley of California. A large set of variables were extracted as predictors, including weather and orchard characteristics from remote sensing imagery. Our results showed that the predicted orchard-level yield agreed well with the independent yield records. For both the early season (March) and mid-season (June) predictions, a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.71, and a ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) of 2.6 were found on average. We also identified several key determinants of yield based on the modeling results. Almond yield increased dramatically with the orchard age until about 7 years old in general, and the higher long-term mean maximum temperature during April–June enhanced the yield in the southern orchards, while a larger amount of precipitation in March reduced the yield, especially in northern orchards. Remote sensing metrics such as annual maximum vegetation indices were also dominant variables for predicting the yield potential. While these results are promising, further refinement is needed; the availability of larger data sets and incorporation of additional variables and methodologies will be required for the model to be used as a fertilization decision support tool for growers. Our study has demonstrated the potential of automatic almond yield prediction to assist growers to manage N adaptively, comply with mandated requirements, and ensure industry sustainability. © 2019 Zhang, Jin, Chen and Brown.","Almond orchard; Central valley; Machine learning; Nitrogen management; Remote sensing; Yield prediction; Yield variation",,Article,Scopus

Recent studies have proven remote sensing is an efficient method for yield estimation and machine learning, especially deep learning, can infer a good prediction by integrating multisource datasets such as satellite data, climate data, soil data, and so on. However, there are some bottleneck challenges to improve accuracy. First, the popular remote sensing data used for yield prediction fall into two major groups - time-series data and constant data. Surprisingly little attention has been devoted to deep learning networks which can integrate the two kinds of data effectively; second, both temporal and spatial features play a role in affecting the yields. But most of the existing approaches employed either convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN). CNN cannot learn temporal patterns, while RNN barely can learn spatial characteristics. This work proposed a novel multilevel deep learning model coupling RNN and CNN to extract both spatial and temporal features. The inputs include both time-series remote sensing data, soil property data, and the model outputs yield. We experimented with the model in U.S. Corn Belt states, and used it to predict corn yield from 2013 to 2016 at the county-level.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of a hybrid method of season optimization algorithm (SO) and support vector regression (SVR) in estimating the yield and WP of tomato crops based on climatic factors, irrigation–fertilizer under the drip irrigation, and plastic mulch. To approve the proposed method, 160 field data including water consumption during the growing season, fertilizers, climatic variables, and crop variety were applied. Two types of treatments, namely drip irrigation (DI) and drip irrigation with plastic mulch (PMDI), were considered. Seven different input combinations were used to estimate yield and WP. R2, RMSE, NSE, SI, and σ criteria were utilized to assess the proposed hybrid method. A good agreement was presented between the observed (field monitoring data) and estimated (calculated with SO–SVR method) values (R2 = 0.982). The irrigation—fertilizer parameters (PMDI, F) and crop variety (V) are the most effective in estimating the yield and WP of tomato crops. Statistical analysis of the obtained results showed that the SO–SVR hybrid method has high efficiency in estimating WP and yield.

The yield of winter wheat is affected by production technology level and climatic conditions. This study analyzed the feasibility of early prediction of winter wheat yield with long time series meteorological data and random forest method in Henan Province. Winter wheat was planted in a total of 106 counties (cities) in Henan province. Based on the ground observation meteorological data and the winter wheat statistical yield data from the year of 1990 to 2015, we extracted 47 climatic factors such as temperature, humidity and precipitation in different growth stages from wheat jointing to heading stage, and 3 spatial factors of latitude, longitude and elevation. A total of 50 parameters were used as a set of feature variables. The actual yield, meteorological yield and relative meteorological yield were used as the target variables respectively, and a random forest yield prediction model with multiple variables was constructed. The data from the year of 1990 to 2009 were used as training samples to construct the model and the forests constructed were validated with data from the year of 2010 to 2015. The yield impact factors were analyzed by combining the data importance results outside the bag. The results showed that: 1) The prediction results by using meteorological yield and relative meteorological yield as the target variables were better than the yield model. For the meteorological yield and relative meteorological yield models, the values of determination coefficient R2 were both above 0.8, the values of mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of meteorological yield were 415 and 558 kg/hm2, respectively, and the values of MAE and RMSE of relative meteorological yield were 0.07 and 0.09, respectively; 2) The spatial characteristics played an important role in the improving the random forest yield model. However, if the model included only spatial parameters, the predicted values were horizontally distributed along 1:1 line and the different yields in the same region by using random forest algorithm were predicted as the same values. The values far from 1:1 line might be affected by meteorological factors. Therefore, on this basis, adding meteorological features improved the prediction accuracy with smaller deviations, higher R2 (0.88), and smaller MAE and RMSE (0.06 and 0.08). 3) The model prediction was also affected by crop growing stages. The accuracy based on the meteorological features of winter wheat florets differentiation and heading and flowering stage was higher than the other spike differentiation periods, indicating that the environmental changes during this period have a greater impact on the final yield; The predicted results at the late drug interval had the larger deviation from the actual yield. It was because the meteorological factors had strong correlation and it weakened the impacts of spatial characteristics. 4) Based on the importance of outside the bag data, In the meteorological features, the average temperature and minimum temperature of winter wheat floret differentiation period, the spatial characteristics parameters were important. In addition, the negative accumulated temperature from the jointing to heading stage, and the maximum temperature at heading and flowering stage had great influence on yield. During the model establishment, we didn't differentiate disaster from non-disaster year because the sample sizes were small. However, during the model validation, the data were from both normal and disaster years, which could ensure the reliability of the prediction model. Thus, the winter wheat yield prediction based on random forest should consider both spatial and meteorological characteristics parameters. The results of this study provide new ideas and methods for early prediction of winter wheat yield. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The results suggest that the mean technical efficiency varies from 0.64 in Gujarat to 0.95 in Odisha. Inputs like human labor, mechanical labor, fertilizer, irrigation and insecticide were found to determine the yield in paddy cultivation across India (except for Chhattisgarh). Inefficiency in the paddy production in Punjab, Bihar, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam, Gujarat and Odisha in 2016–2017 was caused by technical inefficiency due to poor input management, as suggested by the significant σ2U and σ2v values of the stochastic frontier model. In addition, most of the farm groups in the study operated in the high‐efficiency group (80–90% technical efficiency). No specific pattern of input use can be visualized through descriptive measures to give any specific policy implication. Thus, machine learning algorithms based on the input parameters were tested on the data in order to predict the farmers’ efficiency class for individual states. The highest mean accuracy of 0.80 for the models of all of the states was achieved in random forest models. Among the various states of India, the best random forest prediction model based on accuracy was fitted to the input data of Bihar (0.91), followed by Uttar Pradesh (0.89), Andhra Pradesh (0.88), Assam (0.88) and West Bengal (0.86). Thus, the study provides a technique for the classification and prediction of a farmer’s efficiency group from the levels of input use in paddy cultivation for each state in the study. The study uses the DES input dataset to classify and predict the efficiency group of the farmer, as other machine learning models in agriculture have used mostly satellite, spectral imaging and soil property data to detect disease, weeds and crops. © 2021 by the authors.

It is an end-of-season land cover map which is not available within growing season. Moreover, CDLs in early years have many misclassified pixels (relatively low accuracy) due to cloud cover and lack of satellite images. This paper will present the studies of using machine learning technique to address these issues in CDL data.

This Map Reduce technique is being proposed which is employed to process heterogeneous data items. Few issues that are being targeted in the existing paper include associating climatologically and meteorological information with large variety of farming decisions.

Three imputation techniques are tested against a non-imputation approach that discards records with any missing values; the complete-case analysis (CCA). The deep learning linear memory vector recurrent neural network-RNN (LIME) imputation model is tested along with two other nondeep learning models such as the linear function and Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF). The simple LSTM deep learning (DL) prediction model is deployed to decide the best performing imputation model, the one resulting in the lowest price and yield prediction errors. Five performance evaluation measures are utilized; the mean absolute error (MAE), the root mean square error (RMSE), R2 correlation measure along with two aggregated measures summarizing these three measures to decide the overall prediction performance; the average aggregated measure (AGM) for each considered step ahead and the average of the AGM across all considered steps ahead (AAGM). Based on AGM, it is found that the LIME imputation model leads to the best prediction performance of the simple LSTM DL model across both applications of 5 weeks ahead strawberry price and yield predictions using weather; W2P and W2Y. Therefore, the LIME imputed file is reused to train two compound DL models, Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory RNN with attention (ATT-ConvLSTM) and ATT-CNN-LSTM along with their Voting Regressor ensemble (VR). The same models are retrained with files preprocessed with the non-imputation approach, CCA. It is found that the overall AAGM of the compound DL and ensemble prediction models across all the 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks ahead price predictions confirm that using LIME highly improves the prediction performance of the ensemble and its compound DL components. The VR ensemble price prediction performance is improved by 72% and the ATTConvLSTM component is improved by 89% compared to their performances without imputation; using CCA preprocessed files. © 2020 IEEE.","Data Imputation.

Aloe arborescens L. is famous for its medicinal properties used in medicine, cosmetology, and even the food industry. Diagnosing the abnormalities in the plant development in a timely and accurate manner plays an important role in preventing the loss of crop production yields. The current study has built a method for recognizing the causes of abnormalities in the development of Aloe arborescens L. caused by a lack of watering or lighting, based on the use of transfer training of the VGG-16 convolutional neural network (United Kingdom). A given architecture is aimed at recognizing objects in images, which is the main reason for using it to achieve the goal set. The analysis of the quality metrics of the proposed image classification process by specified classes has revealed high recognition reliability (for a normally developing plant, 91%; for a plant without proper watering, 89%; and for a plant without proper lighting, 83%). The analysis of the validity of test sample recognition has demonstrated a similar validity of the plant’s classification to one of three classes: 92.6%; 87.5%; and 85.5%, respectively.

However, due to weather extremes and uncertainties, most forecasting models for crop yield are not reliable and accurate. For measuring the uncertainty in crop yield forecast, a probabilistic forecasting model based on quantile random forest and Epanechnikov kernel function (QRF-E) is proposed. The non-linear structure of random forest is applied to build the non-linear quantile regression forecast model and to capture the non-linear relationship betweeen the weather variables and crop yield. Epanechnikov kernel function and solve-the equation plug-in approach of Sheather and Jones are used in the density estimation. A case study using groundnut and millet yield in Ghana were presented to illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed technique. The values of the prediction interval coverage probability and prediction interval normalized average width for the two crops showed that, the constructed prediction intervals captured the observed yields with high coverage probability. The probability density curves show that QRF-E method has a very high ability to forecast quality prediction intervals with a higher coverage probability. The feature importance gave a score of the importance of each weather variable in building the quantile random forest model. The farmer and other stakeholders are able to realize the specific weather variable that affects the yield of a selected crop through feature importance.

In this study, different multispectral and red-green-blue (RGB) vegetation indices were analyzed, as well as the digitally estimated canopy cover and plant density, in order to estimate corn grain yield using a neural network model. The relative importance of the predictor variables was also analyzed. An experiment was established with five levels of nitrogen fertilization (140, 200, 260, 320, and 380 kg/ha) and four replicates, in a completely randomized block design, resulting in 20 experimental polygons. Crop information was captured using two sensors (Parrot Sequoia_4.9, and DJI FC6310_8.8) mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for two flight dates at 47 and 79 days after sowing (DAS). The correlation coefficient between the plant density, obtained through the digital count of corn plants, and the corn grain yield was 0.94; this variable was the one with the highest relative importance in the yield estimation according to Garson’s algorithm. The canopy cover, digitally estimated, showed a correlation coefficient of 0.77 with respect to the corn grain yield, while the relative importance of this variable in the yield estimation was 0.080 and 0.093 for 47 and 79 DAS, respectively. The wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI), plant density, and canopy cover showed the highest correlation coefficient and the smallest errors (R = 0.99, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.028 t ha−1, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.125 t ha−1 ) in the corn grain yield estimation at 47 DAS, with the WDRVI index and the density being the variables with the highest relative importance for this crop development date. For the 79 DAS flight, the combination of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference red edge (NDRE), WDRVI, excess green (EXG), triangular greenness index (TGI), and visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI), as well as plant density and canopy cover, generated the highest correlation coefficient and the smallest errors (R = 0.97, MAE = 0.249 t ha−1, RMSE = 0.425 t ha−1 ) in the corn grain yield estimation, where the density and the NDVI were the variables with the highest relative importance, with values of 0.295 and 0.184, respectively. However, the WDRVI, plant density, and canopy cover estimated the corn grain yield with acceptable precision (R = 0.96, MAE = 0.209 t ha−1, RMSE = 0.449 t ha−1 ). The generated neural network models provided a high correlation coefficient between the estimated and the observed corn grain yield, and also showed acceptable errors in the yield estimation. The spectral information registered through remote sensors mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles and its processing in vegetation indices, canopy cover, and plant density allowed the characterization and estimation of corn grain yield. Such information is very useful for decision-making and agricultural activities planning. © 2020 by the authors.

Recent research has shown that machine learning (ML) can provide reasonable predictions faster and with higher flexibility compared to simulation crop modeling. However, a single machine learning model can be outperformed by a “committee” of models (machine learning ensembles) that can reduce prediction bias, variance, or both and is able to better capture the underlying distribution of the data. Yet, there are many aspects to be investigated with regard to prediction accuracy, time of the prediction, and scale. The earlier the prediction during the growing season the better, but this has not been thoroughly investigated as previous studies considered all data available to predict yields. This paper provides a machine leaning based framework to forecast corn yields in three US Corn Belt states (Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa) considering complete and partial in-season weather knowledge. Several ensemble models are designed using blocked sequential procedure to generate out-of-bag predictions. The forecasts are made in county-level scale and aggregated for agricultural district and state level scales. Results show that the proposed optimized weighted ensemble and the average ensemble are the most precise models with RRMSE of 9.5%. Stacked LASSO makes the least biased predictions (MBE of 53 kg/ha), while other ensemble models also outperformed the base learners in terms of bias. On the contrary, although random k-fold cross-validation is replaced by blocked sequential procedure, it is shown that stacked ensembles perform not as good as weighted ensemble models for time series data sets as they require the data to be non-IID to perform favorably. Comparing our proposed model forecasts with the literature demonstrates the acceptable performance of forecasts made by our proposed ensemble model. Results from the scenario of having partial in-season weather knowledge reveals that decent yield forecasts with RRMSE of 9.2% can be made as early as June 1st. Moreover, it was shown that the proposed model performed better than individual models and benchmark ensembles at agricultural district and state-level scales as well as county-level scale. To find the marginal effect of each input feature on the forecasts made by the proposed ensemble model, a methodology is suggested that is the basis for finding feature importance for the ensemble model. The findings suggest that weather features corresponding to weather in weeks 18–24 (May 1st to June 1st) are the most important input features. © Copyright © 2020 Shahhosseini, Hu and Archontoulis.","corn yields; ensemble; forecasting; machine learning; US Corn Belt",,Article,Scopus

This quality improves with proper care and timely fertilization, thereby improving the yield of the crop. Fertilization measures are deployed when there is there are issues with the plant health, and these issues can be identified by both intrusive and non-intrusive methods. Intrusive methods require study of chemical composition of the plant leaf and provide high accuracy of detection, while non-intrusive methods require a simple camera arrangement along with an image processing engine to identify diseases with moderate to high accuracy. The main issue with non-intrusive methods is the amount of training needed for every change of crop, which limits its real-time application. Moreover, the accuracy of classification must be tuned for every new crop type. In order to remove these issues, this text proposes a 2 level non-intrusive leaf disease detection model that uses a combination of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and re-enforcement learning. The GAN combines the learning models from different datasets and applies it to any new plant leaf image, while re-enforcement learning re-trains the GAN with the confidence score obtained using this new imagery. Based on the confidence score there are changes in the final model, these changes can be both additive and subtractive. Additive changes allow the network to add more image types, while subtractive images remove low-confidence classified imagery in order to improve the final accuracy of cross-dataset classification. The proposed model is able to work on multiple datasets with more than 99% accuracy of classification, and thus is applicable for real-time deployment. © 2021, Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.","Confidence; Disease; GAN; Growth; Leaf; Re-enforcement; Yield",,Article,Scopus

In this study, we first considered five environmental variables, Mean Wind Speed (MWS), Mean Temperature (MT), Mean Ground Temperature (MGT), Mean Humidity (MH), Daily Sunshine (DS) and Daily Rainfall (DR), which have high influence on onion weight at different stages of growth. Second, we use the partial least square (PLS) regression, support vector machine (SVM) regression, multilayer perceptron (MLP) network as statistical prediction model and LSTM network as deep learning algorithm in order to predict the weight of onion using the collected data. Third, we conducted an experiment to investigate the performance of four prediction models for its weight and the influence of six environmental variables on onion growth. Finally, from the experimental results, we first note that the optimal cultivation strategy to increase onion growth is to lower the MWS, MGT and DR below a certain level and at the same time increase the MT, MS and DS values above a certain level. Secondly, we note that for raw data, the weight of onions is not well predicted at the stages of growth by four prediction methods, but for log transform data, it is well predicted during the growth stages.

The objective of this work was to improve the management of the water resources in a potato crop by applying deep learning algorithms to predict the irrigation prescription. Three deep learning models, such as one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-DCNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and a hybrid convolutional LSTM were reviewed and evaluated. The climatic variables of the potato crop were collected daily for three years, such as temperature, rain, water content in soil, and evapotranspiration, among others. The measured variables were provided by two meteorological stations located in the USoChicamocha Irrigation District. Deep learning models were trained and validated using Python®, calculating performance metrics. The CNN-LSTM model predicted the potato crop irrigation prescription with better precision in the training and validation dataset with MSE values less than 0,067 and RMSE values less than 0,258. The achievement of the CNN-LSTM algorithm had the highest coefficient of determination, obtaining a score of R2 = 0,96. The proven deep learning techniques made it possible to predict the precision irrigation prescription in the studied potato crop, significantly improving the management of water resources.

In China, maize is the most important staple food crop, and Northeast China is one of the main maize-growing regions. Regional maize production in Northeast China is critical for national or even global food security. In order to take preventive measures in combating the potential impacts of climate change on maize yield, it is imperative to evaluate historical climatic maize yield variation at finer scales in Northeast China. Previous scholars have achieved some good results in crop yield projection by using machine learning methods. However, climatic crop yield variation has rarely been addressed by considering the geographical factors (i.e., elevation, latitude, and longitude) of the meteorological stations used. In this study, based on 18 climatic elements during the period of 2003–2016, we compared the performance of three machine leaching methods, including neural network, support vector machine, and random forest, with multiple linear regression in evaluating climatic maize yield variation. Overall, machine learning methods are superior to traditional multilinear regression, particularly the neural network (with an R2 of 0.43 and an annual average MAE of 1.22 ton·ha−1). We selected the best machine learning methods and used the Bayesian method to integrate them as a new model. The Bayesian method reduced the evaluation error (i.e., RMSE and MAE) and improved the estimation accuracy. By addressing the uncertainty in the meteorological stations, our newly built model could be extended to other regions for evaluating climatic crop yield variation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climatic yield variation; Historical evaluation; Machine learning methods; Maize","Bayesian networks; Climate change; Crops; Decision trees; Food supply; Support vector machines; Bayesian methods; Climatic yield variation; Crop yield; Historical evaluation; Machine learning methods; Maize; Maize yield; Meteorological station; Neural-networks; Northeast China; Linear regression; accuracy assessment; Bayesian analysis; climate change; crop yield; machine learning; maize; numerical model; China",Article,Scopus

To overcome this challenge, the final yield was predicted by combining vegetation indices (VIs) to sense the health status of the crop and by computer vision to obtain the vegetated fraction cover (Fc) as a measure of plant vigour. Multispectral imagery obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is used to obtain VIs and Fc, which are used together with artificial neural networks (ANN) to model the relationship between VIs, Fc and yield. The proposed methodology was applied in a vineyard, where different irrigation and fertilisation doses were applied. The results showed that using computer vision techniques to differentiate between canopy and soil is necessary in precision viticulture to obtain accurate results. In addition, the combination of VIs (reflectance approach) and Fc (geometric approach) to predict vineyard yield results in higher accuracy (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.9 kg vine−1 and relative error (RE) = 21.8% for the image when close to harvest) compared to the simple use of VIs (RMSE = 1.2 kg vine−1 and RE = 28.7%). The implementation of machine learning techniques resulted in much more accurate results than linear models (RMSE = 0.5 kg vine−1 and RE = 12.1%). More precise yield predictions were obtained when images were taken close to the harvest date, although promising results were obtained at earlier stages. Given the perennial nature of grapevines and the multiple environmental and endogenous factors determining yield, seasonal calibration for yield prediction is required. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Deficit irrigation; k-means algorithm; NIR; Red-edge; RGB ortho-images; Unmanned aerial vehicles; Vitis vinifera","artificial neural network; computer vision; crop yield; cropping practice; estimation method; machine learning; prediction; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spectral analysis; vegetation cover; vigor; vineyard; Vitis vinifera",Article,Scopus

Accurate and timely estimation of corn yield is therefore essential for commodity trading and global food security. Recently, several deep learning models have been explored for corn yield forecasting. Despite success, most existing models only provide yield estimations without quantifying the uncertainty associated with the predictions. Also, the traditional deep learning approaches typically require a large training set and are easily prone to overfitting when the number of samples in the training set is relatively small. To address these limitations, in this study, we developed a county-level corn yield prediction model based on Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) using multiple data sources that are publicly available, including time-series satellite products, sequential climate observations, soil property maps, and historical corn yield records. Using preceding years since 2001 for model training, the developed BNN model achieved an average coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.77 for late-season prediction across the U.S. Corn Belt in testing years 2010–2019, and outperformed five other state-of-the-art machine learning models. Detailed evaluation in three representative testing years demonstrated that the proposed BNN model could accurately estimate corn yield not only in normal years but also in abnormal years when extreme weather events happened. Moreover, the timeliness of the prediction was evaluated within the growing season with an R2~0.75 achieved by middle August, which is about 2 months before the harvest. We also assessed the predictive uncertainty, and more than 84% of the observed yield records were successfully enveloped in the 95% confidence interval of the predictive yield distribution. Our results also showed that the uncertainty level decreased steadily as time proceeded and stabilized around early August. Uncertainties in yield prediction were mainly induced by the observation noise and also related to the interannual and seasonal variabilities of environmental stress such as heat and water stress. This paper provides a robust framework for the within-season prediction of crop yield and highlights the need to obtain a deeper understanding of the effects of environmental stress on agricultural productivity and crop yield estimation. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Bayesian neural network; Corn yield prediction; Deep learning; Remote sensing; Uncertainty estimation","Bayesian networks; Climate models; Crops; Deep neural networks; Financial markets; Food supply; Forecasting; Productivity; Uncertainty analysis; Yield stress; Bayesian neural networks; Corn yield prediction; Corn yields; Deep learning; Remote-sensing; Training sets; Uncertainty; Uncertainty estimation; Yield estimation; Yield prediction; Remote sensing; artificial neural network; Bayesian analysis; crop yield; estimation method; extreme event; food security; maize; numerical model; remote sensing; uncertainty analysis",Article,Scopus

We redesign our CNN architecture under the Deep Ensemble framework, so the predictive model outputs a probability distribution instead of a single value. Then, a gradient-based optimization algorithm uses this model to find the maps of crop inputs that maximize the expected net revenue while satisfying risk constraints. We show that the new model not only provides uncertainty quantification but also increases the predicted performance of its former version. Experiments with the optimization algorithm show an increase up to 6.4% in the expected net revenue when compared with the status quo management, and provide a flexible setup to match different levels of risk aversion. © 2020 The Authors","Convolutional neural network; Deep ensemble; Deep learning; On-farm research; Risk-averse optimization; Yield modeling","Agricultural robots; Convolution; Crops; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Optimization; Predictive analytics; Probability distributions; Risk analysis; Risk perception; Uncertainty analysis; Gradient based optimization algorithms; Optimization algorithms; Predicted performance; Predictive modeling; Risk aversion; Risk constraints; Uncertainty quantifications; Yield prediction; Convolutional neural networks; algorithm; artificial neural network; crop yield; management practice; optimization; risk assessment; risk perception",Article,Scopus

Rainfall prediction is the usage of science and innovation to anticipate the condition of the environment. Therefore, in order to create precise results of rainfall and weather forecasting, a few techniques have been produced. This paper presents an effective rainfall prediction technique namely Adaptive Moment Optimization (AMO) based Long Short-term Memory Neural Network (LSTM-NN) in the big data environment. The AMO is used to find the relevant features for rainfall prediction and LSTM is used to predict the rainfall. Here, LSTM-NN based AMO technique is proposed to perform the prediction of rainfall.

Machine learning algorithms have materialized in soil fertility prediction as an encouraging method for enhancing production.

Rainfall, temperature (minimum and maximum), evaporation, average wind speed (morning and evening), and sunshine hours are the climatic factors considered for modeling. Rice harvest and yield data over the last three decades and monthly climatic data were used to develop the prediction model by applying artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machine regression (SVMR), multiple linear regression (MLR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), power regression (PR), and robust regression (RR). The performance of each model was assessed in terms of the mean squared error (MSE), correlation coefficient (R), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean squared error ratio (RSR), BIAS value, and the Nash number, and it was found that the GPR-based model is the most accurate among them.

Identification of best parent combinations for crossing is challenging since the total number of possible cross combinations of parents is large and it is impractical to test all possible cross combinations due to limited resources of time and budget. In the 2020 Syngenta Crop Challenge, Syngenta released several large datasets that recorded the historical yield performances of around 4% of total cross combinations of 593 inbreds with 496 testers which were planted in 280 locations between 2016 and 2018 and asked participants to predict the yield performance of cross combinations of inbreds and testers that have not been planted based on the historical yield data collected from crossing other inbreds and testers.

Remote sensing-based platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) show promise to predict different traits including grain yield. Attention is currently being devoted to machine learning methods in order to extract the most meaningful information from the massive amounts of data generated by UAV images. These methods have shown a promising capability to come up with nonlinearity and explore patterns beyond the human ability. This study investigates the application of two different machine learning based regressor methods to predict wheat grain yield using extracted vegetation indices from UAV images. The goal of the study was to investigate the strength of Support Vector Regression (SVR) in combination with Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) for grain yield prediction and compare the results with LASSO regressor with an internal feature selector. Models were tested on grain yield data from 600 plots of spring wheat planted in South-Eastern Norway in 2018. Five spectral bands along with three different vegetation indices; the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) were extracted from multispectral images at three dates between heading and maturity of the plants. These features for each field trial plot at each date were used as input data for the SVR model. The best model hyperparameters were estimated using grid search. Based on feature selection results from both methods, NDVI showed the highest prediction ability for grain yield at all dates and its explanatory power increased toward maturity, while adding MTCI and EVI at earlier stages of grain filling improved model performance. Combined models based on all indices and dates explained up to 90% of the variation in grain yield on the test set. Inclusion of individual bands added collinearity to the models and did not improve the predictions. Although both regression methods showed a good capability for grain yield prediction, LASSO regressor proved to be more affordable and economical in terms of time. © 2021 The Author(s)","LASSO; Machine learning; SFS (Sequential Forward Selection); Support Vector Regression (SVR); Wheat phenotyping; Yield","Antennas; Data mining; Forecasting; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Aerial vehicle; Grain yield; LASSO; Machine-learning; Sequential forward selection; Support vector regression; Wheat phenotyping; Yield; Yield prediction; Grain (agricultural product); crop yield; machine learning; MERIS; NDVI; plant breeding; regression analysis; satellite imagery; spring (hydrology); spring (season); support structure; support vector machine; wheat; Norway",Article,Scopus

It is a well-known fact that climate change has been accelerated over the past decades due to various human induced activities. In addition, demand for the food is increasing day-by-day due to the rapid growth of population. Therefore, understanding the relationships between climatic factors and paddy production has become crucial for the sustainability of the agriculture sector. However, these relationships are usually complex nonlinear relationships. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are extensively used in obtaining these complex, nonlinear relationships. However, these relationships are not yet obtained in the context of Sri Lanka; a country where its staple food is rice. Therefore, this research presents an attempt in obtaining the relationships between the paddy yield and climatic parameters for several paddy grown areas (Ampara, Batticaloa, Badulla, Bandarawela, Hambantota, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, and Puttalam) with available data. Three training algorithms (Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), Bayesian Regularization (BR), and Scaled Conjugated Gradient (SCG)) are used to train the developed neural network model, and they are compared against each other to find the better training algorithm. Correlation coefficient (R) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) were used as the performance indicators to evaluate the performance of the developed ANN models. The results obtained from this study reveal that LM training algorithm has outperformed the other two algorithms in determining the relationships between climatic factors and paddy yield with less computational time. In addition, in the absence of seasonal climate data, annual prediction process is understood as an efficient prediction process. However, the results reveal that there is an error threshold in the prediction. Nevertheless, the obtained results are stable and acceptable under the highly unpredicted climate scenarios. The ANN relationships developed can be used to predict the future paddy yields in corresponding areas with the future climate data from various climate models. © 2020 Vinushi Amaratunga et al.",,"Agricultural robots; Climate models; Complex networks; Forecasting; Mean square error; Neural networks; Population statistics; Bayesian regularization; Correlation coefficient; Efficient predictions; Levenberg-Marquardt; Neural network model; Non-linear relationships; Performance indicators; Seasonal climate data; Climate change",Article,Scopus

Early prediction of crop performance can reduce this constraint by allowing breeders more time to focus on the highest-performing varieties. Here, we present a multimodal deep learning model for predicting the performance of maize (Zea mays) at an early developmental stage, offering the potential to accelerate crop breeding. We employed multispectral images and eight vegetation indices, collected by an uncrewed aerial vehicle approximately 60 days after sowing, over three consecutive growing cycles (2017, 2018 and 2019). The multimodal deep learning approach was used to integrate field management and genotype information with the multispectral data, providing context to the conditions that the plants experienced during the trial. Model performance was assessed using holdout data, in which the model accurately predicted the yield (RMSE 1.07 t/ha, a relative RMSE of 7.60% of 16 t/ha, and R2 score 0.73) and identified the majority of high-yielding varieties, outperforming previously published models for early yield prediction. The inclusion of vegetation indices was important for model performance, with a normalized difference vegetation index and green with normalized difference vegetation index contributing the most to model performance.

It is almost used in every domains. Every year crops growth is reduced due to lack of climatic conditions and inadequate of nutrients supports. Soil fertility is the most important factor to be considered while growing a crop. The measurement of Soil nutrients is required for a better plant growth. All soils are not suitable for all types of crops. In this work, the proposed mechanism is to effectively predict the crop which is suitable to that soil. Conventional soli testing process uses chemicals to test the soil fertility and it is a time taken process. This issue has been resolved by proposing a mechanism that monitors by taking all the parameters into account that can predict the crop by depending upon the pH, moisture, temperature and humidity values. The main objective of this work is that it produces accurate and reliable results and also cost-effective when compared to other existing mechanisms. It helps the farmer to analyze the fertility of their field and plant the better crop to increase their productivity and profit. © 2020 IEEE.","Crop prediction; moisture; pH; soil fertility; temperature and humidity","Cost effectiveness; Crops; Forecasting; Internet of things; Nutrients; Soil testing; Climatic conditions; Cost effective; Plant growth; Reliable results; Soil fertility; Soil nutrients; Temperature and humidities; Testing process; Soils",Conference Paper,Scopus

On the business side, rural area has a disadvantage in the competitiveness with the region near the huge market by the transportation cost. To increase competitiveness, the countryside has adopted greenhouse cultivation to maximize the winter crop yield when there is a low yield near the metropolitan area. In addition, most of the farming environments are set up and manipulated by farmers for themselves. Consequently, they need not only knowledge about farming but also Information and Communication Technology (ICT) ability to be able to understand information. However, it is inefficient for new farmers to acquire both ICT skills and agricultural knowledge, so recent smart farms use AI technology to analyze obtained data. As a first step, to provide expertise and support for new farmers, we propose a method to predict the optimal harvest date of eggplant combining past pattern and future feature variables. That is because estimating accurate harvest date is important for crops that have a short period of optimum size, weight or quality. The proposed model is composed of pattern analysis and solar radiation prediction models, and it forecasts the growth rate as a crop's response. We evaluated several methods and the result shows that the proposed method is an efficient tool for predicting the optimal harvest date in IoT-enabled smart greenhouse. This method can contribute to providing specialized and useful information for inexperienced farmers.

Commonly used approaches for crop prediction include but are not limited to conducting extensive manual surveys or using data from remote sensing. Considering the increasing amount of data provided by remote sensing imagery, this approach is becoming increasingly important for the task of crop yield forecasting and there is a need for more sophisticated approaches to extract the inherent spatiotemporal patterns of these data. Although considerable progress has been made in this field by using Deep Learning (DL) methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), no study before has investigated the use of Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) for crop yield forecasting.

Previous studies mainly focused on the whole crop growth period while different time windows on yield prediction were still unknown. The entire growth period was separated into each month to assess their corresponding predictive ability by taking maize production (silage and grain) in Czechia. We present a thorough assessment of county-level maize yield prediction in Czechia using a machine learning algorithm (extreme learning machine (ELM)) and an extensive set of weather data and maize yields from 2002 to 2018. Results show that sunshine in June and water deficit in July were vastly influential factors for silage maize yield. The two primary climate parameters for grain maize yield are minimum temperature in September and water deficit in May. The average absolute relative deviation (AARD), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient (R2) of the proposed models are 6.565–32.148%, 1.006–1.071%, 0.641–0.716, respectively. Based on the results, silage yield will decrease by 1.367 t/ha (3.826% loss), and grain yield will increase by 0.337 t/ha (5.394% increase) when the max temperature in May increases by 2◦C.

Irregular or aperiodic variations of different WQ variables can influence the growth, survival, and yield of aquatic livestock in the ponds. In this research, WQ and harvest data collected from an Australian prawn farm over a whole grow-out season is used to investigate how the variations of WQ influence the harvest outcome of prawns from the ponds. We present a set of approaches based on machine learning to: (i) understand the effect of five WQ variables in differentiating high and low performing ponds (in terms for harvest performance); and (ii) identify how the variations in these WQ variables over the grow-out season contributed to final harvest outcome (growth and yield). To develop the ponds classification approach, we apply eight different machine learning classifiers: neural networks, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbours, logistic regression, gaussian naïve bayes, decision tree, random forest, and AdaBoost. To identify the driving factors (in terms of variations of WQ) that affect growth and yield of aquatic livestock in ponds, we apply three feature selection methods: mutual information, correlation-based feature selection, and ReliefF. Results demonstrate that dissolved oxygen, salinity, and temperature are the three WQ variables that have the greatest influence on overall harvest performance of the ponds. Changes in dissolved oxygen and salinity in the last quarter of the grow-out season, and variations of temperature immediately after stocking contributed the most to differentiate the high and low performing ponds. © 2021","Aquaculture farming; Machine learning; Sensor data analytics; Water quality","Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Dissolved oxygen; Harvesting; Lakes; Logistic regression; Nearest neighbor search; Ponds; Shellfish; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Water quality; Classification approach; Feature selection methods; Freshwater pond; Growth and yield; Influence of water; K-nearest neighbours; Machine learning approaches; Mutual informations; Learning systems",Article,Scopus

In the horticultural industry, the environmental conditions in commercial greenhouses directly impact the quality of productions. Predicting the Net Photosynthesis (Pn) of plants based on the environmental parameters can help growers optimize the climate in greenhouse systems, thereby ensuring the quality of production. Meanwhile, due to the greenhouse climate can be controlled according to the prediction results, excess energy consumption can be avoided, so the production cost can be reduced. However, since the photosynthesis reaction is a highly nonlinear biochemical process, it is difficult for traditional algorithms to describe the hidden effects of individual elements. In previous related works, polynomial fitting was utilized for modeling the relation between Pn and environmental elements. In this paper, a Deep Learning (DL) method is explored to predict the Pn based on three inputs: light level, CO2 concentration and temperature. An exponential decay learning rate is applied in the training process to ensure convergence performance while increasing the convergence speed. Then, the performance of various Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures is experimented and compared within this modeling problem. Finally, through a comprehensive analysis of the accuracy of individual architecture, a particular architecture is determined to solve this problem. According to the test results, the selected DNN can successfully predict the Pn based on the three environmental elements with high accuracy. © 2021 IEEE.","Commercial greenhouse; Deep Learning (DL); Deep Neural Network (DNN); Modeling; Net photosynthesis (Pn)","Biochemistry; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Greenhouses; Network architecture; Photosynthesis; Biochemical process; Commercial greenhouse; Deep learning; Deep neural network; Environmental factors; Horticultural industry; Modeling; Net photosynthesis; Plant growth; Quality of production; Deep neural networks",Conference Paper,Scopus

However, those results are more helpful for market traders than producers and agricultural policy regulators because any structural change in that field requires a while to be implemented. The mid and long-term predictions (from one year and more) of production and market demand seem more helpful. However, this problem requires considering long-term dependencies between various features. The most natural way of analyzing all those features together is with deep neural networks. The paper presents neural network models for mid-term forecasting of crop production and export, which considers heterogeneous features such as trade flows, production levels, macroeconomic indicators, fuel pricing, and vegetation indexes. They also utilize text-mining to assess changes in the news flow related to the state agricultural policy, sanctions, and the context in the local and international food markets. We collected and combined data from various local and international providers such as UN FAOSTAT, UN Comtrade, social media, the International Monetary Fund for 15 of the world’s top wheat exporters. The experiments show that the proposed models with additive regularization can accurately predict grain export and production levels. We also confirmed that vegetation indexes and fuel prices are crucial for export prediction. Still, the fuel prices seem to be more important for predicting production than the NDVI indexes from past observations. © 2021 by the authors.

We examine factors influencing producers’ WTP for broadband upload and download speed using a conditional logit model. In the evaluation of WTP for broadband, producers were willing to pay on average $1.07 to $1.34 per Mbps (megabits per second) of upload speed, compared to $0.02 to $0.03 per Mbps of download speed.

While the agronomic factors are responsible for inter-region variations in yield, the year-wise yield variation in a particu-lar region may be attributed to meteorological factors. Various Data Mining Techniques can be applied to analyse the effect of these factors on crop yield. Objective: To develop a model for prediction of Block-wise average wheat yield in the Patiala district of Punjab, India. Methods: Sampling is used for the collection of the yield data, and the data concerning temperature and rainfall is obtained from the Indian Meteorological Department, Pune. The data is then pre-processed and analysed to study the effect of phase-wise average temperature and total rainfall on the wheat yield. The factors that are found to significantly affect yield are used for building a model for yield prediction. Results: It has been found that the average temperature and the total rainfall for the whole wheat growing season are not much of help in explaining the variations in yearly wheat yield. The temperature and rainfall have different effects at different stages of plant growth and the yield is affected ac-cordingly. It is inferred that the average temperature and the total rainfall during the vegetative phase and the grain development and ripening phase are the most important parameters for the prediction of wheat yield. Conclusion: The stepwise selection mechanism is used to choose the variables whose inclusion ex-plains the maximum variance in yield. The model is evaluated based on different parameters and is found to explain 95.6% of the yearly variations in yield. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.","Effect of rainfall on yield; Effect of temperature on yield; Moderation analysis; Prediction models; Wheat; Yield prediction","Agronomy; Crops; Data mining; Forecasting; Rain; Effect of rainfall on yield; Effect of temperature on yield; Effects of rainfalls; Effects of temperature; Moderation analyse; Prediction modelling; Total rainfall; Wheat; Wheat yield; Yield prediction; Temperature",Article,Scopus

This can be done by transferring the learning among similar FP with minimal retraining. Hence, Transfer Learning (TL) is used in this work amongst berries which are similar in nature. First, the proposed DL model is trained using station-based data and satellite images as inputs mapped to the strawberry yield as output. The weights obtained from this learning are transferred to the raspberry yield forecasting model since raspberry and strawberry yields are similar and are both planted in California. The proposed model is an ensemble of two models: the station-based ensemble model (ATT-CNN-LSTM-SeriesNet_Ens) with its compound DL components, SeriesNet with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Convolutional Neural Network LSTM with Attention layer (Att-CNN-LSTM); trained and tested using station-based data as input and the corresponding strawberry yields as output.

The weights obtained are transferred to the raspberry yield forecasting ensemble model with minimal retraining. It is found that the voting ensemble improves performance by 27% compared to the best performing component model.

Most crop estimation methods can be divided into two categories, one is based on the crop model and the other is the statistical learning method. For statistical learning methods with recent advances in deep learning, convolutional neural network (CNN) have become state-of-the-art algorithms. can extract the depth-dependent features of crop growth. However, the pivotal challenge is to combine remote sensing images with CNN. In this paper, we employ the method of histogram dimensionality reduction and time series fusion to generate the input layer. The experiment firstly performed projection transformation, splicing, mask, fusion, and clipping for 6 different MODIS images in the research area from 2006 to 2016, and then generated 21 600 fusion images of 12 bands (surface reflectance data of 7 different wavelengths in MOD09A1, surface temperature of day and night in MYD11A2, NDVI and EVI in MOD13A1, and FPAR in MOD15A2H). Then, the sensitivity range of winter wheat growth in each band is divided into 36 sections, and the histogram statistics are used to reduce the dimension to generate a vector of length 36, so the remote sensing image generates a matrix of 36×36×12 in the 228-day growing season. The corresponding time and regional statistics are applied as the output layer to construct a complete sample. The yield estimation sample database of 12 indices in the winter wheat region of north China (60 prefecture-level cities) from 2006 to 2016 was constructed, and the training set and verification set were divided into 10:1 for the training and evaluation of yield estimation model. Finally, the neural network structure is designed according to the sample, which consists of the input layer, 7 convolution layers (c1-c7), 7 activation layers, 7 batch normalization layers, 3 dropout layers, 2 full connection layers, and output layer. The number of c1-c7 convolution kernels is 64, 64, 128, 128, 256, 256, 256, the convolution kernel size is 3×3 dpi, and the sliding step length is 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1 and 2 respectively, 1 zero paddings per convolutional layer. At the same time, batch normalization and Relu function activation are performed on each convolutional layer, and the Dropout layer is used in the fully connected layer. The results show that: 1) The root-mean-square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) of the convolutional neural network model on the training set are 183.82 kg/hm2 and 0.98 respectively. In the validation set, RMSE and R2 are 689.72 kg/hm2 and 0.71. 2) With the same neural network structure, the average RMSE of the estimated samples from 2006 to 2016 trained as validation sets for 11 models was 772.03 kg/hm2. The error of the yield estimation model was the largest in 2007 and the smallest in 2012, and the RMSE was 920.45 kg/hm2 and 632.08 kg/hm2 respectively. Crop estimation algorithm based on CNN has high robustness and precision; 3) The accuracy analysis of prediction yield at the municipal level of different provinces in three temporal points of 2007, 2012 and 2016 indicates that the model has higher accuracy in most areas of the northern winter wheat region, especially, RMSE of Hebei and Shandong provinces is approximately 500 kg/hm2. The result shows that CNN is well applied to the estimation of winter wheat production. This is a great thought of remote sensing combined with the deep learning algorithm. This method can be used to estimate yield by remote sensing in different scales and regions. Compared with the traditional method, this ""start-to-end"" learning method has the advantage of synergy and can obtain the optimal estimation model relative to the whole area. Meanwhile, As data accumulates, the estimation accuracy will be continuously improved, and it has a good application prospect in the national agricultural production forecast. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

We evaluate the predictive power of deep learning, benchmarking its performance against more conventional approaches alongside both weather station and climate. Our findings reveal that deep learning offers the highest predictive accuracy, outperforming all the other approaches.

In India, agriculture is largely influenced by many factors which are unpredictable. One of those factors is Soil moisture, which is a key variable in controlling the exchange of water and heat energy between the land surface and the atmosphere through evaporation and plant transpiration. Hence, it plays an important role in the development of weather patterns and the production of precipitation. Agriculture productivity mainly depends on quality of soil, which is dependent on factors like soil moisture and pH values. The proposed project increases the productivity of the crop by determining the quality of soil by using pH values (a measure of acidity or alkalinity of water soluble substances), This work presents a system in which data analytics techniques are used in order to predict the most profitable crop in the current soil conditions. The proposed system uses few sensors that are connectedto a microcontroller and these sensors are inserted into the soil for retrieving the values. Now these values are stored in different devices which are connected to the WiFi modem around it. And then they are compared with the different pH values and analysis is done using KNN and Naïve bayes. Thus After the analysis, we conclude which type of crop can be harvested in which type of particular soil. Doing this, we can improve the crop yield productivity and increase the profit margin of farmer helping them over a longer run. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

The ITU-T Recommendation for Smart Farming (Y.4450/Y.2238) defines plan/production consultation service at the preproduction stage; this type of service must trace crop production in a predictive way. Several research papers present that machine learning technology can be applied to predict crop production after related data are learned, but these technologies have little to do with standardized ICT services.

Instead of pursuing the maximum yield, most turfgrass managers use nitrogen (N) to maintain a sub-maximal growth rate. Few tools or soil tests exist to help managers guide N fertilizer decisions. Turf growth prediction models have the potential to be useful, but the currently existing turf growth prediction model only takes temperature into account, limiting its accuracy. This study developed machine-learning-based turf growth models using the random forest (RF) algorithm to estimate short-term turfgrass clipping yield. To build the RF model, a large set of variables were extracted as predictors including the 7-day weather, traffic intensity, soil moisture content, N fertilization rate, and the normalized difference red edge (NDRE) vegetation index. In this study, the data were collected from two putting greens where the turfgrass received 0 to 1,800 round/week traffic rates, various irrigation rates to maintain the soil moisture content between 9 and 29%, and N fertilization rates of 0 to 17.5 kg ha–1 applied biweekly. The RF model agreed with the actual clipping yield collected from the experimental results. The temperature and relative humidity were the most important weather factors. Including NDRE improved the prediction accuracy of the model. The highest coefficient of determination (R2) of the RF model was 0.64 for the training dataset and was 0.47 for the testing data set upon the evaluation of the model. This represented a large improvement over the existing growth prediction model (R2 = 0.01). However, the machine-learning models created were not able to accurately predict the clipping production at other locations. Individual golf courses can create customized growth prediction models using clipping volume to eliminate the deviation caused by temporal and spatial variability. Overall, this study demonstrated the feasibility of creating machine-learning-based yield prediction models that may be able to guide N fertilization decisions on golf course putting greens and presumably other turfgrass areas. © Copyright © 2021 Zhou and Soldat.","machine learning; nitrogen management; random forest; turfgrass; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

As these variables are important to developing an overall precision farming model, we propose a machine learning approach to predict DM, PH, and GY for soybean cultivars based on multispectral bands. The field experiment considered 524 genotypes of soybeans in the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 growing seasons and a multitemporal–multispectral dataset collected by embedded sensor in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We proposed a multilayer deep learning regression network, trained during 2000 epochs using an adaptive subgradient method, a random Gaussian initialization, and a 50% dropout in the first hidden layer for regularization. Three different scenarios, including only spectral bands, only vegetation indices, and spectral bands plus vegetation indices, were adopted to infer each variable (PH, DM, and GY). The DL model performance was compared against shallow learning methods such as random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and linear regression (LR). The results indicate that our approach has the potential to predict soybean-related variables using multispectral bands only. Both DL and RF models presented a strong (r surpassing 0.77) prediction capacity for the PH variable, regardless of the adopted input variables group. Our results demonstrated that the DL model (r = 0.66) was superior to predict DM when the input variable was the spectral bands. For GY, all machine learning models evaluated presented similar performance (r ranging from 0.42 to 0.44) for each tested scenario. In conclusion, this study demonstrated an efficient approach to a computational solution capable of predicting multiple important soybean crop variables based on remote sensing data. Future research could benefit from the information presented here and be implemented in subsequent processes related to soybean cultivars or other types of agronomic crops. © 2021 by the authors.

Understanding and quantifying the temporal cumulative effect of crop growth and spatial variances across different regions remains challenging for large-scale crop yield estimation. In this study, a deep spatial-temporal learning framework, named DeepCropNet (DCN), has been developed to hierarchically capture the features for county-level corn yield estimation. The temporal features are learned by an attention-based long short-term memory network and the spatial features are learned by the multi-task learning (MTL) output layers. The DCN model has been applied to quantify the relationship between meteorological factors and the county-level corn yield in the US Corn Belt from 1981 to 2016. Three meteorological factors, including growing degree days, killing degree days, and precipitation, are used as time-series inputs. The results show that DCN provides an improved estimation accuracy (RMSE = 0.82 Mg ha-1) as compared to that of conventional methods such as LASSO (RMSE = 1.14 Mg ha-1) and Random Forest (RMSE = 1.05 Mg ha-1). Temporally, the attention values computed from the temporal learning module indicate that DCN captures the temporal cumulative effect and this temporal pattern is consistent across all states. Spatially, the spatial learning module improves the estimation accuracy based on the regional specific features captured by the MTL mechanism. The study highlights that the DCN model provides a promising spatial-temporal learning framework for corn yield estimation under changing meteorological conditions across large spatial regions. © 2020 The Author(s).

Farmers and their advisors want user-friendly decision support tools for predicting yield. Simulation models can be used to accurately predict yield, but they are complex and difficult to parameterise. The goal of this study is to build a simple and parsimonious model for predicting wheat yields that can be implemented in a decision tool to be used by farmers at a paddock level. A large yield data set accumulated from trials on commonly grown varieties in Western Australia is used to build and validate a generalised additive model (GAM) for predicting wheat yield. Explanatory variables tested included weather data and derivatives, geolocation, soil type, land capability, and wheat varieties. Model selection followed a forward stepwise approach in combination with cross-validation to select the smallest set of explanatory variables. The predictive performance is also evaluated using independent data. The final model uses seasonal water availability, location and year to predict wheat yield. Because the GAM model has minimal inputs, it can be easily employed in a decision tool to predict yield throughout the growing season using rainfall data up to the prediction date and either climatological averages or seasonal forecasts of rainfall for the remainder of the growing season. It also has the potential to be used as an input to agronomic models that predict the effect on yield of various management choices for fertiliser, pest, weed and disease management. © 2019","Crop modelling; Crop water relations; Decision support; Precision farming; Waterlogging; Yield prediction","agricultural management; agricultural modeling; crop production; crop yield; decision support system; farming system; growing season; implementation process; model validation; numerical model; parameterization; plant water relations; precision agriculture; prediction; rainfall; water use efficiency; waterlogging; wheat; yield response; Australia; Western Australia; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Inadequate and overdose of fertiliser leads to nutrient deficiency and lesser yield of crops. Rice has a unique fertiliser recommendation based on climatic conditions and soil types but the issue is the random use of fertilisers by the farmer, without knowing their own land soil nutrition. Soil consists of primary nutrients and secondary nutrients. This supplement is used for crop growth.

These local farmers contribute towards food security and they are part of organic food producers here in South Africa since most of them relied only on natural resources to grow crops. However, many technological developments are not paying enough attention on them. They are not equipped with irrigation systems and agricultural machineries to help with cropping. Most of them are technological and educationally semi-literate and financially volatile. Because of rapid increase and unpredictability of climate, these local farmers are severely suffering. They are constantly experiencing poor crop yield because of season transition variations caused by climate change. Due to these variations, it becomes difficult for farmers to spot the onset of agricultural season to enable good establishment of crops. A transition to agricultural season can be foreseen by using indigenous knowledge indicators and observing the movement of temperature and vegetation cover. During the onset of the warm agricultural season, healthy vegetation cover increases as the temperature increases and vis-versa during the onset of the cold agricultural season. This is because many plants are vulnerable to cold temperature.

People are encountering lot of problems in the field of agriculture. Even today in India in many places traditional way of farming is being practiced which requires human intervention. Due to technological advanced the present people are interested towards smart irrigation system than traditional farming. Due to lack of time people are not able to spend time in traditional farming, to assist the people who are in urban and metropolitan cities, Hydroponic farming, an approach of smart irrigation system is implemented in this paper. In the traditional framing technique water and space is abundantly required, this irrigation approach minimizes the use of water and reduces the space. This proposed work aims to build an automated irrigation farming system that incorporates the data from all the sensors connected to the Raspberry pi and transferred to IoT server through the network. Meanwhile the data stored data can be read to know the status of the system by the user on web based application. Knowing the status of the system the user can turn on/off the motor to water the system when required. The plants growth can be predicted by collecting the data of sensor readings using machine learning technique. © 2020 IEEE.","automated irrigation; Hydroponic; machine learning","Agricultural robots; Data Science; Developing countries; Irrigation; Learning systems; Farming system; Human intervention; Irrigation systems; Machine learning techniques; Metropolitan cities; Sensor readings; Web-based applications; Internet of things",Conference Paper,Scopus

The proposed machine learning model was based on an artificial neural network (ANN) and used three types of crop features derived from UAS data to predict the yield, namely; multi-temporal features including canopy cover, canopy height, canopy volume, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), excessive greenness index (ExG); non-temporal features including cotton boll count, boll size and boll volume, and irrigation status as a qualitative feature. The model provided low residual values with predicted yield values close to the observed yield values (R2 ~ 0.9). ANN model performance was compared with support vector regression (SVR) and random forest regression (RFR). Comparison results revealed that ANN model outperforms SVR and RFR. Additionally, redundant features were removed using correlation analysis, and an optimal subset of features was obtained that included canopy volume, ExG, boll count, boll volume and irrigation status. Moreover, the relative significance of each feature in the optimal input feature subset was determined using sensitivity analysis. It was found that canopy volume and ExG contributed around 50% towards the corresponding yield. Finally, further analysis was performed to investigate how early in the growing season the model can accurately predict yield. It was observed that even at 70 days after planting the model predicted yield with reasonable accuracy (R2 of 0.72 over test set). This study revealed that UAS derived multi-temporal data along with non-temporal and qualitative data can be combined within a machine learning framework to provide a reliable estimation of crop yield and provide effective understanding for crop management. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Several researchers have investigated cropping operations’ role in mycotoxin contamination, but these findings were inconclusive, precluding their use in predictive modeling. In this study a machine learning (ML) approach was considered, which included weather-based mechanistic model predictions for AFLA-maize and FER-maize [predicting aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and fumonisins (FBs), respectively], and cropping system factors as the input variables. The occurrence of AFB1 and FBs in maize fields was recorded, and their corresponding cropping system data collected, over the years 2005–2018 in northern Italy. Two deep neural network (DNN) models were trained to predict, at harvest, which maize fields were contaminated beyond the legal limit with AFB1 and FBs. Both models reached an accuracy &gt;75% demonstrating the ML approach added value with respect to classical statistical approaches (i.e., simple or multiple linear regression models). The improved predictive performance compared with that obtained for AFLA-maize and FER-maize was clearly demonstrated. This coupled to the large data set used, comprising a 13-year time series, and the good results for the statistical scores applied, together confirmed the robustness of the models developed here. © Copyright © 2021 Camardo Leggieri, Mazzoni and Battilani.","aflatoxins; Aspergillus flavus; cropping system; deep learning; fumonisins; Fusarium verticillioides; predictive models","aflatoxin B1; fumonisin; mycotoxin; Article; controlled study; cropping system; cross validation; deep learning; deep neural network; diagnostic accuracy; food safety; kernel method; learning algorithm; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; local field potential; machine learning; maize; nerve cell; nonhuman; prediction; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; support vector machine; validation process",Article,Scopus

They are sensitive to extreme climate events such as drought and flood. Therefore, the assessment of the future production of these crops in an era of climate change is essential. However, current assessment tools are time consuming and require extensive input datasets and expert knowledge. This study is an attempt to provide an alternative tool for prefecture level users using an aggregate Z-index which uses precipitation as an input. A machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) was introduced to build and train the model. Finally, future precipitation projected from Global Climate Models (GCMs) was used as an input to assess the future rice and maize yield variations. This tool outperformed other conventional statistical tools and was especially suitable for assessing extreme cases. Crop yields are significantly affected by drought in the study area. Z-indexes derived from three GCMs on decadal time scales were used for assessing future yield variations. Under the lower emission Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5, average maize yields and rice yields are likely to be reduced by-0.58% and-1.49%, respectively, over the next three decades in Mianyang prefecture compared to the baseline period. Similarly, under the higher emission (RCP) 8.5, maize yields and rice yields may decrease by-0.75% and-1.30%, respectively. This assessment tool can be applied in other locations, providing that datasets are available to meet the user’s needs. © 2020, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang.

Numerous studies proved that traditional econometric techniques face significant challenges in out of sample predictability tests due to model uncertainty and parameter instability. Recent studies introduce several machine learning algorithms to improve time series prediction accuracy. The purpose of this study is to develop a precise wheat production model using artificial neural networks (ANN). A total of 71 years' wheat production data from 1948 to 2018 is divided into training data and test data. The model is trained by using 53 years' data and forecasts the future wheat production for the remaining 14 years. There are 16 indicators used as input variables for wheat production and top ten most important variables highlighted. The findings show, that the model captures much of the trend, and some of the undulations of the original series. The results reveal that the most important features in wheat production includes production prevailing trends, momentum and volatility. © 2019, Sarhad Journal of Agriculture.","Forecasting; Machine learning; Neural networks; Pakistan; Wheat production",,Article,Scopus

Whereas traditional agricultural systems mainly rely on scarce ground-survey data, freely available multi-temporal and multi-spectral remote sensing images are excellent tools to support these vulnerable systems by accurately monitoring and estimating crop yields before harvest. In this context, we introduce the use of Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery, with a medium spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions, to estimate rice crop yields in Nepal as a case study. Firstly, we build a new large-scale rice crop database (RicePAL) composed by multi-temporal S2 and climate/soil data from the Terai districts of Nepal. Secondly, we propose a novel 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) adapted to these intrinsic data constraints for the accurate rice crop yield estimation. Thirdly, we study the effect of considering different temporal, climate and soil data configurations in terms of the performance achieved by the proposed approach and several state-of-the-art regression and CNN-based yield estimation methods. The extensive experiments conducted in this work demonstrate the suitability of the proposed CNN-based framework for rice crop yield estimation in the developing country of Nepal using S2 data. © 2021 by the authors.

The results showed that the simulated values of the VSL and A H A models were in good agreement with the measured values: the square root error (RMSE) of the salinity was 0.757 g • kg-1 and 0.966 g • kg-1, respectively, and the determination coefficient (R2) was 0.977 and 0.964, respectively.

At the same time, this paper further fitted the empirical formula between the ring width (RW) of VSL and its saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) (R2 = 0.99, P&lt;0.01). The empirical formula could be used to determine the model parameters of VSL when the layout of simulated domain and subsurface pipe changes, and the simulation results could be used to guide the layout of subsurface pipe in relevant areas. © 2020 Editorial Department of Agricultural Research in the Arid Areas.

We have used onion weight on growth stages as the response variable and six environmental factors such as average temperature, average ground temperature, rainfall, wind speed, sunshine, and humidity as the explanatory variables in the functional regression model. We then define a least minimum integral squared residual (LMISE) measure to obtain an estimate of the function regression coefficient. In addition, a principal component regression analysis was applied to derive the estimates that minimize the defined measures. Next, to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, data were collected, and the following results were identified through analyses of the collected data. First, through graphical and correlation analysis, the ground temperature, mean temperature, and humidity have a very significant effect on the onion weights, but environmental factors such as wind speed, sunshine, and rainfall have a small negative effect on onion weights. Second, through functional regression analysis, we can determine that the ground temperature, sunshine, and precipitation have a significant effect on onion growth and are essential in the goodness-of-fit test. On the other hand, wind speed, mean temperature, and humidity did not significantly affect onion growth. In conclusion, to promote onion growth, the appropriate ground temperature and amount of sunshine are essential, the rainfall and the humidity must be low, and the appropriate wind or mean temperature must be maintained. © 2020 by the authors.","Agricultural data analysis method; Environmental factors; Functional regression model; Onion weight; Optimum cultivation strategy; R-packages",,Article,Scopus

Machine Learning (ML) is a growing trend in determining yield as a complex function of multiple input variables. Aeroponics is one of the efficient sustainable farming methods and allows all season farming despite hostile outdoors growing environment. In this paper, yield prediction in aeroponics is studied using ML. We have compared and analyzed three popular supervised ML methods - Dense Neural Network (DNN), Random Forest based on decision trees (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Air quality and water quality measurements including temperature, humidity, CO2, pH and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) are used for yield prediction. Other static inputs such as number of days before and after transplant are also used. Six crops are studied (garlic chives, basil, red chard, rainbow chard, arugula, and mint). DNN performs particularly well with the prediction. The root mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R2) are calculated to estimate the efficiency of the method. Mean square error and R2 score of DNN are 0.10 and 0.67, RF follows DNN correctness with MSE and R2 of 0.12 and 0.62, and SVR achieves 0.18 and 0.45 respectively, all of these values over the validation dataset. In addition to individual models, the two top performing models are combined as an ensemble model to improve overall performance, which shows an average R2 score over the whole dataset divided by crop of 0.81. © 2021 IEEE",,"Agricultural robots; Air quality; Crops; Decision trees; Errors; Forecasting; Support vector regression; Water quality; Coefficient of determination; Growing environments; Production management; Root mean square errors; Support vector regression (SVR); Sustainable Farming; Total dissolved solids; Water quality measurement; Mean square error",Conference Paper,Scopus

Most farmers are driven to suicide due to an inability to sell their produce at desired profit levels, which is caused by the widespread uncertainty/fluctuation in produce prices resulting from varying market conditions. To prevent farmer suicides, this paper takes the first step towards resolving the issue of produce price uncertainty by presenting PECAD, a deep learning algorithm for accurate prediction of future produce prices based on past pricing and volume patterns. While previous work presents machine learning algorithms for prediction of produce prices, they suffer from two limitations: (i) they do not explicitly consider the spatio-temporal dependence of future prices on past data; and as a result, (ii) they rely on classical ML prediction models which often perform poorly when applied to spatio-temporal datasets. PECAD addresses these limitations via three major contributions: (i) we gather real-world daily price and (produced) volume data of different crops over a period of 11 years from an official Indian government administered website; (ii) we pre-process this raw dataset via state-of-the-art imputation techniques to account for missing data entries; and (iii) PECAD proposes a novel wide and deep neural network architecture which consists of two separate convolutional neural network models (trained for pricing and volume data respectively).

Research has been carried out in this study into grass growth in the dairy farming sector, specifically within Northern Ireland. Grass growth prediction aims to inform farmers and policy makers in their decision-making process regarding sustainable land management in agriculture. The present work focuses on analysing and evaluating how data-driven classifiers can be used for grass growth prediction using the data related to soil content, weather, grass quality components etc. Four classifiers, namely Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and Neural Networks, are chosen for this purpose. Classification results based on a real-world data set are analysed and compared to evaluate and illustrate the performance and robustness of the classifiers. The results indicate that it is difficult to declare a single classifier with the highest performance and robustness. Nevertheless, it indicates that tree classification methods are better suited to the data to be studied, as opposed to probabilistic methods and weighted methods, e.g., the naïve Bayes classifier obtained a predictive performance of 78% when classifying spring seasonal grass growth data. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change; Data-driven classifier; Grass growth prediction","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Decision making; Decision trees; Forecasting; Forestry; Information management; Knowledge based systems; Land use; Machinery; Agriculture industries; Classification methods; Classification results; Decision making process; Predictive performance; Probabilistic methods; Quality components; Sustainable land managements; Classification (of information)",Conference Paper,Scopus

Therefore it is important to stabilize rice farmers' incomes by giving them appropriate compensation even at the time of adverse weather, e.g. cold summer. In the case of compensating farmers' incomes based on a comparison between the usual yield and estimated yield, an accurate and quick estimation of rice yield is significant to help farmers at the time of disaster. However, a manual survey requires a huge amount of effort and time to investigate all the fields where damage has been declared, especially when a largescale cool summer occurs; therefore, we propose a yield estimation system using satellite images and part of the yield data. Our system provides an accurate and quick yield estimation for the vast extent of the fields at a reasonable cost. Many rice yield estimation methodologies utilizing satellite images have been studied over the years. For example, a crop growth model-based method and deep learning based method that utilize many satellite images taken multiple times at different times have been proposed. Although we can get much information about fields from many satellite images, systems using plural images cost much and need exhaustive calibration before the estimation. Therefore, in this study we propose a yield estimation method using a single image that is taken just before the harvest time. First, we extracted the spectral values from the satellite image using field GIS data and then used a mixed model to perform rice yield estimation. Mixed model is expanded linear regression model and able to take the difference between rice varieties, such as Yumepirika and Nanatsuboshi, into accounts. In addition, we introduced two vegetation indexes, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), into our model as feature values. Generally, NDVI and GNDVI have a positive correlation with the volume of the plant on the field and are used for yield estimation. Of course, we could use machine learning methods, for example random forest and support vector regression. However, we adopted a mixed model considering the explainability of the results and tha fact that the number of input feature values is small. The area of interest is Asahikawa-City, Hokkaido Province, Japan. We demonstrated our method on two datasets and evaluated the performance of our model based on mean absolute error (MAE) using 10-fold cross-validation. One dataset was damaged field data acquired in 2018 (2170 fields). The other was undamaged field data acquired in 2017 (1358 fields). We used RapidEye and SPOT-6 satellite images in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Our experimental results show that our model reduces the MAE of the estimated yield by over 2.5% percent compared to conventional regression methods in each damaged field and undamaged field case. © 2019 SPIE.","Mixed model; NDVI and GNDVI; RapidEye; Rice; SPOT-6; Statistical model; Yield estimation","Agriculture; Decision trees; Deep learning; Ecosystems; Hydrology; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Satellites; Vegetation; Mixed modeling; NDVI and GNDVI; Rapideye; Rice; SPOT-6; Statistical modeling; Yield estimation; Cost estimating",Conference Paper,Scopus

For understanding the unknown environment cognitive architecture has been applied. CA are used to model artificial minds capable of behaving like human (farmer). Recently, Society of Mind Cognitive Architecture (SMCA) has been presented using multi-agent and reinforcement learning technique. However, it is problematic to solve the Markov decision process problem because the Markov decision process has many variables. Further, no prior work has considered such cognitive architecture design for agriculture domain. For overcoming research challenges, this paper presents a Deep Q- Reinforcement Learning (DQRL) cognitive learning technique for SMCA by combining both reinforcement learning and Deep learning method.

Secondly, the remote sensing ensemble model (SIM_CNN-LSTM_Ens), which is an ensemble model of Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM) models, is trained and tested using satellite images of the same county as input mapped to the same yields and prices as output. These two ensembles forecast strawberry yields and prices with minimal forecasting errors and highest model correlation for five weeks ahead forecasts. Finally, the forecasts of these two models are ensembled to have a final forecasted value for yields and prices by introducing a voting ensemble. Based on an aggregated performance measure (AGM), it is found that this voting ensemble not only enhances the forecasting performance by 5% compared to its best performing component model but also outperforms the Deep Learning (DL) ensemble model found in literature by 33% for forecasting yields and 21% for forecasting prices. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Crop growth conditions and yield are related to climate variability and are impacted by extreme events. Remotely sensed time-series could be used to study the variability in crop growth and agricultural production. However, the choice of remotely sensed data and methods is still an issue, as different datasets have different spatiotemporal characteristics. Our primary goal was to test different algorithms and several remotely sensed time-series datasets for yield estimation in U.S. at county and field scale. For a county-level analysis, MODIS-based surface reflectance, Land Surface Temperature, and Evapotranspiration time series were used as input datasets. Field-level analysis was carried out using NASA's Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) product. For this purpose, 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) and CNN followed by long-short term memory (LSTM) were used. For county-level analysis, the CNN-LSTM model had the highest accuracy, with a mean percentage error of 10.3% for maize and 9.6% for soybean. This model presented robust results for the year 2012, which is considered a drought year. In the case of field-level analysis, all models achieved accurate results with R2 exceeding 0.8 when data from mid growing season were used. The results highlight the potential of using satellite data for yield estimation at different management scales. © 2020 IEEE.","crop yield; Landsat; maize; MODIS; neural network; Sentinel-2; soybean; TensorFlow","Agricultural robots; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Food supply; Geology; Land surface temperature; Long short-term memory; NASA; Remote sensing; Time series; Time series analysis; Agricultural productions; Climate variability; Crop growth condition; Remotely sensed data; Satellite images; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Surface reflectance; Yield prediction; Deep learning",Conference Paper,Scopus

It has a predominant role in improving the economic development of our nation. In recent days due to the changes in weather pattern, the crop cultivation has become the greatest challenge. This directly or indirectly affects the productivity of the crops. Hence to overcome from this and to the improve productivity of the crops new technologies can be brought up for usage. The usage of these new technologies will convert traditional farming practices into precision farming. The new technology specified here includes the data analysis and Internet of Things (IoT). As it is revealed that it improves the productivity of the crops by maintaining the finest crop health. Although changes had been adopted in the recent agricultural practices the major issue yet not gets resolved. One such main issue yet to be resolved is cultivating precise crop at the precise time. This can be done with the help of deep learning algorithm such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is found to be an effective one for predicting the precise crop. Hence the proposed system aims at helping the farmers by providing valuable insights to them. These insights can be driven with the help of parameters such as soil moisture level, humidity, temperature and pH collected from the sensors using IoT. In addition to these other parameters include soil type, land type, and the area sown. The crop prediction Graphical User Interface (GUI) system will take these valuable inputs and give suggestions using the crop suggestion user interface. The prediction is made using the Deep Neural Network (DNN) which predicts about the crop to be get cultivated, fertilizer to be used, production range etc. The crop suggestion system greatly helps the farmers to take a valuable decision. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Agriculture; Artificial neural network (ANN); Crop suggestion GUI; Crop suggestion system; Deep learning; Deep neural networks (DNN); IoT; Precision farming; Prediction; Suggestion","Agriculture; Crops; Cultivation; Deep learning; Forecasting; Gradient methods; Graphical user interfaces; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Nanosensors; Neural networks; Photonics; Productivity; Soil moisture; Agricultural practices; Economic development; Farming practices; Gradient descent; Graphical user interfaces (GUI); Internet of Things (IOT); Precision farming; Suggestion; Deep neural networks",Conference Paper,Scopus

Machine learning methods can be used to predict crop yield based on a combination of remote sensing data and data collected by ground weather stations. This paper argues that forecasting drylands farming yield can be reliable for management purpose under uncertain conditions using machine learning methods and remote sensing data and determines which indicators are most important in predicting the yield of chickpea. In this study, the yield of rainfed chickpea farms in 11 top chickpea producing counties in Kermanshah province, Iran, was predicted using three machine learning methods, namely support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). To improve prediction accuracy, for each county, remote sensing data were overlaid by the satellite images of rainfed farms with a suitable slope and altitude for rainfed farming. An integrated database was created by combining weather data, remote sensing data, and chickpea yield statistics. The methods were evaluated using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) technique and compared in terms of multiple measures. Given the sensitivity of rainfed chickpea yield to the time of data, the predictions were made in two scenarios: (1) using the averages of the data of all growing months, and (2) using the data of a combination of months. The results showed that RF provides more accurate yield predictions than other methods. The predictions of this method were 7–8% different from the statistics reported by the Statistical Center and the Ministry of Agriculture of Iran. It was found that for pre-harvest prediction of rainfed chickpea yield, using the data of the March–April period (the averages of two months) offers the best result in terms of the correlation coefficient for the relationship between the yield and the predictor indices. © 2021 by the authors.

For more than a decade, the time series leaf area index (LAI) products obtained from high temporal resolution satellites have been widely used in global crop growth monitoring. However, the spatial resolutions (250–1000 m) of these satellite sensors are too coarse for areas with complex and diverse land-use types, especially in China, which causes great uncertainties in crop growth monitoring and yield estimation results. In addition, due to the influence of clouds, optical remote sensing satellites cannot obtain continuous time series data at a given time step over the main crop growth and development period. In this paper, a method based on spatiotemporal data fusion and singular vector decomposition (SVD) is proposed to reconstruct field-scale time series LAI imagery over the main growth and development period of winter wheat. In this method, the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) is used to fuse the reflectance imagery of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3, and a linear regression model between the LAI data retrieved from the fused reflectance data and the singular vectors derived from the 4-day interval Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI data is established to reconstruct the continuous time series field-scale LAI imagery at a given time step. The accuracy of the reconstructed LAI and its capability for winter wheat yield estimation were tested on the Guanzhong Plain of China. The results indicate that (1) the ESTARFM model can fuse the reflectance bands from visible to shortwave infrared of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 on the Guanzhong Plain accurately within a 20-day interval of the winter wheat growth and development period; (2) the 4-day interval field-scale LAI imagery over the main winter wheat growth and development period can be accurately reconstructed based on the linear regression models between the fused LAI data and the singular vectors derived from the 4-day interval MODIS LAI data; and (3) the yield map estimated from the reconstructed field-scale LAI shows more yield distribution details than MODIS yield estimation results. This study shows the feasibility of reconstructing continuous time series field-scale LAI data over the main winter wheat growth and development period on the Guanzhong Plain by combining the spatiotemporal data fusion model with SVD and the potential for estimating the winter wheat yield at field scales. © 2020 The Authors","Crop yield estimation; Field scale; Singular vector decomposition (SVD); Spatiotemporal data fusion; time series LAI reconstruction","Continuous time systems; Crops; Data fusion; Image enhancement; Land use; Landforms; Radiometers; Reflection; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Satellites; Time series; Crop growth and development; Growth and development; High temporal resolution; Linear regression models; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Optical remote sensing; Short wave infrared; Spatio-temporal data; Image reconstruction; crop yield; field method; growth; land use; leaf area index; MODIS; reconstruction; satellite data; satellite imagery; satellite sensor; Sentinel; spatial resolution; time series; wheat; yield response; China; Guanzhong Plain; Shaanxi; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Having this information allows stakeholders the ability to make real-time decisions to maximize yield potential. Although various models exist that predict yield from remote sensing data, there currently does not exist an approach that can estimate yield for multiple crops simultaneously, and thus leads to more accurate predictions. A model that predicts the yield of multiple crops and concurrently considers the interaction between multiple crop yields. We propose a new convolutional neural network model called YieldNet which utilizes a novel deep learning framework that uses transfer learning between corn and soybean yield predictions by sharing the weights of the backbone feature extractor. Additionally, to consider the multi-target response variable, we propose a new loss function. We conduct our experiment using data from 1132 counties for corn and 1076 counties for soybean across the United States. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed method accurately predicts corn and soybean yield from one to four months before the harvest with an MAE being 8.74% and 8.70% of the average yield, respectively, and is competitive to other state-of-the-art approaches. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"article; convolutional neural network; deep learning; harvest; loss of function mutation; nonhuman; plant yield; prediction; remote sensing; response variable; soybean; transfer of learning; United States",Article,Scopus

Recent studies have used different machine learning techniques to develop such yield forecast systems for single crops at regional scales. However, no study has used multiple sources of environmental predictors (climate, soil, and vegetation) to forecast yields for three major crops in China. In this study, we adopted 7-year observed crop yield data (2013–2019) for three major grain crops (wheat, maize, and rice) across China, and three major data sets including climate, vegetation indices, and soil properties were used to develop a dynamic yield forecasting system based on the random forest (RF) model. The RF model showed good performance for estimating yields of all three crops with correlation coefficient (r) higher than 0.75 and normalized root means square errors (nRMSE) lower than 18.0%. Our results also showed that crop yields can be satisfactorily forecasted at one to three months prior to harvest. The optimum lead time for yield forecasting depended on crop types. In addition, we found the major predictors influencing crop yield varied between crops. In general, solar radiation and vegetation indices (especially during jointing to milk development stages) were identified as the main predictor for winter wheat; vegetation indices (throughout the growing season) and drought (especially during emergence to tasseling stages) were the most important predictors for spring maize; soil moisture (throughout the growing season) was the dominant predictor for summer maize, late rice, and mid rice; precipitation (especially during booting to heading stages) was the main predictor for early rice. Our study provides insights into practical crop yield forecasting and the understanding of yield response to environmental conditions at a large scale across China. The methods undertaken in this research can be easily implemented in other countries with available information on climate, soil, and vegetation conditions. © 2021","Climate extremes; Crop yield forecast; Lead time; Random forest; Remote sensing; Variable importance","agricultural policy; crop yield; environmental conditions; forecasting method; harvesting; investment; machine learning; rice; yield response; China",Article,Scopus

Evaporation and other weather parameters are collected from the year 1985-2012,1973-2005,1991-2005 and 1958-2010 respectively. The performance of the techniques is compared using classification, misclassification, and sensitivity of the model along with the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve and Area Under Curve (AUC) value. The combinations of variables as independent variables are used in two sets. In the first set, maximum and minimum temperature, relative humidity morning and evening, wind speed, rainfall, and bright sunshine hours are used. In the second set mean temperature, mean relative humidity, bright sunshine hours, and wind speed is used to see the effect on evaporation. It is found that more accuracy is obtained using the second set as predictors. The model validation accuracy is checked via running developed model on out of sample data, i.e. testing data (last three years). The study demonstrates that the random forest approach predict evaporation in a much better way than logistic regression, discriminant analysis.

Technology-driven solutions to various problems, such as soil fertility, inadequate irrigation, pest control, weed management and yield prediction have been discussed, along with, affirmative actions taken by the Indian government to promote smart agriculture. The agricultural life cycle faces many impediments, such as disease, weeds, pest infestation, improper soil conditions, outdated irrigation methods, unpredictable weather conditions, etc. These lead to severe crop failure, food shortage and increasing environmental hazards, driving the farmers to poverty. Extensive research has been done to address these problems in the past few decades. Further, due to the outbreak of pandemic COVID 19, certain restrictions have been imposed by the Indian Government in the farming sector to ensure the safety of farmers from getting infected with the deadly virus. This has resulted in an acute shortage of farmworkers. The use of ICT in agriculture becomes even more important at this crucial time, when, the pandemic has spread across the globe. The ICT based solutions reduce the dependence of farmers on farm-workers and enable them to maintain stable income levels and farm yield, despite the shortage of farm labourers. Various agro-intelligent practices adopted in the last 15 years, worldwide, have also been surveyed, in this paper.

Taking winter wheat and summer maize in Fenhe River basin as the study object, six machine learning algorithms were used to build the yield prediction models, including Linear Regression, Back Propagation Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine Regression, Random Forest, Radial Basis Function, and Extreme Learning Machine. Based on the response of water resources to climate change by the climate-elasticity coefficient, the comprehensive response of grain yield was analyzed on a catchment scale, which was related to climate change driving water resources change. The results indicated that ① Machine learning algorithms performed well on the simulation yield of the winter wheat and summer maize in Fenhe River basin. ② There was a 19.4% increase in water resources as a 10% increase in precipitation, otherwise, a 1 ℃ increase in temperature might lead to a 4.3% decrease in water resources. ③ If precipitation decreased by 10%-30%, the yields of winter wheat and summer maize would decrease by 6.4%-19.3% and 4.0%-15.0%, respectively. ④ When the temperature increased by 0.5-3.0 ℃, there might be 1.8%-17.1% and 1.2%-7.9% increases in the yields of winter wheat and summer maize, respectively. ⑤ The yield of winter wheat was more sensitive to climate change than that of summer maize in the Fenhe River basin.

These factors, however, vary from region to region: consequently, farmers are unable to cultivate similar crops in every region. This is where machine learning (ML) techniques step in to help find the most suitable crops for a particular region, thus assisting farmers a great deal in crop prediction. The feature selection (FS) facet of ML is a major component in the selection of key features for a particular region and keeps the crop prediction process constantly upgraded. This work proposes a novel FS approach called modified recursive feature elimination (MRFE) to select appropriate features from a data set for crop prediction. The proposed MRFE technique selects and ranks salient features using a ranking method. The experimental results show that the MRFE method selects the most accurate features, while the bagging technique helps accurately predict a suitable crop. The performance of proposed MRFE technique is evaluated by various metrics such as accuracy (ACC), precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, area under the curve, mean absolute error, and log loss. From the performance analysis, it is justified that the MRFE technique performs well with 95% ACC than other FS methods. © 2014 IEEE.","Agriculture; classification; crop prediction; feature selection (FS); modified recursive feature elimination (MRFE)","Agricultural robots; Crops; Cultivation; Forecasting; Nitrogen fertilizers; Area under the curves; Environmental characteristic; Environmental features; Mean absolute error; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Performance analysis; Prediction process; Recursive feature elimination; Feature extraction",Article,Scopus

High resolution (5 m) wheat yield forecasting is presented here using two machine learning approaches: (a) Bootstrapped Regression Trees (BRR) where predictions are pixel-wise and (b) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) where predictions use neighbouring pixels. This study focused on three aims. First, to compare the two approaches in a yield forecasting task that included publicly available data and on-farm gathered yield data. Second, to study any benefit of adding more layers of information in the modelling process, e.g. proximal soil sensing surveys. Third, to evaluate the value of including information from contiguous neighbouring fields in order to forecast within-field wheat yield at harvest. Results showed that BRR modelling using publicly available Sentinel data with the addition of local electromagnetic induction surveys or gamma radiometric surveys produced the best forecasts as determined by the classical performance metrics. The results from the CNN models improved with the addition of publicly available data from neighbouring fields and produced a spatial distribution pattern that most closely resembled the actual yield data. Within-field yield forecasting using machine learning techniques and publicly available data shows good potential, and this work suggests that the choice of yield forecasting methodology may depend on the type and extent of spatial data that is available for use in forecasting. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Deep learning; Landsat 8; Proximal and remote sensing; Sentinel 2; Yield forecasting","agricultural management; artificial neural network; crop yield; electromagnetic method; farm; farming system; forecasting method; machine learning; pixel; precision agriculture; satellite data; Sentinel; spatial data; spatial distribution; spatial resolution; wheat",Article,Scopus

Here, climate, satellite data, and meteorological indices were integrated to predict maize yield at the city-level in China from 2000 to 2015 using four machine learning approaches, e.g., cubist, random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost), and support vector machine (SVM). The climate variables included the diffuse flux of photosynthetic active radiation (PDf), the diffuse flux of shortwave radiation (SDf), the direct flux of shortwave radiation (SDr), minimum temperature (Tmn), potential evapotranspiration (Pet), vapor pressure deficit (Vpd), vapor pressure (Vap), and wet day frequency (Wet). Satellite data, including the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), were used. Meteorological indices, including growing degree day (GDD), extreme degree day (EDD), and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), were used. The results showed that integrating all climate, satellite data, and meteorological indices could achieve the highest accuracy. The highest estimated correlation coefficient (R) values for the cubist, RF, SVM, and Xgboost methods were 0.828, 0.806, 0.742, and 0.758, respectively. The climate, satellite data, or meteorological indices inputs from all growth stages were essential for maize yield prediction, especially in late growth stages. R improved by about 0.126, 0.117, and 0.143 by adding climate data from the early, peak, and late-period to satellite data and meteorological indices from all stages via the four machine learning algorithms, respectively. R increased by 0.016, 0.016, and 0.017 when adding satellite data from the early, peak, and late stages to climate data and meteorological indices from all stages, respectively. R increased by 0.003, 0.032, and 0.042 when adding meteorological indices from the early, peak, and late stages to climate and satellite data from all stages, respectively. The analysis found that the spatial divergences were large and the R value in Northwest region reached 0.942, 0.904, 0.934, and 0.850 for the Cubist, RF, SVM, and Xgboost, respectively.

In this study, a crop-growth model was integrated with time series of remotely sensed data through deep learning (DL) methods to improve the accuracy of regional wheat-yield estimations in Henan Province, China. Firstly, the time series of moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were input into the long short-term memory network (LSTM) model to identify the wheat-growing region, which was further used to estimate wheat areas at the municipal and county levels. Then, the leaf area index (LAI) and grain-yield time series simulated by the Crop Environment REsource Synthesis for Wheat (CERES-Wheat) model were used to train and evaluate the LSTM, one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D CNN) and random forest (RF) models, respectively. Finally, an exponential model of the relationship between the field-measured LAI and MODIS NDVI was applied to obtain the regional LAI, which was input into the trained LSTM, 1-D CNN and RF models to estimate wheat yields within the wheat-growing region. The results showed that the linear correlations between the estimated wheat areas and the statistical areas were significant at both the municipal and county levels. The LSTM model provided more accurate estimates of wheat yields, with higher R2 values and lower root mean square error (RMSE) and mean relative error (MRE) values than the 1-D CNN and RF models. The LSTM model has an inherent advantage in capturing phenological information contained in the time series of the MODIS-derived LAI, which is important for satellite-based crop-yield estimates. © 2021 by the authors.

Design policies for increasing smallholder productivity remains a safe way to establish sustainable food systems and boost local economies. However, efforts are still needed in order to achieve accurate and timely monitoring in smallholder farming systems. With the advent of modern Earth Observation programmes such as the Sentinel satellites, which provide quasi-synchronous and high-resolution multi-source information over any area of the continental surfaces, new opportunities are opened up to accurately map crop yields in smallholder farming systems. This study intends to estimate and forecast millet yields in central Senegal, making the use of multi-source (synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) and optical) image time series and state-of-the-art machine learning models. A Random Forest (RF) model explained up to 50% of the millet yield variability, while deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) showed promise results but performed lower. We also found that the concatenation of SAR polarizations and vegetation indices improved our crop yield modelling, but such improvement was tightly related to the modelling approach, namely RF and CNN.

Accurate and timely estimation of the sugarcane yield before harvest plays a particularly important role in the management of agroecosystems. The rapid development of remote sensing technologies, especially Light Detecting and Ranging (LiDAR), significantly enhances aboveground fresh weight (AFW) estimations. In our study, we evaluated the capability of LiDAR mounted on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in estimating the sugarcane AFW in Fusui county, Chongzuo city of Guangxi province, China. We measured the height and the fresh weight of sugarcane plants in 105 sampling plots, and eight variables were extracted from the field-based measurements. Six regression algorithms were used to build the sugarcane AFW model: multiple linear regression (MLR), stepwise multiple regression (SMR), generalized linear model (GLM), generalized boosted model (GBM), kernel-based regularized least squares (KRLS), and random forest regression (RFR). The results demonstrate that RFR (R2 = 0.96, RMSE = 1.27 kg m−2) performs better than other models in terms of prediction accuracy. The final fitted sugarcane AFW distribution maps exhibited good agreement with the observed values (R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 1.33 kg m−2). Canopy cover, the distance to the road, and tillage methods all have an impact on sugarcane AFW. Our study provides guidance for calculating the optimum planting density, reducing the negative impact of human activities, and selecting suitable tillage methods in actual cultivation and production. © 2020 by the authors.

Here we present a thorough assessment of county-level maize yield prediction in U.S. Midwest using six statistical/machine learning algorithms (Lasso, Support Vector Regressor, Random Forest, XGBoost, Long-short term memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)) and an extensive set of environmental variables derived from satellite observations, weather data, land surface model results, soil maps, and crop progress reports. Results show that seasonal crop yield forecasting benefits from both more advanced algorithms and a large composite of information associated with crop canopy, environmental stress, phenology, and soil properties (i.e. hundreds of features). The XGBoost algorithm outperforms other algorithms both in accuracy and stability, while deep neural networks such as LSTM and CNN are not advantageous. The compositing interval (8-day, 16-day or monthly) of time series variable does not have significant effects on the prediction. Combining the best algorithm and inputs improves the prediction accuracy by 5% when compared to a baseline statistical model (Lasso) using only basic climatic and satellite observations. Reasonable county-level yield foresting is achievable from early June, almost four months prior to harvest. At the national level, early-season (June and July) prediction from the best model outperforms that of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE).

Simulation crop models can assist in scenario planning, but their use is limited because of data requirements and long runtimes. Thus, there is a need for more computationally expedient approaches to scale up predictions. We evaluated the potential of four machine learning (ML) algorithms (LASSO Regression, Ridge Regression, random forests, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and their ensembles) as meta-models for a cropping systems simulator (APSIM) to inform future decision support tool development. We asked: (1) How well do ML meta-models predict maize yield and N losses using pre-season information? (2) How many data are needed to train ML algorithms to achieve acceptable predictions? (3) Which input data variables are most important for accurate prediction? And (4) do ensembles of ML meta-models improve prediction? The simulated dataset included more than three million data including genotype, environment and management scenarios. XGBoost was the most accurate ML model in predicting yields with a relative mean square error (RRMSE) of 13.5%, and Random forests most accurately predicted N loss at planting time, with a RRMSE of 54%. ML meta-models reasonably reproduced simulated maize yields using the information available at planting, but not N loss. They also differed in their sensitivities to the size of the training dataset. Across all ML models, yield prediction error decreased by 10%-40% as the training dataset increased from 0.5 to 1.8 million data points, whereas N loss prediction error showed no consistent pattern. ML models also differed in their sensitivities to input variables (weather, soil properties, management, initial conditions), thus depending on the data availability researchers may use a different ML model. Modest prediction improvements resulted from ML ensembles. These results can help accelerate progress in coupling simulation models and ML toward developing dynamic decision support tools for pre-season management. © 2019 The Author(s).

In this work, we developed an unprecedented optimized framework for the MODIS-based mid-season corn yield forecasting over five producing states of the United States: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, and Ohio. We evaluated Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)-based forecasts under different schemes accounting for: different machine learning techniques with a mid-season composite or multi-temporal composites as inputs, four (county-, district-, state-, and global-based) training domains, and 16-day composites versus daily interpolated composites involving the day of pixels as predictors. Under the best identified scheme, we compared the EVI-based forecasts with those based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Leaf area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetic Active Radiation (FPAR). EVI and NDVI were transformed to LAI (named as LAIEVI and LAINDVI) as predictors for producing EVI- and NDVI-based forecasts. We evaluated both county- and state-level forecasts using the percent error (PE), mean absolute PE (MAPE) and determination coefficient (R2). The linear regression models driven by the single latest composite in mid-season often outperformed elastic net and random forest models driven by multi-temporal composites. The forecast performance decreased with longer subsets of EVI composites being used. The performance under the different training domains varied by states and forecast level (county or state), although the changes within states were mostly non-significant except in Nebraska. The forecasts based on 16-day and daily composites performed similarly, indicating that the use of information about the day of pixel composite provides no additional benefit to the yield forecast. For the best EVI-based schemes, the medium annual MAPE (PE) at the county (state) level varied between 6.1% (2.4%) and 7.7% (5.3%) across states while the medium annual R2 (interannual R2) varied between 0.54 (0.59) and 0.82 (0.86). Results suggested that, while EVI was, in general, the best predictor for the Corn Belt as a whole, the adequacy of the EVI- and NDVI-based forecasts varied by states and largely exceeded that of the LAI- and FPAR-based forecasts. Compared with the EVI-based forecasts, the NDVI-based forecasts performed better in Iowa (MAPE's 0.9% and 1.43% lower at the county and state level), similar in Nebraska and worse in the other states. Overall, the best state-level forecasts consistently outperformed concurrent National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) forecasts. © 2020 The Authors","Crop yield forecast; Enhanced vegetation index; Leaf area index; Machine learning; MODIS; The Corn Belt","crop yield; decision making; leaf area index; machine learning; MODIS; optimization; vegetation index; Illinois; Indiana; Iowa; Nebraska; Ohio; United States",Article,Scopus

An initial attempt has been made in this study to select important parameters to be used as input to the machine learning method. Mean Decrease Accuracy and Mean Decrease Gini measures of random forest algorithm have been used to select the important parameters for predictive modelling. The results of the study revealed that Green Normalized Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Land Surface Water Index performed best among other indices. Bands B2, B3, B6 and B7 of Landsat-8 recorded as top scorers.

However, stroke patients use available motor strategies to reach the target position to compensate for their upper limb weakness. This can lead to inaccurate assessment data for the predictive analysis. The primary goal of this study is to examine the effect of shoulder movement in upper limb assessment for predicting the Motor Assessment Scale (MAS) score using Partial Least Squares (PLS), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and hybrid (i.e. PLS-ANN) predictive models. However, the feature selection method on the model's input predictor influences the predictive model's performance.

Our previous study found the profitability of implementing sensor-based N fertilizing varied from one study site to another and changed from one location to another within the same site. To better understand the relationship between site conditions and SENSE profitability, we developed a method to analyze SENSE project data at a finer scale. We first partitioned study strips into 20 feet long paired (Grower vs. SENSE) study units. We then created a 200-feet long aggregation block to move along each study strip to integrate N application data, yield data, and site condition data. Within each block, we compared yields and marginal net returns (MNR) from Grower and SENSE treatments and quantified the profitability of the sensor-based N application as the difference between SENSE MNR and Grower MNR. Three types of features were constructed to characterize site conditions within each aggregation block: 1) features derived from DEM, TWI, 2) features constructed to quantify the complexity of soil combination, and 3) features extracted from the SSURGO database on soil properties. The data processing generated 12000+ samples with 70+ features. Multiple supervised methods were applied to model the relationship between the site features and the profitability of the sensor-based N application (target outputs are -1 for nonprofitable, 1 for profitable).

In this study, we aim to realize a stable predictive performance for ear emergence in rice crops regardless of its regional variations. Although a variety of data that represents regional characteristics have been adopted as the variables for prediction in related work, stability of the predictive performance has not been attained. These results imply that explicit regional data is insufficient for stabilizing the regional variances of the prediction. This study proposes to use engineered variables that uncover hidden regional characteristics behind the explicit regional data. Pre-examinations of the regional data indicate distinctive patterns of time dependency according to each region.

Accordingly, the objective of this investigation was to develop a method that can accurately define the most suitable environment in the greenhouse for an optimal yield of roses. Herein, an optimal and highly accurate BO-DNN surrogate model was developed (based on 300 experimental data points) for a quick and reliable classification of the rose yield environment considering some of the most influential variables including soil humidity, temperature and humidity of air, CO2 concentration, and light intensity (lux) into its architecture. Initially, two BO techniques (GP and GBRT) are used for the tuning process of the hyper-parameters (such as learning rate, batch size, number of dense nodes, number of dense neurons, number of input nodes, activation function, etc.). After that, an optimal and simple combination of the hyper-parameters was selected to develop a DNN algorithm based on 300 data points, which was further used to classify the rose yield environment (the rose yield environments were classified into four classes such as soil without water, correct environment, too hot, and very cold environments). The very high accuracy of the proposed surrogate model (0.98) originated from the introduction of the most vital soil and meteorological parameters as the inputs of the model. The proposed method can help in identifying intelligent greenhouse environments for efficient crop yields. © 2021 by the authors.

PA uses site-specific crop management concept based on measured data using sensors and data analytics to find the root cause of yield reduction. Precision agriculture automates farming which involves the collection of data and analysis of them for better decision-making to gain high yield and quality of the agricultural product. The agriculture system integrated with data analytics and machine learning is called as smart farming or smart agriculture The goal of smart agriculture is to develop a decision-making support system for farming management.

Proper assessment of the components of any hydrological system is a priority in watersheds studying. SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model was used within ArcGIS, to assess the hydrological situation in general, and surface runoff in particular for Galal Badra Watershed GBW (Wasit Governorate, eastern Iraq). GBW has an area of 2,655 square kilometers (89% of which is in Iran and the rest 11% within Iraq). The data set for SWAT model running were digital elevation model, slope map, soil map, LULC map, and climatic data (precipitation, relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, minimum/ maximum air temperature). SWAT simulation concluded that the annual average surface runoff in GBW was 244x106 cubic meters (with an average discharge of 7.8 M3 / s), which accounts for about 25.7% of the total precipitation. This ratio can be used in preliminary forecasting of surface runoff resulting from different amounts of precipitation. The model was not calibrated due to insufficient data available to complete the calibration process. However, the results provided by the SWAT model regarding the water balance elements in the watershed, make the SWAT model an effective tool for hydrological assessments, especially in cases where the necessary data are scarce for various reasons. Also, SWAT results can be considered as a preliminary assessment, which gives an overview of the hydrological situation of the area, contributes to building an initial perception of the water system, determining the most important elements in it, and anticipating the factors most influencing it.

The weighted aggregation performed by the convolutional operator also helps to smoothen the noisy data collected at the given locations. However, current convolutional methods are primarily designed to learn the spatial dependencies of the input (predictor) variables only. The recent success in applying multi-task learning to various geospatial prediction problems shows that the model parameters themselves may also be spatially related. This suggests the possibility of employing convolutional methods to learn the spatial dependencies among the model parameters at different locations, especially in situations where there are limited training data available to fit accurate local models. In this paper, we investigate three different ways to incorporate convolutions into geospatial prediction models—convolutions on the predictors, model parameters, or a hybrid of both. We provide guidance on when convolution of each type can be fruitfully applied and verify their effectiveness using both synthetic and real-world datasets.

In spatial data context, outliers are the observations whose non-spatial attributes are distinct from other observations. Thus, treating an entire field as uniform area is trivial which influence the farmers to use expensive fertilizers. Iterative-R algorithm is applied for outlier detection to reduce the masking/swamping effects. Outlier-free data defines interpretable field patterns to satisfy statistical assumptions.

Along with industries and businesses, farming is also going digital and the data-driven agri-technology and precision farming are the new scientific approaches toward sustainable agriculture to enhance productivity and minimizing environmental bearings. Driven by analytics of historical data, satellite data and real-time sensor inputs, machine learning (ML) plays a pivotal role in developing models for sustainable digital agriculture. This chapter aims at explaining different applications, approaches and algorithms of ML being used in agriculture production system. This chapter covers how ML approaches add sustainability to broad categories of agriculture management that includes managing the soil, water and crop. Effectively and efficiently managing the soil and water in agricultural entails substantial efforts and is very significant for achieving agronomical, hydrological and climatological equilibrium. The evolving artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics driven agriculture systems can apply different algorithms on data from sensors and can help a lot in detecting diseases, identifying weeds, predicting quality of crop and yield along with water management, nutrition management, soil management and so on. It can provide recommendations, remedies and great insights for timely decision and action.

Three transfer learning methods, namely, fine-tuned DeepLab V3+, SegNet, and fully convolutional network-8s (FCN-8s), were utilized to detect clover fractions (on an area basis). The detected clover fraction (CFdetected), together with auxiliary variables, viz., measured clover height (Hclover) and grass height (Hgrass), were used to build multiple linear regression (MLR) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) models for BC estimation. A total of 347 clover–grass images were used to build the estimation model on clover fraction and BC. Of the 347 samples, 226 images were augmented to 904 images for training, 25 were selected for validation, and the remaining 96 samples were used as an independent dataset for testing. Testing results showed that the intersection-over-union (IoU) values based on the DeepLab V3+, SegNet, and FCN-8s were 0.73, 0.57, and 0.60, respectively. The root mean square error (RMSE) values for the three transfer learning methods were 8.5, 10.6, and 10.0%. Subsequently, models based on BPNN and MLR were built to estimate BC, by using either CFdetected only or CFdetected, grass height, and clover height all together. Results showed that BPNN was generally superior to MLR in terms of estimating BC. The BPNN model only using CFdetected had a RMSE of 8.7%. In contrast, the BPNN model using all three variables (CFdetected, Hclover, and Hgrass) as inputs had an RMSE of 6.6%, implying that DeepLab V3+ together with BPNN can provide good estimation of BC and can offer a promising method for improving forage management. © Copyright © 2021 Sun, Liang, Zuo, Parsons, Morel, Shi, Wang, Luo, Zhao, Fang, He and Zhou.","back propagation neural network; crop species classification; DeepLab V3+; forage crop; transfer learning",,Article,Scopus

In this study, the response of WT fluctuations to changes in ET was investigated involving the DRAINMOD water management model. The WT depth data were measured during three canola growing seasons (2011-12, 2015-16 and 2016-17) in a paddy field with two subsurface drainage systems (drain depth of 65 cm with two spacing of 15 m and 30 m) in the north of Iran. For the growing seasons, ET was estimated through 17 equations including five temperature- based, four radiation- based, three pan evaporation- based, four combination- based and one mass transfer- based equations. The estimated ET values was then applied in the calibrated DRAINMOD model to simulate the corresponding WT depths in the drainage systems. The reliability of various ET estimation methods and the model predictions were evaluated using determination coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), error percentage (PE) and mean absolute deviation (MAD). Compared to the FAO- Penman-Monteith equation, the FAO-24 radiation (R2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.31 mm d-1, MAD =0.71 mm d-1 and PE = - 0.95%), Blaney- Criddle (R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 0.38 mm d-1, MAD =0.76 mm d-1 and PE = - 6.24%), Irmak (R2 = 0.87, RMSE =0.87 mm d-1, MAD =0.41 mm d-1 and PE = - 11.09%) and FAO- 24 pan (R2 = 0.86, RMSE =0.45 mm d-1, MAD =0.80 mm d-1 and PE = - 16.18%) provided the best estimations of ET.

These methods considerably improved the reliability of the DRAINMOD predictions in comparison with the Thornthwaite method which is a default method for ET calculation in the model.

Temperature, radiation, water availability and other environmental conditions influence crop growth, development, and final grain yield in a complex nonlinear manner. Machine learning (ML) techniques, and deep learning (DL) methods in particular, can account for such nonlinear relations between yield and its covariates. However, they typically lack transparency and interpretability, since the way the predictions are derived is not directly evident. Yet, in the context of yield forecasting, understanding which are the underlying factors behind both a predicted loss or gain is of great relevance. Here, we explore how to benefit from the increased predictive performance of DL methods while maintaining the ability to interpret how the models achieve their results. To do so, we applied a deep neural network to multivariate time series of vegetation and meteorological data to estimate the wheat yield in the Indian Wheat Belt. Then, we visualized and analyzed the features and yield drivers learned by the model with the use of regression activation maps. The DL model outperformed other tested models (ridge regression and random forest) and facilitated the interpretation of variables and processes that lead to yield variability. The learned features were mostly related to the length of the growing season, and temperature and light conditions during this time. For example, our results showed that high yields in 2012 were associated with low temperatures accompanied by sunny conditions during the growing period. The proposed methodology can be used for other crops and regions in order to facilitate application of DL models in agriculture. © 2020 The Author(s).

To improve the accuracy of banana remote sensing yield estimation, totally 71 banana fields in Fusui County, Guangxi were used as the study area, and a remote sensing prediction model for banana yield in 2019-2020 was conducted by using time-series Sentinel-2 remote sensing image data, combined with field measured yield data. The method firstly obtained Sentinel-2 images during the key banana phenological period of 2019-2020, then the threshold segmentation and morphological open operation methods were used to remove cloud and cloud shadow coverage areas, the average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values of each plot were extracted, and finally the BSO-SVR model was used to predict and evaluate the banana yield in combination with the actual measured data of banana yield. The results showed that compared with the grid search (GS) and grey wolf optimizer (GWO) algorithms to optimize the penalty factor and kernel function parameters of the SVR model, the brain storming optimization algorithm proposed had higher prediction accuracy and faster prediction speed. The running times of the BSO-SVR model in 2019 and 2020 were 0.320 s and 0.331 s, respectively, and for the validation set, the R2 of the BSO-SVR model was 0.777 and 0.793 in 2019 and 2020, respectively; for the test set, the R2 of the BSO-SVR model was 0.765 and 0.636 in 2019 and 2020, respectively, except that the R2 of the BSO-SVR model in 2019 is slightly lower than that of the GS-SVR model (R2=0.797) in 2019, except that the R2 of the BSO-SVR model was higher than that of the GWO-SVR model and the GS-SVR model, and in addition, the overall performance of the RMSE and MAE of the BSO-SVR model was optimal in 2019-2020 compared with that of the GWO-SVR model and the GS-SVR model, indicating that the prediction results of the BSO-SVR model were closer to the actual values and with higher forecasting accuracy. Compared with the traditional ridge regression (RR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) models, in 2019, the BSO-SVR model had the highest R2, followed by the RR model, and the PLSR model was the worst, where the BSO-SVR model had R2 above 0.75 for both the validation and test sets, which was 0.113 and 0.174 higher than that of the RR model, and 0.192 and 0.184 higher than thta of the PLSR model, respectively. Meanwhile, the BSO-SVR model had the lowest RMSE and MAE compared with the RR model and PLSR model, indicating that the BSO-SVR model had good results in forecasting banana yield in 2019. In 2020, the BSO-SVR model had the best overall performance, with the average R2 of 0.715 for the validation and test sets, and the R2 of the validation and test sets were higher than that of the RR model by 0.035 and 0.014, respectively, and better than that of the PLSR model by 0.040 and 0.035, while the RMSE and MAE of the BSO-SVR model also had the best overall performance.

It is an important baseline observation that is used for ensuring regional and global food security. In this study, a novel deep learning framework was developed for winter wheat yield estimation using meteorological data and two remotely sensed indices, Vegetation Temperature Condition Index (VTCI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) at the main growth stages of winter wheat in the Guanzhong Plain. The proposed deep learning model was based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network with an attention mechanism (ALSTM), which the main idea is to assign attention to the key parts of the input sequence that affect the target vectors so that the specific features can be accurately extracted. The ALSTM model provided an improved estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.63, MAPE = 8.20%, RMSE = 502.71 kg/ha, NRMSE = 11.15%) as compared with the LSTM (R2 = 0.55, MAPE = 13.46%, RMSE = 699.92 kg/ha, NRMSE = 15.52%). A validation based on leave-one-year-out-validation further substantiated the robustness of ALSTM with smaller values of NRMSE and MAPE (13.63% and 11.54%). We demonstrated that the ALSTM model provided good generalization ability for sampling sites under different farming systems, including irrigation and rain-fed sampling sites. In addition, we evaluated the relative importance of each input variable in determining yields based on stepwise sensitivity analysis. It was found that LAI at the heading-filling stage and the milk stage as well as VTCI at the jointing stage contributed more than other input feature variables towards the corresponding yield. In conclusion, our findings highlighted that the attention mechanism helped to improve the interpretability of neural networks and the ALSTM model along with remotely sensed biophysical indices can provide a reliable and robust estimation of crop yield. An accurate estimation of wheat yield is not only helping towards informed crop management decisions but it will improve efficiency and sustainability of farming operations. © 2021 The Authors","Leaf Area Index (LAI); Long short-term memory with an attention mechanism (ALSTM); Vegetation Temperature Condition Index (VTCI); Winter wheat; Yield estimation","crop yield; leaf area index; machine learning; meteorology; remote sensing; vegetation index; wheat; China; Guanzhong Plain; Shaanxi",Article,Scopus

In this study, taking the major winter wheat production regions of China as an example, we compared a traditional machine learning method (random forest, RF) and three deep learning (DL) models, including DNN (deep neural networks), 1D-CNN (1D convolutional neural networks), and LSTM (long short-term memory networks) to predict crop yields by integrating publicly available data within the GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform, including climate, satellite, soil properties, and spatial information data. The results showed that all four models could capture winter wheat yield variations in all the county-years, with R2 of recorded and simulated yields ranging from 0.83 to 0.90 and RMSE ranging from 561.18 to 959.62 kg/ha. They all performed well for winter wheat yield prediction at a county level from 2011 to 2015, with mean R2≥0.85 and RMSE ≤ 768 kg/ha. At a field level, the spatial pattern of estimated winter wheat yield could capture the spatial heterogeneity and yield differences between individual fields across a county fairly well. However, only the DNN and RF models had relatively good performance at the field level, with mean R2 values of 0.71, 0.66 and RMSE values of 1127 kg/ha and 956 kg/ha, respectively. The model comparisons showed that the performance of RF was not always worse than DL at both the county and field levels.

Furthermore, earlier treatment reduces the amount of yield loss and therefore boosts crop production during a given season. With this in mind, we collect sequences of high-resolution aerial imagery and construct semantic segmentation models to detect and predict NDS across the field; our work sits at the intersection of agriculture, remote sensing, and deep learning. First, we establish a baseline for full-field detection of NDS and quantify the impact of pretraining, backbone architecture, input representation, and sampling strategy. We then quantify the amount of information available at different points in the season by building a single-timestamp model based on a U-Net. Next, we construct our proposed spatiotemporal architecture, which combines a U-Net with a convolutional LSTM to accurately detect regions of the field showing NDS; this approach has an impressive IOU score of 0.53. Finally, we show that this architecture can be trained to predict regions of the field which are expected to show NDS in a later flight- potentially more than three weeks in the future- maintaining an IOU score of 0.47- 0.51 depending on how far in advance the prediction is made. We will also release a dataset which we believe will benefit the computer vision, remote sensing, and agriculture fields.

However, the productivity of most smallholder farms around the world is still poorly estimated due to absence of technologies and field-scale data, especially for the largest smallholders across China. Here, we integrated 11,857 of field-surveyed yields across maize cultivation areas in China and heterogeneous geospatial data to predict field-level maize yield using three data-driven approaches, i.e., Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We determined the most suitable vegetation index (VI), compared the performances of satellite-derived and ground-observed climate data, and identified the optimal combination of input variables and the best method for maize yield estimation. We found that the green chlorophyll vegetation index (GCVI) outperformed the traditional visible and near-infrared-based VIs. Combining Land Surface Temperature (LST), cumulative precipitation (Pgs) and standardized precipitation index (SPI) explained about 70% of the yield variation, which was comparable to ground-observed indices. Integrating GCVI improved R2 by 0.01–0.20 depending on the methods, suggesting valuable information on biotic or abiotic stress contained by GCVI. Maize yield could be predicted 1–2-month ahead before harvesting in all agro-ecological zones. The data collected during silking period contributed more information. The LSTM model did better than LightGBM and LASSO, because of its neural network characterizing the cumulative effects of environmental factors on yield. Our study demonstrates an effective mean for large-scale crop yield estimation using publicly available data, particularly for smallholder systems where ground observations are currently limited and sparse. © 2021","Deep learning; GEE; Maize; Remote sensing; Smallholder farms; Yield prediction","algorithm; crop yield; cultivation; detection method; integrated approach; maize; smallholder; China",Article,Scopus

As a result, massive amounts of data are being generated in every domain at an alarming rate. Agriculture is one such area of interest for researchers. Machine learning is the process of extracting useful information from various types of data. The classification of objects is an important area within the field of data mining, and its application extends to a variety of areas, whether or not in the field of science. Although k-Nearest Neighbor classification is a simple and effective technique, it slows down the classification of each object.

Recent advances in artificial neural networks particularly with deep neural networks provided an opportunity to explore and expose weights in the individual layers for discovery, extraction and transfer of knowledge. Several experiments with transfer of weights from a particular layer to other layers are conducted to analyse how the classification is affected by moving weights into particular layer in a particular position. This paper, for the first time tries to investigate the importance of individual layers in a neural network through systematic experimental evaluation. Experiments are carried out using feed-forward deep neural network with different topologies. Three data sets namely MNIST, IRIS and a synthetic hierarchical data set are used for the experiments. Knowledge extraction and transfer of knowledge (through weights) experiments are performed with multiple strategies. The results indicate that the middle layer weights possess some underlying representation and has highest impact on classification accuracy. When the middle layer weights are transferred to an untrained deep neural network, irrespective of topology or type of data set (from the three data sets used), there is a significant improvement in classification accuracy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

One of the main difficulties faced by people is that they do not know when to water the plants and also the amount of water to be poured, resulting in the death of the plant. Current solutions to this problem focus on automatically watering the plants when the soil gets dry or drip irrigation-based solution where the plants are watered continuously. But this solution does not help people whose hobby is gardening and for those who want to take care of their plants by themselves. To tackle this problem, a system is proposed where the time is used to predict when a plant has to be watered in future. Our research is mainly on the deep learning (DL) algorithms, to analyze which would give better performance in this scenario. To achieve this, various sensors to obtain the moisture level of the soil, temperature, and humidity of the air around the plant. The cloud technologies and deep learning techniques are used to store, process, and obtain the optimum time. Since the data received is time-series data, we use LSTM and GRU models to predict the optimum time to water the plants. The results and their comparison are discussed in this article.

In Malaysia rice productivity is steadily increasing and Malaysia’s self-sufficiency level of rice is at 72%. Quantification of rice parameters, such as Vegetation Indices (VIs) and Backscatter Coefficients (σ°) is important in rice yield productivity modelling. Yield modelling is the best tool for rice crop and productivity management. Various VIs and backscatter coefficients are being used to monitor crop growth and to predict and estimate yield before harvesting date. Previous studies shows most analysis use satellite images close to harvesting date of rice crop. The aims of this study is to develop rice yield modelling through on VIs i.e. Normalize Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Leaf Area Index (LAI) and backscatter coefficients (σ°) for 30 plots of rice fields in Sawah Sempadan, Selangor, Malaysia rice granary area. Other purposes of this study are to examine the correlation of the VIs and σ° with the reported yield and study the effectiveness of using Optical and SAR data for rice yield modelling. The first method of this modelling involves data processing of Landsat 8 OLI and Radarsat2 imageries to obtain the VIs of rice crop and the second part present regression analysis of VIs with the reported yield of rice crop. The yield prediction equation gives good correlation (R2) result for LAI which is R2=0.81, compared to NDVI (R2=0.61) and SAVI (R2=0.71) for Landsat 8 dataset. While the analysis of Radarsat-2 gave very low correlation (R2=0.10). In this limited study, it was observed that SAVI gives a better result for modelling yield at the time of the productive stage. © 2020 ACRS 2020 - 41st Asian Conference on Remote Sensing.

However, identification usually requires the involvement of experts. It would be useful to develop means to support pest identification. Although machine learning techniques have been applied to multiple fields including pest identification, expert knowledge for modeling was required to construct a high-accuracy model. In recent years, machine learning platforms that automatically construct a model are offered by IT firms. We tested whether automated machine learning using Google Cloud AutoML Vision was useful for identifying pest species. We trained machine learning models to identify aphids of three species—Aphis craccivora Koch, Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris, and Megoura crassicauda Mordivilko (Hemiptera: Aphididae)—sharing host plants and assessed accuracies. Models were constructed using 20, 50, 100, 200, and 400 images per species, with and without augmentation of training data volume by image inversion. The accuracy of identification increased with the number of training images and with the use of inverted images. Since the rates of correct identification were > 0.96 when the models were trained with 400 images per species with inversion, we consider automated machine learning to be useful for pest species identification. © 2019, The Japanese Society of Applied Entomology and Zoology.","Aphid; Automated machine learning; AutoML; Image analysis; Pest identification",,Article,Scopus

As a probabilistic model, Gaussian Processes (GPs) on the other hand offers uncertainty information, which is nonetheless lack of scalability for large datasets. This paper adapts traditional GPs regression for ordinal regression problem by using both conjugate and non-conjugate ordinal likelihood. Based on that, it proposes a deep neural network with a GPs layer on the top, which is trained end-to-end by the stochastic gradient descent method for both neural network parameters and GPs parameters. The parameters in the ordinal likelihood function are learned as neural network parameters so that the proposed framework is able to produce fitted likelihood functions for training sets and make probabilistic predictions for test points.

However, efficiently extracting complex spatio-temporal relationships by proper utilization of these enormous volumes of data is a critical issue which imposes significant challenge in timely processing and prediction of such spatio-temporal data.

The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) was taken as the data source to extract the information of visible and near-infrared bands at different periods and selected seven remote sensing features of vegetation, including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), optimal soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) and green red vegetation index (GRVI). Using its histogram distribution information as an input variable, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to predict winter wheat yield, comparatively analyze the performance of NDWI in winter wheat yield estimation, and explore its accuracy changes under the influence of frost damage. The results showed that compared with NDVI, SAVI, OSAVI, GNDVI, MSAVI and GRVI, NDWI had a better prediction effect on the yield prediction of winter wheat in the early growth stage, the prediction accuracy of NDWI was higher than that of NDVI, SAVI and other vegetation indices before and after yield detrending, the coefficient of determination (R2) was up to 0.79, and it can still maintain a good prediction effect under the influence of frost damage. NDWI had the greatest influence on the final yield of winter wheat at the stage of heading and grouting. From April 23th to April 30th, the R2 of NDWI can reach 0.72.

An alternative to output multiple numeric values upon the input, we think, would be multi-target regression (MTR) with either Random Forest (RF) or k-nearest neighbors (KNN). Therefore, we captured the advantages of high-resolution remote sensing and multi-target machine learning into an immersive single framework then analyzed if it could be possible for accurately predicting for the yield of sweet potato by the market class of its tuberous roots (i.e., Extra &lt; 0.15 kg; 015 ≤ Extra AA ≤ 0.45 kg; and Extra A &gt; 0.45 kg) upon imagery data on summer and winter full-scale fields. The remote sensing captured the spectral changes on both fields and enabled the MTR to accurately predict for the yield of sweet potato in total and by the market class of harvestable roots upon normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and its derivative version (GreenNDVI) as well as upon soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI). The SAVI-RF framework predicted the summer field to yield marketable roots at the proportions of 2.04 t ha−1 Extra, 3.89 t ha−1 Extra AA and 2.08 t ha−1 Extra A, and the spectral data from the mid-stage of cultivation at 296 growing degree days (GDD) minimized its mean absolute error (MAE) to 2.66 t ha−1. The GNDVI-RF framework predicted the winter field to yield 1.64 t ha−1 Extra, 5.02 t ha−1 Extra AA and 3.65 t ha−1 Extra A, with an error of 3.45 t ha−1 upon spectral data from sampling on the late stage at 966 GDD.

Yet, the majority of sensor-based decision tools which support fertiliser management have relied on simplistic mechanistic frameworks normally informed by a single sensor. This study used a 20-year nitrogen (N) experiment on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to test a range of approaches for N decision support systems, including commercial sensor-based options and a novel, multivariate, data-driven approach. The latter was based on a non-mechanistic framework in which various digital variables were trained directly against optimum N application rates using machine learning. It was hypothesized that such a method would enhance our ability to handle system complexity, resulting in higher accuracy for the decision, as compared to current farm management or to available sensor-based options, both of which are normally underpinned by mechanistic methods. Results showed that the proposed approach was able to predict the optimal N rate with an RMSE of 16.5 kg N ha–1 (R2 = 0.79). This method was also the only one that was statistically superior (p &lt; 0.05) to the control scenario (the application of the historical average optimal N rate; RMSE =38.0 kg N ha–1). This proposed approach used a multivariate digital input including a spectral vegetation index (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI), weather and soil moisture data and information from on-farm experimentation (the in-situ N response using a ‘N-rich’ strip) to guide the decision. When similar data input and modelling techniques were used to predict yield potential to then derive an N recommendation through a mechanistic decision framework – a nutrient mass balance – the recommendation error (RMSE) increased to 26.0 kg N ha−1 (R2 = 0.51). In summary, by forcing the input data through the mechanistic framework, the decision error increased. This study challenges the ideas that farm decisions should follow pre-established agronomic mechanistic frameworks and that digital technologies must necessarily be used to estimate specific crop and soil attributes so as to enable deployment of current decision systems at scale and site-specifically. © 2021 The Authors","Crop reflectance sensors; Decision support systems; Nitrogen; On-farm experimentation; Soil moisture sensors","accuracy assessment; agricultural management; artificial intelligence; cost analysis; decision support system; error analysis; machine learning; optimization; sensor; soil moisture; wheat; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Therefore, there is an incentive to apply it in other important domains such as agriculture. Fertilizers, electricity, chemicals, human labor, and water are the components of total energy consumption in agriculture. Yield estimates are critical for food security, crop management, irrigation scheduling, and estimating labor requirements for harvesting and storage. Therefore, estimating product yield can reduce energy consumption. Two deep learning models, Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units, have been developed for the analysis of time-series data such as agricultural datasets. In this paper, the capabilities of these models and their extensions, called Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units, to predict end-of-season yields are investigated. The models use historical data, including climate data, irrigation scheduling, and soil water content, to estimate end-of-season yield. The application of this technique was tested for tomato and potato yields at a site in Portugal. The Bidirectional Long Short-Term memory outperformed the Gated Recurrent Units network, the Long Short-Term Memory, and the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units network on the validation dataset. The model was able to capture the nonlinear relationship between irrigation amount, climate data, and soil water content and predict yield with an MSE of 0.017 to 0.039. The performance of the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory in the test was compared with the most commonly used deep learning method, the Convolutional Neural Network, and machine learning methods including a Multi-Layer Perceptrons model and Random Forest Regression. The Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory outperformed the other models with an R2 score between 0.97 and 0.99. The results show that analyzing agricultural data with the Long Short-Term Memory model improves the performance of the model in terms of accuracy. The Convolutional Neural Network model achieved the second-best performance. Therefore, the deep learning model has a remarkable ability to predict the yield at the end of the season. © 2021 by the authors.

These farmers are financially incapable of equipping themselves with irrigation systems and other agricultural technologies that can assist in improving their farm yields. One of the challenges facing them is that they rely heavily on rain-fed agriculture which makes them extremely vulnerable in the face of climate change. They have continued to consult their indigenous knowledge systems to predict the onset of rains and in making critical decisions such as when to prepare land for crop cultivation. Evidence shows that this knowledge is no longer as precise as it used to be – among other reasons, this is due to the effects of climate change and deforestation. The second problem is that the only sources of weather information these farmers have (e.g. the media) are general and not scaled down to the specific locations where they reside. On the other hand, most of the small-scale farmers are educationally and technologically semi-literate and are financially crawling when it comes to adoption of the likes of sensors and other technologies that could help in predicting and monitoring crop health. There is however opportunity in that most of these farmers are now using android phones.

The long short-term memory (LSTM) model represents a deep network structure to incorporating crop growth processes, which has been proven to accommodate different types and representations of data, recognize sequential patterns over long time spans, and capture complex nonlinear relationships. The LSTM model was developed to estimate wheat yield in the Guanzhong Plain by integrating meteorological data and two remotely sensed indices, vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) and leaf area index (LAI) at the main growth stages. Considering the LSTM model has characteristics of memorizing time series information, we adopted different time steps to estimate wheat yield. The results showed that the accuracy of yield estimation was highest (RMSE = 357.77 kg/ha and R2 = 0.83) under two time steps and the input combination (meteorological data and two remotely sensed indices). We evaluated the yield estimation accuracy of the optimal LSTM model performance compared with the back propagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector machine (SVM). As a result, the LSTM model outperformed BPNN (R2 = 0.42 and RMSE = 812.83 kg/ha) and SVM (R2 = 0.41 and RMSE = 867.70 kg/ha), since its recurrent neural network structure that can incorporate nonlinear relationships between multi-features inputs and yield. To further validate the robustness of the optimal LSTM method, the correlations between estimated yield and measured yield at the irrigation sites and the rain-fed sites from 2008 to 2016 were analyzed, and the results demonstrated that the proposed model can serve as an effective approach for different type sampling sites and has better adaptability to interannual fluctuations of climate. Our findings demonstrated a reliable and promising approach for improving yield estimation. © 2021","Leaf area index (LAI); Long short-term memory (LSTM); Meteorological data; Vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI); Yield estimation","artificial neural network; back propagation; crop yield; economic development; estimation method; food security; leaf area index; meteorology; remote sensing; satellite data; wheat; China; Guanzhong Plain; Shaanxi",Article,Scopus

For a commercial organization that manages large amounts of crops, collecting accurate and consistent data is a bottleneck. Due to limited time and labor, accurately phenotyping crops to record color, head count, height, weight, etc. is severely limited. However, this information, combined with other genetic and environmental factors, is vital for developing new superior crop species that help feed the world's growing population. Recent advances in machine learning, in particular deep learning, have shown promise in mitigating this bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method for counting on-ear corn kernels in-field to aid in the gathering of real-time data and, ultimately, to improve decision making to maximize yield. We name this approach DeepCorn, and show that this framework is robust under various conditions. DeepCorn estimates the density of corn kernels in an image of corn ears and predicts the number of kernels based on the estimated density map. DeepCorn uses a truncated VGG-16 as a backbone for feature extraction and merges feature maps from multiple scales of the network to make it robust against image scale variations. We also adopt a semi-supervised learning approach to further improve the performance of our proposed method. Our proposed method achieves the MAE and RMSE of 41.36 and 60.27 in the corn kernel counting task, respectively. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art methods. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Convolutional neural network; Corn kernel counting; Deep learning; Semi-supervised learning; Yield estimation","Crops; Decision making; Learning systems; Semi-supervised learning; Environmental factors; High throughput; Learning methods; Multiple scale; Real-time data; Semi-supervised; State-of-the-art methods; Yield estimation; Deep learning",Article,Scopus

Therefore, monitoring the real-time net photosynthesis plays an essential role in improving the quality of productions in commercial greenhouses. Net photosynthesis mainly depends on three environmental parameters, that are light level, temperature and CO2 concentration. However, it is challenging to calculate accurate net photosynthesis due to the highly nonlinear relation. In this paper, Deep Learning (DL) is utilized to model this relationship in order to predict the net photosynthesis based on the three inputs. Firstly, the architecture of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model is designed according to the features of this problem, and three activation functions are concerned for the DNN model design. Secondly, a training dataset is established, and two schedules of Learning Rate (LR), fixed LR and exponential decay LR, are elaborated. Then, to select the optimal hyperparameters for the DNN model, experiments of hyperparameters tuning related to activation functions and LR schedules are implemented, respectively. Finally, through a comprehensive evaluation of the training speed and the prediction accuracy, a DNN model that is with ReLU activation function and decay LR is determined. This DNN model can perform a dramatically high prediction accuracy in a fast training convergence speed for solving the proposed net photosynthesis prediction problem. © 2021 IEEE.","Commercial greenhouse; Deep Learning (DL); Deep Neural Network (DNN); Exponential decay learning rate; Net photosynthesis (Pn)","Chemical activation; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Greenhouses; Photosynthesis; Plants (botany); Activation functions; Comprehensive evaluation; Environmental parameter; Greenhouse production; Nonlinear relations; Prediction accuracy; Prediction problem; Quality of production; Deep learning",Conference Paper,Scopus

The aim of this study is to propose a novel weed detection system that provides accurate results in recognizing crops and weed using Machine Learning and Image Processing techniques. The image dataset chosen for this work is comprised of four different classes including broadleaf weed, grass, soil, and soybean. The proposed algorithm extracts texture and color features from each image in dataset and uses Random Forest algorithm to train a model using extracted feature descriptors.

They are inspired by the human brain structure and function as if they are based on interconnected nodes in which simple processing operations take place. The spectrum of neural networks application is very wide, and it also includes agriculture. Artificial neural networks are increasingly used by food producers at every stage of agricultural production and in efficient farm management. Examples of their applications include: forecasting of production effects in agriculture on the basis of a wide range of independent variables, verification of diseases and pests, intelligent weed control, and classification of the quality of harvested crops. Artificial intelligence methods support decision-making systems in agriculture, help optimize storage and transport processes, and make it possible to predict the costs incurred depending on the chosen direction of management. The inclusion of machine learning methods in the “life cycle of a farm” requires handling large amounts of data collected during the entire growing season and having the appropriate software. Currently, the visible development of precision farming and digital agriculture is causing more and more farms to turn to tools based on artificial intelligence.

The study was conducted in Spain, as one of the top European producers. Within-field grain yield data was obtained from a GPS combine harvester machine for 7 fields in 2018, which were consecutively processed to match Sentinel-2 10 m pixel size. Vegetation indices NDVI and GNDVI as well as biophysical parameters LAI and FAPAR were calculated from Sentinel-2 bands using the SNAP Sentinel2 ToolBox. Besides those, the Sentinel-2 10 m resolution spectral bands were used as variables for modeling, including multilinear, random forest and support vector machine regression. Various combinations of variables were tested to find the most suitable training dataset. At validation, the combination of LAI, FAPAR and Sentinel-2 10 m bands were found to be the most suitable (R2=0.77 and RSME=1.01 t/ha). The model developed with vegetation indices alone yielded the lowest R2 and highest RMSE (0.54 and 1.44 t/ha respectively).

The selected model was weighted and integrated in order to improve the accuracy of prediction, as it plays a key role in ensuring food security. Daily meteorological observations, winter wheat yield data, and growth period observations were obtained from 69 basic meteorological stations in Jiangsu Province from 1993 to 2018. Then, five methods of meteorological yield and trend yield separation (linear separation, percentage difference, 5- or 3-year sliding average, and quadratic curve) were compared. On this base, by using the fitting test and hind-casting test, we evaluated and analyzed the simulation effects of yield prediction methods based on similar years with bumper or poor harvest, key meteorological factors and climate suitability, and integrated the methods for Jiangsu winter wheat yield prediction. The results revealed the following: 1) For the same yield prediction method, the yield separation methods had a greater effect on prediction accuracy. The quadratic curve method was the best among the linear separation, percentage difference, 5- or 3-year sliding average and quadratic curve methods. The prediction accuracy of the weighting method was higher than the large probability method in the similar years with bumper or poor harvest prediction method. From 1993 to 2013, the average accuracy of the methods of the similar years with bumper or poor harvest prediction, key meteorological factor, and climate suitability were 89.67%, 94.86%, and 94.96%, respectively. 2) The accuracy of the integrated prediction method was more than 96.33% in the past 5 years, and it was higher than that of the similar years with bumper or poor harvest-weighting model, key factor-quadratic curve model and climate suitability-quadratic curve model. This could probably overcome the less stability of prediction accuracy of a single prediction method. 3) The closer the predicted time to the maturity period and the more comprehensive the prediction factor information, the higher the accuracy of the prediction model.

The paper considers two methods which are Extreme Learning Machine and Deep Learning. The simulation results show, in the training process, Deep Learning produces better b-value prediction performance as an earthquake precursor compared to Extreme Learning Machine.

Spectral vegetation indices for different dates were analysed together with apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) to obtain the best linear model to predict yield in critical moments of the barley cycle, in which it is still possible to apply variable rates of sidedress fertilizer to improve yield.

The Švihov dam catchment spreads over 1200 km2 and supplies over 1.5 million people in the capital of Prague and the Central Bohemian region with drinking water. Due to intensive agricultural activities and a lack of wastewater treatment plants in small settlements, the water quality is deteriorating. As a result, corrective measures need to be taken. Technological Agency of the Czech Republic supported this research which proposes different scenarios for a reduction of water quality degradation in the dam. The Trnávka dam watershed was chosen for study purposes as it occupies one quarter of the Švihov dam watershed. Hydrological balance was established using measured data. Point and non-point sources of nutrients were determined by field research and included in a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. This study aims to propose complex watershed management to improve the state of the environment in the entire area and to reduce eutrophication. Different management practices would reduce nutrient loads of streams and increase water quality which is the critical factor in dam eutrophication.

However, the acquisition and analysis of spectral data require costs and skills that are often not sufficiently available. In this context, the identification of geometric indices that allow the monitoring of spatial variability with low-cost instruments, without spectral analysis know-how but based on photogrammetry techniques with high-resolution RGB cameras, becomes extremely interesting. The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential of new canopy geometry-based indices for the characterization of vegetative and productive agronomic parameters compared to traditional NDVI based on spectral response of the canopy top. Furthermore, considering grape production as a key parameter directly linked to the economic profit of farmers, this study provides a deeper analysis focused on the development of a rapid yield forecast methodology based on UAV data, evaluating both traditional linear and machine learning regressions. Among the yield assessment models, one of the best results was obtained with the canopy thickness which showed high performance with the Gaussian process regression models (R2 = 0.80), while the yield prediction average accuracy of the best ML models reached 85.95%.

Occurrences and numbers of insects can be monitored through insect traps, which include their permanent touring and checking of their condition. Another more efficient way is to set up sensor devices with a camera at the traps that will photograph the traps and forward the images to the Internet, where the pest insect’s appearance will be predicted by image analysis. Weather conditions, temperature and relative humidity are the parameters that affect the appearance of some pests, such as Helicoverpa armigera. This paper presents a model of machine learning that can predict the appearance of insects during a season on a daily basis, taking into account the air temperature and relative humidity. Several machine learning algorithms for classification were applied and their accuracy for the prediction of insect occurrence was presented (up to 76.5%). Since the data used for testing were given in chronological order according to the days when the measurement was performed, the existing model was expanded to take into account the periods of three and five days. The extended method showed better accuracy of prediction and a lower percentage of false detections. In the case of a period of five days, the accuracy of the affected detections was 86.3%, while the percentage of false detections was 11%.

We tested six different artificial intelligence (AI) models using satellite images and meteorological data for the dominant growth period. To examine the effects of extreme weather events, we defined the drought and heatwave by considering the characteristics of corn growth and selected the cases for sensitivity tests from a historical database. In particular, we conducted an optimization for the hyperparameters of the deep neural network (DNN) model to ensure the best configuration for accuracy improvement. The result for drought cases showed that our DNN model was approximately 51-98% more accurate than the other five AI models in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). For the heatwave cases, our DNN model showed approximately 30-77% better accuracy in terms of RMSE. The correlation coefficient was 0.954 for drought cases and 0.887-0.914 for heatwave cases. Moreover, the accuracy of our DNN model was very stable, despite the increases in the duration of the heatwave.

Among the different approaches, machine learning (ML) techniques are being increasingly adopted, since they allow exploiting all the information on crop progress and environmental conditions and their relations with crop yield, achieving reliable and accurate estimations. However, interpreting the relationships learned by the ML models, and hence getting insights about the problem, remains a complex and usually unexplored task. Without accountability, confidence and trust in the ML models can be compromised. Here, we develop interpretable ML approaches for crop yield estimation that allow us investigating the most informative agro-ecological drivers and influencial regions learned by the models. We conduct a set of experiments to learn the selection of agro-ecological drivers leading to best estimations of main crops grown in Europe: corn, barley and wheat. As input data, we consider a variety of multi-scale Earth observation products sensitive to canopy greenness (e.g. EVI and LAI), its water-uptake dynamics (e.g. VOD) and available water (soil moisture), as well as climatic variables from the ERA5-Land reanalysis (e.g. temperature and radiation). Our results show that the best performances (R2&gt;0.55 for corn and R2&gt;0.8 for both barley and wheat) are obtained when descriptors of soil, vegetation, and atmosphere status are used as input in the ML models. This combination of variables outperforms the results obtained using single variables as inputs or all variables altogether. We then further analyze the relations of input features with crop yield in the developed models by means of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). We show how the information learned by the GPR model allows us to identify atypical or anomalous crop seasons across the study region, and investigate the underlying factors behind crop progress and failure in Europe. © 2021","Crop Yield Estimation; ERA5-Land; Gaussian Process; Interpretability; Machine Learning; MODIS; Optical and Passive Microwave sensors","crop yield; environmental conditions; Gaussian method; machine learning; MODIS; remote sensing; sensor; Europe",Article,Scopus

Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) enables accurate forest inventory, but it is expensive for large area analyses. Continuously increasing volume of open Earth Observation (EO) imagery from high-resolution (<30 m) satellites together with modern machine learning algorithms provide new prospects for spaceborne large area forest inventory. In this study, we investigated the capability of Sentinel-2 (S2) image and metadata, topography data, and canopy height model (CHM), as well as their combinations, to predict growing stock volume with deep neural networks (DNN) in four forestry districts in Central Finland. We focused on investigating the relevance of different input features, the effect of DNN depth, the amount of training data, and the size of image data sampling window to model prediction performance. We also studied model transfer between different silvicultural districts in Finland, with the objective to minimize the amount of new field data needed. We used forest inventory data provided by the Finnish Forest Centre for model training and performance evaluation. Leaving out CHM features, the model using RGB and NIR bands, the imaging and sun angles, and topography features as additional predictive variables obtained the best plot level accuracy (RMSE% = 42.6%, |BI AS%| = 0.8%). We found 3 × 3 pixels to be the optimal size for the sampling window, and two to three hidden layer DNNs to produce the best results with relatively small improvement to single hidden layer networks. Including CHM features with S2 data and additional features led to reduced relative RMSE (RMSE% = 28.6–30.7%) but increased the absolute value of relative bias (|BI AS%| = 0.9–4.0%). Transfer learning was found to be beneficial mainly with training data sets containing less than 250 field plots. The performance differences of DNN and random forest models were marginal.

Airborne hyperspectral data is widely utilized to retrieve leaf nitrogen concentration. Since the current algorithms cannot completely fulfill the accuracy requirement of precision agriculture, it is urgent to improve the retrieval accuracy of leaf nitrogen concentration. The accuracy of leaf nitrogen concentration retrieval is restricted by principle error and algorithm error. The principle error is generated in the process of specular reflection at the leaf surface. The radiant energy detected by sensors consists of a specular components and multiple scattering components. Solely the multiple scattering component carries vegetation biochemistry information (leaf nitrogen concentration, for instance). The specular component represents the energy reflected directly at the foliar wax layer, thus carries no inner information of the leaf. Based on the Fresnel formula, the specular component is partially polarized, and the multiple scattering component is unpolarized. Therefore, the principle error can be eliminated by the specular reflectance estimate, particularly with the aid of polarization reflectance modelling. The algorithm error is derived from the difference of airborne hyperspectral data mining capability between different algorithms. The performance of Partial Least Squares Regression, Principal Component Regression, Support Vector Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor Regression and Random Forest Regression are systematically compared in this research, and ultimately Random Forest Regression is chosen to reduce the algorithm error. In this research, in order to estimate the polarization reflectance of broadleaf and needle vegetation, multispectral data gained by POLDER/PARASOL satellite (equipped with multi-angle polarization sensors) are used to establish Bidirectional Polarization Distribution Function model. Hyperspectral data gained by the HySpex sensor system is used to conduct high-precision retrieval of leaf nitrogen concentration. Root Mean Square Error is taken as a major evaluation index. The conclusion is: After eliminating polarization reflectance in hyperspectral data, an average accuracy improvement of 4.244% is achieved among the above algorithms. Random Forest Regression is rather competitive by reaching 13.103% improvement in accuracy (RSQ 0.803, RMSE 0.252), which indicates that Random Forest is sensitive to polarization information. Compared to the basic method (Partial Least Squares Regression), the accuracy is improved by 32.440% after eliminating principle error and reducing algorithm error. In our research, the high-accuracy retrieval of leaf nitrogen concentration is realized, proving the significance of eliminating polarization reflectance and indicates the potential of random forest regression in hyperspectral remote sensing retrieval. © 2021, Peking University Press.

The components of IoT collect the observable data from different plants at different points. The data gathered through IoT components, such as sensors and cameras, can be used to be manipulated for a better farming-oriented decision-making process. This work proposes a system that observes the crops' growth and leaf diseases continuously for advising farmers in need. To provide analytical statistics on plant growth and disease patterns, the proposed framework uses machine learning (ML) techniques, such as support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN). This framework produces efficient crop condition notifications to terminal IoT components which are assisting in irrigation, nutrition planning, and environmental compliance related to the farming lands. In this regard, this work proposes ensemble classification and pattern recognition for crop monitoring system (ECPRC) to identify plant diseases at the early stages.

Generally, paddy harvest, price, and demand for rice depend on several factors: rainfall, humidity, paddy cultivation area, temperature, etc. Therefore, precisely predicting the future harvest of paddy and consumption demand of rice is complicated. It creates a necessary requirement of a management platform to predict future paddy harvest and rice demands considering important parameters. Such platform will help the countries in the processes of national strategy development, to maintain a sustainable approach between paddy cultivation and rice demand. We have proposed a centralized management platform, where we would analyze numerous factors affecting on the amount of crop yield on the next harvesting season and the factors affecting on future demand for rice. The proposed platform follows the smart agri/farm approach for paddy related processes, with three functional features: (1) paddy harvest prediction module, (2) rice demand prediction module, and (3) an optimal planning module for crop distribution. Two popular machine learning algorithms, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are used to develop the prediction modules.

There has been limited knowledge on the efficacy of leguminous tree biomass on maize yield when grown after a crop with a high nitrogen (N) demand. One such crop is cotton. The current study was undertaken with the objective of determining the efficacy of either gliricidia or tephrosia biomass application with or without inorganic fertilizer on maize yield cultivated after cotton and also after land fallowing. Significant variations in grain yield (P = 0.0038) were obtained in the second cropping season (2016/17) but not in the first cropping season (2014/15), except maize stover (P < 0.0016). Significant variations were also obtained during 2016/17 season with respect to maize cob yield (P < 0.0041) and stover yield (P = 0.0062). Grain yield was significantly higher where inorganic fertilizer was applied with gliricidia biomass than where inorganic fertilizer was applied alone. A similar trend was also observed during the first cropping season though not significantly different. Lower grain yield was obtained when cotton crop preceded maize crop indicating a need for a higher N fertilizer dose for maize crop cultivated after cotton. Application of a half dose of inorganic fertilizer together with gliricidia biomass showed high and steady grain yield over the yield obtained when inorganic fertilizer was applied alone. It is concluded that soil fertility amendment with inorganic fertilizer is needed after a cotton crop. Also, the use of a half dose of inorganic N fertilizer with gliricidia was effective, suggesting that a full dose with gliricidia biomass was rather surplus to the requirements for maize production.

Firstly, in order to reduce the influence of light on image processing, the RGB color image is converted to HSI color image, and the S component image of the HSI color space is extracted as a research object. Then, the S component image is binarized by the Otsu method, the hole of the binary image is filled by morphology closing algorithm, and the sugarcane and the background are initially separated by the horizontal projection map of the binary image. Finally, the position of sugarcane stem is preliminarily determined by continuously taking the derivative of the vertical projection function of the binary image, and the sum of the local pixel value of the suspicious pixel column is compared to further determine the sugarcane stem node. The experimental results showed that the recognition rate of single stem node is 100%, and the standard deviation is less than 1.1 mm. The accuracy of simultaneous identification of double stem nodes is 98%, and the standard deviation is less than 1.7 mm. The accuracy of simultaneous identification of the three stem nodes is 95%, and the standard deviation is less than 2.2 mm.

In this study, we demonstrate the use of agronomic knowledge of crop growth drivers in a Long Short-Term Memory-based, domain-guided neural network (DgNN) for in-season crop progress estimation. The DgNN uses a branched structure and attention to separate independent crop growth drivers and captures their varying importance throughout the growing season. The DgNN is implemented for corn, using RS data in Iowa, U.S., for the period 2003–2019, with United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) crop progress reports used as ground truth. State-wide DgNN performance shows significant improvement over sequential and dense-only NN structures, and a widely-used Hidden Markov Model method. The DgNN had a 4.0% higher Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency over all growth stages and 39% more weeks with highest cosine similarity than the next best NN during test years. The DgNN and Sequential NN were more robust during periods of abnormal crop progress, though estimating the Silking–Grainfill transition was difficult for all methods. Finally, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection visualizations of layer activations showed how LSTM-based NNs separate crop growth time-series differently from a dense-only structure. Results from this study exhibit both the viability of NNs in crop growth stage estimation (CGSE) and the benefits of using domain knowledge. The DgNN methodology presented here can be extended to provide near-real time CGSE of other crops. © 2021 by the authors.

However, selecting the most appropriate technologies from a wide range of options is never an easy job. In this context, several authors consider Smart Farming as the best solution. However, they fall short in providing more information to recommend the most appropriate IoT technology, the options to manage the IoT infrastructure, and the services to crop management plans and crop production estimation. This paper implements a Smart Farming System based on a three-layered architecture (Agriculture Perception, Edge Computing, and Data Analytics). In the Agriculture Perception Layer, we evaluated Omicron, Libelium, and Intel technologies under criteria such as the price, the number of inputs for sensor connection, communication protocols, portability, battery life, and harvesting energy system photovoltaic panel. We evaluated edge-based management mechanisms in the Edge Layer to provide data reliability, focusing on outlier detection and treatment using Machine Learning and Interpolation algorithms. We recommend the Isolation Forest algorithm for classifying outliers in the monthly temperature dataset (99% of precision) and the Cubic Spline technique for effectively replacing the data classified as outliers (RMSE lower than 0.085). In the Data Analytics Layer, we evaluated different machine learning algorithms to estimate coffee production. The results show that the measured error values of the XGBOOST algorithm keep the values lower than the other models (RMSE 0.008, MAE 0.032, and RSE 0.585). The www.iot-agro.com platform offers farmer services such as weather variables monitoring, coffee production estimating, and IoT infrastructure setting.

Simple and accurate statistical techniques are essential to predict sugar beet yield loss as an industrial crop for agricultural management specialists. The objectives of the present study were to compare: (1) the prediction capabilities of different statistical models at several regions and cultivars, (2) the effectiveness of artificial neural network (ANN) models to predict root rot yield loss, and (3) the effectiveness of simple and multiple linear regression models compare to ANN models. In order to measure crop loss, during two consecutive growing seasons, eleven different sugar beet cultivars were planted in the infected fields in Qazvin, Torbate Jam, Urmia and Kermanshah regions in Iran. To calculate the crop loss, the correlation between Disease incidence (DI) and the important components was considered. The highest correlation (P ≤ 0.01) was observed between DI and Root yield (RY), so we developed different yield loss models. Consequently, the best-fitted simple regression model obtained for RC01 and Urmia with 94.51 % and 90.44 % R-squared, respectively. Then the proper parameters specified in the regression models considered to develop an ANN model using Matlab software to predict the yield loss. Interestingly, obtained ANN models resulted in R2, RMSE of 87.07 %, 5.01 and the lowest AIC vs. 86.78 % and 6.033 for final linear regression, respectively.

Due to higher population growth and recent climate change scenarios, it is crucial to get timely and accurate rice yield estimates and production forecast of the growing season for governments, planners, and decision makers in formulating policies regarding import/export in the event of shortfall and/or surplus. This study aims to quantify the rice yield at various phenological stages from hyper-temporal satellite-derived-vegetation indices computed from time series Sentinel-II images. Different vegetation indices (viz. NDVI, EVI, SAVI, and REP) were used to predict paddy yield. The predicted yield was validated through RMSE and ME statistical techniques. The integration of PLSR and sequential time-stamped vegetation indices accurately predicted rice yield (i.e., maximum R2 = 0.84 and minimum RMSE = 0.12 ton ha−1 equal to 3% of the mean rice yield). Moreover, our results also established that optimal time spans for predicting rice yield are late vegetative and reproductive (flowering) stages.

This study uses Pucheng County, Fujian Province, a demonstration county of China Good Grains and Oils, as the research area. Using actual rice yield sample data and environment data, a yield simulation model based on random forest regression is constructed to realize a fine-scale simulation of rice yield and its spatial distribution pattern in Pucheng County. On this basis, we construct a method system to identify spatial combination patterns between rice yields and fine-scale multidimensional environmental planting suitability using rice yield data and environmental planting suitability evaluation data. We categorize the areas into four combination model areas to analyze the spatial correlation model of planting suitability, multidimensional environment, and yield: higher-yield and higher-suitability cluster–comprehensive environmental-advantage areas, high-yield and high-suitability cluster–soil condition-limited areas, moderate-yield and moderate-suitability cluster–irrigation and drainage condition-limited areas, and low-yield and low-suitability cluster–site condition-limited areas. The following results are found. (1) The rice yield simulation model, which is based on random forest regression, considers the various complex relationships between yield and natural as well as human factors to realize the refined simulation of rice yields at a county scale. (2) The county rice yield has a strong positive spatial correlation, and the spatial clustering characteristics are obvious; these relationships can provide a basis for effectively imple-menting intensive rice planting in Pucheng County. (3) We construct a spatial combination pattern recognition method based on rice yield and environmental planting suitability. We can use this method to effectively identify the spatial relationship between yield and planting suitability as well as the shortcomings and advantages of different regions in terms of the climate, soil, irrigation, site, mechanical farming, and similar factors. On this basis, we can provide regional rice planting guidance for Pucheng County.

It generates a magnetic field which released in solar flares or coronal mass ejections for 11-year solar cycle that causes the occurrence of space weather. Different researchers in different parts of the world indicated that space weather highly affects agriculture production. However, in Ethiopia context especially Chokie mountain basin the influence of space weather on agriculture was not documented. Hence, this paper was aimed at investigating the impact of space weather on agriculture products over Chokie mountain basin. Assessment of space weather impacts on agriculture product is quite useful to balance energy and food security over developing countries like Ethiopia. Space weather (sunspot number), precipitation, temperature, and agriculture data were used for this study. Descriptive quantitative design method was applied on the data of agriculture products and climate variables. Furthermore, regression models with the help of MATLAB software were applied for data analysis. The relation between crop yield (teff, wheat, and maize) with sunspot number, temperature, and precipitation were analyzed in each agro-ecological zones using 31 years (1990–2019) data over Chokie mountain basin. The results showed that correlation coefficients between sunspot number with annual average value of temperature, precipitation, maize, teff, and wheat were found 0.11, − 0.32, − 0.47, − 0.52, and − 0.59, respectively. Sunspot had highly negatively correlated with annual spatial average value of teff and wheat. Generally, the occurrence of space weather (sunspot) leads to reduction of wheat and teff over the study area. Hence, shifting cultivation strategy is needed for local community during the occurrence of 11-year solar cycles frequency.

Over the years, many sugarcane yield monitoring approaches have been developed and tested, but its use is still limited. One option is to use data generated by the sugarcane harvester provided in the controller area network (CAN), which allows getting the messages related to the harvester operation. Our goal was to train and to test random forest (RF), multiple linear regression (MLR), and artificial neural network (ANN) using CAN data available on the on-board computer of the harvester. All predictive models were trained and tested using the main engine parameters: fuel consumption, engine rotation, engine power, and specific fuel consumption (SFC) as data input. A scale yield monitor was installed on the harvester elevator to provide the georeferenced yield data. The yield prediction accuracy of the predictive models using the four parameters was compared. All models followed the observed sugarcane yield and recognized the changes over the time of data collection. The MLR and ANN models have a higher error of prediction in the extreme values of yield. Over the testing time, the ANN underestimated the sugarcane yield, and the RF prediction by the engine parameters of the harvester was coming closest to the observed yield. The best results for predicting sugarcane yield by engine parameters were obtained from the RF model with a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 5.6%, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.0 Mg ha−1. The MLR and ANN models have a MAPE of 7.8% and 5.6%, respectively.

It can be determined by different parameters such as temperature/humidity, soil mineral contents, soil pH level, salinity level, climatic conditions, moisture of the soil, etc. These parameters must meet the optimum level to make a desirable environment to sustain productivity. Failure to provide the required condition from any of the parameters will lead the plant to stress and deteriorate, potentially leading to a loss in productivity. Laborious ways of monitoring the agricultural parameters are inefficient and time-consuming. An automated irrigation system is essential for the proper growth of crops. Excessive watering of crops and crop water dehydration can lead to stresses that affect the growth of plants. Supplying an optimum amount of water is essential for the healthy development of plants. The IoT and artificial intelligence technologies are the most viable alternative solution for traditional yield prediction and irrigation because of the remote accessibility, interoperability, cognitive capability, etc. These technologies aid the farmers in monitoring agricultural parameters remotely from embedded devices, drastically reducing human efforts. It makes farming much efficient and a smarter farming experience and also increases crop productivity exponentially. This chapter has manifested the current environmental problems and the potential future challenges that may decrease crop productivity of the crops. It also shows how the sensor technology has gradually evolved the traditional farming experience to solve problems and the possibilities of transforming the current farming practices into much more innovative and eco-friendly with the emergence of artificial intelligence technologies.

Efficient modelling of agro-climatic indices will simplify the upscaling of experimental observations and aid in the implementation of climate-smart agriculture. This paper aims to present a comprehensive review of the use of machine learning algorithms for modelling agro-climatic indices.

This study aimed to investigate the performance of artificial neural network (ANN), multiple linear regression (MLR), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) in terms of saffron yield estimation in some lands of Golestan province, Iran. To this end, 100 areas under saffron cultivation were selected. For rapid and low-cost saffron yield estimation, six different models were designed based on soil properties as inputs using MLR, ANN, and ANFIS methods. According to the results, ANN showed the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.58–0.89) in estimating saffron yield as compared to MLR (R2 = 0.41–0.47) and ANFIS (R2 = 0.41–0.69) models. A comparison of the results obtained from the six models defined in these three methods indicated that Model 4 (R2Reg = 0.45, R2ANFIS = 0.57, R2ANN = 0.87), with the inputs, organic phosphorus, potassium, and calcium carbonate, was the best model in terms of accuracy and speed in estimating saffron yield phosphorus. The RI indexes for ANN in the model were 50% and 34% relative to MLR and ANFIS, respectively, demonstrating the higher accuracy of ANN in saffron yield estimation. The study results can be used to identify lands suitable for saffron cultivation in the study area using organic phosphorus and organic matter levels in the soil. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","artificial neural network; Golestan; multiple linear regression; Saffron","accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; comparative study; crop yield; cultivation; estimation method; herb; organic phosphorus; soil organic matter; soil property; Golestan; Iran",Article,Scopus

The overarching approach is to develop and adopt a systems-agronomy framework relevant to any wheat production system. It first establishes the scale of current yield gaps, identifies defensible benchmarks, and takes a holistic approach to understand and overcome exploitable yield gaps to complement genetic increases in potential yield. New opportunities to increase productivity will be sought by exploiting future Genotype × Environment × Management synergies in different wheat systems. To identify research gaps and opportunities for collaboration among different wheat producing regions, the EWG compiled a comprehensive database of currently funded wheat agronomy research (n = 782) in countries representing a large proportion of the wheat grown in the world. The yield gap analysis and research database positions the EWG to influence priorities for wheat agronomy research in member countries that would facilitate collaborations, minimize duplication, and maximize the global impact on wheat production systems.

Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) may be a useful tool for this purpose. The objective of this study was to assess the use of UAS with true color and multispectral imagery to predict the yield and total cellulosic content (TCC) of newly created energy cane germplasm. A trial was established in the growing season of 2016 at the Texas A&M AgriLife Research Center in Weslaco, Texas, where 15 energy cane elite lines and three checks were grown on experimental plots, arranged in a complete block design and replicated four times. Four flights were executed at different growth stages in 2018, at the first ratoon crop, using two multi-rotor UAS: the DJI Phantom 4 Pro equipped with RGB camera and the DJI Matrice 100, equipped with multispectral sensor (SlantRange 3p). Canopy cover, canopy height, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and ExG (Excess Green Index) were extracted from the images and used to perform a stepwise regression to obtain the yield and TCC models. The results showed a good agreement between the predicted and the measured yields (R2 = 0.88); however, a low coefficient of determination was found between the predicted and the observed TCC (R2 = 0.30). This study demonstrated the potential application of UAS to estimate energy cane yield with high accuracy, enabling plant breeders to phenotype larger populations and make selections with higher confidence. © 2020 by the authors.

Systematic sampling was done at 184 sampling points at the 8-leaf to early-flowering and at lentil maturity. The weed density and height as well as canopy cover of the weeds and lentil were measured in the first sampling stage. In addition, weed species richness, diversity and evenness were calculated. The measured variables in the first sampling stage were considered as predictive variables. In the second sampling stage, lentil yield and biomass dry weight were recorded at the same sampling points as the first sampling stage. The lentil yield and biomass were considered as dependent variables. The model input data included the total raw and standardized variables of the first sampling stage, as well as the raw and standardized variables with a significant relationship to the lentil yield and biomass extracted from stepwise regression and correlation methods. The results showed that neural network prediction accuracy was significantly more than multiple regression. The best network in predicting yield of lentil was the principal component analysis network (PCA), made from total standardized data, with a correlation coefficient of 80% and normalized root mean square error of 5.85%. These values in the best network (a PCA neural network made from standardized data with significant relationship to lentil biomass) were 79% and 11.36% for lentil biomass prediction, respectively.

However, to have satisfactory performance and avoid overfitting, training deep neural nets typically requires thousands of labeled images. This leads to tedious pixelwise labeling for semantic segmentation. In this paper, we hinge on the recent development in data augmentation and utilize the concept further for semantic segmentation and classification of crops and weeds. To be specific, we propose a novel data augmentation framework, based on the random image cropping and patching (RICAP) method, which is originally designed to augment data for generic image classification. The proposed framework introduces novel enhancements to the original RICAP so that it can be effectively used for data augmentation of semantic segmentation tasks. We evaluate the proposed methodology on two datasets from different farms. Comprehensive experimental evaluations and ablation studies show that the proposed framework can effectively improve segmentation accuracies, and the enhancements made over the original RICAP actually contribute to the performance gain. On average, the proposed method increases the mean accuracy and mean intersection over union (IOU) of the deep neural net with the conventional data augmentation (random flipping, rotation and colour jitter) from 91.01 to 94.02 and from 63.59 to 70.77 respectively for Narrabri dataset, and from 97.99 to 98.51 and from 74.26 to 77.09 respectively for Bonn dataset.

Techniques such as regression and simulation have been used by various studies to model and predict maize yield. This study used a feed-forward, back propagation artificial neural network with levenberg-marquardt algorithm for training. Artificial neural networks framework was chosen because its a data driven method that is relatively less widely used in county level yield prediction. Moreover, neural networks has key merits, such as require less formal statistical training, ability to detect nonlinear relationships by identifying likely interactions between variables and the availability of multiple training algorithms. We modelled historical maize yield between 2005–2016 as function of satellite derived precipitation, temperature, reference crop evapotranspiration, soil moisture and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to predict maize yields at pixel level. The data were obtained with a spatial resolution of ≈ 4 km and subsequently, the predictions was done at ≈ 4 km pixel size. The historical reference maize yield data was divided into two sets for model training and validation. The model predicted maize yield with R2 and root mean square error of 0.76 and 0.038 MT/ha in Trans-Nzoia county and 0.86 and 0.016 MT/ha, respectively, in Nakuru county.

Crucial for this technique to work is a sufficient amount of data. This can either be very long time-series data or fine-grained time-series data. If the data is insufficient, in terms of length or complexity, LSTM approaches perform poorly. We propose a fractal interpolation approach to generate a more fine-grained time series out of insufficient data sets. The interpolation is dynamically adapted to the time series using a time-dependent complexity feature so that the complexity properties of the interpolated time series are related to that of the original one. Also we perform a linear interpolation with the same number of interpolation points to compare results. This paper shows that predictions of fractal interpolated and linear interpolated time series clearly outperform the ones of the original data for a test fit on unknown data. Though predictions of linear and fractal interpolated time series data perform very similar, the fractal interpolated ones outperform the linear interpolated ones on difficult time series data. Also, though the complexities of sub-intervals are tailored to match the one from the original data, the interpolated time series shows a much higher degree of persistency and (in terms of the Hurst exponent) a much higher degree of long term memory. © 2020","Chaos; Deep learning; Fractal dimension; Hurst exponent; Hyperchaos; Linear interpolation; LSTM; Lyapunov exponent; Machine learning; R/S analysis; Time series analysis; Time series data; Time series prediction","Complex networks; Deep learning; Forecasting; Fractals; Interpolation; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Fractal interpolation; Insufficient data sets; Interpolation points; Learning methods; Linear Interpolation; Long time series; Neural network predictions; Time-series data; Time series",Article,Scopus

Different from previous years, crop yield estimation is conducted every month in actual agricultural insurance nowadays. Crop yield estimation needs to be provided in a timely and accurate manner. It is a key issue to use multitemporal remote sensing data effectively and flexibly. With the development of remote sensing and computer science, state-of the-art research on crop yield estimation has shifted from relying on a single static state to a combination of multiple spectral and time-series information. We propose a method to divide multispectral data into a single time phase in deep learning and then combine the information of the multitemporal results on each neural network model. This can maintain the accuracy of the original information although the remote sensing multi-time series data is missing in some time phases. However, in actual practice, more accurate results can be further obtained with the superposition of new time-series data. We trained several semantic segmentation models for each individual time-series dataset. On the single time phase model, the accuracy of rice classification, corn classification and forest classification were 85.9%-92.8%, 77%-93% and 77%-87.6% respectively. Furthermore, the classification accuracy of our method for all catalogs reached 92.6% by the multi-temporal verification dataset from May to September of 2017.

Most of the farmers in India depend on rainfall as the primary source of irrigation which implies that rainfall is directly linked to the yield. The quantity of rain a land receives helps in planning which crop to sow and also in which month the farmer should begin farming. Precipitation is not only limited to agriculture, even the infrastructure development sector has to keep track of the monsoon season and amount of rainfall that a construction site will receive because of the influence it has on construction projects. It also serves as one of the most important sources of freshwater for all living things on the planet. As rainfall prediction model gives data on the impact of various climatological variables on rainfall amounts it has many applications across many sectors.

This can be done by choosing the proper season for the crop and employing the cultivation land. The data analysis study is conducted on 124 crop varieties in the 33 Indian states in different weather conditions. The data analysis used a two-factor experimental design. The data analysis helps the farmer select the crop in the region and weather conditions that can have more productivity results. The study shows that the Kharif and Rabi season is the most favorable season for agriculture. Other than these seasons, agricultural activities are also done in summer, winter, autumn, and the whole year. The yield from the crops based on the seasonal weather information is a challenge in the agricultural sector. Amongst the variety of fruits, vegetables, seeds, and nuts, the majorly grown are pulses in all the states, rice has the largest producers. Data analysis is an important concept to understand the data wisely. This study helps the smallholder farmer in decision making to increase crop productivity due to climate risk and trends.

Based on the multiple linear regression algorithm, many factors affecting CET4 are analyzed. Ideas based on data mining, collecting history data and appropriate to transform, using statistical analysis techniques to the many factors influencing the CET-4 test were analyzed, and we have obtained the CET-4 test result and its influencing factors. It was found that the linear regression relationship between the degrees of fit was relatively high. We further improve the algorithm and establish a partition-weighted K-nearest neighbor algorithm. The K-weighted K nearest neighbor algorithm and the partition algorithm are used in the CET-4 test score classification prediction, and the statistical method is used to study the relevant factors that affect the CET-4 test score, and screen classification is performed to predict when the comparison verification will pass. The weight K of the input feature and the adjacent feature are weighted, although the allocation algorithm of the adjacent classification effect has not been significantly improved, but the stability classification is better than K-nearest neighbor algorithm, its classification efficiency is greatly improved, classification time is greatly reduced, and classification efficiency is increased by 119%.

Understanding relationship of water extraction of groundwater can lead to better watershed management. The main problem in this study is the complexity of recharge processes and limited observations in groundwater recharge in Malaysia makes it difficult to quantify. This study was done at Baung’s watershed (BW) which can be considered as an ungauged watershed. The estimation of groundwater recharge in BW was done using SWAT. However, BW cannot be calibrated due to lack of streams station availability but the uncalibrated SWAT able to provide satisfactory predictions on hydrologic budget. A framework for SWAT input data including hydrography, terrain, land-use, soil, and weather for BW was then focused in order to achieve the model simulation for ungauged basins. The results emphasize the importance and prospects of using accurate spatial input data for the physically based SWAT model. Normal condition, extreme-low precipitation and future in land-use development represented as scenarios 1, 2, and 3 were evaluated in this study. These conditions give different groundwater recharge rate as different scenarios give different impact to groundwater.

The collected images are then fed into a fire detection model trained using a variety of classifiers for performance comparisons. The results display that the proposed solution has an accuracy of 97%, which can be further increased with a refined dataset dedicated solely to fraud detection. © 2020 The Authors.

More than 70% to 80% rural households depend on agriculture. India's agriculture is composed various crops such as the foremost essential food being rice and wheat with sugarcane, oilseeds, and such non-food items as cotton, rubber and jute. Crop productivity per hector in India are generally low because of an exponential rise in population, extensive utilization of natural resources, increase in pollution levels due to the saturated industrial growth, overuse of automobiles, overrunning of people on farmland to build residential complex because of this the environmental balance is getting affected to a great extent, directly impacting on the very important growth factor of the country i.e. Agriculture. As increase in population the demand of staple food getting increases but due to unpredictable rain or windstorm or a predictable rain that does not turn up on time, spoils everything. This leads to a huge loss to the farmer, the consumers and ultimately the nation. By taking into consideration of above scenario we are trying to prevent the accidental measures using continuous live observation and weather forecasting so that farmer could get notification time to time like what is going to happen regarding environmental? What types of precaution should I take while farming? What types of disinfectant spraying should I? Because of this pre-intimation of the system, one can notify unpredictable rain or windstorm or a predictable rain that does not turn up on time, result of this, will try to avoid spoils of crops and try to increase the crop yield. © 2019 IEEE.","Agriculture; Crop; Deep Learning etc","Agricultural robots; Crops; Oils and fats; Population statistics; Rain; Weather forecasting; Crop productivity; Environmental balance; Growth factor; Industrial growth; Pollution level; Residential complexes; Rural households; Staple food; Deep learning",Conference Paper,Scopus

Genomic selection enables the breeders to select individuals with improved phenotypes even before growing them. Existing genomic selection is made mostly through statistical methods that do not accurately predict complex non-linear traits. Deep learning and other machine learning methods have been applied, but most of the deep learning methods are not specifically designed for genomic selection. Also, there has been relatively little comparison between different machine learning methods. We propose three ensemble learning methods: i) ensemble support vector regression; ii) ensemble deep convolutional neural networks and iii) random forests; to predict phenotype with high accuracy. We also propose a feature selection strategy that identifies important markers and contributes to improved phenotype prediction. The proposed marker selection strategy is independent of machine learning methods; thus, the markers that are selected remain the same when the machine learning model is changed. We employed our methods to Iranian wheat landraces. The result shows that ensemble learning methods are better than the single machine learning methods with the lowest PCC 0.339 for plant height and the highest PCC 0.747 for grain length. Our models are also robust as they rank both top twenty and bottom twenty individuals well with nDCG@20 ranges from 0.188 to 0.712. © 2019 IEEE.","deep learning; ensemble learning; genomic selection; machine learning","Agricultural robots; Bioinformatics; Convolutional neural networks; Decision trees; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Genes; Support vector regression; Ensemble learning; High-accuracy; Learning methods; Machine learning methods; Machine learning models; Non linear; Plant height; Single- machines; Learning systems",Conference Paper,Scopus

These modifications can have a natural origin due to phenomena such as climate variation, fires, or floods; or they can be anthropic, due to the unsustainable use of forest resources. In general, according to the dominance of the different strata, the forests are classified as virgin, successional, or renoval. In the realization of inventories, there are situations in which the operator can offer a doubtful classification with a high degree of subjectivity. The purpose of this work has been to provide to technicians an objective tool for the classification of successional status in native forests. In this work, it has been found that there is a relationship between the presence of combinations of different plant species, both arboreal and shrub, related to the classification of forests. This relationship has been analyzed through the application of neural networks in two steps: First, a perceptron was applied, then a probabilistic neural network. The analysis through an artificial neuronal network of these two stages has allowed us to develop equations that through the presence/absence of 16 species allows to classify objectively the successional state.

At present, spectral index for multi-band calculation has been widely used in empirical/semi-empirical estimation of canopy chlorophyll content. Taking the difference of leaf inclination angle distribution (LAD) between different crops and different varieties of homogeneous crop into consideration, this study analyzed the influence of LAD on retrieving chlorophyll content, and selected chlorophyll-related spectral indices that are insensitive to the variation of LAD and researched canopy chlorophyll retrieval model. PROSAIL radiative transfer model was used for simulating the canopy reflectance corresponding to different leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), leaf area index (LAI) and LAD. The simulation results showed that under the same LAI and LCC conditions, the canopy reflectance corresponding to different LAD was significantly different, and the canopy reflectance decreased with the increase of the average LAD. By calculating the correlation coefficient of 12 common chlorophyll-related spectral indices with CCC, the sensitivity of spectral indices in retrieval of chlorophyll content under different LAD was evaluated, consequently, four spectral indices that are insensitive to variation of LAD were selected: MTCI, MNDVI1, CIred-edge and MNDVI8.80 measured corn samples were utilized to model and validate the estimation models of CCC. Model establishment and verification results showed MNDVI8 was the most insensitive to variation of LAD, thus it was the best spectral index for estimating chlorophyll content with the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.70 and the root mean square error (RMSE) of 22.47 μg•cm-2. The precision of CIred-edge (R2=0.63, RMSE=24.06 μg•cm-2), MNDVI (R2=0.66, RMSE=24.07 μg•cm-2) and MTCI (R2=0.65, RMSE=26.76 μg•cm-2) retrieval model was relatively close but was weaker than that of MNDVI8. Through analyzing the retrieval results, it was concluded that different spectral indices had different sensitivities to variation of LAD. The preferred spectral indices generally had the best correlation and highest sensitivity to chlorophyll content, among which MNDVI8 was least affected by LAD and can be used to retrieve CCC in corn under different LAD types. Although retrieval capabilities of MTCI, CIred-edge and MNDVI1 were slightly weaker than MNDVI8, they were less affected by variation of LAD and also had good retrieval capabilities. This paper researched the influence of LAD on retrieving chlorophyll content based on spectral indices, and the results from measured corn data were in accordance with those from simulated data. Based on the sensitivity analysis and validation results of canopy chlorophyll content retrieval models under different LAD types, this paper has a certain reference significance for remote sensing application of estimation of chlorophyll content in crop without prior knowledge of LAD in large scale. © 2019, Peking University Press.

To circumvent the lack of socio-economic data at high granularity, computer vision has already been applied successfully to raw satellite imagery sampled from resource poor countries. In this work we apply a similar approach to the metropolitan areas of five different cities in North and South America, starting from pre-trained convolutional models used for poverty mapping in developing regions. Applying a transfer learning process we estimate household income from visual satellite features. The urban environment we consider is characterized by different features with respect to the resource-poor training environment, such as the high heterogeneity in population density.

Traditional approach of processing data is not capable of processing the humongous data generated these days. So to overcome the problem of smart processing of data, Big Data analytics came into existence. Many scientists are working to make it more efficient.

The aim of such sequences is to use not only spatial information but also the temporal dimension of the data, which is used for multiple real-world applications, such as classification, segmentation, anomaly detection, and prediction. Several traditional machine learning algorithms have been developed and successfully applied to time series for predictions. However, these methods have limitations in some situations, thus deep learning (DL) techniques have been introduced to achieve the best performance. Reviews of machine learning and DL methods for time series prediction problems have been conducted in previous studies. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these surveys have addressed the specific case of works using DL techniques and satellite images as datasets for predictions. Therefore, this paper concentrates on the DL applications for SITS prediction, giving an overview of the main elements used to design and evaluate the predictive models, namely the architectures, data, optimization functions, and evaluation metrics. The reviewed DL-based models are divided into three categories, namely recurrent neural network based models, hybrid models, and feed-forward-based models (convolutional neural networks and multi-layer perceptron). The main characteristics of satellite images and the major existing applications in the field of SITS prediction are also presented in this article. These applications include weather forecasting, precipitation nowcasting, spatio-temporal analysis, and missing data reconstruction. Finally, current limitations and proposed workable solutions related to the use of DL for SITS prediction are also highlighted. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aims to develop an early forecasting model of cereal yields (soft wheat, barley and durum wheat) at the scale of the agricultural province considering the 15 most productive over 2000–2017 (i.e., 15 × 18 = 270 yields values). To this objective, we built on previous works that showed a tight linkage between cereal yields and various datasets including weather data (rainfall and air temperature), regional climate indices (North Atlantic Oscillation in particular), and drought indices derived from satellite observations in different wavelengths. The combination of the latter three data sets is assessed to predict cereal yields using linear (Multiple Linear Regression, MLR) and non-linear (Support Vector Machine, SVM; Random Forest, RF, and eXtreme Gradient Boost, XGBoost) machine learning algorithms. The calibration of the algorithmic parameters of the different approaches are carried out using a 5-fold cross validation technique and a leave-one-out method is implemented for model validation. The statistical metrics of the models are first analyzed as a function of the input datasets that are used, and as a function of the lead times, from 4 months to 2 months before harvest. The results show that combining data from multiple sources outperformed models based on one dataset only. In addition, the satellite drought indices are a major source of information for cereal prediction when the forecasting is carried out close to harvest (2 months before), while weather data and, to a lesser extent, climate indices, are key variables for earlier predictions. The best models can accurately predict yield in January (4 months before harvest) with an R2 = 0.88 and RMSE around 0.22 t. ha−1 . The XGBoost method exhibited the best metrics. Finally, training a specific model separately for each group of provinces, instead of one global model, improved the prediction performance by reducing the RMSE by 10% to 35% depending on the provinces. In conclusion, the results of this study pointed out that combining remote sensing drought indices with climate and weather variables using a machine learning technique is a promising approach for cereal yield forecasting. © 2021 by the authors.

Due to the absence of complex microbial network interactions and soil heterogeneity in a restricted soilless medium, the architecture of roots is a function of genetics defined by the soilless matrix and exogenously supplied nutrients such as nitrogen (N). The knowledge of root trait combinations that offer the optimal nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is far from being conclusive. The objective of this study was to define the root trait(s) that best predicts and correlates with vegetative biomass under differed N treatments. We used eight image-derived root architectural traits of 202 diverse spinach lines grown in two N concentrations (high N, HN, and low N, LN) in randomized complete blocks design. Supervised random forest (RF) machine learning augmented by ranger hyperparameter grid search was used to predict the variable importance of the root traits. We also determined the broad-sense heritability (H) and genetic (rg) and phenotypic (rp) correlations between root traits and the vegetative biomass (shoot weight, SWt). Each root trait was assigned a predicted importance rank based on the trait’s contribution to the cumulative reduction in the mean square error (MSE) in the RF tree regression models for SWt. The root traits were further prioritized for potential selection based on the rg and SWt correlated response (CR). The predicted importance of the eight root traits showed that the number of root tips (Tips) and root length (RLength) under HN and crossings (Xsings) and root average diameter (RAvdiam) under LN were the most relevant. SWt had a highly antagonistic rg (− 0.83) to RAvdiam, but a high predicted indirect selection efficiency (− 112.8%) with RAvdiam under LN; RAvdiam showed no significant rg or rp to SWt under HN. In limited N availability, we suggest that selecting against larger RAvdiam as a secondary trait might improve biomass and, hence, NUE with no apparent yield penalty under HN. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"nitrogen; anatomy and histology; biomass; genetics; machine learning; metabolism; phenotype; plant root; quantitative trait; seedling; spinach; Biomass; Machine Learning; Nitrogen; Phenotype; Plant Roots; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Seedlings; Spinacia oleracea",Article,Scopus

However, it requires high-quality daily weather data for the model establishment and verification, and the low data availability limits the application of CGM at the regional scale. With the rapid development of machine learning techniques, adapting data-driven machine learning algorithms to build a meta-model with environmental feature variables at the desired spatio-temporal scale provides a new method for regional yield simulation. In this study, we developed four machine-learning-based meta-models to simulate regional yield potential (RYP) of wheat in China with the selected environmental feature variables and assessed four different machine learning algorithms, including multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural networks (ANN), random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR). The research aimed to verify whether these meta-models can outperform CGM in simulating RYP. The results showed that the meta-models could reduce the requirements of the number of input variables and the amount of data for RYP simulation and maintain the simulation accuracy because monthly weather variables could replace daily weather variables in the meta-models. Although all four meta-models can well reveal the mean RYP, the meta-model based on RF has the best performance. In the RF-based meta-model, longitude, latitude, altitude, and the averaged maximum temperature in March are the top four ranked essential variables. However, the generalizability of meta-models is affected by the training dataset, and the meta-models cannot adapt appropriately to new unseen data. Moreover, there is no unique optimal machine learning algorithm used for building meta-models, and this will increase the workload of similar research in the future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Crop growth model; Environmental variables; Machine learning; Regional yield potential","climate change; crop yield; growth modeling; growth rate; machine learning; regional climate; spatiotemporal analysis; China",Article,Scopus

Total rainfall (Rain), average air temperature (Tavg), and the difference between maximum and minimum air temperature (Tdiff) at weekly, biweekly, and monthly timescales from May to August were used to estimate county-level maize and soybean grain yields for Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Minnesota. Step-wise multiple linear regression (MLR), general additive (GAM), and support vector machine (SVM) models were trained with Rain, Tavg, and with/without Tdiff. For the total study area and at individual state level, SVM outperformed other models at all temporal levels for both maize and soybean. For maize, Tavg and Tdiff during July and August, and Rain during June and July, were relatively more important whereas for soybean, Tavg in June and Tdiff and Rain during August were more important. The SVM model with weekly Rain and Tavg estimated the overall maize yield with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 591 kg ha−1 (4.9% nRMSE) and soybean yield with a RMSE of 205 kg ha−1 (5.5% nRMSE). Inclusion of Tdiff in the model considerably improved yield estimation for both crops; however, the magnitude of improvement varied with the model and temporal level of weather data.

(b) How close can ML algorithms predict maize grain yields under CA-based cropping systems in the highlands and lowlands of Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA)? Machine learning algorithms could predict maize grain yields from conventional and CA-based cropping systems under low and high potential conditions of the ESA region. Linear algorithms (LDA and LR) predicted maize yield more closely to the observed yields compared with nonlinear tools (NB, KNN, CART and SVM) under the conditions of the reported study. However, the KNN algorithm was comparable in its yield prediction to the linear tools tested in this study. Overall, the LDA algorithm was the best tool, and SVM was the worst algorithm in maize yield prediction.

Moreover, skilful and reliable daily forecast sequences are required to drive decision support models that operate on a daily time step. While downscaling of daily GCM outputs has been developed extensively in climate impacts studies, much less attention has been paid to the downscaling of ensemble GCM forecasts, which has the confronting aspect of low and diminishing skill with increasing lead time. Evidence is building that simple bias-correction methods that do not model correlation between forecasts and observations, nor attempt to correct spatial, temporal and inter-variable correlations, produce downscaled forecasts that perform poorly in applications models. Thus downscaling GCM forecasts requires inclusion of a full calibration component to reduce bias, improve reliability, capture skill where it is available and remove negative skill. In this study, we propose a new methodology for coupling a full GCM forecast calibration with empirical methods to (a) instil correct temporal, spatial and inter-variable correlations in ensembles and (b) perform a multivariate downscaling of ensembles to daily sequences at multiple sites. Through a case study application, the proposed methodology is shown to produce skilful monthly–seasonal forecasts of rainfall, temperature and solar radiation at regional spatial scales. It also produces realistic and coherent multivariate daily sequences at multiple sub-grid locations.

The three major fruit production areas on the Central Coast complement each other in producing fruits almost throughout the year. Forecasting strawberry yield with some lead time can help growers plan for required and often limited human resources and aid in making strategic business decisions. The objectives of this paper were to investigate the correlation among various weather parameters related with strawberry yield at the field level and to evaluate yield forecasts using the predictive principal component regression (PPCR) and two machine-learning techniques: (a) a single layer neural network (NN) and (b) generic random forest (RF). The meteorological parameters were a combination of the sensor data measured in the strawberry field, meteorological data obtained from the nearest weather station, and calculated agroclimatic indices such as chill hours. The correlation analysis showed that all of the parameters were significantly correlated with strawberry yield and provided the potential to develop weekly yield forecast models. In general, the machine learning technique showed better skills in predicting strawberry yields when compared to the principal component regression. More specifically, the NN provided the most skills in forecasting strawberry yield.

Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) are all important nitrogen fertilizers extensively utilized in crops to supply a sufficient level of nutrients and keep their production level high. However, the application is generally limited to specific crops because of the global variability in these essential nutrients. Stability in fertilizer application, growth, and root growth rate increases crop fertility and crop production. To predict the suitable nutrients for different crops and provide nutrients recommendations by analyzing the crop fertility and yield production, this paper proposes nutrient recommendations through an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) that uses time-series sensor data and recommends various crop settings. A neighborhood-based strategy is then presented to handle exploration and exploitation for optimizing the parameters to obtain the maximum yield. The method can expand knowledge by using the population exploration strategy. The final recommendation is made by using the similarity between recommended patterns and real-time sensor data. With time, crop fertility decreases due to the low level of nutrients. This crop model will help to increase yield by analysis of the seasonal fertility performance of the soil. The proposed method is also a useful tool to improve soil fertility performance by providing the nutrient recommendation of optimal conditions for crop development. Experimental results show that the proposed model can recommend optimizing patterns and increasing the yearly yield efficiently. The method can help identify the region to assess crop suitability under certain nutrients levels and give insight into nutrient suitability assessments concerning specific crops in a climate-changing world. © 2021 The Author(s)","Agriculture; Evolutionary computation; Sensor data; Soil nutrients","Crops; Cultivation; Genetic algorithms; Nitrogen fertilizers; Soils; Agricultural productions; Energy inputs; Global variability; Minimal energy; Performance; Production level; Sensors data; Soil characteristics; Soil fertilization; Soil nutrients; Nutrients; crop production; crop yield; evolutionary theory; fertilizer application; genetic algorithm; growth; growth rate; nutrient; soil fertility; soil nutrient; time series analysis",Article,Scopus

The use of feature descriptors and detectors allows to find distinctive keypoints in an image and the use of this approach for agronomical applications has become a widespread field of study. By combining near infrared (NIR) images, acquired with a modified Nikon D80 camera, and visible spectrum (VIS) images, acquired with a Nikon D300s, a proper crop identification could be obtained. Still, the use of different sensors brings an image matching challenge due to the difference between cameras and the possible distortions from each imaging technique. The aim of this paper is to compare the performance of several feature descriptors and detectors by comparing near infrared and visual spectral bands in rice crop images. Therefore, a group of 20 different scenes with different cameras and growth stages in a rice crop were evaluated. Thus, red, green, blue (RGB) and L, a, b (CIE L*a*b*) channels were extracted from VIS images in order to compare the matches obtained between each of them and the corresponding NIR image. The BRISK, SURF, SIFT, ORB, KAZE, and AKAZE methods were implemented, which act as descriptors and detectors. Additionally, a combination was made between the FAST algorithm for the detection of keypoints with the BRIEF, BRISK, and FREAK methods for features description. BF and FLANN matching methods were used. The algorithms were implemented in Python using OpenCV library. The green channel presented the highest number of correct matches in all methods. In turn, the method that presented the highest performance both in time and in the number of correct matches was the combination of the FAST feature detector and the BRISK descriptor. © 2021 by the authors.

Many scholars have conducted research on predicting the outcome of MLB matches. The accuracy in predicting the results of baseball games is low. Therefore, deep learning and machine learning methods were used to build models for predicting the outcomes (win/loss) of MLB matches and investigate the differences between the models in terms of their performance. The match data of 30 teams during the 2019 MLB season with only the starting pitcher or with all pitchers in the pitcher category were collected to compare the prediction accuracy. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN), a traditional machine learning artificial neural network (ANN), and a support vector machine (SVM) were used to predict match outcomes with fivefold cross-validation to evaluate model performance. The highest prediction accuracies were 93.4%, 93.91%, and 93.90% with the 1DCNN, ANN, SVM models, respectively, before feature selection; after feature selection, the highest accuracies obtained were 94.18% and 94.16% with the ANN and SVM models, respectively. The prediction results obtained with the three models were sim-ilar, and the prediction accuracies were much higher than those obtained in related studies. Moreover, a 1DCNN was used for the first time for predicting the outcome of MLB matches, and it achieved a prediction accuracy similar to that achieved by machine learning methods. © 2021 by the authors.

The analysis of this big data enables extraction and deduction of useful knowledge that can be exploited at various levels of the farming process and by different actors (farmers, companies, and agronomists).

In this paper, we propose an electronic farming record model using a fact constellation schema that is flexible enough to incorporate various farming datasets and big data models. We also apply some analysis techniques to extract knowledge with the view to optimise crop yield, reduce cost and pesticide resistance, and protect the environment. This can be done by finding suitable quantities of soil properties (texture and pH), soil nutrients, seed rate, herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and adjuvants, which are individually assessed on the most popular crops in Europe.

In this paper, a method for measuring grain accumulation thickness using a near-infrared photoelectric sensor was developed. According to the attenuation characteristics of light intensity in the discontinuous medium, a Gaussian regression model was established to describe the relationship between the output voltage and the grain accumulation thickness. Calibration results indicated that the measurement error was less than 0.5 mm with the infrared wavelength of 940 nm. Then, three sensors were arranged in parallel as an array to measure the change process of grain accumulation thickness on the flight during the lifting process. A back propagation (BP) neural network which takes time series of the output voltage as inputs was developed to predict the grain mass. The measurement experiments were carried out on a single flight elevator test-rig. After training using the experimental data, the measurement error and the average error using the BP neural network were less than ± 18.2 g and 7.6 g with the grain mass in the range of 0 – 600 g. Finally, grain flow measurement tests were carried out on a grain flow test-rig, and the results indicated that the relative error reduced from 5.6 to 1.4% when the grain flow increased from 0.5 to 2.8 kg/s.

Soil salinization is one of the key problems of sustainable development of arid agricultural land. Exploring the use of shallow subsurface pipe drainage to improve soil salinization. Methods. This study investigates the desalinization effect of shallow subsurface pipe drainage, in combination with drip irrigation under plastic mulch, in an arid region in China. Field data collection was conducted in 2010. Soil salinity at a range of soil depths, water EC and pH of subsurface pipe drainage and crop yield during crop growth stages in salinized farmlands were measured. Results and Conclusion. The results show that soil salinity was reduced significantly on mildly (1-3 dS m-1) and moderately (3-6 dS m-1) salinized farmlands. The highest desalinization rate of mildly and moderately salinized soils was 51% and 91% respectively. The desalinization in upper soil layers, to a depth of 60 cm, was more significant than that in lower soil layers. Drainage water salinity was much higher than irrigation water salinity. Crop yield on mildly and moderately salinized land increased about 25% and 50%, respectively. This indicates that the combination of drip irrigation and shallow subsurface pipe drainage on farmlands is potential feasible to desalt farmlands and to improve crop yield.

The DL model is an exceptional technique used in automatic plant disease identification that employs a series of convolutions for feature representation of the visible disease region, mainly characterized as the combination of the chlorotic, necrotic, and blurred (fuzzy) lesions. The majority of current DL model approaches apply whole leaf image data for which studies have shown its consequential tendencies of leading to irrelevant feature representations of the ROI. The effects of which are redundant feature learning and low classification performance. Consequently, some state-of-the-art deep learning methods practice using the segmented ROI image data, which does not necessarily follow the pathological disease inference. This study proposes an extended ROI (EROI) algorithm using pathological inference of the disease symptom to generate the segmented image data for improved feature representation in DL models. The segmentation algorithm is developed using soft computing techniques of color thresholding that follows an individual symptom color feature that resulted in the incorporation of all lesions. The results from three different pre-trained DL models AlexNet, ResNet, and VGG were used to ascertain the efficacy of the approach. The advantage of the proposed method is using EROI image data based on pathological disease analogy to implement state-of-the-art DL models to identify plant diseases.

The USDA egg grading records are currently managed in paper form. While there is useful information for data-driven knowledge discovery and decision making, the paper-based egg grading record system has fundamental limitations in effective and timely management of such information. Thus, there has been a demand to electronically and digitally store and manage the egg grading records in a database for data analytics and mining, such that the quality trends of eggs observed at various levels (e.g., nation or state) are readily available to decision makers. In this study, we report the design and implementation of a web-based online data entry and reporting information system (called USDA Egg Grading Information Management System, EGIMS), based on a data warehouse framework. The developed information system consisted of web applications for data entry and reporting, and internal databases for data storage, aggregation, and query processing. The internal databases consisted of online transaction processing (OLTP) database for data entry and retrieval, data warehouse (DW) for centralized data storage and online analytical processing (OLAP) database for multidimensional analytical queries. Thus, the key design goal of the system was to build a system platform that could provide the web-based data entry and reporting capabilities while rapidly updating the OLTP, DW and OLAP databases. The developed system was evaluated by a simulation study with statistically-modeled egg grading records of one hypothetical year. The study found that the EGIMS could handle approximately up to 600 concurrent users, 32 data entries per second and 164 report requests per second, on average. The study demonstrated the feasibility of an enterprise-level data warehouse system for the USDA and a potential to provide data analytics and data mining capabilities such that the queries about historical and current trends can be reported. Once fully implemented and tested in the field, the EGIMS is expected to provide a solution to modernize the egg grading practice of the USDA and produce the useful information for timely decisions and new knowledge discovery. © 2020 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Data; Data warehouse; Database; Egg grading; Information management; Information system; OLAP; OLTP; Web application","Data Analytics; Data mining; Data warehouses; Decision making; Digital storage; Grading; Information systems; Information use; Management information systems; Query languages; Query processing; Search engines; Websites; Analytical queries; Data warehouse systems; Design and implementations; Fundamental limitations; Information management systems; On-line analytical processing; Online transaction processing; Simulation studies; Information management",Article,Scopus

As an important index of land deterioration and degree of drought, soil moisture can influence vegetation growth, hydrological cycle and water resource distribution in mountainous areas significantly. However, topographic effect of soil moisture under complicated mountainous terrain conditions still remains unknown. In the present study, a quantitative inversion on surface soil moisture content in a typical mountainous area of Dengfeng city, Henan province (China) in 2013 and 2017 was carried out by using temperature vegetation dryness index method based on Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) remote sensing images and digital elevation model (DEM). Results were conducive to analyze effects of terrain factors on spatial-temporal distribution of soil moisture and improve ecological environment in mountainous area. Besides, a quantitative analysis on topographic effect (e.g. elevation, slope and slope orientation) on soil moisture in mountainous area was performed based on DEM data. Results demonstrate that topographic factors (e.g. elevation, slope and slope orientation) can cause violent variations of soil moisture in mountainous areas. Soil moisture is positively correlated with elevation and slope. In view of slope orientations, shady slope generally presents the highest soil moisture, followed by semi-shady slope, sunny slope and semi-sunny slope successively. In 2017, the heat island effect in the study area is stronger and the arid area is significantly larger than those in 2013. Additionally, soil moisture in the region with elevation lower than 750 m and slope smaller than 25° is lower in relative to that in 2013, but it is higher in the region with elevation higher than 750 m and slope larger than 25°. This study discloses the influencing law of terrain factors on spatial-temporal distribution of soil moisture in mountainous areas.

The main objectives of this study are to examine the change point and trend analysis for wheat production on the basis of time and spatial scale of major wheat producing states of India. This study has considered various prominent non-parametric methods i.e. Pettitt's, Standard normal homogeneity (SNH) and Buishand's range tests. The core purpose of these three techniques is to capture the mutation point in time series data connected to wheat production during the period 1980-2016. Consequently, Sen's slope estimator has been used to measure the magnitude of the trend for wheat production and their significances examined through Mann Kendall (M-K) test. The analysis provided a clear idea about the trends of wheat production over India. The results exhibit that all the states showed the raising trends. The notable observation is that the trend of Madhya Pradesh got highest Sen's slope estimator (i.e. 1541.999/ year) in the second segmentation period. At present, the production of wheat is highly improved in Madhya Pradesh compared to other states from 2008.

However, studies have shown that agricultural problems like forecasting yields remain difficult due to the lack of the necessary and optimal infrastructures. Recently, deep-learning (DL) approach like the recurrent neural network-long short term memory (RNN-LSTM) has been used as a new alternative model in time series (TS) forecasting. In this paper, using the banana harvest data from agrarian reform beneficiary (ARB) cooperative in Davao del Norte, Philippines, proved that RNN-LSTM has the capability in forecasting harvest yields over conventional-based model like the famous autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). Using the same set of training and testing data, experiment exhibits that RNN-LSTM obtains 43.69 in terms of root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) and ARIMA obtains 64.11respectively. This means that RNN-LSTM outperforms the ARIMA model with 32.31 percent reduction in error rates. Since there is no proof that RNN-LSTM has been used with the same agricultural problem domain, therefore, there is no standard available with regards to the level of error reduction in the forecast. Moreover, as enhancement to the performance of the model, the use of multiple LSTM layers joined together and the use of regularization technique like dropout are suggested for exploration. Furthermore, extending and embedding this approach to a web-based application is the future plan for the benefit of the medium scale banana growers of the region for efficient and effective decision making and advance planning. © 2019 IEEE.","Banana harvest yield forecasting; Deep Learning; Long short-term memory; Yield forecasting","Brain; Decision making; Errors; Forecasting; Fruits; Harvesting; Long short-term memory; Mean square error; Systems engineering; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Harvest yields; Regularization technique; Root mean squared errors; Sustainable production; Training and testing; Web-based applications; Yield forecasting; Deep learning",Conference Paper,Scopus

Yields are spatial dependence, and they are affected by both controllable and uncontrollable factors such as soil moisture, nutrient, weather and climate. We assume that the probability distribution of the yields depends on the irrigation water, controlled by the IoT-based irrigation system. We compare the expected profits with and without the system. Without the system, the profit is maximized with respect to the probability distribution of the demand and the yields.

The indicators of the maximum rate of reduction and the maximum rate of increase of yield can be used as markers of agroecosystem stability to external factors. It can be noted that the southern regions of Ukraine are less stable and more exposed to the destructive inﬂ uence, while the central and western regions are more stable and rapidly increase productivity under favorable conditions. This research has found that the agroecological systems of the regions of Ukraine are far from the maximum ecological capacity, and agroeconomic and agrotechnological factors are the limiting now. © 2019, Agricultural Academy, Bulgaria.

Recently, deep-learning (DL) approach has been used as a new alternative model in forecasting. In this paper, the enhanced DL approach incorporates multiple long short term memory (LSTM) layers employed with multiple neurons in each layer, fully trained and built a state for forecasting. The enhanced model used the banana harvest yield data from agrarian reform beneficiary (ARB) cooperative of Dapco in Davao del Norte, Philippines. The model parameters such as epoch, batch size and neurons underwent tuning to identify its optimal values to be used in the experiments. Additionally, the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) is used to evaluate the performance of the model. Using the same set of training and testing data, experiment exhibits that the enhanced model achieved the optimal result of 34.805 in terms of RMSE. This means that the enhanced model outperforms the single and multiple LSTM layer with 43.5 percent and 44.95 percent reduction in error rates, respectively. Since there is no proof that LSTM recurrent neutral network has been used with the same agricultural problem domain, therefore, there is no standard available with regards to the level of error reduction in the forecast. Moreover, investigating the performance of the model using diverse datasets specifically with multiple input features (multivariate) is suggested for exploration. Furthermore, extending and embedding this approach to a web-based along with a handy application is the future plan for the benefit of the medium scale banana growers of the region for efficient and effective decision making and advance planning. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.","Banana harvest yield forecasting; Deep Learning; Long short-term memory; Yield forecasting","Brain; Decision making; Errors; Forecasting; Harvesting; Long short-term memory; Mean square error; Banana harvest yield forecasting; Deep learning; Harvest yields; Learning approach; Memory layers; Multifaceted systems; Performance; Root mean squared errors; Yield forecasting; Fruits",Article,Scopus

This article presents a comprehensive review of research dedicated to the application of ML in the oil palm agricultural industry over the last decade (2011–2020). A systematic review was structured to answer seven predefined research questions by analysing 61 papers after applying exclusion criteria. The works analysed were categorized into two main groups: (1) regression analysis used to predict fruit yield, harvest time, oil yield, and seasonal impacts and (2) classification techniques to classify trees, fruit, disease levels, canopy, and land. Based on defined research questions, investigation of the reviewed literature included yearly distribution and geographical distribution of articles, highly adopted algorithms, input data, used features, and model performance evaluation criteria. Detailed quantitative– qualitative investigations have revealed that ML is still underutilised for predictive analysis of oil palm.

However, traditional yield assessment approaches are laborious and time-consuming, and thus hinder the acquisition of timely information at the field scale. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant attention in precision agriculture due to their efficiency in data acquisition. In addition, compared with other imaging modalities, hyperspectral data can offer higher spectral fidelity for constructing narrow-band vegetation indices which are of great importance in yield modeling. In this study, we performed an in-season alfalfa yield prediction using UAV-based hyperspectral images. Specifically, we firstly extracted a large number of hyperspectral indices from the original data and performed a feature selection to reduce the data dimensionality. Then, an ensemble machine learning model was developed by combining three widely used base learners including random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR) and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). The model performance was evaluated on experimental fields in Wisconsin. Our results showed that the ensemble model outperformed all the base learners and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.874 was achieved when using the selected features. In addition, we also evaluated the model adaptability on different machinery compaction treatments, and the results further demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed ensemble model. © 2020 by the authors.

Official yields in the top hazelnut producing municipalities in 2004–2019 are used as reference data, whereas ground observations of phenology and weather data represent the main HADES inputs. A statistical analysis allows inferring the occurrence and magnitude of biennial bearing in official yields and is used to aid the calibration of a process-based hazelnut simulation model. Then, a Random Forest algorithm is deployed in regression mode using the outputs of the process-based model as predictors, together with information on hazelnut varieties, the presence of alternate bearing in the yield series, and agro-meteorological indicators. HADES predictive ability in calibration and validation was balanced, with relative root mean square error below 20%, and R2 and Nash-Sutcliffe modeling efficiency above 0.7 considering all municipalities together.

Current approaches based on crop cutting experiments are expensive and usually too late for timely income stabilization measures like crop insurances. We, therefore, utilized a Gradient Boosted Regression (GBR), a machine learning technique, to estimate rice yields at ~500 m spatial resolution for rice-producing areas in India with potential application for near real-time estimates. We used resampled intermediate resolution (~5 km) images of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Leaf Area Index (LAI) and observed yields at the district level in India for calibrating GBR models. These GBRs were then used to downscale district yields to 500 m resolution. Downscaled yields were re-aggregated for validation against out-of-sample district yields not used for model training and an additional independent data set of block-level (below district-level) yields. Our downscaled and re-aggregated yields agree well with reported district-level observations from 2003 to 2015 (r = 0.85 & MAE = 0.15 t/ha). The model performance improved further when estimating separate models for different rice cropping densities (up to r = 0.93). An additional out-of-sample validation for the years 2016 and 2017, proved successful with r = 0.84 and r = 0.77, respectively. Simulated yield accuracy was higher in water-limited, rainfed agricultural systems. We conclude that this downscaling approach of rice yield estimation using GBR is feasible across India and may complement current approaches for timely rice yield estimation required by insurance companies and government agencies. © 2021 by the authors.

More suitable time window selection methods and vegetation indexes, both of which are critical for yield estimations, have not been fully considered. In this article, the Chinese GaoFen-1 Wide Field View (GF-1 WFV) and Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were fused by the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) to generate time-series data with a high spatial resolution. Then, two time window selection methods involving distinguishing or not distinguishing the growth stages during the monitoring period, and three vegetation indexes, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) and wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI), were intercom-pared. Furthermore, the yield estimations obtained from two different spatial resolutions of fused data and MODIS data were analyzed. The results indicate that taking the growth stage as the time window unit division basis can allow a better estimation of winter wheat yield; and that WDRVI is more suitable for yield estimations than NDVI or EVI2.

In this study, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery were used in combination with climate, soil and elevation data to predict field-level sugarcane yield across the multiple sugar mill areas in the Wet Tropics of Australia at different time steps over four consecutive growing seasons (2016–2019). A total of ≈1400 field-level measurements were used to train predictive machine learning models of cane yield (t/ha), commercial cane sugar (CCS, %), sugar yield (t/ha), crop varieties and ratoon numbers. We compared the predictive performance of models based on both satellite imagery only and a fusion of satellite imagery with climate, soil and topographical information. Randomized search on hyperparameters was the method used to optimize and identify the most accurate decision tree-based machine model. Overall, gradient boosting was the most accurate method for predicting sugarcane attributes. The analysis resulted in cane yield, CCS and sugar yield predicted at the field level with R2 of up to 0.51 (RMSE = 16 t/ha), 0.63 (RMSE = 1 %) and 0.62 (RMSE = 2 t/ha) as soon as four months before the harvest season. It was also found that sugarcane varieties could be mapped with an accuracy of up to 73.4 %, while the differentiation of planted and ratoon crops exhibited the lowest accuracy of 45.4 %. Using a novel SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach to explain the output of our machine learning models we found that Sentinel-2 derived spectral indices were the most important in predicting cane yield as well as differentiating sugarcane varieties and ratoon numbers. In contrast, climate and elevation derived predictors were the most important in predicting CCS and sugar yield. At the whole sugar mill area level, spatially averaged field-level results predicted mill area cane yield, CCS and sugar yield with R2 of 0.75 (RMSE = 4.6 t/ha), 0.80 (RMSE = 0.6 %) and 0.77 (RMSE = 1 t/ha).

County-level corn phenology varies spatially and interannually across the Corn Belt in the United States, where precipitation and heat stress presents a temporal pattern among growth phases (GPs) and vary interannually. In this study, we developed a long short-term memory (LSTM) model that integrates heterogeneous crop phenology, meteorology, and remote sensing data to estimate county-level corn yields. By conflating heterogeneous phenology-based remote sensing and meteorological indices, the LSTM model accounted for 76% of yield variations across the Corn Belt, improved from 39% of yield variations explained by phenology-based meteorological indices alone. The LSTM model outperformed least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and random forest (RF) approaches for end-of-the-season yield estimation, as a result of its recurrent neural network structure that can incorporate cumulative and nonlinear relationships between corn yield and environmental factors. The results showed that the period from silking to dough was most critical for crop yield estimation. The LSTM model presented a robust yield estimation under extreme weather events in 2012, which reduced the root-mean-square error to 1.47 Mg/ha from 1.93 Mg/ha for LASSO and 2.43 Mg/ha for RF. The LSTM model has the capability to learn general patterns from high-dimensional (spectral, spatial, and temporal) input features to achieve a robust county-level crop yield estimation.

This study selected the remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI) and vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) which closely relate to crop growth and crop water stress as two key variables for indicating crop growth condition and estimating crop yields in the Guanzhong Plain, PR China. The single VTCI, the single LAI and the combination of VTCI and LAI at four growth stages of winter wheat (the turning green, jointing, heading-filling, and dough stages) were used as three input variable schemes of the back propagation (BP) neural network and the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm (IPSO)-BP neural network using a nonlinear decreasing inertia weight, respectively. The relative importance of the input variables to the output variable, yield of winter wheat, was used to determine the weight values of input variables at each growth stage. Based on the weights, the integrated index (I) was established, and then three linear regression models (weighted VTCIs, weighted LAIs, and I values) were established with yield data to estimate winter wheat yields. By calculating several statistical functions, i.e., coefficient of determination (R2) and probability value (P), the model between the I values and wheat yield performed better than those between the weighted VTCIs or weighted LAIs and wheat yields. The yield estimation model of I values by using the IPSO-BP neural network (R2 = 0.342) was found to be better than that using the BP neural network (R2 = 0.310). Therefore, we applied the model with better performance (R2 = 0.342) to map the regional winter wheat yields pixel by pixel in the Guanzhong Plain during 2011–2018, and analyzed the spatial and temporal characteristics of the estimated yields. Regarding the spatial distribution, the yields in the west part of the plain are the highest, followed by the central part, and the yields in the east part are lowest, consistent with previous studies. The estimated yields showed inter-annual fluctuations along with an increasing trend on the whole. Winter wheat yields were most depleted in 2013 and most abundant in 2015. These results were consistent with the actual situation of winter wheat production in the plain, which indicated that I can be used to provide a better quantification for monitoring regional winter wheat growth conditions and estimating crop yield. Thus, the approach of this study can provide significant benefit for regional crop production monitoring. © 2019","BP neural network; Integrated index; Leaf area index; Vegetation temperature condition index; Winter wheat yield estimation","Backpropagation algorithms; Cultivation; Food supply; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Pixels; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Traffic signals; Vegetation; BP neural networks; Integrated index; Leaf Area Index; Vegetation temperature condition index; Winter wheat yields; Crops; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Due to the importance of wheat production scale, it is advisable to predict its yield before harvesting. However, the current models are built solely on the basis of quantitative data. Therefore, the aim of the work was to create three multicriteria models for the prediction and simulation of winter wheat yield, which were made on the basis of extended quantitative and qualitative variables from field research in the year period 2008-2015. Neural networks with MLP (multi-layer perceptron) topology were used to build the following models, which can predict and simulate the yield on three dates: 15 April, 31 May, and 30 June. For this reason, they were designated as follows: QQWW15_4, QQWW31_5, and QQWW30_6. Each model is based on a different number of independent features, which ranges from 19 to 25. As a result of the conducted analyses, a MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) forecast error from 6.63% to 6.92% was achieved. This is equivalent of an error ranging from 0.521 to 0.547 t·ha-1, with an average yield of 6.57 ton per hectare of cultivated area. In addition, the most important quantitative and qualitative factors influencing the yield were also indicated. In the first predictive range (15 April), it is the average air temperature from 1 September to 31 December of the previous year (T9-12_PY). In the second predictive range (31 May) it is the sum of precipitation from 1 May to 31 May, and in the third (30 June) is the average air temperature from 1 January to 15 April of the year (T1-4_CY). In addition, one of the qualitative factors had a significant impact on the yield in the first phase-the type of forecrop in the previous year (TF_PY). The presented neural modeling method is a specific extension of the previously used predicting methods. An element of innovation of the presented concept of yield modeling is the possibility of performing a simulation before harvest, in the current agrotechnical season. The presented models can be used in large-area agriculture, especially in precision agriculture as an important element of decision-making support systems. © 2019 by the authors.","Artificial neural networks; Machine learning; MLP network; Precision agriculture; Sensitivity analysis; Winter wheat yield; Yield prediction; Yield simulation",,Article,Scopus

In addition, crop yields are correlated with phenology information, especially the fruit filling days. The objectives of this study were to identify the phenology time for making a reliable jujube yield prediction, more importantly, explore an approach that used the length of phenology growth period to improve remotely sensed estimates of inter-annual variability for yields. The best time for making jujube yield prediction was found to be during the fruit filling period, showing higher correlation coefficient (r)between vegetation indices and yields. The average NDVI for 14th and 15th half-months represented a better performance for yield prediction, with a highest r value of 0.87 for NDVI, 0.82 for SAVI, 0.73 for NDWI and 0.73 for EVI, respectively. The potential of using Landsat-NDVI for jujube yield estimation, combined with the phenological length, was preliminarily proved based on 200 observations of individual jujube orchards, showing a validated R2 of 0.85, 0.80 and 0.67, RMSE of 0.61, 0.78 and 0.85 t ha−1 for 2013, 2014 and 2016, respectively.

We assess the performance of these forecasts for soft wheat, durum wheat, grain maize, rapeseed, sunflower, potato and sugar beet, and sought to answer three questions. First, how good has the system performed? This was investigated by calculating several accuracy indicators (e.g. the mean absolute percentage error, MAPE) for the first forecasts during a season, forecasts one month pre-harvest, and the end-of-campaign (EOC) forecasts during 2006–2015 using reported yields. Second, do forecasts improve during the season? This was evaluated by comparing the accuracy of the first, the pre-harvest, and the EOC forecasts. Third, have forecasts systematically improved year-to-year? This was quantified by testing whether linear models fitted to the median of the national level absolute relative forecast errors for each crop at EU-12 (EU-27) level from 1993 to 2015 (2006–2015) were characterized by significant negative slopes. Encouragingly, the lowest median MAPE across all crops is obtained for Europe's largest producer, France, equalling 3.73%. Similarly, the highest median MAPE is obtained for Portugal, at 14.37%. Forecasts generally underestimated reported yields, with a systematic underestimation across all MS for soft wheat, rapeseed and sugar beet forecasts. Forecasts generally improve during the growing season; both the forecast error and its variability tend to progressively decrease. This is the case for the cereals, and to a lesser extent for the tuber crops, while seasonal forecast improvements are lower for the oilseed crops. The median EU-12 yield forecasts for rapeseed, potato and sugar beet have significantly (p-value < 0.05) improved from 1993 to 2015. No evidence was found for improvements for the other crops, neither was there any significant improvement in any of the crop forecasts from 2006 to 2015, evaluated at EU-27 level. In the early years of the MCYFS, most of the yield time series were characterized by strong trends; nowadays yield growth has slowed or even plateaued in several MS. In addition, an increased volatility in yield statistics is observed, and while crop yield forecasts tend to improve in a given year, in recent years, there is no evidence of structural improvements that carry-over from year-to-year. This underlines that renewed efforts to improve operational crop yield forecasting are needed, especially in the light of the increasingly variable and occasionally unprecedented climatic conditions impacting the EU's crop production systems. © 2018 The Authors","AMIS; Climate change; Crop production; Crop yield forecasting","accuracy assessment; assessment method; canola; climate change; climate conditions; crop improvement; crop plant; crop production; crop yield; European Union; growing season; growth; sugar beet; tuber; France; Portugal; Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Brassica napus; Helianthus; Solanum tuberosum; Triticum aestivum; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Firstly, the historical data of the combine harvester are taken into account to perform correlation analysis to verify the input rationality of the proposed model. Secondly, pre-training has been performed to determine the model's initial migration parameters, along with the adoption of CDAE to denoise and reconstruct the input data. Finally, after the migration, the CNN-LSTM hybrid model was trained with a real dataset and was able to predict the cooling water temperature. The accuracy of the model has been verified by field test data gathered in June 2019. Results show that the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the model is 0.0817, and the mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.0989. Compared with the performance of LSTM on the prediction data, the RMSE improvement rate is 2.272 %, and the MAE improvement rate is 20.113 %.

In this study, growth data from three different rice cultivars at two different climate regions in Taiwan were used to calculate the rice growth rate (Gr) in key growth stages. A total of 10,246 Gr data from 95 cultivations were used to assess the feasibility of simulating rice growth rate from ambient temperature by regression algorithm (REG), artificial neural networks (ANN) and gene-expression programming (GEP). Simulation was carried out for each algorithm using ambient temperature and growing season as input variables for the entire life cycle of rice (Trall) either as one continuous growth period or as the sum of four distinctive growth stages (Tr1~4). The results showed that the model output from Tr1~4 are more accurate than Trall. However, simulation errors in the transitional stages occurred when the growth rate at different stages was modelled separately. Artificial intelligence based nonlinear models were more accurate than the regression model and ANN generally exhibited better performance than other two models.

Training-data-diversity is very important to achieve good generalization. However, there are scenarios where we have training data with certain limitations. One such scenario is when the objects of the testing set have a different size (discrepancy) from the objects used during training. Another scenario is when we have high-resolution images with a dimension that is not supported by the model. To address these problems, we propose a novel pipeline that is able to handle high-resolution images by cropping the original image into sub-images and put them back in the end. Also, in the case of the discrepancy of object sizes, we propose two different techniques based on scaling the image up and down in order to have an acceptable performance. In addition, we also use the information from the Feature Pyramid Network to remove false-positives. Our proposed methods overcome state-of-the-art data augmentation policies and our models can generalize to different object sizes even though limited data is provided. © 2021 IEEE.","Data augmentation; Drone imaging; Feature pyramid network; Object detection","Aircraft detection; Computer vision; Drones; Object recognition; Data augmentation; Drone imaging; Feature pyramid; Feature pyramid network; High-resolution images; Object detectors; Object size; Pyramid network; State of the art; Training data; Object detection",Conference Paper,Scopus

Due to this, more electrical power is being consumed in Data Centers therefore Data Center power &amp; cooling management has become quite an important and challenging task. Direct impacting aspects affecting the power energy of data centers are power and commensurate cooling losses. It is difficult to optimise the Power Usage Efficiency (PUE) of the Data Center using conventional methods which essentially need knowledge of each Data Center facility and specific equipment and its working. Hence, a novel optimization approach is necessary to optimise the power and cooling in the data center. This research work is performed by varying the temperature in the data center through a machine learning-based linear regression optimization technique. From the research, the ideal temperature is identified with high accuracy based on the prediction technique evolved out of the available data. With the proposed model, the PUE of the data center can be easily analysed and predicted based on temperature changes maintained in the Data Center. As the temperature is raised from 19.73 oC to 21.17 oC, then the cooling load is decreased in the range 607 KW to 414 KW. From the result, maintaining the temperature at the optimum value significantly improves the Data Center PUE and same time saves power within the permissible limits. © 2021.

However, depending on the application, the IoT network tends to consume lot of power from the individual devices. Various conventional solutions are provided to reduce the consumption of energy but most methods focus on increasing the data acquisition speed, data transmission and routing capabilities. However, these methods tend to fall under the trade-off between these three factors. Hence, in order to maintain the trade-off between these constraints, a viable solution is developed in this paper. A deep learning-based routing is built considering the faster acquisition of data, faster data transmission and routing path estimation with increasing path estimation. The paper models a Deep belief Network (DBN) to route the data considering all these constraints. The experimental validation is conducted to check the network lifetime, energy consumption of IoT nodes.

The typical approach consists in measuring multiple quantities and in applying complex and frequently just approximated mathematical models to characterize the sensor response. The use of machine learning to extract information from measurements in sensors have been tried in several forms before. But one of the problems with the approaches so far, is the difficulty in getting a training dataset that is representative of the measurements done by the sensor. Additionally, extracting multiple parameters from a single measurement has been so far an impossible problem to solve efficiently in luminescence. In this work a new approach is described for building an autonomous intelligent sensor, which is able to produce the training dataset self-sufficiently, use it for training a neural network, and then use the trained model to do inference on measurements done on the same hardware. For the first time the use of machine learning additionally allows to extract two parameters from one single measurement using multitask learning neural network architectures.

It can stabilize product quality and improve the economic efficiency of enterprises. In this paper, three process parameters of a carbonization furnace, namely feeding rate, rotation speed, and carbonization temperature, were adopted to build a quality optimization model for carbonized materials. First, an orthogonal test was designed to obtain the preliminary relationship between the process parameters and the quality indicators of a carbonized material and prepare data for modeling. Then, an improved SVR model was developed to establish the relationship between product quality indicators and process parameters. Finally, through the single-factor experiments and the Monte Carlo method, the process parameters affecting the quality of a carbonized material were determined and optimized. This showed that a high-quality carbonized material could be obtained with a smaller feeding rate, larger rotation speed, and higher carbonization furnace temperature. The quality of activated carbon reached its maximum when the feeding rate was 1.0 t/h, the rotation speed was 90 r/h, and the temperature was 836°C.

Adequate agricultural inputs, particularly nutrient amendments and best management practices, are essential to reverse this trend. There is a need to understand the cause of variations in maize yield, provide reliable early estimates of yields, and make necessary recommendations for fertilizer applications. Maize yield prediction and estimates of yield gaps using objective and spatial analytical tools could provide accurate and objective information that underpin decision support. A study was conducted in Rwanda at Nyakiliba sector and Gashora sector located in Birunga and Central Bugesera agro-ecological zones, with the objectives of (1) determining factors influencing maize yield, (2) predicting maize yield (using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) approach), and (3) assessing the maize yield gaps and the impact on food security. Maize grain yield was significantly higher at Nyakiliba (1.74 t ha−1) than at Gashora (0.6 t ha−1). NDVI values correlated positively with maize grain yield at both sites (R2 = 0.50 to 0.65) and soil fertility indicators (R2 = 0.55 to 0.70). Maize yield was highest at 40 kg P ha−1 and response to N fertilizer was adequately simulated at Nyakiliba (R2 = 0.85, maximum yield 3.3 t ha−1). Yield gap was 4.6 t ha−1 in Nyakiliba and 5.1 t ha−1 in Gashora. Soil variables were more important determinants of social class than family size. Knowledge that low nutrient inputs are a major cause of yield gaps in Rwanda should prioritize increasing the rate of fertilizer use in these agricultural systems. © 2020, The Author(s).","Crop intensification; Maize grain yield; Prediction; Social classification","agricultural ecosystem; crop yield; decision support system; fertilizer application; food security; maize; NDVI; prediction; soil fertility; spatial analysis; Rwanda",Article,Scopus

However, data collection is very costly if it is not impossible to do. To overcome the limited data problem, one can use models that have been trained with a large dataset and apply them in the target domain with a limited dataset. In this paper, we use pre-trained models on imageNet data and re-train them on our data to detect tea leaf diseases. Those pre-trained models use deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architectures: VGGNet, ResNet, and Xception. To mitigate the difference tasks of ImageNet and ours, we apply fine-tuning on the pre-trained models by replacing some parts of the pre-trained models with new structures. We evaluate the performance using various re-training and fine-tuning schema. The vanilla pre-trained model is used as the baseline while other techniques such as re-training the models on the appended structures, partially re-training the pre-trained models, and fully re-training the whole networks where the pre-trained models are used in the initialization as the evaluator. Our experiments show that applying transfer learning only on our data may not be effective due to the difference in our task to ImageNet. Applying fine-tuning on pre-trained DCNN models is found to be effective. It is consistently better than that of using transfer learning only or partial fine-tuning. It is also better than training the model from scratch, i.e., without using pre-trained models. © 2020 IEEE.","agriculture; CNN; deep learning; fine-tuning; tea diseases detection; transfer learning","Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Large dataset; Learning systems; Radar; Tea; Transfer learning; Tuning; Data collection; Fine tuning; Large amounts; Leaf disease; Limited data; Small data set; Target domain; Use-model; Deep learning",Conference Paper,Scopus

First, the relationship between the features and the output is modelled using a Bayesian neural network, capable of representing complex interactions and principled uncertainty. Second, interaction effects and their uncertainty are estimated from the trained model. For the second step, we propose an intuitive global interaction measure: Bayesian Group Expected Hessian (GEH), which aggregates information of local interactions as captured by the Hessian. GEH provides a natural trade-off between type I and type II error and, moreover, comes with theoretical guarantees ensuring that the estimated interaction effects and their uncertainty can be improved by training a more accurate BNN. The method empirically outperforms available non-probabilistic alternatives on simulated and real-world data.

The classifiers are built by classification algorithms using data. Nowadays, the data are high dimensional in nature since the data are massively generated due to advancements in information and communication technology. The high-dimensional space contains irrelevant and redundant features; both of them reduce the classification accuracy and increase space and building time of the classifiers. Redundancy and relevancy analysis mechanisms of the feature selection process remove the irrelevant and redundant features. Identifying the irrelevant features is a simple task since that only considers the relevancy between each feature and the target class of a dataset using any one of the statistical or information theoretic measures. Identifying the redundant features from a dataset is quite difficult, especially in high-dimensional space since it needs to consider the relevancy among the features. This leads to more computational complexity and an inappropriate relevancy measure that can degrade the classification accuracy. In order to overcome these problems, this paper presents an unsupervised learning-based redundancy analysis mechanism for feature selection by evaluating various clustering techniques in terms of average redundancy rate and runtime. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Clustering; EM clustering; Hierarchical clustering; K-means clustering; Redundancy rate","Clustering algorithms; Diagnosis; Information theory; Redundancy; Unsupervised learning; Classification accuracy; Classification algorithm; Clustering techniques; High dimensional data; High dimensional spaces; Information and Communication Technologies; Information theoretic measure; Machine learning applications; Feature extraction",Article,Scopus

Parametric methods, such as segmented regression, were proposed to estimate the complicated trajectory of size-density relationships. However, applying nonparametric methods to assess stand development has not been explicitly examined. In this study, we compared parametric and nonparametric methods for estimating size-density relationships for Japanese cedar plantations in Taiwan. Specifically, we compared the efficacy of two segmented regression models with the penalized spline and random forest for regression methods. We also examined various stages in stand development for old-growth Japanese cedar stands. Data collected from 237 Japanese cedar permanent plots were used in model fitting and validation. Results indicated that the parametric and nonparametric methods used in this study can provide reliable estimates of the size-density relationship for Japanese cedar. Higher accuracy was achieved before the stands diverged from the self-thinning line. The penalized spline approach behaved consistently well regardless of datasets or stages in stand development, while the predictability of the random forest algorithm slightly decreased when the validation data was fitted.

In the current study, salt stress was induced in Pea and the expression pattern of Mn-superoxide dismutase, Peroxiredoxin, Thioredoxin, and Alternative oxidase genes was studied. The research was performed in hydroponic system, with three replicates. Ten days old seedlings of Pea variety “Meteor” were exposed to four different levels of salt stress i.e., 0 mM, 50 mM, 75 mM and 100 mM NaCl. The expression of selected genes was studied by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results showed that shoot and root length, root and shoot biomass were significantly reduced under salt stress as compared to the control Pea plantlets. Results showed7.77 cm shoot length and 9.89 cm root length under 100 mM NaCl as compared to 22.45 cm shoot length and 24.53 cm root length in control. Fresh shoot biomass of 0.81 g and fresh root biomass of 2.3 g was observed under 100 mM salt stress as compared to 1.5 g fresh shoot biomass and 1.2 g fresh root biomass in control plantlets. Mn-SOD gene showed expression in all treatments but high expression was observed under 75 mM NaCl and 100 mM NaCl treatments. Trxo1 gene showed expression in all treatments but was more pronounced in 75 mM NaCl. The PrxIIF gene also showed the expression in all salt treatments and the expression increased with increasing salt stress. AOX gene showed high expression in 50 mM and 100 mM NaCl and was less expressed in 75 mM NaCl. As the expression of selected genes was upregulated in Pea leaves under salinity, therefore, the results suggest that these genes are involved in salt stress and these may help to cope salt stress and could be used in developing salt resistant Pea varieties in future. © 2020, University of Agriculture.

The key objective was to develop understanding on site-specific suitability of the Mid Elevation Spray Application (MESA) and Low Elevation Spray Application (LESA) sprinkler systems in irrigating corn crop and potential water as well as energy savings. Aerial data was collected through small UAS flights at 100 m height above ground level and on 49, 59, 65, 77, 105, 114, 134 days after planting (DAP). Small UAS had 5-band multispectral and radiometric thermal imager on-board the platform. Custom image processing algorithms were developed to extract various vegetation indices (Normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI], Green NDVI [GNDVI] and Normalized difference red edge [NDRE]) and canopy temperature maps from the imagery data. Two sample T-test was performed on extracted data to understand significant difference, at 5% level, within the LESA and MESA treatments. For both the irrigation techniques, the crop vigor increased in the early growth stage (49, 65 DAP), peaked in the mid growth stage (77, 105, 114 DAP) and then decreased in the late growth stage (134 DAP). The MESA irrigated sections had higher vigor (NDVI, GNDVI, NDRE), but not significant, compared to LESA throughout the season. Similarly, the MESA irrigated areas had significantly (0.61–2.07 °C) cooler canopies than LESA. Such results were anticipated, in part due to the issues with the sprinkler heads used in LESA. The heads were being pulled off in the corn field, causing the weighted hose to damage the crop. A different kind of sprinkler head was used after this incident. However, some strips of corn had already been damaged. Overall, this study results confirm suitability of aerial imagery data in evaluating pertinent irrigation treatments.

This relationship between soil nutrients, fertilization, and yield is very complicated. It has strongly non-linear and black box characteristics and is difficult to quantify with traditional analytic methods. This paper proposes a method for the precision fertilization of maize based on the wavelet-BP neural network. Firstly, the existing “3414″ experimental data was chosen and interpolated as the performing data for the modeling. Then, the general condition of low frequency and details of high-frequency of the yield were calculated via the wavelet decomposition and reconstruction method. After that, the wavelet-BP neural network was established. Three different BP neural sub-networks for each component of the yield after wavelet analysis were established, and the output of each sub-network was summed to obtain the predicted corn yield. The results show that the model that combines wavelet analysis with the BP neural network achieves better performance than the traditional BP neural network, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest regarding accuracy and stability, which indicates the feasibility of this method. Finally, the best fertilizer amount that achieves the maximum yield or maximum profit is calculated based on nonlinear programming. The proposed method of the wavelet-BP neural network provides a new technique for precision fertilization research and enriches the existing fertilization system. The application of precision fertilization based on the wavelet-BP neural network has important practical significance that guides and increases maize production, while reducing production cost and agricultural pollution. At the same time, it also provides a way to solve similar problems in the entire field of cleaner agricultural production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","BP neural network; Cleaner production; Fertilization; Sustainable agriculture; Wavelet analysis","Crops; Decision trees; Neural networks; Nonlinear programming; Pollution control; Support vector machines; Wavelet analysis; Agricultural pollution; Agricultural productions; BP neural networks; Cleaner production; Decomposition and reconstruction; Fertilization; Precision fertilizations; Sustainable agriculture; Wavelet decomposition",Article,Scopus

The yields for different outputs are random and depend on the location. By remotely sensing from satellites or locally sensing from unmanned aerial vehicle, the firm may employ an image-based yield prediction model at the pre-purchase time. The distribution of the yield differs by a location. With the sensed data, the company updates the distribution of the yield using a regression model, whose explanatory variable is a vegetation index from image processing. At a more favorable location, the distribution of the yield is stochastically larger. The objective of this paper is to quantify the added value of image sensing in predicting crop yield. Specifically, the posterior yield distribution from image processing is used as an input to the multi-location newsvendor model with random yields. The optimal expected profit given the posterior distribution is compared to that with only the prior distribution of the yield. The difference between the total expected profits with the prior and posterior distributions is defined as the value of the sample information.

This quantity of fly ash generated poses significant environmental problems, besides occupying large areas of land for its dumping, requiring appropriate measures for its safe disposal and gainful utilization on sustainable basis. Based on the field demonstration work carried out on the bulk utilization of pond ash in agriculture and forestry sectors under different agro-climatic conditions and soil types for the last two decades, it has been well established that pond ash has significant potential for utilization as liming agent, soil conditioner, source of plant nutrients and also for boosting the growth and yield of a variety of crops.

As such, the influence of major plant nutrients viz. N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S on the yield of wheat crops cultivated in different soil types and agro-climatic conditions is discussed.

The object of this study is to understand if surface karstification is the same as the interior karst development of an aquifer. Surface karstification was analyzed using Geographic Information System and remote sensing techniques, while interior karstification was studied with spring hydrograph analysis. The study area includes seven carbonate aquifers in the Zagros Region of Iran. The surface karstification of these aquifers is controlled by different factors including the thickness of carbonate formations, distance from faults, fracture density, precipitation, temperature, vegetation index, slope, and relief. The most important factors are precipitation and presence and density of faults and fractures; while the least significant factor is the vegetation cover. The spring hydrograph analysis shows that there are different ways of estimating the relative karst development, but each parameter that impacts the specific character of the karst aquifer might be independent of others. Furthermore, comparing the relative surface and interior karst development demonstrates that the possible relationship between them is unpredictable. Consequently, we define a specific and unique numeric method to assess the interior karst development that permits a meaningful concept and comparison among different aquifers throughout the world. © 2019, National Speleological Society Inc..

To this end, a 167&thinsp;ha catchment was delineated consisting of 10 hydrological response units. Daily data for streamflow and nitrate loadings from 2004 to 2015 were used to calibrate and validate the model, while annual values for crop yields (winter wheat, winter barley, rapeseed, maize silage) were available. In addition, the detailed field maps provided by the local farmer were used to implement exact crop rotations and nitrogen fertilization into the model. Nash-Sutcliffe-Efficiencies for streamflow were 0.54 during the calibration and 0.57 for the validation period. The modeling performance for nitrate loadings were lower with 0.31 for the calibration and 0.42 for the validation period. The average crop yields were reproduced well, while SWAT failed to reproduce the inter-annual crop yield variations. A scenario analysis revealed that a slight decrease of nitrogen fertilization leads to significant reductions in nitrate loadings, while crop yields remained on a high level. The outcome of the study may help practitioners to operate according to an economic and environmental optimal N management. Nevertheless, experimental studies with varying fertilization intensities at catchment scale are needed to underpin the modeling results. © Author(s) 2019.",,"agricultural catchment; crop yield; fertilizer application; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; nitrate; nutrient enrichment; prediction; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; Germany; Brassica napus; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

A necessary condition is the assessment and analysis of current trends in changing the characteristics of contrasting groups of varieties. The aim of the study is to identify homogeneous groups of varieties of an ampelographic collection and to compare the rates of reaction of their agrobiological parameters to climate changes. Material for the study consists of observations of 21 agrobiological characteristics of 109 grape varieties from the Don ampelographic collection named after Ya.I. Potapenko (Novocherkassk) with an observation period from 10 to 36 years in 1981–2017. The sample included Vitis vinifera L. varieties and the V. vinifera L. × V. labrusca L. and V. vinifera L. × V. amurensis Rupr. interspecific hybrids, and hybrids from crosses between V. vinifera L. and several American species. Homogeneous groups of characteristics and varieties are identified by principal component analysis (PCA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods. Trends in changing the agrobiological characteristics of the varieties and groups of varieties are calculated. PCA revealed that the main differentiating factor of the studied fragment of the ampelographic collection is the size of the bunch; the second, the yield; the third, the time of ripening. The values of the factors are contrasting in varieties of different directions of use and taxonomic origin, which was confirmed by ANOVA. The groups of the V. vinifera × V. labrusca and V. vinifera × V. amurensis hybrids do not differ significantly from each other in most indicators, exceeding V. vinifera varieties in the number of elements of productivity, winter hardiness and yield. Complex hybrids with American species have an intermediate position between these groups exceeding all groups in bunch weight. All groups of cultivars show trends towards a reduction in productive period, an increase in the mass of bunch and yield, sugar content and a decrease in acidity. The V. vinifera × V. labrusca hybrids are distinguished by the highest growth rate of the bunch mass caused by a reduction in the duration of active growth and a decrease in the percentage of fruit-bearing shoots. A higher reduction rate of the production period and a decrease in acidity were observed in later varieties. Regression analysis showed that the acceleration of the ripening of grapes is largely due to rising temperatures. © Novikova L.Yu., Naumova L.G., 2019.","Adaptability; Agrometeorology; Ampelographic collection; Climate change; Information system; Time series",,Article,Scopus

Consequently, analyzing the fuel consumption of agricultural machinery for farm operations of different sizes makes it possible to predict fuel consumption to set an appropriate budget for energy. The main purpose of this study was to determine the ability of the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the fuel consumption of tractor-chisel plow systems correctly. A training-set design of 139 points of 173 data points obtained from the literature was utilized, and the remaining 34 data points were applied as a test set. The input parameters were tractor power, plowing width, depth and speed of plowing, soil percentages of sand, silt, and clay, initial soil moisture content, and initial soil bulk density. The predictive power of the KNN method was compared with that of multiple linear regression (MLR), and experimental data were used to determine the predictive power of both methods. The KNN method generated better results than the multiple linear regression method. The test dataset correlation coefficients were 0.817 for the KNN (k = 2) method and 0.422 for the multiple linear regression method. This study suggests that the KNN method with k = 2 (two nearest neighbors) is suitable for estimating the fuel consumption of tractor-chisel plow systems for input values within the studied range. © Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Agricola.","Chisel plow; Fuel consumption; K-nearest neighbors; Machine-learning algorithms; Prediction; Tillage",,Article,Scopus

Farmers can fly their UAV spraying pesticides around their crop fields while staying at their remote control room or any place that is separated from their farm land. However, there is a common phenomenon in rice planting management stage that some empty areas are randomly located in farmland. Therefore, a critical problem is that the waste of pesticides that occurs when spraying pesticides over rice fields with empty areas by using the common UAV, because it is difficult to control the flow accuracy based on the empty areas changing. To tackle this problem, a novel vision-based spraying system was proposed that can identify empty areas automatically while spraying a precise amount of pesticides on the target regions. By this approach, the image was preprocessed with the Lucy-Richardson algorithm, then the target area was split from the background with k-means and the feature parameters were extracted, finally the feature parameters were filtered out with a positive contribution which would serve as the input parameters of the support vector machine (SVM) to identify the target area. Also a fuzzy control model was analyzed and exerted to compensate the nonlinearity and hysteresis of the variable rate spraying system. Experimental results proved that the approach was applicable to reducing the amount of pesticides during UAV spraying, which can provide a reference for precision agriculture aviation in the future. © 2019, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Then we demonstrate the model's performance for the period 2008-2019 over corn and soybean fields in the midwestern United States, which suffer frequent damage from recurrent flooding. We fed the network with remote sensing images and weather fields and divide the growing season into two windows, the early season (May-June) and the late season (July-November) for better performance. The results show mean relative error within ± 25% and relative root mean square error within 35%-75% in majority of the counties for most years. Finally, we show that the model forced with meteorological variables alone can provide acceptable accuracy, which indicates it can be applied to forecasting crop damage area in the upcoming season or the studying of future climate impact on crop productivity.

Cultivar differences can significantly influence potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tuber yield prediction using remote sensing technologies. The objective of this study was to improve potato yield prediction using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing by incorporating cultivar information with machine learning methods. Small plot experiments involving different cultivars and nitrogen (N) rates were conducted in 2018 and 2019. UAV-based multi-spectral images were collected throughout the growing season. Machine learning models, i.e., random forest regression (RFR) and support vector regression (SVR), were used to combine different vegetation indices with cultivar information. It was found that UAV-based spectral data from the early growing season at the tuber initiation stage (late June) were more correlated with potato marketable yield than the spectral data from the later growing season at the tuber maturation stage. However, the best performing vegetation indices and the best timing for potato yield prediction varied with cultivars. The performance of the RFR and SVR models using only remote sensing data was unsatisfactory (R2 = 0.48–0.51 for validation) but was significantly improved when cultivar information was in-corporated (R2 = 0.75–0.79 for validation). It is concluded that combining high spatial-resolution UAV images and cultivar information using machine learning algorithms can significantly improve potato yield prediction than methods without using cultivar information. More studies are needed to improve potato yield prediction using more detailed cultivar information, soil and landscape variables, and management information, as well as more advanced machine learning models. © 2021 by the authors.

The research showed a close relationship between yield and most remote sensing variables. Significant multiple correlations were also recorded between most remote sensing variables. The optimal principal components numbers of PLS models used to estimate yield were 4. Green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI) were sensitive variables for yield remote sensing estimation.

As affected by complex background such as soil, ground, plastic film and lots of overlapping green leaves in greenhouse, it is difficult to recognize disease from image of tomato leaf. In order to provide a solution for such problem, an innovate tomato early blight disease spot detection method of sliding window SVM (SW-SVM) was proposed. To enhance recognition accuracy and stability, color and texture features included color moment (CM), color coherence vector (CCV) and rotation invariant co-occurrence among adjacent LBPs (RIC-LBP) features were introduced, and CCR-SVM (CM+CCV+RIC-LBP+SVM) classification model were trained by using RBF-SVM with the extracted color texture feature (CCR) from the training samples. Meanwhile, for supporting small region data set and to fulfill recognize performance under complex environment, original images were divided to small region images by applying sliding window. And small region images belonged to early blight disease spot, healthy leaves and ground background were selected and divided into three catalogs as training samples. To verify feasibility of the proposed method, offline and online experiments were conducted. For offline classification performance, cross validation average recognition rate was 99.55% and recognition rate for testing data set was 96.97%, and average testing time for a single sliding window image was 0.004 s. For online detection performance, the results showed that the proposed method can realize average accuracy rate for the original images with 86.39%, average detection time of single sliding windows image with 0.073 s. For rotated images and pixel value adjusted image data, average accuracy rate was 88.98% and 92.59%, respectively; average error recognition rate was 12.71% and 16.44%, respectively; average missing recognition rate was 10.93% and 7.41%, respectively; and average disease detection time of single sliding window image was 0.075 s and 0.074 s, respectively. As a conclusion, the offline and online experiments results showed that the proposed method of CCR-SVM realized high accuracy and low memory requirement, which could provide real-time solution for tomato early blight detection in greenhouse. © 2021, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

Can we use ML to find a variable that significantly affects the TCP throughput in WiFi? In this work, we employ a publicly available WiFi dataset to investigate these questions. We use ML techniques, including principal component analysis (PCA), linear regression (LR), and random forest (RF), to study the effect of link speed, received signal strength, round-trip time (RTT), and number of available access points on TCP throughput in WiFi. More specifically, we are interested in employing ML to find the variable that most accurately predicts and thereby most significantly affects the throughput. Simple correlation analysis indicates that a combination of multiple variables is more likely to act as a reasonable predictor of the throughput, whereas a single variable, such as RTT, alone is not likely to predict the throughput with reasonable accuracy. From PCA, the first principal component (PC1) is seen as highly correlated to RTT. During predictive analysis, it is observed that the LR model is unable to find any hidden relationship between throughput and other variables. However, the RF model discovers that RTT explains the variation in throughput more closely and as such it predicts the throughput more accurately compared to other variables. PC1 captures nearly all of the variation in throughput with the RF model and predicts throughput with very high accuracy, which indirectly confirms RTT as the variable that most significantly affects the TCP throughput in WiFi. Consequently, we discover a very close relationship between RTT and TCP throughput using appropriate ML techniques, and these results can be helpful in developing a better understanding of the relationship between latency and throughput for designing future low-latency networks. © 2021, The Author(s).","Machine learning; Random forest; Round-trip time; TCP throughput; WiFi","Decision trees; Flow control; Principal component analysis; Transmission control protocol; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Link speed; Machine learning techniques; Principal-component analysis; Random forest modeling; Random forests; Regression forests; Round-trip-time; TCP throughput; Wi Fi networks; Wifi; Machine learning",Article,Scopus

So, decision support tools, on-farm nutrient cycling models, and life cycle assessment tools to assess the sustainability of agricultural production systems that include manure typically use ambient air temperature as a surrogate for manure temperature. This study explores the application of machine learning algorithms' unique abilities to predict manure temperature based on measured data. The data was collected from two on-farm manure storages (clay pit and concrete tank) instrumented with sensors to acquire manure temperature at various depths during the storage period. The local weather data (ambient air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, solar radiation, relative humidity, and rainfall) were recorded by stations installed at each farm. The data were subjected to four machine learning algorithms gradient boosted trees, bagged tree ensembles, random forest ensembles, and neural networks using the supervised learning approach. The weather data and two additional parameters, time (month) and the manure depth above a sensor, were derived and used as inputs for the machine learning algorithms. Further, the developed machine learning algorithms were challenged with parameters from historical weather data (1990 to 2020) to assess their suitability to predict manure temperature where local weather is not available. The results showed that, in general, the stored manure temperature lagged but followed a similar trend as the ambient air temperature and solar radiation. The average manure temperature was higher than the ambient air temperature for most of the year. Depth influenced the manure temperature; manure in the top layers had a higher temperature during warm periods than the bottom layers, and vice versa during cold seasons. The ensemble models performed better than the neural networks by predicting manure temperatures closer to the measured values and predictions during the scenario analysis. The random forests and bagged tree ensembles were the best performers. Models tended to make better predictions as the depth of manure above a sensor increased. This work will provide added value for developing better decision support tools and models for assessing nutrient cycling on farms. It also informs our knowledge to develop emission mitigation strategies during manure storage, leading to more sustainable manure management practices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Dairy manure; Machine learning; Manure emissions; Manure storages; Modeling manure temperature","Atmospheric temperature; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Digital storage; Fertilizers; Forecasting; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Life cycle; Meteorology; Nutrients; Solar radiation; Wind; Ambient air temperature; Dairy manures; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Manure emission; Manure storages; Modeling manure temperature; Nutrients cycling; Support tool; Weather data; Machine learning; agricultural production; air temperature; algorithm; assessment method; detection method; gas storage; machine learning; sensor; solar radiation; storage; temperature effect",Article,Scopus

The rice production mainly depends on climatic parameters such as rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed etc. If the farmers can get the timely advice on variation of climatic condition, they can take appropriate action to increase the rice production. This factor motivate us to prepare a computational model for the farmers and ultimately to the society also. The main contribution of this work is to present a classifier ensemble based prediction model by considering the original rice yield and climatic datasets of coastal districts Odisha namely Balasore, Cuttack and Puri for the period of 1983 to 2014 for Rabi and Kharif seasons. This ensemble method uses five diversified classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbour, Naive Bayesian, Decision Tree, and Linear Discriminant Analysis. This is an iterative approach; where at each iteration one classifier acts as main classifier and other four classifiers are used as base classifiers whose output has been considered after taking the majority voting.

In the scaled model silo, a total of 5681 measurements are carried out for grain stacks with different surface patterns and different weights (0-20 kg). Then, the dataset is constituted by using the spectrograms of these radar measurements.

To achieve sustainability, we formulate a multiobjective (MO) optimization problem, in which the decision maker determines the cultivation areas and the supplemental irrigation water levels at different locations, with social, economic, and environmental goals in mind. For the social goal, we minimize the root mean squared difference of incomes among locations. For the economic goal, we minimize the production risk. We show that minimizing production risk is equivalent to maximizing the service level, when demand is normally distributed. For the environmental goal, we minimize the resource utilization. Assume that the yield vector at different locations follows a multivariate normal distribution. We formulate the MO optimization problem using a weight global criterion method, and we provide a sufficient condition for convex quadratic programming. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed framework in the case study of sugarcane production in Thailand. To capture yield response to water, we propose several models including linear and nonlinear regressions, and we obtain the closed-form expression for the linear and probit yield response models.

In addition to the ASOS in-situ observations, we used CRU-JRA ver. 2.1 and ERA5 reanalysis. From the multiple meteorological datasets, we extracted the four common variables (air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and precipitation) and analyzed the characteristics of each data and the associations with rice yields. CRU-JRA ver. 2.1 showed an overall agreement with the other datasets. While relative humidity had a rare relationship with rice yields, solar radiation showed a somewhat high correlation with rice yields. Using the air temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation of July, August, and September, we built a random forest model for the hindcast experiments of rice yields. The model with CRU-JRA ver. 2.1 showed the best performance with a correlation coefficient of 0.772.

First, the youth share in population is falling rapidly, and youth numbers are stable or falling slowly everywhere, except in Africa. In Africa, youth share is rising very slowly, but numbers are set to double in 40 years. Second, large majorities of rural youth live in spaces that are not inherently limiting: two-thirds live in zones with highest agricultural potential, and one-quarter combine this with highest commercialisation potential. The 4% that do live in inherently challenging spaces are concentrated in pockets of persistent poverty in middle-income countries. Third, rural spaces’ commercial potential has large impacts on welfare outcomes, but their agricultural potential has no detectable impact.

The accurate prediction of its yield quantity could lead to high economic benefits for farmers as well as for the rural national economy. In this research, we propose a multiple-input neural network model for the prediction of cotton’s production. The proposed model utilizes as inputs three different kinds of data (soil data, cultivation management data, and yield management data) which are treated and handled independently. The significant advantages of the selected architecture are that it is able to efficiently exploit mixed data, which usually requires being processed separately, reduces overfitting, and provides more flexibility and adaptivity for low computational cost compared to a classical fully-connected neural network. An empirical study was performed utilizing data from three consecutive years from cotton farms in Central Greece (Thessaly) in which the prediction performance of the proposed model was evaluated against that of traditional neural network-based and state-of-the-art models. The numerical experiments revealed the superiority of the proposed approach. © 2020 by the authors.

Verdc.) is an underutilized pulse crop with good drought resistance traits. It is a rich source of protein. Conventional breeding methods for high yielding and abiotic stress tolerant germplasm are hampered by the scarcity of morphological data sets. Thus, horse gram cultivars considered for this study is classified based on prevailing growth factors showing homogenous genotype in various agro ecological zones. Nowadays, several machine learning (ML) methods are used in the field of plant phenotyping. RESULTS: We adopted unsupervised learning techniques from the K-means clustering algorithm to analyze important morphological traits: plant shoot length, total plant height, flowering percentage, number of pods per plant, pod length, number of seeds per plant, and seed length variants between germplasm. Unsupervised clustering revealed that 20 germplasm accessions were grouped in four clusters in which high-yielding traits were predominantly observed in cluster 2. CONCLUSION: These findings could guide ML-based classification to characterize suitable germplasms on the basis of high-yielding varieties for different agro-ecological zones. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry","germplasm; horse gram; K-means clustering; machine learning; morphological traits","algorithm; classification; drought; Fabaceae; genetics; genotype; growth, development and aging; machine learning; phenotype; physiological stress; physiology; plant breeding; plant seed; quantitative trait locus; Algorithms; Droughts; Fabaceae; Genotype; Machine Learning; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Quantitative Trait Loci; Seeds; Stress, Physiological",Article,Scopus

An EM38-DD field apparatus was used to measure the apparent electrical conductivity of the soil expressed as ECv in order to shed light on the spatial variability of salinity of the area by monthly observations conducted at 50 points. The salinity measurements were conducted from June 2005 to November 2006, and in July and November 2018, and in March 2019. The ECv values decreased with distance from the lagoon and the wetlands towards the upper and/or central parts of the basin. A comparison of the distributions of salinity showed that salt-affected soils corresponded to the high electrical conductivity of the water-table. The changes in soil salinity indicated that salinization was the result of capillary rise and evaporation from the saline shallow water-table. The electrical conductivity of several soil series and varying land management revealed that the ECv values above 200 mS/m significantly hinder plant growth, however, land use practices (i.e., crop rotation) slightly affected the fluctuation level of salinization. The ECv values of the rainy seasons were generally lower than those of the dry periods. It can be concluded that the topographic position (e.g., distance to the lagoon), soil texture, and the saline shallow water-table along with the inappropriate soil and micro-topographic conditions, are the most effective factors for salinity build up. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Irrigation facilities; Land use; Micro-topography; Semi-arid regions; Soil salinity; Water-table","electrical conductivity; environmental monitoring; long-term change; salinity; salinization; semiarid region; spatial variation; wetland; Adana [Turkey]; Adana [Turkey]; Akyatan Lagoon; Mediterranean Coast [Turkey]; Seyhan Basin; Turkey",Article,Scopus

A study presents a comparison between proposed models with conventional 2D and 3D CNN architectures, and existing agronomy methods. The dataset used to train and test the models is constructed using on-farm experiment data from nine cornfields across the US together with multispectral satellite images. Results show that the MSCNN-LF achieved a 20% reduction of the prediction's mean squared error value when compared to a 3D CNN, and a 26% reduction when compared to a 2D CNN. An optimization algorithm uses the MSCNN-LF model's gradient to change the manageable inputs variables in a way the expected profit is maximized subject to resource constraints.

This study was conducted in 2015 to evaluate the interspecific competition in tree-based intercropping systems in a semiarid region of Saman County, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province, Iran. Wheat and barley intercropping with almond trees in comparison with the conventional sole-cropping was investigated in terms of the photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), leaf area index, crop growth rate (CGR), net assimilation rate (NAR), amount of the residual elements in the soil, soil organic carbon, and crop yields at three distances from the trees (0.5 m, 1.5 m, and 2.5 m). According to the results, the PAR intercepted by the crops increased with distances from the tree. The highest intercepted PAR in almond–barley and almond–wheat systems was 1017 and 796 µmol m−2 s−1, respectively, at a distance of 2.5 m from the trees. The shading of the almond tree at 0.5 m from the trunk caused a reduction in the intercepted PAR by about 80%. This trend was repeated for the NAR and CGR, which had the highest values at distance of 2.5 m from the tree. The highest grain yields for wheat and barley (2985 and 2180 kg ha−1, respectively) were obtained by intercropping systems at the distance of 2.5 m from the trees, which were 35% and 39% higher than their respective monocultures. The remaining nutrients in the soil were also affected by the planting systems and their distance from the tree. For example, in barley–almond system, the highest amounts of soil organic carbon (0.89 g kg−1), total nitrogen (0.8 g kg−1), phosphorus (15.5 mg kg−1), and potassium (289 mg kg−1) in soil were observed at a distance of 0.5 m from the almond trees, which were higher than the monoculture by about 55, 63, 48, and 53%, respectively. In general, the amounts of residual nutrients of the soil were greater for the agroforestry system. The reduction of PAR in agroforestry systems was the most important crop limitation, which can be managed by increasing the distance from the trees. According to the data regarding carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium residues in the soil of agroforestry system, it could be concluded that soil fertility was not limiting crop performance. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Agroforestry; Competition; Monoculture; Nutrient; PAR","agroforestry; cereal; crop plant; crop yield; deciduous tree; growth rate; intercropping; monoculture; organic carbon; photosynthetically active radiation; semiarid region; soil fertility; soil nutrient; Iran; Hordeum; Prunus dulcis; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

However, it remains to be determined whether and how the soil extracts of Cupressus funebris impact seed germination and seedling growth of the crops of the Hilly Area of the Central Sichuan Basin. We hypothesized that the soil extracts of Cupressus funebris would restrain both the seed germination and seedling growth of the crops. We conducted a laboratory experiment to examine the allelopathic effects of the soil extracts (0.00 g/mL, 0.01 g/mL, 0.02 g/mL, 0.05 g/mL, and 0.10 g/mL) on the seed germination and seedling growth of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), pepper (Capsicum annuum), and eggplant (Solanum melongena). Our results demonstrated that variation in soil extracts can impact seed germination and seedling growth, but the effects were species specific. In tomato plants, the vigor index significantly increased, but the fresh root weight significantly decreased at 0.01 g/mL of soil extracts. Tomato root length significantly increased at 0.05 g/mL of soil extracts, whereas the seed germination rate decreased at 0.10 g/mL of soil extracts. Soil extracts obviously reduced the germination energy and fresh seedling weight of pepper. The root lengths and fresh root weights of pepper were obviously decreased at 0.01 g/mL and 0.02 g/mL of soil extracts, respectively. For eggplants, soil extracts significantly increased the vigor index but decreased the fresh root weight. The comprehensive allelopathic effect index indicated that tomato and eggplant exhibited inhibitory and stimulatory effects, while pepper exhibited only an inhibitory effect. Meanwhile, the allelopathic sensitivity of crops to soil extracts was as follows: pepper > eggplant > tomato. These results demonstrate that soil extracts can impact seed germination and seedling growth. Our results also suggest that pepper planting should be avoided in the slopes of farmland with Cupressus funebri in the Hilly Area of Central Sichuan Basin. © 2020 Science Press.

On the basis of field survey data, the effect of weed infestation on winter wheat spectral reflectance at different stages of vegetation was analyzed using the example of individual fields in the Tula region with chernozems, grey forest, and alluvial arable soils. Under field conditions, crop weedness, spectral reflectance of crops, weeds, winter wheat leaves and soil determined using FieldSpec® HandHeld 2TM field spectro-radiometer (ASD, Inc., USA) was assessed several times during the growing season, and the crop canopy surface was photographed. The decoding of the photos showed that the projective weed coverage on the crop canopy surface is low enough at the beginning and middle of the wheat growing season, but increases significantly since the beginning of leaves yellowing. At the same time, the projective coverage of weeds in the field with chernozems was minimal at the beginning and middle of the growing season, and maximal - by the end of the growing season. Projective coverage of weeds on fields with grey forest and alluvial arable soils did not differ statistically, but on alluvial soils it increased significantly by the end of wheat vegetation. Using the spectral mixing model, the contribution of weeds infestation to the integral reflection of light by crops in the visible and near infrared bands of the electromagnetic waves was estimated. It has been found that despite the rather high weedness of winter wheat canopy in the spring-summer growing season, its projective coverage on the surface of the crop canopy is small. The magnitude of the projective cover of weeds on the surface of crop canopy weakly depends on soil conditions, and is more determined by other factors (history of fields use, crop rotation, etc.). The effect of weed vegetation on the spectral reflectivity of crop canopy changes over time. It is minimal at the peak of the growing season, accounting for several percent for all wavelengths of the visible and near IR range. At the beginning of the post-winter vegetation period, the contribution of weed vegetation to the spectral reflectance of crop canopy can reach 10-20%, and at the end of the vegetation season, weed vegetation can predetermine the spectral appearance of crops at most wavelengths of the considered range. The greatest contribution is observed in all cases in the near IR (710-730 nm) and in the green (520-560 nm) spectral region, but at certain times there are local maxima of the contribution and in the blue spectral region of electromagnetic waves (400-420 nm). The data obtained open up the possibility for the development of new vegetation indices for remote monitoring of crops, which will be less affected by weedness than those traditionally used (for example, NDVI). Conversely, on the basis of the data obtained, special vegetation indices can be proposed for the remote detection of the weedness of winter wheat canopy. © 2020 Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

At this time, data related to rice avaibility is still spread across several agencies and difficult to access easily and quickly to support strategic and rapid decision making. This data is the level of fertility of rice plants, fertilizers and water content at certain locations and times. Fertilizers, new superior varieties and water content are production factors that are vital in supporting the efforts to increase national rice production. New superior varieties including hybrid rice are generally responsive to macro fertilizers NPC (Nitrogen-Phosporus-Calcium), where fertilization efficiency and effectiveness is very dependent on local location. The use of fertilizers with excessive doses must be prevented by socializing the right dosage specifically for location and time. The use of fertilizers with high doses of nitrogen also results in plants being more susceptible to plant pests. Based on the consideration of efficiency and sustainability, the use of uniform recommended doses for large areas and not considering the specific conditions of the plant is no longer relevant to be applied. Therefore the distribution of the characteristics of rice and soil at specific locations and times is very important information.

Understanding the parameters affecting crop productivity is essential for an efficient agriculture. We compared two statistical methods: random forest (RF), and multiple linear regression (MLR), to evaluate the effects of various parameters, including subsoiling, on corn (Zea mays L.) plant height and on seasonal mean water table depth. We performed subsoiling treatments in a clay field of low permeability, provided with subsurface drains and remodeled with rounded beds. These experiments allowed comparing a control without subsoiling to four subsoiling treatments: a tractor and a bulldozer operated parallel and perpendicular to the subsurface drains. Each treatment was randomized and repeated three times. In the spring of 2016, we drilled 198 60-cm deep water table depth observation wells. The corn height was estimated by photogrammetry. The results showed that both RF and MLR allowed determining the main factors affecting plant height and seasonal mean water table depth, for which subsoiling treatments played a negligible role. Coefficients of determination were much higher and prediction intervals much smaller for RF (R2 ≥ 0.94) than for MLR (R2: 0.28-0.69). RF allowed visualizing nonlinear relationships between mean water table depth, plant height and the predictor variables, such as XY coordinates, horizontal distance to the field open drain and depth to subsurface drains which are all related to the position on the beds. To maximize corn plant height in this type of soil, RF also showed that the horizontal distance to drain must be less than 3–4 m, and therefore optimal drain spacing is 7 m, horizontal distance to field open drains is more than 8 m, and optimal mean seasonal water table depth is greater than 0.25 m. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Corn plant height; Multiple linear regression; Random forest; Soil bedding; Subsoiling; Subsurface drainage; Tile drainage; Water table depth","Cultivation; Decision trees; Drainage; Groundwater flow; Linear regression; Plants (botany); Soil mechanics; Soils; Corn plant; Multiple linear regressions; Random forests; Subsoiling; Subsurface drainages; Tile drainage; Water table depths; Groundwater; clay soil; compaction; deep water; growth response; maize; numerical method; permeability; prediction; seasonality; spacing; subsoil; tile drain; water table; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

In this research, the capability of the DRAINMOD-S model was evaluated to predict the salinity of the subsurface drainage effluents in a newly subsurface drained paddy field during winter cropping. Measurements of groundwater table depths and drainage water salinity were taken in three conventional subsurface drainage systems at the Sari Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University, northern Iran, during three canola growing seasons (2011–2012, 2015–2016 and 2016–2017).

Recently, HTP using Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) has shown advantages in both cost and efficiency. However, scalability and efficiency have not been well studied when processing images in complex contexts such as multispectral bands and early/late growth stages. The listed challenges hamper further analysis to quantify phenotypic traits for large-scale and high-precision applications in plant breeding. To solve these challenges, the research team previously built a 3-step data processing pipeline, which is highly modular. For this project we present improvements to the previous methods used for canopy segmentation and crop plot localization for crop image extraction. Furthermore, we propose a novel workflow based on a trie data structure to compute vegetation indices efficiently and with greater flexibility. For each of our proposed changes, we evaluate advantages by comparing with processing results using the original model. Based on these proposed methods, we implement two MATLAB programs, namely Multi-Layer Mosaic version 2 (MLM2) and Vegetation Indices Derivation version 1 (VID1). Using MLM2 and VID1, we compute canopy coverage and Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVIs) for a soybean phenotyping experiment. We use canopy coverage to investigate water depression and NDVIs to evaluate temporal patterns across the soybean growth stages. Both experimental results compare favorably with previous studies, especially on soybean reproductive stage approximation.

Previous regional studies have suggested that the predictable seasonal pattern of a climatic time series, or seasonality, might aid in the prediction of average fire activity, but it is not known whether these findings are applicable globally. Here, we investigate how seasonality can be used to explain variations in fire activity on a global scale. Location: Global, 60° S–60° N. Time period: Data averaged over the period 1999–2015. Methods: We describe a method to partition a periodic seasonal cycle into two seasons and define conceptually simple temporal metrics that describe spatial variability in seasonality. We explore the usefulness of these metrics in explaining global fire activity using the average monthly time series of precipitation and temperature and a flexible machine learning procedure (random forests). Results: A simple model that uses only precipitation and temperature amplitude and synchrony between wet and warm seasons correctly predicts 66% of the variability in global fire activity, substantially more than a model with mean annual temperature and precipitation. A more complex model that includes all nine metrics predicts 87% of variability in global fire activity. Main conclusions: This study shows that seasonality of temperature and precipitation can be used to predict multi-year average fire activity in a globally relevant way. The mechanisms highlighted in our work could be used to improve global fire models and enhance their ability to represent the spatial patterns of fire activity. Our method might also be useful in hindcasting historical fire using reanalysis or predicting future fire regimes using coarse output from climate models. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","burned area; fire prediction; pyrogeography; seasonality","climate modeling; fire; machine learning; precipitation (climatology); prediction; seasonality; spatial variation; temperature profile",Article,Scopus

We also tested the influence of adjusting the quantity of local fertilization and irrigation on crop production in Guizhou Province. Results showed that the total yield of the selected crops had, on average, reached over 72.5% of the theoretical maximum yield. Increasing irrigation tended to be more consistently effective at increasing crop yield than additional fertilization. Conversely, appropriate reduction of fertilization may even benefit crop yield in some regions, simultaneously resulting in significantly higher fertilization efficiency with lower residuals in the environment.

We implemented a remote sensing and evapotranspiration-based light use efficiency model globally and integrated abiotic environmental stressors (temperature, soil moisture, and vapor deficit stressors). The operational model (Global Yield Mapper in Earth Engine (GYMEE)) was validated against actual yield data for three agricultural schemes with different climatic, soil, and management conditions located in Lebanon, Brazil, and Spain. Field-level crop yield data on wheat, potato, and corn for 2015–2020 were used for assessment. The performance of GYMEE was statistically evaluated through root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean bias error (MBE), relative error (RE), and index of agreement (d). The results showed that the absolute difference between the modeled and predicted field-level yield was within ±16% for the analyzed crops in both Brazil and Lebanon study sites and within ±15% in the Spain site (except for two fields). GYMEE performed best for wheat crop in Lebanon with a low RMSE (0.6 t/ha), MAE (0.5 t/ha), MBE (−0.06 t/ha), and RE (0.83%). A very good agreement was observed for all analyzed crop yields, with an index of agreement (d) averaging at 0.8 in all studied sites. GYMEE shows potential in providing yield estimates for potato, wheat, and corn yields at a relative error of ±6%. We also quantified and spatialized the soil moisture stress constraint and its impact on reducing biomass production. A showcasing of moisture stress impact on two emphasized fields from the Lebanon site revealed that a 12% difference in soil moisture stress can decrease yield by 17%.

However, the viability of using these datasets with machine learning to predict within-field cotton lint yield at key growth stages are largely unknown. This study was conducted on two cotton fields, located near Mungindi, New South Wales, Australia. Three years of yield data, soil, elevation, rainfall, and Landsat imagery were collected from each field. A total of 12 models were created using: (a) two machine learning algorithms: random forest (RF) and gradient boosting machines (GBM); (b) three growth stages: squaring, flowering, and boll-fill; and (c) two different amounts of variables: all variables and the optimal variables determined by a recursive feature elimination (RFE). Results showed a strong agreement between predicted and observed yields at flowering and boll-fill when more information was available. At flowering and boll-fill, root mean square error (RMSE) ranged between 0.15 and 0.20 t ha−1 and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC) ranged between 0.50 and 0.66, with RF providing superior results in most cases.

Yield prediction in the early growth stages significantly informs field management decisions for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A 10-year field experiment carried out in the Loess Plateau area tested how three tillage practices (deep ploughing (DP), subsoiling (SS), and no tillage (NT)) influenced cultivation and yield across different fallow periods. The experiment used the random forest (RF) algorithm to construct a prediction model of yields and yield components. Our results revealed that tillage during the fallow period was more effective than NT in improving yield in dryland wheat. Under drought condition, DP during the fallow period achieved a higher yield than SS, especially in drought years; DP was 16% higher than SS. RF was deemed fit for yield prediction across different precipitation years. An RF model was developed using meteorological factors for fixed variables and soil water storage after tillage during a fallow period for a control variable. Small error values existed in the prediction yield, spike number, and grains number per spike. Additionally, the relative error of crop yield under fallow tillage (5.24%) was smaller than that of NT (6.49%). The prediction error of relative meteorological yield was minimum and optimal, indicating that the model is suitable to explain the influence of meteorological factors on yield. © Copyright 2021 Feng et al.","Precipitation types; Random Forest; Tillage; Winter wheat; Yield prediction","calcium phosphate; nitrogen; nitrogen fertilizer; organic matter; phosphorus; phosphorus derivative; potassium sulfate; soil water; alkaline hydrolysis; Article; decision tree; evapotranspiration; fertilization; growth period; harvest; meteorological phenomena; plant yield; plowing; precipitation; random forest; spike; tillage; Triticum aestivum; wheat; winter wheat",Article,Scopus

In this article, the CW-RF model, a new wheat yield estimation model suitable for the North China plain, was established using random forest, and the crop growth model (the CERES-wheat model) was chosen to simulate abundant training samples for random forest at field plot scale. According to CERES-wheat model simulation, the leaf area index (LAI) and leaf nitrogen content (LNC) at the wheat jointing and heading stages were selected as the most sensitive parameters, and were retrieved from UAV hyperspectral imagery using the directional second derivative and angular insensitivity vegetation index methods, respectively. Then the retrieved LAI and LNC results were input into the CW-RF model to estimate winter wheat yield. The field validation in Luohe, Henan showed that the root-mean-squared error of the retrieved LAI and LNC were 6.27% and 12.17% at jointing stages, 9.21% and 13.64% at heading stages, respectively. The RMSE of estimated yield was 1,008.08 kg/ha, and the mean absolute percent error of estimated yield was 9.36%, demonstrating the available of the CW-RF model in wheat yield estimation at field plot scale. Apart from Luohe, validations in some other fields (e.g., Xiaotangshan, Beijing), prove the wide applicability of the CW-RF model. In addition, the UAV hyperspectral data were found to significantly improve the retrieval accuracy, and further improve CW-RF model estimation accuracy. In conclusion, this article showed that the CERES-Wheat model simulation can be important data source for machine learning-based wheat yield estimation model at field plot scale, and the hyperspectral sensor mounted on a UAV is a feasible remote sensing data acquisition mode for winter wheat growth monitoring and yield estimation. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Hyperspectral remote sensing; random forest; the CERES-wheat model; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); wheat yield estimation","Antennas; Crops; Decision trees; Mean square error; Plants (botany); Random forests; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Accurate estimation; Angular insensitivity; Hyper-spectral imageries; Leaf nitrogen content; Root mean squared errors; Second derivatives; Sensitive parameter; Winter wheat yields; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); estimation method; image analysis; image classification; remote sensing; spectral analysis; unmanned vehicle; wheat; yield response; China; North China Plain",Article,Scopus

Previously, hyperspectral indices for chlorophyll (Chl) estimation, namely a green peak and red edge in the visible region, have been identified and used for N estimation because leaf N content closely related to Chl content in green leaves. Herein, datasets of N and Chl contents, and visible and near-infrared hyperspectral reflectance, derived from green leaves under various N nutrient conditions and albino yellow leaves were obtained. A regression model was then constructed using several machine learning algorithms and preprocessing techniques. Machine learning algorithms achieved high-performance models for N and Chl content, ensuring an accuracy threshold of 1.4 or 2.0 based on the ratio of performance to deviation values. Data-based sensitivity analysis through integration of the green and yellow leaves datasets identified clear differences in reflectance to estimate N and Chl contents, especially at 1325–1575 nm, suggesting an N content-specific region. These findings will enable the nondestructive estimation of leaf N content in tea plants and contribute advanced indices for nondestructive tracking of N status in crops. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"chlorophyll; nitrogen; algorithm; Camellia sinensis; chemistry; machine learning; plant leaf; procedures; spectroscopy; Algorithms; Camellia sinensis; Chlorophyll; Machine Learning; Nitrogen; Plant Leaves; Spectrum Analysis",Article,Scopus

With increasingly available topographical and soil information, there is a growing interest in developing variable rate planting strategies to exploit variation in the agri-landscape in order to maximize production. A random forest regression-based approach was developed to model the interactions between planting rate, hybrid/variety, topography, soil characteristics, weather variables, and their effects on yield by leveraging on-farm variable rate planting trials for corn and soybean conducted at 27 sites in New York between 2014 and 2018 (57 site-years) in collaboration with the New York Corn and Soybean Growers Association. Planting rate ranked highly in terms of random forest regression variable importance while explaining relatively minimal yield variation in the linear context, indicating that yield response to planting rate likely depends on complex interactions with agri-landscape features. Random forest models explained moderate levels of yield within site-years, while the ability to predict yield in untested site-years was low. Relatedly, variable importance measures for the predictors varied considerably across sites. Together, these results suggest that local testing may provide the most accurate optimized planting rate designs due to the unique set of conditions at each site. The proposed method was extended to identify the optimal variable rate planting design for maximizing yield at each site given the underlying conditions, and empirical validation of the resulting designs is currently underway. © 2020 The Authors.

Climate forecasting centres around the globe now routinely run global climate models (GCMs) to provide ensemble forecasts. However, raw GCM forecasts require post-processing to improve their reliability and to enable systematic integration with crop models. Post-processing to meet crop model input requirements is highly challenging and simple bias-correction methods can perform poorly in this regard. As a result of the difficulties, GCM forecasts are often sidelined in favour of other inputs such as climate analogues. In this study, we evaluate two variants of a recently-developed post-processing method designed to systematically and reliably calibrate and downscale GCM forecasts for use in crop models. In one variant, local GCM forecasts of rainfall, temperature and solar radiation are post-processed directly. The second variant is a novel adaption in which the predictive input is instead the GCM's forecast of a large-scale climate pattern, in this case related to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. The post-processed climate forecasts, which are in the form of ensemble time series, are used to drive an APSIM-sugar model to generate long-lead forecasts of biomass in north-eastern Australia from 1982 to 2016. A rigorous probabilistic assessment of forecast attributes suggests that local GCM forecast calibration provides the most skilful forecasts overall although the ENSO-related forecasts give more skilful biomass forecasts at certain times, implying model combination could be worthwhile to maximise skill. The generated biomass forecasts are unbiased and reliable for short to long lead times, suggesting that the downscaling methods will be of value to trial in a range of crop forecast applications, and support the quantitative, meaningful use of GCM forecasts in agriculture. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","APSIM; Crop yield; Ensemble forecasting; Forecast verification; Sugarcane","biomass; calibration; crop yield; downscaling; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; general circulation model; global climate; solar radiation; weather forecasting; Australia",Article,Scopus

This study provides land productivity estimates in the contiguous United States (CONUS) through a machine learning approach. Land productivity is defined as the potential in producing agricultural outputs given biophysical properties including climate, soil, and land slope. The land productivity is approximated by the potential yields of six major crops in the CONUS, i.e. corn, soybean, winter wheat, spring wheat, cotton, and alfalfa. This quantitative relationship is then applied to estimating the availability of marginal land for bioenergy crop production in the CONUS. Furthermore, the levels of uncertainties associated with land productivity and marginal land estimates are quantified and discussed. Based on the modeling results, the total marginal land of the CONUS ranges 55.0-172.8 mha, but the 95% inter-percentile distance of the estimated productivity index reaches up to 60% of its expected value in data-scarce regions.

This study investigated the possibility of using vegetation indices (VIs) derived from Sentinel-2 images and machine learning techniques to assess corn (Zea mays) grain yield spatial variability within the field scale. A 22-ha study field in North Italy was monitored between 2016 and 2018; corn yield was measured and recorded by a grain yield monitor mounted on the harvester machine recording more than 20,000 georeferenced yield observation points from the study field for each season. VIs from a total of 34 Sentinel-2 images at different crop ages were analyzed for correlation with the measured yield observations. Multiple regression and two different machine learning approaches were also tested to model corn grain yield. The three main results were the following: (i) the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) provided the highest R2 value of 0.48 for monitoring within-field variability of corn grain yield; (ii) the most suitable period for corn yield monitoring was a crop age between 105 and 135 days from the planting date (R4-R6); (iii) Random Forests was the most accurate machine learning approach for predicting within-field variability of corn yield, with an R2 value of almost 0.6 over an independent validation set of half of the total observations. Based on the results, within-field variability of corn yield for previous seasons could be investigated from archived Sentinel-2 data with GNDVI at crop stage (R4-R6). © 2019 by the authors.","Corn yield; Digital farming; Machine learning; Precision agriculture; Sentinel-2; Vegetation indices; Within-field variability","Crops; Decision trees; Image enhancement; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Corn yields; Digital farming; Field variability; Sentinel-2; Vegetation index; Grain (agricultural product)",Article,Scopus

LCA and TEA were coupled with dynamic simulation models of crop yields, costs, and prices, allowing for the estimation of life-cycle environmental impacts and profitability of crop planting activities under changing climate and economic conditions. The framework was demonstrated by a case study for an agricultural system, including 1,000 farms in the United States over a 30-year time frame. The results indicated that information exchange among farmers, farmers' environmental awareness, access to environmental information, and farm size are key factors driving the system's environmental impacts. The results can provide a broad range of stakeholders (e.g., policymakers, nonprofits, agriculture companies) with insightful information to tailor their strategies for effectively managing the environmental footprints of large-scale agricultural systems.

Oil palm is known as the most efficient commercial crop with the capacity to fulfill the growing global demand for vegetable oil consumption. However, oil palm production dependence on pollination is experiencing issues with decreasing the actual yield. Consequently, alternative methods in commercial plantations such as human-assisted pollination and recently Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) have been deployed despite their high economic costs due to labor requirements. Oil palm assisted pollination requires precision, inspection, traceability, and validation processes in the field. Currently, all these processes are performed by humans that can be associated with false assumptions, uncertainty, and pollination latency. Therefore, Machine Learning (ML) approaches as a subset of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain provides efficient, cost-effective, and non-destructive solutions to determine these reproductive stages for future autonomous pollination system. Our goal was to reduce the variability of worker's performance in oil palms, using ML algorithms to make expert decisions and reduce the risk related to a transient workforce. This comparative empirical study examined and compared the performance of the Random Forest (RF) against k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification of oil palm pre-anthesis and anthesis stages, dividing into four classes (1, 2, 3, and 4). These models were tested using thermal features (endogenous) individually and in combination with meteorological variables (exogenous). The performance of models is evaluated with specific measures of performance, such as overall user's and producer's accuracies and F-measure values derived from the confusion matrix. The results showed that the RF model produced better results with regard to average F-measure (88.6%, 71.83%), producer's accuracies (88.70%, 71.35%), and user's accuracies (88.27%, 72.36%) on test sets using exogenous + exogenous and endogenous feature sets, respectively. Among the three classifiers tested with two datasets, the RF method outperforms the other two popular algorithms, i.e., kNN and SVM with respect to accuracy and F-measure metrics.

Still, in many regions crop type mapping with satellite data remains constrained by a scarcity of field-level crop labels for training supervised classification models. When training data is not available in one region, classifiers trained in similar regions can be transferred, but shifts in the distribution of crop types as well as transformations of the features between regions lead to reduced classification accuracy. We present a methodology that uses aggregate-level crop statistics to correct the classifier by accounting for these two types of shifts. To adjust for shifts in the crop type composition we present a scheme for properly reweighting the posterior probabilities of each class that are output by the classifier. To adjust for shifts in features we propose a method to estimate and remove linear shifts in the mean feature vector. We demonstrate that this methodology leads to substantial improvements in overall classification accuracy when using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to map crop types in Occitanie, France and in Western Province, Kenya. When using LDA as our base classifier, we found that in France our methodology led to percent reductions in misclassifications ranging from 2.8% to 42.2% (mean = 21.9%) over eleven different training departments, and in Kenya the percent reductions in misclassification were 6.6%, 28.4%, and 42.7% for three training regions. While our methodology was statistically motivated by the LDA classifier, it can be applied to any type of classifier. As an example, we demonstrate its successful application to improve a Random Forest classifier. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Agriculture; Anticausal Learning; Classification; Crop mapping; Domain Shift; Machine Learning; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Transfer learning","Aggregates; Crops; Decision trees; Discriminant analysis; Mapping; Satellite imagery; Supervised learning; Anticausal learning; Crop mapping; Crop type mappings; Domain shift; Field level; Linear discriminant analysis; Machine-learning; Remote-sensing; Sentinel-2; Transfer learning; Remote sensing; crop plant; geostatistics; image classification; satellite data; satellite imagery; statistical analysis; supervised classification; France; Kenya; Occitanie; Western Province [Kenya]",Article,Scopus

Precision irrigation allows to achieve these goals through optimizing water use. This approach is particularly advantageous to supply specific irrigation in water limited conditions, but it requires a quick and accurate identification of the grapevine water status and its variability in the vineyard. Traditional sensing methods require specific equipment and long elaboration steps that cannot be easily used by all the wineries. In vineyards, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is currently largely detected to evaluate the variability of plant characteristics. Monitoring the crop water status using NDVI would allow to have a rapid and simple support for the irrigation management. The objective of the study is to set a site-specific model able to estimate the grapevine water stress and its variability at different phenological stages, using NDVI as input. The experiment was carried out in 2018 in a ‘Sangiovese’ vineyard located in the Chianti area, Tuscany (Italy). Data were collected on July 18 and August 23 in 15 analysis stations for the calibration and 12 stations for the validation of the model. In each station, NDVI index was measured using proximal and remote (sentinel 2) multispectral sensors. The water stress was estimated using a portable thermal camera through the crop water stress index (CWSI), analyzing 9 repetitions per station. A square regression model was set for each phenological stage, using NDVI as predictor. Models were calibrated for proximal (July 18, R2=0.578; August 23 R2=0.573) and remote (July 18, R2=0.476) sensing and they were validated for proximal (July 18, R2=0.658; August 23, R2=0.545) and for remote (July 18, R2=0.466). Results show that NDVI was able to predict the water status of the studied vineyard, thus the obtained models can be used for a site-specific water management. © 2021 International Society for Horticultural Science.

In this paper, the trends of temperature and precipitation over the next thirty years in China are analysed using CMIP6 under the SSP1–2.6, SSP2–4.5 and SSP 5–8.5 climate scenarios. The resilience indicators of grain yield are proposed for the first time. We find that the higher the emission concentration is, the greater the temperature increase will be and further northward the precipitation belt will move. Meanwhile, the resilience varies across different climate zones. The temperate monsoon climate zone has a stronger resilience to adapt to climate change compared to that of other areas.

These data intensive cooperatives help generate AI supported insights for member farmers. However, this leads to a rising concern among individual smart farm owners about the privacy of their data, especially while sharing the data with the co-op. In this paper, we present a framework where the individual smart farm owner's privacy is preserved, as it is shared to train robust anomaly detection models at the cooperative level. Here, we preserve the privacy of each farm owner by adding noise to their data through data perturbation techniques such as white Gaussian noise. Our experimental results show that the anomaly detection models can identify various anomalous events even when the training data is transformed with white noise.

Postharvest grading of Calamansi is an arduous task when manually done. Thus an efficient way of grading it according to size, color, maturity, and condition of the fruit is needed to help calamansi farmers, grade and classify them non-destructively with precision and accuracy. The goal of this study is to create a model for classifying Calamansi fruit. The study used ImageJ to measure the size of the fruit before it is run and trained using Convolutional Neural Network. Additionally, two datasets were used during the training of the model. The original dataset contains images with reference objects while the second dataset is a duplicate of the original dataset with the reference object removed from the images. The reference object used is a United States (US) quarter coin with a diameter of 2.1426 cm. The result revealed a 96.67% average accuracy using the original dataset that contains the reference object. Whereas, using the dataset without the reference object yielded a 70.24% accuracy rate. It shows that the size of the fruit could be best measured and produced the highest accuracy rate when a reference object is used.

This paper analyses the butterfly effect in the agricultural product industry chain from the perspective of producer and consumer by using multidimensional time and space theory and proposes a new price forecasting method. We consider that the price change of agricultural products is not only affected by the balance of market supply and demand but also by the factors of time and space. Taking the pig industry chain of Sichuan Province as an example, this paper explores and excavates the data from 2010 to 2020 in the time dimension. Interestingly, we found that the price changes in pork in the market are generally highly correlated with the prices of slaughtered pigs, piglets a few weeks ago and the prices of multiple feed a few months ago. Based on the precise time-space factors, we improved the price forecasting model, greatly improved the accuracy of price prediction, and proved the effectiveness of multidimen­sional spatiotemporal association mining.

This paper attempts to study the impact of ongoing pandemic in the agricultural sector specific to pulses in India. This paper finds that there is a significantly negative impact of Covid-19 on the pulses market. The market arrival of pulses has declined in the recent period while market demand for pulses has increased, therefore, there exists a supply side shortage for pulses in the domestic economy of India. This paper suggests that Government of India (Agriculture Department) urgently needs to deal with this shortage in supply of domestic pulses in ""mandis"" (agricultural markets). In this paper market arrival for pulses particularly green gram (Moong whole) has been forecasted for the next few months in Indian Agricultural Markets with the forecasting techniques such as Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique for pre and during pandemic period by using the arrival data in agriculture markets of India from Agmarknet. The results of this study using ARIMA models and ANNs have been compared to obtain the final conclusions with higher visibility in forecasting performance, which shows that there will be a sharp decline in market arrival with an average arrival of 494 quintals per day which can be maximized up to 623 quintals per day by stimulating the modal price at maximum possible point.

However, detecting infestation with the RPW is highly challenging because symptoms are not visible until the death of the palm tree is inevitable. In addition, the use of automated RPW weevil identification tools to predict infestation is complicated by a lack of RPW datasets. In this study, we assessed the capability of 10 state-of-the-art data mining classification algorithms, Naive Bayes (NB), KSTAR, AdaBoost, bagging, PART, J48 Decision tree, multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and logistic regression, to use plant-size and temperature measurements collected from individual trees to predict RPW infestation in its early stages before significant damage is caused to the tree. The performance of the classification algorithms was evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure using a real RPW dataset. The experimental results showed that infestations with RPW can be predicted with an accuracy up to 93%, precision above 87%, recall equals 100%, and F-measure greater than 93% using data mining. Additionally, we found that temperature and circumference are the most important features for predicting RPW infestation. However, we strongly call for collecting and aggregating more RPW datasets to run more experiments to validate these results and provide more conclusive findings. © 2021 by the authors.

Observations of GY and SN were performed at harvest on six fields (three locations in two seasons: 2017 and 2018) in three regions of Poland, i.e., northeastern (A—Brożówka), central (B—Zdziechów) and southeastern Poland (C—Kryłów). Vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), modified SAVI (mSAVI), modified SAVI 2 (mSAVI2), Infrared Percentage Vegetation Index (IPVI), Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI), and Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI)) calculated for sampling points from mid-March until mid-July, covering within-field soil and topographical variability, were included in the analysis.

In order to strengthen the economy and also to meet the food demand for the exponentially growing population, optimizing the agricultural practices has become necessity. In India, weather and geographical conditions are highly variable and were thought to be the major bottleneck of agricultural practices to achieve improved crop yield. Agricultural practices in India are facing many challenges such as change in climatic conditions, different geographical environment, conventional agricultural practices; economic and political scenario. Economic loss due to the lack of information on crop yield productivity is another major concern in the country. These hurdles can be overcome by the implementation of advanced technology in agriculture. Some of the trends observed are smart farming, digital agriculture and Big Data Analytics which provide useful information regarding various crop yields influencing factors and predicting the accurate amounts of crop yield. The exact prediction of crop yield helps formers to develop a suitable cultivation plan, crop health monitoring system, management of crop yield efficiently and also to establish the business strategy in order to decrease economic losses. This also makes the agricultural practices as one of the highly profitable ventures.

An overestimation may thus incur further costs, whereas an underestimation entails potential crop waste. More interestingly, an accurate yield estimation enables stakeholders to better place themselves in the market. Yet, computer-aided precision farming is set to play a pivotal role in this respect. Kiwifruit represents a major produce in several countries (e.g., Italy, China, New and Zealand). However, up to date, the relevant literature remains short of a complete as well as automatic system for kiwifruit yield estimation. In this paper, we present a fully automatic and noninvasive computer vision system for kiwifruit yield estimation across a given orchard. It consists mainly of an optical sensor mounted on a minitractor that surveys the orchard of interest at a low pace. Afterwards, the acquired images are fed to a pipeline that incorporates image preprocessing, stitching, and fruit counting stages and outputs an estimated fruit count and yield estimation. Experimental results conducted on two large kiwifruit orchards confirm a high plausibility (i.e., errors of 6% and 15%) of the proposed system. The proposed yield estimation solution has been in commercial use for about 2 years. With respect to the traditional manual yield estimation carried out by kiwifruit companies, it was demonstrated to save a significant amount of time and cut down on estimation errors, especially when speaking of large-scale farming. © 2020 by the authors.

Mature tomato detection has been wildly studied, while immature tomato detection, especially when occluded with leaves, is difficult to perform using traditional image analysis, which is more important for long-term yield prediction. Therefore, tomato detection that can generalize well in real tomato cultivation scenes and is robust to issues such as fruit occlusion and variable lighting conditions is highly desired. In this study, we build a tomato detection model to automatically detect intact green tomatoes regardless of occlusions or fruit growth stage using deep learning approaches. The tomato detection model used faster region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) with Resnet-101 and transfer learned from the Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset. The detection on test dataset achieved high average precision of 87.83% (intersection over union ≥ 0.5) and showed a high accuracy of tomato counting (R2 = 0.87). In addition, all the detected boxes were merged into one image to compile the tomato location map and estimate their size along one row in the greenhouse. By tomato detection, counting, location and size estimation, this method shows great potential for ripeness and yield prediction. © 2020 by the authors.

Forecasting yields of bioenergy crops at fine spatial resolutions can help to evaluate near-term and long-term pathways for scaling up bio-based fuel and chemical production, and for understanding the impacts of abiotic stressors such as severe droughts and temperature extremes on potential biomass supply. We used a large dataset of 28,364 Sorghum bicolor yield samples (uniquely identified by county and year of observation), environmental variables, and multiple approaches to analyze historical trends in sorghum productivity across the USA. We selected the most accurate machine learning approach (a variation of the random forest approach) to predict future trends in sorghum yields under four greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios and two irrigation regimes. We identified irrigation practices, vapor pressure deficit, and time (a proxy for technological improvement) as the most important predictors of sorghum productivity. Our results showed a decreasing trend of sorghum yields over future years (on average 2.7% from 2018 to 2099), with greater decline under a high GHG emissions scenario (3.8%) and in the absence of irrigation (4.6%). Geographically, we observed the steepest predicted declines in the Great Lakes (8.2%), Upper Midwest (7.5%), and Heartland (6.7%) regions. Our study demonstrates the use of machine learning to identify environmental controllers of sorghum biomass yield and predict yields with reasonable accuracy. These results can inform the development of more realistic biomass supply projections for bioenergy if sorghum production is scaled up. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","bioenergy; biofuels; climate change; machine learning; sorghum; yield modeling","Biofuels; Chemical industry; Climate change; Crops; Decision trees; Forecasting; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Large dataset; Learning systems; Machine learning; Productivity; Agricultural productions; Bio-energy; Environmental variables; Future climate scenarios; Machine learning approaches; sorghum; Technological improvements; Yield modeling; Biomass",Article,Scopus

The widely used European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA5 reanalysis products provide long-term spatial estimates of the total and direct solar radiation on an hourly scale; however, its accuracy has not been systematically evaluated for China. In this letter, in situ measurements from 98 sites are used to analyze the deviations in the hourly radiation from ERA5 and to compare the daily variations. The results reveal that estimates from the reanalysis correlate well with ground observations and completely reflect the regional characteristics and daily variations at individual sites. Overall, ERA5 overestimates the hourly total solar radiation and direct radiation by approximately 30.87 and 73.95 W/m2, respectively, whereas it underestimates the diffuse radiation by approximately 43.08 W/m2. Spatiotemporal differences are found by comparing the errors and time series of different sites. The fact that the accuracy in areas with rainy and cloudy weather is obviously lower indicates that the ERA5 analysis poorly performs when retrieving cloud properties. These conclusions can contribute to guiding the rational use of ERA5 radiation products. © 2019 IEEE.","Accuracy evaluation; ERA5; reanalysis product; solar radiation; surface measurements","Solar radiation; Surface measurement; Accuracy evaluation; Diffuse solar radiations; Environmental researches; ERA5; European centre for medium-range weather forecasts; Reanalysis; Regional characteristics; Surface solar radiation; Weather forecasting; accuracy assessment; environmental research; estimation method; forecasting method; measurement method; regional climate; solar radiation; spatial analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; China",Article,Scopus

In this paper, a new approach to predict NDVI based on precipitation in the grass-growing season for the arid and semi-arid grassland is proposed using time-delay neural network (TDNN). To intuitively know the ability of TDNN to learn the relationship between NDVI and precipitation and to predict NDVI, the performance of the TDNN model is compared with back propagation neural network (BPNN) trained with the same data. The results indicate that TDNN works well to predict precipitation. Moreover, the relationship between precipitation and NDVI can be predicted accurately by the proposed TDNN model. The results show the goodness-of-fit between the observed NDVI and predicted NDVI measured by the determination coefficient of R2 being 0.999 from the TDNN model, with the mean absolute percentage error, mean absolute error, and root-mean-square error to be 0.23%, 0.20, and 0.19, respectively. The analysis shows that the proposed method can result in an accurate NDVI prediction. Thus, the algorithm is applied to predict the NDVI during the grass-growing season for the validation of the approach.

In today's world condition, the existence of humans is not possible without the essential proliferation of plants. In the photosynthesis procedure, plants use solar energy to convert into chemical energy. This process is responsible for all life on earth, and the main controlling factor for proper plant growth is soil since it holds water, air, and all essential nutrients of plant nourishment. Though, due to overexposure, soil gets despoiled, so fertilizer is an essential component to hold the soil quality. In that regard, soil analysis is a suitable method to determine soil quality. Soil analysis examines the soil in laboratories and generates reports of unorganized and insignificant data. In this study, different big data analysis machine learning methods are used to extracting knowledge from data to find out fertilizer recommendation classes on behalf of present soil nutrition composition. For this experiment, soil analysis reports are collected from the Tata soil and water testing center. In this paper, Mahoot library is used for analysis of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), artificial neural network (ANN) performance on Hadoop environment. For better performance evaluation, we also used single machine experiments for random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbors K-NN, regression tree (RT), support vector machine (SVM) using polynomial function, SVM using radial basis function (RBF) methods. Detailed experimental analysis was carried out using overall accuracy, AUC-ROC (receiver operating characteristics (ROC), and area under the ROC curve (AUC)) curve, mean absolute prediction error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) validation measurements on soil reports dataset. The results provide a comparison of solution classes and conclude that the SGD outperforms other approaches. Finally, the proposed results support to select the solution or recommend a class which suggests suitable fertilizer to crops for maximum production. © 2019 by the authors.","Agriculture industry; Artificial neural network (ANN); Big data analytics; Fertilizer recommendations; Hadoop framework; K-NN; Random forest (RF); Regression tree (RT); Stochastic gradient descent (SGD); Sustainability-oriented performance; SVM","agricultural technology; agroindustry; algorithm; alternative agriculture; artificial neural network; comparative study; conceptual framework; data management; fertilizer application",Article,Scopus

Firstly, the capability of the SVM to predict annual electricity consumption was investigated at both a farm and catchment-level (combined consumption). Electricity consumption data were attained from 16 pasture-based, Irish dairy farms between June 2016 and May 2017 in conjunction with farm data related to herd size, milk production, infrastructural equipment and managerial tendencies, required to generate predictions using the SVM. The SVM predicted annual electricity consumption of dairy farms to within 10.4% (relative prediction error). Concurrently, catchment-level electricity consumption was predicted with an error value less than 5.0%. Secondly, an investigation was carried out to assess the impact of increasing herd size and milk production on dairy farm related electricity consumption at a catchment-level across ten hypothetical infrastructural scenarios. The dairy expansion analysis showed electricity economies of scale across all ten infrastructural scenarios. The greatest reduction in electricity consumption per litre was observed when all farms employed ground water for pre-cooling milk with two additional parlour units, reducing by 4% in 2018, relative to a base scenario (no change to infrastructural equipment). The results presented in this article demonstrate the potential effectiveness of the SVM as a macro-level simulation forecast tool for dairy farm electricity consumption that may be used to quantify the impact of milk production on electricity resources, or to offer decision support to dairy farmers. © 2019","Dairy expansion; Energy; Machine-learning; Milk production; Sustainability; SVM","Catchments; Dairies; Decision support systems; Economics; Electric power utilization; Expansion; Forecasting; Groundwater; Learning systems; Runoff; Support vector machines; Sustainable development; Annual electricity consumption; Decision supports; Economies of scale; Electricity resources; Electricity-consumption; Energy; Milk production; Prediction errors; Farms; dairy farming; electricity; energy use; future prospect; milk production; scenario analysis; support vector machine; sustainability; Ireland",Article,Scopus

Nutrient deficiency is the cause of serious diseases in plant growth, affecting crop yield. In this article, we employed artificial neural network models to recognize, classify, and predict the nutritional deficiencies occurring in tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.). To classify and predict the different macronutrient deficiencies in the cropping process, this paper handles the captured images of the macronutrient deficiency. This deficiency during the fruiting and leafing phases of tomato plant are based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). A total of 571 images were captured with tomato leaves and fruits containing the crop species at the growth stage. Among all images, 80% (461 captured images) were used for the training dataset and 20% (110 captured images) were applied for the validation dataset. In this study, we provide an analysis of two different model architectures based on convolutional neural network for classifying and predicting the nutrient deficiency symptoms. For instance, Inception-ResNet v2 and Autoencoder with the captured images of tomato plant growth under the greenhouse conditions. Moreover, a major type of statistical structure, namely Ensemble Averaging, was applied with two aforementioned predictive models to increase the accuracy of predictive validation. Three mineral nutrients, i.e., Calcium/Ca2+, Potassium/K+, and Nitrogen/N, are considered for use in evaluating the nutrient status in the development of tomato plant with these models. The aim of this study is to predict the nutrient deficiency accurately in order to increase crop production and prevent the emergence of tomato pathology caused by lack of nutrients. The predictive performance of the three models in this paper are validated, with the accuracy rates of 87.273% and 79.091% for Inception-ResNet v2 and Autoencoder, respectively, and with 91% validity using Ensemble Averaging. © 2019 by the authors.","Autoencoder; Classification; Deep learning; Ensemble averaging; Inception-ResNet v2; Nutrient deficiency; Prediction; Tomato plant",,Article,Scopus

However, the productivity of many agroforestry systems has been lower than expected in recent years, highlighting the need for an actionably deep mechanistic understanding of the competition between crops and trees. Here, three different fruit tree/ wheat (jujube/wheat, apricot /wheat, and walnut /wheat) intercropping agroforestry systems were chosen to investigate influence of different fruit tree shade intensity on the growth, yield and quality of intercropping wheat. Compared to the monoculture wheat system, the mean daily shade intensity of the jujube-, apricot-, and walnut-based intercropping systems were, respectively, 23.2%, 57.5%, and 80.7% shade. The photosynthetic rate of wheat in the jujube-, apricot-, and walnut-based intercropping systems decreased by, respectively, 11.3%, 31.9%, and 36.2% compared to monoculture wheat, and the mean number of fertile florets per spike decreased by 26.4%, 37.4%, and 49.5%. Moreover, the apricot- and walnut-based intercropping systems deleteriously affected grain yield (constituent components spike number, grains per spike, and thousand grain weight) and decreased the total N, P, and K content of intercropping wheat. Tree shading intensity strongly enhanced the grain protein content, wet gluten content, dough development time, and dough stability time of wheat, but significantly decreased the softening degree. Strong negative linear correlations were observed between tree shade intensity and the number of fertile florets, grain yield related traits (including spike number, grains per spike, and thousand grain weight), nutrient content (N, P and K), and softening degree of wheat. In contrast, Daily shade intensity was positively linearly correlated with grain protein content, wet gluten content, dough development time, and dough stability time. We conclude that jujube-based intercropping systems can be practical in the region, as they do not decrease the yield and quality of intercropping wheat. © 2019 Qiao et al.

The SWAP model in conjunction with a genetic algorithm and PEST optimization tool was used to find optimum parameters by minimizing the differences between observed and simulated values of drainage discharge, watertable depth, and drainage salinity. Results revealed that the best simulation of drainage outputs was obtained by parameters which were estimated minimizing an objective function that included all three datasets via a genetic algorithm. Although assuming the soil as a homogeneous and heterogeneous medium had quite similar results from objective functions with one or two datasets, homogeneous assumption worked better in the objective function with three datasets.

However, there is a lack of research about the price at which mines sell copper concentrate to smelters. The market reality is more complex since smelters obtain the copper that they sell from the concentrate that mines produce by processing the ore which they have extracted. It therefore becomes necessary to thoroughly analyse the price at which smelters buy the concentrates from the mines, besides the price at which they sell the copper. In practice, this cost is set by applying discounts to the price of cathodic copper, the most relevant being those corresponding to the smelters' benefit margin (Treatment Charges-TC and Refining Charges-RC). These discounts are agreed upon annually in the markets and their correct forecasting will enable making more adequate models to estimate the price of copper concentrates, which would help smelters to duly forecast their benefit margin. Hence, the aim of this paper is to provide an effective tool to forecast copper TC/RC annual benchmark levels. With the annual benchmark data from 2004 to 2017 agreed upon during the LME Copper Week, a three-model comparison is made by contrasting different measures of error. The results obtained indicate that the LES (Linear Exponential Smoothing) model is the one that has the best predictive capacity to explain the evolution of TC/RC in both the long and the short term. This suggests a certain dependency on the previous levels of TC/RC, as well as the potential existence of cyclical patterns in them. This model thus allows us to make a more precise estimation of copper TC/RC levels, which makes it useful for smelters and mining companies. © 2019 Francisco J.

Agricultural best management practices (BMPs) are implemented to mitigate the adverse impacts of intensive agricultural production on flow and water quality, thus can potentially protect and improve FWP services. Many studies have assessed BMP effectiveness for improving hydrology/water quality, however the impact of climate changes on BMP effectiveness for protecting FWP is poorly understood. In this study, changes in FWP under 5 BMPs and 6 projected climate change/variability scenarios, were quantified. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool was used to quantify FWP services for baseline (1975–2004) and future climates (2021–2050). We then assessed the climate change impacts on BMP effectiveness for 13 watersheds in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. The results indicated that all 5 BMP scenarios behaved similarly under the historical and future climates, generally resulting in improved FWP services compared to the baseline agricultural management. The combined BMPs was the most effective way to enhance FWP. No-tillage and cover crops performed well in improving FWP in agriculturally-dominated watersheds, while filter strips and grassed waterways had high effectiveness in non-agriculturally dominated watersheds. Results for the climate scenarios indicate that 5 BMPs under future climate were still effective compared to baseline. The increased precipitation and rising temperatures generally improved BMP effectiveness in maintaining and improving FWP services, due to increased freshwater availability under the projected future climate. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Ecosystem service; Streamflow; SWAT; Water quality","Agriculture; Ecosystems; Land use; Stream flow; Water quality; Watersheds; Agricultural best management practices; Agricultural management; Agricultural productions; Climate change impact; Ecosystem services; Rising temperatures; Soil and Water assessment tools; SWAT; Climate change; agricultural management; best management practice; climate change; ecosystem service; freshwater; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; water quality; Mississippi Basin; United States",Article,Scopus

For an immediate response to drastically changing crop yields and resulting harvest failures and to enhance the country’s food security in general, extensive area crop growth monitoring and early prediction of production are needed. In this study, we developed an early maize (Zea mays) yield forecasting model using Sentinel-2 MSI (Multispectral Instrument); the study was carried out in the Abaya district of the Oromia Regional State in Ethiopia. The model consists of the following components: (1) Sentinel-2 image-based cropland identification for different crop development stages, (2) extraction of time series Sentinel-2 vegetation indices for crop growth monitoring, and (3) a simple linear stepwise forward regression approach for yield prediction. We tested different spectral indices regarding their performance in describing the crop development and eventually predicting the expected yield. The result showed that (1) the linear Red-Edge Enhanced Vegetation Index (Red-Edge EVI), (2) the combination of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Green Vegetation Index (GVI), (3) the combination of the Red-Edge EVI and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and (4) the combination of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Red-Edge EVI and SAVI offer the best predictive model about 2 months before harvesting with the highest coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.73, 0.80, 0.84, and 0.88, respectively. The correlation for the GVI was generally lowest compared to established models, and no evidence of a peak correlation for NDVI was observed. Our approach showed a high accuracy of detecting maize fields, detecting crop phenology, and early predicting of grain yield for the study year 2018. Our simple model may generate early warning information, which may support in-time decision-making regarding food supply when critical yield fluctuations are to be expected. © 2021, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Photogrammetrie, Fernerkundung und Geoinformation (DGPF) e.V.","Crop phenology; GVI; Red-Edge EVI; SAVI; Spectral indices; Zea mays","agricultural modeling; crop yield; early warning system; food security; maize; phenology; prediction; Sentinel; vegetation index; Ethiopia; Oromia",Article,Scopus

Spatially explicit information on crop yields is essential for farmers and agricultural agencies to make well-informed decisions. One approach to estimate crop yield with remote sensing is data assimilation, which integrates sequential observations of canopy development from remote sensing into model simulations of crop growth processes. We found that leaf area index (LAI) inversion based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) vegetation index has a high accuracy, with R2 and root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.877 and 0.609, respectively. Maize yield estimation based on UAV remote sensing data and simple algorithm for yield (SAFY) crop model data assimilation has different yield estimation accuracy under different water treatments. This method can be used to estimate corn yield, where R2 is 0.855 and RMSE is 692.8kg/ha. Generally, the higher the water stress, the lower the estimation accuracy. Furthermore, we perform the yield estimate mapping at 2 m spatial resolution, which has a higher spatial resolution and accuracy than satellite remote sensing. The great potential of incorporating UAV observations with crop data to monitor crop yield, and improve agricultural management is therefore indicated. © 2021 by the authors.

For satellite data, we compared the contiguous solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), a newly emerging satellite retrieval, with a traditional vegetation index (enhanced vegetation index, EVI). The results showed that LSTM (with R2 ranging from 0.77 to 0.87, RMSE from 298.11 to 724kg/ha) and RF (with R2 ranging from 0.76 to 0.82, RMSE from 366 to 723.3 kg/ha) models outperformed LASSO (with R2 ranging from 0.33 to 0.42, RMSE from 633.46 kg/ha to 1231.39 kg/ha) in yield prediction; and LSTM was better than RF. Besides, ESI (combining EVI and SIF together) could slightly improve the model performance compared with only using EVI or SIF as the single input, primarily due to the ability of satellite-based SIF in capturing extra information on drought and heat stress. Furthermore, we also explored the potential for timely rice yield prediction, and concluded that the optimal prediction could be achieved with approximately two/one-month leading-time before single/double rice maturity.

Previous approaches to crop phenology detection have relied on time-series (multi-temporal) vegetation index (VI) data, and have included threshold-based, phenometrics-based and shape-model-fitting-based (SMF) methods. However, the performance of these methods depends on the duration and temporal resolution of the time-series data. In this study, we propose a new approach which identifies the principal growth stages of rice (Oryza sativa L.) directly from RGB images. Only a mono-temporal unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery was required for a large-area phenology detection via the well-trained network. An efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was designed to estimate rice phenology. The CNN incorporated spatial pyramid pooling (SPP), transfer learning and an auxiliary branch with external data. A total of 82 plots across a 160-hectare rice cultivation area of Southern China were selected to evaluate the proposed network. CNN predictions were ground truthed using rice phenology measurements taken from each plot throughout the growing season. Aerial data were collected using a fixed-wing UAV equipped with multispectral and RGB cameras. The performance of traditional SMF methods deteriorated when time-series VI data were of short duration. In contrast, the phenological stage estimated by the proposed network showed good agreement with ground observations, with a top-1 accuracy rate of 83.9% and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.18. The spatial distribution of harvest dates for 627 plots in the study area were computed from the phenological stage estimates. The estimates matched well with the observed harvest dates. The results demonstrated the excellent performance of the proposed deep learning approach in near real-time phenology detection and harvest time estimation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Rice phenology detection; Shape model fitting; UAV","artificial neural network; computer; data management; image analysis; phenology; real time; remote sensing; remotely operated vehicle; rice; China; Oryza sativa",Article,Scopus

This study was conducted in a 11.07 ha area under Mediterranean climate in Northern Italy to evaluate the spatial variability and the relationships between six remotely sensed vegetation indices (VIs) and grain yield (GY) in five consecutive years. A total of 25 satellite (Landsat 5, 7, and 8) images were downloaded during crop growth to obtain the following VIs: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), EnhancedVegetation Index (EVI), Soil AdjustedVegetation Index (SAVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Green Chlorophyll Index (GCI), and Simple Ratio (SR). The surveyed crops were durum wheat in 2010, sunflower in 2011, bread wheat in 2012 and 2014, and coriander in 2013. Geo-referenced GY and VI data were used to generate spatial trend maps across the experimental field through geostatistical analysis. Crop stages featuring the best correlations between VIs and GY at the same spatial resolution (30 m) were acknowledged as the best periods for GY prediction. Based on this, 2-4 VIs were selected each year, totalling 15 VIs in the five years with r values with GY between 0.729** and 0.935**. SR and NDVI were most frequently chosen (six and four times, respectively) across stages from mid vegetative to mid reproductive growth. Conversely, SAVI never had correlations high enough to be selected. Correspondence analysis between remote VIs and GY based on quantile ranking in the 126 (30 m size) pixels exhibited a final agreement between 64% and 86%. Therefore, Landsat imagery with its spatial and temporal resolution proved a good potential for estimating final GY over different crops in a rotation, at a relatively small field scale. © 2019 by the authors.","Crop rotation; Field spatial variability; Geostatistics; Grain yield prediction; Landsat imagery; Spectral vegetation indices","Grain (agricultural product); Image enhancement; Vegetation; Crop rotation; Geo-statistics; Grain yield; Landsat imagery; Spatial variability; Spectral vegetation indices; Crops",Article,Scopus

However, due to irregular climatic events, ASA regions are affected commonly by frequent droughts that can impact food production. In addition, ASA regions in the Middle East and Africa are often characterised by political instability, which can increase population vulnerability to hunger and ill health. Remote sensing (RS) provides a platform to improve the spatial prediction of crop production and food availability, with the potential to positively impact populations. This paper, firstly, describes some of the important characteristics of agriculture in ASA regions that require monitoring to improve their management. Secondly, it demonstrates how freely available RS data can support decision-making through a cost-effective monitoring system that complements traditional approaches for collecting agricultural data. Thirdly, it illustrates the challenges of employing freely available RS data for mapping and monitoring crop area, crop status and forecasting crop yield in these regions. Finally, existing approaches used in these applications are evaluated, and the challenges associated with their use and possible future improvements are discussed. We demonstrate that agricultural activities can be monitored effectively and both crop area and crop yield can be predicted in advance using RS data.

The previous estimation models of winter wheat yield often perform a low accuracy and less generalization, due to the overfitting during machine learning. Meanwhile, the specific feature variables can be expected to reduce the high collinearity between spectral bands of surface reflectance. It is also proper to set the spectral index for the less influence of independent wavelengths on iterative calculation. In this study, an improved estimation model of winter wheat yield was established using Random Forest (RF) in Henan Province of China, using the surface reflectance data and spectral index during the growth period. The specific procedure was listed. 1) The comparisons were conducted for the regional mean values and regional frequency histogram on the spectral bands of surface reflectance. 2) The different spectral bands of surface reflectance were then compared. 3) The generated sample data on the specific feature variable was used to train a yield estimation model. 4) The yield estimation model was applied to evaluate the winter wheat yields during 2013-2015, using the surface reflectance data and spectral index. The estimated yields of winter wheat were also verified by the survey statistics. The results showed that the frequency histogram presented a better performance than the regional mean values, where the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was 660 kg/hm2, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was 860 kg/hm2, and the coefficient of determination was 0.83. The dimension of input feature variables and computational complexity were greatly reduced to improve the estimation ability of the model. The frequency histogram was suitable for the extraction of feature variables, further to optimize the sample structure. Among the surface reflectance bands, the near-infrared band 1 behaved the best performance, where the MAE was 636 kg/hm2, RMSE was 784 kg/hm2, and the coefficient of determination was 0.76. The near-infrared band 2 was the second most. The estimation accuracy of the blue band was the lowest, where the coefficient of determination was only 0.58, while the MAE and RMSE were 885 and 1040 kg/hm2, respectively. The coefficient of determination of Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was 0.82, whereas, the coefficient of determination of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was 0.73. Moreover, there was a higher coefficient of determination in the combination of NDVI and NDWI, where the coefficient of determination was 0.89, and the MAE and RMSE were 444 and 527 kg/hm2, respectively. There was the crucial influence of the heading stages of NDVI and NDWI on the winter wheat yield. Specifically, the accuracy of the combined NDVI and NDWI reached the highest on April 15th, indicating that the period from April 15th to 22nd presented the greatest impacts. In addition, the inter-year variation patterns from 2013 to 2015 showed well consistent trends between the estimated and observed yields in the spatial distribution, where the relative errors were within ±20%, and gradually decreased from the northwest to the southeast. A comprehensive effect of topography, temperature, and precipitation can be attributed to the surface microclimate and material redistribution. Consequently, the better yield estimation of winter wheat over the large areas can be achieved in the main winter wheat planting regions of Henan Province, using the random forest model combined with the regional frequency histogram samples. The next step can be recommended to maximize the number of samples and introduce the high-resolution satellite images for higher accuracy of the winter wheat yield estimation model. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The quality of spatial information and the fidelity of spectral information are normally contradictory. However, these two properties are non-negligible indicators for multi-source remote-sensing images fusion. The smoothing filter-based intensity modulation (SFIM) method is a simple yet effective model for image fusion, which can improve the spatial texture details of the image well, and maintain the spectral characteristics of the image significantly. However, traditional SFIM has a poor effect for edge information sharpening, leading to a bad overall fusion result. In order to obtain better spatial infor-mation, a spatial filter-based improved LSE-SFIM algorithm is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the least square estimation (LSE) algorithm is combined with SFIM, which can effectively improve the spatial information quality of the fused image. At the same time, in order to better maintain the spatial information, four spatial filters (mean, median, nearest and bilinear) are used for the simu-lated MSI image to extract fine spatial information. Six quality indexes are used to compare the performance of different algorithms, and the experimental results demonstrate that the LSE-SFIM based on bilinear (LES-SFIM-B) performs significantly better than the traditional SFIM algorithm and other spatially enhanced LSE-SFIM algorithms proposed in this paper. Furthermore, LSE-SFIM-B could also obtain similar performance compared with three state-of-the-art HSI-MSI fusion algorithms (CNMF, HySure, and FUSE), while the computing time is much shorter. © 2021 by the authors.

An accurate estimation of regional crop yield can greatly contribute to agricultural production management and national food policy. However, only a few studies have been focused on the combined effects of different exponential screening and statistical regression at present, even though there are various models of crop yield estimation. In this study, a comparative investigation was performed on the three types of index screening and three regression models, in order to explore the coordinated effect of the estimation model for the rice yield. The influence mechanism was also proposed to achieve an optimal yield estimation model suitable for the local production conditions. An important rice-producing area, the Sanjiang Plain in the Heilongjiang Province of China was taken as the study area. The rice unit yield and MOD09A1 remote sensing data were collected in the Bielahong River basin of the study area in 2019. After preprocessing, a total of 36 remote sensing variables were obtained, where four original bands and five vegetation indices of rice at the four growth stages, including the tillering, booting, heading, and milk ripening stage. Subsequently, the remote sensing variables were screened for the high sensitivity to the rice yield using the correlation coefficient (r), Variable Importance in Projection (VPI), and Out-Of-Bag (OOB) data importance analysis. After that, nine estimation models of rice yield were constructed to combine with the Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression, such as the r-RF, r-SVM, r-PLS, VIP-RF, VIP-SVM, VIP-PLS, OOB-RF, OOB-SVM, and OOB-PLS. Several experiments were carried out for each model. Thus, the best input data was achieved for the optimal model. The determination coefficient, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and normalized Root Mean Square Error (nRMSE) were also used to evaluate the model. The results showed that the same index screening was fitted the different models with different degrees, where the OOB was more suitable for RF, the VIP was more suitable for r and PLS, and the r was more suitable for SVM. Specifically, the PLS and SVM model performed better in the three modelings, whereas, the RF model performed the best, among which the combined OOB-RF model was the best, with the model determination coefficient of 0.742, RMSE of 206 kg/hm2, and nRMSE of 3.10%. Therefore, the index screenings varied greatly with the regression, where the OOB-RF model presented the best yield estimation in the study area. This finding can provide a strong theoretical reference to integrate the exponential screening and regression for the rice yield estimation model. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Robots have historically been used for carrying out routine tasks that require physical strength, accuracy, and repeatability, whereas humans are used to engage with more value‐added tasks that need reasoning and decision‐making skills. On the other hand, robots are also increasingly exploited in several non‐routine tasks that require cognitive skills. This technological evolution will create a fundamental and an unavoidable transformation of the agricultural occupations landscape with a high social and economic impact in terms of jobs creation and jobs destruction. To that effect, the aim of the present work is two‐fold: (a) to map agricultural occupations in terms of their cognitive/manual and routine/non‐routine characteristics and (b) to assess the susceptibility of each agricultural occupation to robotization. Seventeen (17) agricultural occupations were reviewed in relation to the characteristics of each individual task they entail and mapped onto a two‐dimensional space representing the manual versus cognitive nature and the routine versus non‐routine nature of an occupation. Subsequently, the potential for ro-botization was investigated, again concerning each task individually, and resulted in a weighted average potential adoption rate for each one of the agricultural occupations. It can be concluded that most of the occupations entail manual tasks that need to be performed in a standardised man-ner. Considering also that almost 81% of the agricultural work force is involved with these activities, it turns out that there is strong evidence for possible robotization of 70% of the agricultural domain, which, in turn, could affect 56% of the total annual budget dedicated to agricultural occupations. The presented work silhouettes the expected transformation of occupational landscape in agricultural production as an effort for a subsequent identification of social threats in terms of unemploy-ment and job and wages polarization, among others, but also of opportunities in terms of emerged skills and training requirements for a social sustainable development of agricultural domain. © 2021 by the authors.

With the heightened concern of its water-quality implications, we need a method to design drainage systems for both crop production and environmental protection. The objective of this research was to develop an empirical equation that estimates the design drainage rate (DDR) for local soil and weather conditions. This DDR can then be used in the Hooghoudt equation to estimate the optimum drain spacing that maximizes profit. We conducted DRAINMOD simulations for each combination of four factors: three drain depths, three effective radii, seven locations, and five soils. For each combination of factors, simulations were repeated for a range of drain spacing from 5 to 100 m using 30 years (1990–2019) of weather data planted with continuous corn (Zea mays L.). Simulations provided a 30-year average relative corn yield and drainage discharge for each combination of factors. The drain spacings that maximized annual economic return on investment were identified as optimum spacings and used to calculate the DDR for each combination of factors. Results were then used in a multiple linear regression to develop two empirical equations for northeast and southeast USA with DDR as the dependent variable. The independent variables were the long-term average growing-season precipitation, drain depth, equivalent saturated hydraulic conductivity, and depth to restrictive layer.

Some target fruits are homochromatic with background, and the limited number of samples have brought great challenges to accurately detect the target, due mainly to the difficulty of collecting some environmental data. Therefore, the detection needs to meet the high requirements of intelligent yield measurement and automatic harvesting, in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. In this study, an efficient detection model was proposed for the green target fruits suitable for small samples under different light conditions and fruit postures. The optimized transformer network was also employed in this model. Firstly, the convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to extract image features. The transformer encoder was input after feature dimension reduction and positional encoding. Multi-head attention and feed-forward network (FFN) were then selected to obtain the encoder output. Secondly, the transformer decoder processed the input using multi-head attention and feed-forward network. The positional encoding was then added to each link. After that, the outputs were generated with different data sizes. The bounding boxes were much larger than the actual objects after prediction, indicating a low missing rate of green target fruit after decoder settlement. Finally, the feed-forward network (FFN) was utilized to predict the detection. The training of detection model was mostly used sufficient samples to avoid overfitting in the training process for higher generalization of the model. Bootstrapping was also introduced to repeatedly mapping the original data for several times. As such, the expanding dataset was utilized to meet the high requirement of larger samples for the higher accuracy of detection mode in the training process. Transfer learning was selected to significantly improve the training efficiency of the model, while, accelerate the convergence of the network. The apple and persimmon datasets were made separately for the model training. The experimental results show that the training efficiency of the model was greatly improved by more than 13% after migration learning. An excellent illustration of features transferability increased the speed and efficiency of detection, as the difference decreased between the pre-training and target task. Transfer learning was adopted to improve the efficiency of the model, where the model converged faster and was better suitable for the complex orchard environment. The new model can widely be expected to effectively realize the detection of green target fruit in the complex orchard environment with multiple postures, illumination, and scenes, indicating better generalization ability and robustness. The accuracies of detection were 93.27% and 91.35%, respectively, when testing green persimmons and green apples. Consequently, the new optimized model presented the best performance, compared with the conventional. The finding can also provide a sound theoretical reference for the target detection of green fruits and vegetables in the intelligent yield measurement and automated harvesting in orchards. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Due to the large number of historical and literary documents written in this language, an automated OCR system is highly demanded. However, previous approaches have been based on traditional machine learning algorithms that focus on hand-crafted feature extraction, and the performance of these methods is greatly affected by the presence of a large set of structurally similar characters. Therefore, according to various studies on Amharic character, this problem can be solved by examining robust feature extraction techniques. In this study, we proposed a hybrid method that uses deep learning models Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Convolutional Auto-Encoder (CAE) for feature extraction, Random Forest (RF) and Mutual Information (MI) feature selection methods for selecting top features and a traditional machine learning algorithm Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. First, the features extracted by the two deep models were combined to form hybrid features, and then top features were selected by applying feature selection. The common features selected by the two feature selection methods were later used for recognition by SVM. Experimental results using CNN extracted features achieved an accuracy of 96.03% while using CAE extracted features achieved an accuracy of 92.52%.

In this study, agronomic trait data of rice and climate data in eastern China were collected, and rice yields were predicted using a variety of algorithms, including the non-linear tool of feed-forward backpropagation neural networks (FFBN) and the linear model of partial least squares regression (PLSR). The results showed that both the agronomic traits and the climate data were significantly related with rice yield. The PLSR model showed that covariates occurred among the parameters, and modifications should be considered for climate data-based modelling. The FFBN model demonstrated better prediction performance than that of PLSR, in which the relation coefficient (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) were 0.611 vs. 0.374 and 0.578 vs. 0.865 ton/ha using climate data, respectively; and 0.742 vs. 0.689 and 0.556 vs. 0.608 using agronomic trait data, respectively.

One way of estimating a product is to use remote sensing data in conjunction with field data and meteorological data. One of the main issues surrounding this comprises the use of machine learning techniques to create a multi-resource data-based estimation model. Many studies have been conducted on barley yield prediction from planting to harvest. Still, the effect of different time intervals on yield prediction has not been investigated. Furthermore, the effect of different periods on yield prediction has not been investigated. RESULTS: In the present study, the whole growth period was divided into three parts. Using one of the major barley production areas in Iran, the performance of the proposed model was evaluated. In the first step, a model for integrating field data, remote sensing data and meteorological data was prepared. The results obtained show that, among the four machine learning methods implemented, the gaussian process regression algorithm performed best and estimated yield with r2 = 0.84, root mean square error = 737 kg ha−1 and mean absolute = 650 kg ha−1, 1 month before harvest. CONCLUSION: It was found that the estimation results change depending on different agricultural zones and temporal training settings.

In general, the interaction between humans and computers relies on the flexibility of the interactive visualization system. Electromyography (EMG) is a bioelectric signal used in HCI that can be captured noninvasively by placing electrodes on the human hand. Due to the impact of complex background, accurate recognition and analysis of human motion in real-time multitarget scenarios are considered challenging in HCI. Further, EMG signals of human hand motions are exceedingly nonlinear, and it is important to utilize a dynamic approach to address the noise problem in EMG signals. Hence, in this paper, the Optimized Noninvasive Human-Computer Interaction (ONIHCI) model has been proposed to predict human motion recognition. Average Intrinsic Mode Function (AIMF) has been used to reduce the noise factor in EMG signals. Furthermore, this paper introduces spatial thermographic imaging to overcome the conventional sensor problem, such as gesture recognition and human target identification in multitarget scenarios. The human motion behavior in spatial thermographic images is examined by target trajectory, and body movement kinematics is employed to classify human targets and objects.

This makes it easier to take proactive steps to reduce losses before they occur. The proposed model attempts to find an association between agrometeorological parameters and the occurrence of the four types of rice diseases. Rice is the staple food of people in Maharashtra. The four major diseases that occur on rice crops are focused on this paper (namely Rice Blast, False Smut, Bacterial Blight and Brown Spot) as these diseases spread rapidly and lead to economic loss. This research paper demonstrates the usage of artificial neural network (ANN) to detect, classify and predict the occurrence of rice diseases based on diverse agro-meteorological conditions. The results were carried out on two cases of dataset split that is 70-30% and 80-20%.

In this work, MAIA S2 spectral properties were compared with the correspondent Sentinel-2 ones, focusing on possible effects that differences could induce onto agriculture related deductions. The reference dataset was acquired by aerial survey and radiometric and geometric pre-processing achieved to generate the correspondent at-the-ground reflectance multispectral orthomosaic by ordinary workflow as suggested by sensor suppliers. A comparison was achieved at single band level to test spectral consistency of the two data. It showed a low correlation in the red-edge and infrared bands (r &lt; 0.5); oppositely, a higher correlation was found for the visible bands (r &gt; 0.8).

Enterprise-scale geographic information system (GIS) software and high-resolution aerial or satellite imagery are tools which are typically not available to or affordable for resource-limited communities. In this paper, we present a concept of aerial data collection, 3D cadastre modeling, and disaster risk assessment using low-cost drones and adapted open-source software. Computer vision/machine learning methods are used to create a classified 3D cadastre that contextualizes and quantifies potential natural disaster risk to existing or planned infrastructure. Building type and integrity are determined from aerial imagery. Potential flood damage risk to a building is evaluated as a function of three mechanisms: undermining (erosion) of the foundation, hydraulic pressure damage, and building collapse due to water load. Use of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) provides water runoff estimates that are improved using classified land features (urban ecology, erosion marks) to improve flow direction estimates. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to find these flood-induced erosion marks from high-resolution drone imagery. A flood damage potential metric scaled by property value estimates results in individual and community property risk assessments. © 2021 by the authors.

A number of requirements are imposed on farmers, including the maintenance of permanent grassland, fallow land or crop diversification. To meet these requirements, the European Union guarantees subsidies, but at the same time fields must be monitored focusing on crop identification. The limitation of field inspection and substituting it with crop recognition using satellite images could increase the effectiveness of this procedure. The application of satellite imagery in automatic detection and identification of dominant crops over a large area seems to be technically and economically sound. The paper discusses the concept and the results of automatic classification based on a Random Forests classifier performed on multitemporal images of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8. A test site was established in a complex agricultural structure with long and narrow parcels in the south-eastern part of Poland. Time-series images acquired during the growing season 2016 were used for multispectral classification in different configurations: for Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 separately and for both sensors integrated. Different Random Forests approaches and post-processing methods were examined based on independent data from farmers' declarations records, reaching the best accuracy of over 90% for crops like winter or spring cereals. Overall accuracy of the classification ranged from 72% to 91% depending on the classification variant.

Taking the conventional spring irrigation level (2 250 m3/hm2) of open ditch drainage as the control group(CK), four gradients of 100%, 90%, 80%, and 70% (W1, W2, W3, W4) of conventional spring irrigation water volume were set under the condition of subsurface drainage, total five treatments. Leaching effect of different spring irrigation volumes combined with subsurface drainage on moderately salinized soil was studied. Water and salt distribution, salt leaching effect, control effect on groundwater depth, oil sunflower yield and water use efficiency were analyzed. The results showed that because of the larger irrigation volume and less drainage, the soil moisture content in the root layer of CK treatment was higher, but there was no significant difference in W1 and W2 treatments. W1, W2 and W3 treatments all had better desalination effects after irrigation. The soil desalination rates in the root layer were increased by 18.47, 18.24, 7.75 percentage points compared with that of CK treatment (P&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference between W1 and W2 treatments, and both were significantly higher than that of W3 treatments (P&lt;0.05). Due to the smaller irrigation volume in W4 treatment, the soil desalination effect was significantly lower than that of other treatments (P&lt;0.05). While leaching salt, W1 and W2 treatments had better leaching effect on soil salt isolates. At the same time, with the increase of irrigation leaching water, the ionic composition of the soil was developed in a benign. W2 treatment had the best time for the groundwater depth to drop after spring irrigation. The groundwater depth was dropped to 0.8m at the end of May, which was the best time for oil sunflower planting. W2 can better maintain soil moisture without affecting normal crop cultivation. The yield of oil sunflower in W1 treatment was significantly higher than that in the other four treatments (P&lt;0.05), which was increased by 3.27%, 3.54%, 6.46%, and 17.98% compared with CK, W2, W3 and W4, respectively. The treatment with the highest soil water use efficiency was W2, which was not significantly different from W1, and significantly higher than CK, W3 and W4 (P&lt;0.05). In view of the above, from the perspective of increasing production alone, W1 treatment was significantly higher than the other four treatments (P&lt;0.05), which was an alternative mode. If it was limited by water resources, it can be used to reduce the amount of irrigation by 20% (W3 treatment), the desalination efficiency was slightly lower, totally 2.99 percentage points lower than that of open ditch drainage, and the improvement cycle can be increased to relieve soil salinization. From a multi-angle comprehensive analysis of soil salt control, water saving, stable production, and water use efficiency, a 10% reduction based on conventional irrigation and a combination of underground drainage technology (W2) was an appropriate choice. © 2020, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

Current practice is to estimate alkaloid concentration using destructive sampling and laboratory analysis. However, in order to estimate the value of the whole crop, a method that could predict alkaloid concentration in field conditions prior to harvesting is needed. In this study, an unmanned aerial system (UAS) with multispectral imaging was tested for estimation of alkaloid concentration of a poppy crop before harvest, which was sown for pharmaceutical purposes in Tasmania, Australia. This study presents the result of a random forest (RF) regression analysis to evaluate the contribution and predictive ability of spectral and structural variables derived from the images. It was found that UAS imagery with an RF model has the potential to estimate thebaine (paramorphine) concentration well before harvesting and without laboratory analysis. It was found that an RF model with the combination of MSAVI, mSR, OSAVI, NDVI and EVI spectral indices can provide optimal results to estimate thebaine with a relative error of 13.56% to 22.36% with training and validation datasets, respectively. The thebaine concentration predicted using the proposed RF model was strongly correlated to the laboratory-measured thebaine concentration, with an R2 value ranging from 0.63 to 0.82 for the training and validation datasets, respectively. These results indicate that poppy thebaine concentration can be estimated with reasonable accuracy 3 weeks prior to harvesting. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Alkaloids; Poppy; Random forest; Thebaine; UAS remote sensing","accuracy assessment; alkaloid; concentration (composition); data set; error analysis; model validation; NDVI; prediction; regression analysis; remote sensing; Australia; Tasmania; Papaver",Article,Scopus

Based on the wavelet transform, a combined prediction approach for crop water requirement is proposed. Firstly, the Mallat wavelet transform algorithm is used to decompose and reconstruct the crop water requirement series. The approximate and detail components of the original series can be obtained. The characteristics of approximate components and detail components are analyzed by Hurst index. Then, according to the different characteristics of the components, the particle swarm optimization algorithm optimized support vector machine is used to predict the approximate component, and the autoregressive moving average model is used to predict the detail components. Three-fold cross-validation is used to improve the generalization ability of the forecasting model. Finally, combined with the prediction value of each prediction model, the final prediction value of crop water requirement is obtained. The crop water requirement data from 1983 to 2018 in Liaoning Province of China are collected as the research object. The simulation results indicate that the proposed combined prediction approach has high prediction accuracy for crop water requirement. The comparison of performance indicators shows that the root mean square error of the proposed prediction approach reduced by 45.40% to 57.16%, mean absolute error reduced by 32.96% to 52.07%, mean absolute percentile error reduced by 33.02% to 52.37%, relative root mean square error reduced by 45.26% to 57.38%, square sum error reduced by 70.18% to 80.42%, and the Theil inequality coefficient reduced by 59.02% to 80.77%. R square increased by 16.46% to 54.77%, and the index of agreement increased by 3.82% to 23.37%. The results of Pearson's test and the DM test show that the association strength between the actual value and the prediction value of the crop water requirement is stronger. Moreover, the proposed prediction approach in this paper has higher reliability under the same confidence level. The effectiveness of the proposed prediction approach for crop water requirement is verified. The proposed prediction approach has great significance for the rational use of water resources, planning and management, promoting social and economic sustainable development. © IWA Publishing 2020.","autoregressive moving average; combined prediction; crop water requirement; particle swarm optimization; support vector machine; wavelet transform","Agricultural robots; Crops; Errors; Mean square error; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machines; Water resources; Wavelet transforms; Comparison of performance; Crop water requirements; Economic sustainable development; Generalization ability; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Root mean square errors; Three fold cross validation; Wavelet transform algorithms; Forecasting; ground water; surface water; algorithm; model validation; sustainable development; water management; water mass; water resource; water use; wavelet; wavelet analysis; Article; artificial neural network; back propagation neural network; convolutional neural network; crop; crop water consumption; cross validation; particle swarm optimization; radial basis function; simulation; support vector machine; time series analysis; water management; water supply; wavelet transform; China; Liaoning",Article,Scopus

The snowmelt period was extracted from statistical data, and the corresponding parameters in the source code of SWAT were optimized for the study area. After the calibration was completed, the modified simulation value was compared with the original code simulation value. The simulation accuracy of the daily runoff was improved, and we found that the greater the difference between the source code simulation value and the observed value was, the better the simulation accuracy. Therefore, modifying the source code in SWAT is an effective way to improve the accuracy of simulations of Alpine regions in Northern China.

It is even more important for IoT networks given the number of connected elements and the real-time nature of many connections. This work presents a novel deep learning architecture applicable to this supervised regression problem. It is based on an additive network model formed by ‘learning blocks’ that are stacked iteratively following, in part, the principles of gradient boosting models. The resulting architecture is trained end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent. This new architecture has connections with residual, stacked and boosted networks, being different from any of them. Like residual networks, it shows excellent convergence behavior during training and allows for deeper models. It has a regularization effect similar to stacked models and presents excellent prediction results as gradient boosting models do. The building elements of the architecture are neural network blocks or learning blocks, that can be constituted by a sequence of simple fully connected layers or by more elaborate dispositions of recurrent and convolutional layers. The resulting architecture is a generic additive network (gaNet) applicable to any supervised regression problem. To obtain experimental results on a hard prediction problem, the model is applied to the forecasting of network traffic using IoT traffic volume real data from a mobile operator.

The R– and Rc treatments had higher water use efficiency (WUE) than R+ in 2014-2015, and Rc was the highest in 2015-2016. The proportions of soil water to water consumption in R+ and Rc increased from 22.5% in 2014-2015 to 42.5% in 2015-2016 on average, and for R– was stable over 2-yr (average 44.5%). Soil water plays a critical role in winter wheat performance under changes in precipitation, which should guide winter wheat production and soil water management in the future. © 2019 The author(s).",,,Article,Scopus

Since predictive accuracy depends partly on which indicators are used to identify food insecure households, it is important to assess the performance of indicators that are relatively easy and inexpensive to collect yet can proxy for the “gold standard” food security indicator, calorie intake. We study the effectiveness of different variable combinations and methods in predicting calorie-based food security among poor households and communities in rural Bangladesh. We use basic household information as a benchmark set for predicting calorie-based food security. We then assess the gain in predictive power obtained by adding subjective food security indicators (e.g., self-reported days without sufficient food), the dietary diversity score (DDS), and the combination of both sets to our model of calorie-based food security. We apply machine learning as well as traditional econometric methods in estimation. We find that the overall predictive accuracy rises from 63% to 69% when we add the subjective and DDS sets to the benchmark set. Our study demonstrates that while alternative indicators and methods are not always accurate in predicting calorie intake, DDS related indicators do improve accuracy compared to a simple benchmark set. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Dietary diversity; Food security; Machine learning; Poverty; Program targeting","econometrics; food policy; food security; machine learning; poverty; rural area; Bangladesh",Article,Scopus

The adaptability of trees to drought is likely to be of increasing importance as climate changes occur around the world. Modelling stomatal regulation can help improve our understanding of how forests respond to their environment. Traditionally, empirical models have been used to model stomatal responses, however these models cannot always capture nonlinear responses and their parameters are often difficult to measure. In this study various machine learning (ML) models were able to capture stomatal responses of multiple tree species. We showed that ML can be a useful tool for predicting stomatal response based on climate variables and species traits. A random forest model performed the best with an R2 of 75 %, compared to the empirical Ball-Berry stomatal conductance model (BWB) (R2 = 41 %). In this study, the use of a combined dataset consisting out of data from multiple studies were successfully used, showcasing the use of data across studies. This also allowed for an ML model to be trained on 36 tree species from 5 forest biomes, from measurements taken across 6 continents, instead of being limited to one species, increasing the versatility of the model. The importance of species-specific stomatal responses was highlighted, with the drought strategies used by plants significantly influencing stomatal responses and predictions. ML models were able to capture these trends parsimoniously without prior knowledge of the underlying physiology of the tree species. The quality of combined datasets are however still not desirable, and long-term data collection using standardized measuring protocols are required to increase the strength of ML models. Data taken across different climatic regions and vegetation types can also help improve the adaptability of ML models. Regardless of limitations on data accessibility, ML shows promise in modelling plant responses to changes in climate. Focus on the use of ML together with traditional models can help give further insight into various ecological mechanisms. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate data; Machine learning; Stomatal conductance","climate change; drought; drought resistance; drought stress; environmental factor; forest management; machine learning; numerical model; physiological response; regional climate; stomatal conductance",Article,Scopus

Moreover, a convenient and real-time advance technology for nitrogen nutrition diagnosis of crops is a prerequisite for an efficient and reasonable nitrogen-fertilizer management system. With the development of research on plant phenotype and artificial intelligence technology in agriculture, deep learning has demonstrated a great potential in agriculture for recognizing nonde-structive nitrogen nutrition diagnosis in plants by automation and high throughput at a low cost. To build a nitrogen nutrient-diagnosis model, muskmelons were cultivated under different nitrogen levels in a greenhouse. The digital images of canopy leaves and the environmental factors (light and temperature) during the growth period of muskmelons were tracked and analyzed. The nitrogen concentrations of the plants were measured, we successfully constructed and trained machine-learning-and deep-learning models based on the traditional backpropagation neural network (BPNN), the emerging convolution neural network (CNN), the deep convolution neural network (DCNN) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) for the nitrogen nutrition diagnosis of muskmelon. The ad-justed determination coefficient (R2 ) and mean square error (MSE) between the predicted values and measured values of nitrogen concentration were adopted to evaluate the models’ accuracy. The values were R2 = 0.567 and MSE = 0.429 for BPNN model; R2 = 0.376 and MSE = 0.628 for CNN model; R2 = 0.686 and MSE = 0.355 for deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model; and R2 = 0.904 and MSE = 0.123 for the hybrid model DCNN–LSTM.

The food system, in turn, is a critical component in sustainable development, with direct linkages to the social, economic, and ecological systems. Weeds are one of the major factors responsible for the crop yield gap in the different regions of the world. In this work, a plant and weed identifier tool was conceptualized, developed, and trained based on artificial deep neural networks to be used for the purpose of weeding the inter‐row space in crop fields. A high‐level design of the weeding robot is conceptualized and proposed as a solution to the problem of weed infestation in farming systems. The implementation process includes data collection, data pre‐processing, training and optimizing a neural network model. A selective pre‐trained neural network model was considered for implementing the task of plant and weed identification. The faster R‐CNN (Region based Convolution Neural Network) method achieved an overall mean Average Precision (mAP) of around 31% while considering the learning rate hyperparameter of 0.0002. In the plant and weed prediction tests, prediction values in the range of 88–98% were observed in comparison to the ground truth. While as on a completely unknown dataset of plants and weeds, predictions were observed in the range of 67–95% for plants, and 84% to 99% in the case of weeds. In addition to that, a simple yet unique stem estimation technique for the identified weeds based on bounding box localization of the object inside the image frame is proposed. © 2021 by the authors.

However, extensive validation data at a matching resolution remain uncommon or infeasible due to data availability. This has limited the ability to evaluate different yield estimation models and improve understanding of key features useful for yield estimation in both data-rich and data-poor contexts. Here, we assess machine learning models’ capacity for soybean yield prediction using a unique ground-truth dataset of high-resolution (5 m) yield maps generated from combine harvester yield monitor data for over a million field-year observations across the Midwestern United States from 2008 to 2018. First, we compare random forest (RF) implementations, testing a range of feature engineering approaches using Sentinel-2 and Landsat spectral data for 20-and 30-m scale yield prediction. We find that Sentinel-2-based models can explain up to 45% of out-of-sample yield variability from 2017 to 2018 (r2 = 0.45), while Landsat models explain up to 43% across the longer 2008–2018 period. Using discrete Fourier transforms, or harmonic regressions, to capture soybean phenology improved the Landsat-based model considerably. Second, we compare RF models trained using this ground-truth data to models trained on available county-level statistics. We find that county-level models rely more heavily on just a few predictors, namely August weather covariates (vapor pressure deficit, rainfall, temperature) and July and August near-infrared observations. As a result, county-scale models perform relatively poorly on field-scale validation (r2 = 0.32), especially for high-yielding fields, but perform similarly to field-scale models when evaluated at the county scale (r2 = 0.82). Finally, we test whether our findings on variable importance can inform a simple, generalizable framework for regions or time periods beyond ground data availability. To do so, we test improvements to a Scalable Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM) approach that uses crop simulations to train statistical models for yield estimation. Based on findings from our RF models, we employ harmonic regressions to estimate peak vegetation index (VI) and a VI observation 30 days later, with August rainfall as the sole weather covariate in our new SCYM model. Modifications improved SCYM’s explained variance (r2 = 0.27 at the 30 m scale) and provide a new, parsimonious model. © 2020 by the authors.

The framework combines an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based surrogate model, an optimization algorithm (Genetic Algorithm), and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation to find the best lift-up design that maximizes either pedestrian wind comfort or thermal comfort or both. The optimization is done for two diametrically different climates: a hot climate with calm wind conditions (öhot-calm’), and a cold climate with windy conditions (öcold-windy’). By adjusting eight parameters, the proposed framework enlarges, by more than 46% and 37% for öhot-calm’ and öcold-windy’ climates respectively, the area near a lift-up building where there is pedestrian wind comfort, and by 18% and 10% respectively for the two climates, the area where there is thermal comfort.

Because the United States is a major producer and exporter of wheat to the world market, accurate and timely forecasting of wheat yield in the United States (U.S.) is fundamental to national crop management as well as global food security. Previous studies mainly have focused on developing empirical models using only satellite remote sensing images, while other yield determinants have not yet been adequately explored. In addition, these models are based on traditional statistical regression algorithms, while more advanced machine learning approaches have not been explored. This study used advanced machine learning algorithms to establish within-season yield prediction models for winter wheat using multi-source data to address these issues. Specifically, yield driving factors were extracted from four different data sources, including satellite images, climate data, soil maps, and historical yield records. Subsequently, two linear regression methods, including ordinary least square (OLS) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and four well-known machine learning methods, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and deep neural network (DNN), were applied and compared for estimating the county-level winter wheat yield in the Conterminous United States (CONUS) within the growing season. Our models were trained on data from 2008 to 2016 and evaluated on data from 2017 and 2018, with the results demonstrating that the machine learning approaches performed better than the linear regression models, with the best performance being achieved using the AdaBoost model (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.51 t/ha, MAE = 0.39 t/ha). Additionally, the results showed that combining data from multiple sources outperformed single source satellite data, with the highest accuracy being obtained when the four data sources were all considered in the model development. Finally, the prediction accuracy was also evaluated against timeliness within the growing season, with reliable predictions (R2 &gt; 0.84) being able to be achieved 2.5 months before the harvest when the multi-source data were combined. © 2020 by the authors.","CONUS; Machine learning; Multi-source data; Winter wheat; Yield prediction","Adaptive boosting; Crops; Decision trees; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Food supply; Forecasting; International trade; Least squares approximations; Remote sensing; Satellites; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Least absolute shrinkage and selection operators; Linear regression methods; Linear regression models; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning methods; Satellite remote sensing; Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.); Yield prediction models; Learning systems",Article,Scopus

We develop a copula-based postprocessing (CPP) method to overcome this mismatch problem. The CPP forecasts are ensemble based and are generated from the predictive distribution conditioned on raw climate forecasts. CPP performs univariate postprocessing procedures at each station, lead time, and variable separately and then applies the Schaake shuffle to reorder ensemble sequence for a more realistic spatial, temporal, and cross-variable dependence structure. The use of copulas makes CPP free of strong distributional assumptions and flexible enough to describe complex dependence structures. In a case study, we apply CPP to postprocess rainfall, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and radiation forecasts at a monthly level from the Australian Community Climate and Earth-System Simulator Seasonal model (ACCESS-S) to three representative stations in Australia. We evaluate forecast skill at lead times of 0–5 months on a cross-validation theme in the context of both univariate and multivariate forecast verification. When compared with forecasts that use climatological values as the predictor, the CPP forecast has positive skills, although the skills diminish with increasing lead times and finally become comparable at long lead times. When compared with the bias-corrected forecasts and the quantile-mapped forecasts, the CPP forecast is the overall best, with the smallest bias and greatest univariate forecast skill. As a result of the skill gain from univariate forecasts and the effect of the Schaake shuffle, CPP leads to the most skillful multivariate forecast as well. Further results investigate whether using ensemble mean or additional predictors can enhance forecast skill for CPP. © 2020, American Meteorological Society.

Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are beneficial in building a good model to detect fraudulent transactions. Dealing with high-dimensional and imbalanced dataset becomes a hinder in real-world applications like credit card fraud detection. To overcome this issue, feature selection a pre-processing technique is adopted considering the classification performance and computational efficiency. This paper proposes a new two-phase feature selection approach that integrates filter and wrapper methods to identify the significant feature subsets. In the first phase, Mutual Information (MI) has been adopted due to its computational efficiency to rank the features based on their feature importance. However, they cannot drop the less important features. Thus, a second phase is added to eliminate the redundant features using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) a wrapper method employed by 5-fold cross-validation. eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is adopted as the estimator for RFE by adjusting the class weights. The optimal features obtained from the proposed method were used in four boosting algorithms such as XGBoost, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Classic Gradient Boosting (CatBoost) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) to analyse the performance of classification. The proposed approach has been applied to the credit card fraud detection dataset obtained from the IEEE-CIS, which consists of imbalance in the binary class target. The experimental outcome shows promising results in terms of Geometric mean (G-Mean) for XGBoost (84.8%) and LGBM (83.7%), the Area Under a Receiver Operating Character (ROC) Curve (AUC) has increased from 79.8% to 85.5% for XGBoost and also the computation time are reduced in training the classifiers. © 2021 C.

Methods: In May 2019, an orthophoto was reconstructed through a flight over an olive grove to predict oil production from segmentation of plant canopy surfaces. The orchard was divided into four plots (three considered as training plots and one considered as a test plot). For each olive tree of the considered plot, the leaf surface was assessed by segmenting the orthophoto and counting the pixels belonging to the canopy. At harvesting, the olive production per plant was measured. The canopy radius of the plant (R) was automatically obtained from the pixel classification and the measured production was plotted as a function of R. Results: After applying a k-means-classification to the four plots, two distinct subsets emerged in association with the year of loading (high-production) and unloading. For each plot of the training set the logarithm of the production curves against R were fitted with a linear function considering only four samples (two samples belonging to the loading region and two samples belonging to the unloading one) and the total production estimate was obtained by integrating the exponent of the fitting-curve over R. The three fitting curves obtained were used to estimate the total production of the test plot. The resulting estimate of the total production deviates from the real one by less than 12% in training and less than 18% in tests. Conclusions: The early estimation of the total production based on R extracted by the orthophotos can allow the design of an anti-fraud protocol on the declared production. © 2021 by the authors.

The quality of these contracts and the indices on which they are based, need to be evaluated to assess their fitness as insurance, and to provide a guide to choosing the index that best protects the insured. In the remote sensing literature, indices are often evaluated with generic model evaluation statistics such as R2 or Root Mean Square Error that do not directly consider the effect of errors on the quality of the insurance contract. Economic analysis suggests using measures that capture the impact of insurance on the expected economic well-being of the insured. To bridge the gap between the remote sensing and economic perspectives, we adopt a standard economic measure of expected well-being and transform it into a Relative Insurance Benefit (RIB) metric. RIB expresses the welfare benefits derived from an index insurance contract relative to a hypothetical contract that perfectly measures losses. RIB takes on its maximal value of one when the index contract offers the same economic benefits as the perfect contract. When it achieves none of the benefits of insurance it takes on a value of zero, and becomes negative if the contract leaves the insured worse off than having no insurance. Part of our contribution is to decompose this economic well-being measure into an asymmetric loss function. We also argue that the expected well-being measure we use has advantages over other economic measures for the normative purpose of insurance quality ascertainment. Finally, we illustrate the use of the RIB measure with a case study of potential livestock insurance contracts in Northern Kenya. We compared 24 indices that were made with 4 different statistical models and 3 remote sensing data sources. RIB for these indices ranged from 0.09 to 0.5, and R2 ranged from 0.2 to 0.51. While RIB and R2 were correlated, the model with the highest RIB did not have the highest R2. Our findings suggest that, when designing and evaluating an index insurance program, it is useful to separately consider the quality of a remote sensing-based index with a metric like the RIB instead of a generic goodness-of-fit metric.

The water losses increased, when water application records low efficiency. The water losses maybe amplified, when the irrigation system ignores soil variability and water applied uniformly. Which means more water application, more energy demand, and more money expenses. The current investigation aims at using remotely sensed data and GIS Techniques for monitoring irrigation water consumption and its correlation with crop yield under the pivot irrigation system. El-Salhia region contains a big agricultural farm located at the South Eastern of Nile delta. The investigated field was irrigated under the pivot central sprinkler irrigation system which cultivated with the wheat crop. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) were calculated based on landsat data. The crop water stress index (CWSI) depends on the variance between the LST of the targets and their air temperature (Tair) to detect the relative moisture condition. The soil texture, organic matter, time-domain reflectometer (TDR), thermal infrared, leaf area index (LAI), and actual yield measurements were taken for 47 systematic samples during the wheat growing season of the year 2012/2013. Accordingly, the available water (AW) displayed relatively lower accuracy than the rest of the other parameters. The canopy temperature (Tc), CWSI, field capacity (Fc), and LAI showed high accuracy to predict the wheat yield as shown from the statistical analysis. The WUE recorded 1.07 (kg/m3) in the southeast boundary and gradient toward the northwest boundary with a rate of 2.2 (kg/m3). The WUE distribution is comparable to soil parameters and measured yield circulation, which indicates high applicability with significant improvement in yield response. © 2020, King Abdulaziz University and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","And field capacity; Available water; The canopy temperature; Water holding capacity; Water-use efficiency",,Article,Scopus

(steadily supported by the Hellenic Agricultural Organization—Demeter) towards offering precision farming services to rice growers. Within this framework, a new methodology for topdressing nitrogen prediction was developed based on machine learning. Nitrogen is a key element in rice culture and its rational management can increase productivity, reduce costs, and prevent environmental impacts. A multi-source, multi-temporal, and multi-scale dataset was collected, including optical and radar imagery, soil data, and yield maps by monitoring a 110 ha pilot rice farm in Thessaloniki Plain, Greece, for four consecutive years. RapidEye imagery underwent image segmentation to delineate management zones (ancillary, visual interpretation of unmanned aerial system scenes was employed, too); Sentinel-1 (SAR) imagery was modelled with Computer Vision to detect inundated fields and (through this) indicate the exact growth stage of the crop; and Sentinel-2 image data were used to map leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) exactly before topdressing applications. Several machine learning algorithms were configured to predict yield for various nitrogen levels, with the XGBoost model resulting in the highest accuracy. Finally, yield curves were used to select the nitrogen dose maximizing yield, which was thus recommended to the grower. Inundation mapping proved to be critical in the prediction process. Currently, Ecodevelopment S.A. is expanding the application of the new method in different study areas, with a view to further empower its generality and operationality. © 2021 by the authors.

In order to classify the three closely related cultivars (small flower EF, medium flower EF, and big flower EF) and simplify the identification procedure in the future, an approach integrating ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet spectrum-hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-UV-Q-Orbitrap HRMS) with machine learning algorithms was developed. Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and random forest (RF) were used to assort the processed EF products and select the chemical markers to differentiate among the three EF cultivars, respectively. Then the thresholds of classification were determined using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost) model based on the quantitative data of chemical markers by the UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS. The results demonstrated that the approach successfully discriminated among three closely related cultivars of EF, and five chemical markers (neochlorogenic acid, (+)-catechin, chlorogenic acid, dehydroevodiamine, and limonin) were selected. Thresholds were obtained to classify the three cultivars. If the content of neochlorogenic acid was greater than 7.52 mg/g, the sample belonged to small flower EF, otherwise, it belonged to medium flower EF or big flower EF. Furthermore, if the content of dehydroevodiamine was greater than 3.84 mg/g, the sample was medium flower EF, otherwise, it was big flower EF.

In areas where such data are not readily available, an independent seasonal monitoring method is needed. Remote sensing is a widely used tool to map land use types, although there are some limitations that can partly be circumvented by using, among others, multiple observations, careful feature selection and appropriate analysis methods. Here, we used Sentinel-2 satellite image time series (SITS) over the land area of Norway to map three agricultural land use classes: cereal crops, fodder crops (grass) and unused areas. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and two variants of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are implemented on SITS data of four different temporal resolutions. These enabled us to compare twelve model-dataset combinations to identify the model-dataset combination that results in the most accurate predictions. The CNN is implemented in the spectral and temporal dimensions instead of the conventional spatial dimension. Rather than using existing deep learning architectures, an autotuning procedure is implemented so that the model hyperparameters are empirically optimized during the training. The results obtained on held-out test data show that up to 94% overall accuracy and 90% Cohen’s Kappa can be obtained when the 2D CNN is applied on the SITS data with a temporal resolution of 7 days. This is closely followed by the 1D CNN on the same dataset. However, the latter performs better than the former in predicting data outside the training set. It is further observed that cereal is predicted with the highest accuracy, followed by grass. Predicting the unused areas has been found to be difficult as there is no distinct surface condition that is common for all unused areas. © 2021 by the authors.

Mission-critical and sensitive applications like aircraft operations and control systems, online banking systems will need minimum latency and quick response time. To address these issues and provide cloud services available to the proximity of edge users without causing delays (like processing delays, network delays, etc.), the concept of fog computing came into existence. Fog computing makes real-time data available to mobile users without any delays close to the edge of the network. With the decline of saffron cultivation in the last decade due to numerous arid and climatic challenges, the Internet of Things (IoT) seems to be an impeccable solution for its cultivation. In this research contribution, a fog-assisted information model for saffron cultivation has been proposed which delivers information to all saffron cultivators as a cloud service using IoT and fog, thus eradicating the possibilities of latency and storage issues. Also, the services offered by the fog node using the ESP32 Wi-Fi module are discussed. To implement the proposed model, data gathered from sensor nodes is stored on the cloud and big data analytics is performed on collected data. Simultaneously, machine learning technology will be used to facilitate increased crop yield in making proper decisions for all the saffron cultivators in smart farming.

Two machine-learning techniques, gradient boosting (GB) and random forests (RF), were used to predict stand mean height of dominant and codominant trees (HT), trees per hectare (Tree·ha1), and basal area per hectare (BA·ha1) based on data sets collected from extensively and intensively managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations in the West Gulf Coastal Plain region. Models were evaluated using coefficient of determination (R2) and bias by applying models to independent tests and validation data sets and then comparing to conventional statistical models (Coble-2017) currently being used in the region. For extensively managed plantations, the GB models had less bias than the RF models. For model precision (R2), the GB models were consistently better than the RF models, and the HT model was the best, followed by those of Tree·ha1 and BA·ha1. Even for BA·ha1, the GB and RF models had R2 over 0.81. GB and RF models outperformed the Coble-2017 model; differences were not substantial for Tree·ha1 but were significant for HT and BA·ha1 (R2 = 0.96, 0.95, and 0.88 for HT and 0.84, 0.81, and 0.76 for BA). Important predictors identified by GB and RF and their contributions to the models were similar. For intensively managed plantations, GB and RF were similarly accurate in predicting HT and Tree·ha1, but GB outperformed RF in predicting BA·ha1 (R2 = 0.87 versus 0.75). We conclude that both GB and RF, although the former is preferred, can be effective in predicting future stand attributes.

How to reflect the external morphological features of the disease and completely retain the color and texture information of the disease area is one of the key research issues for crop disease segmentation. Meanwhile, aiming at the problem of low segmentation accuracy with traditional convolution neural network-based methods in the crop disease leaf image, this paper proposes a spatial pyramid-oriented encoder-decoder cascade convolution neural network for crop disease leaf segmentation. The network consists of a region disease detection network and a region disease segmentation network. Region disease detection network is a kind of network combining cascade convolution neural network with spatial pyramid. This method connects the three-level convolution neural network model, where the structure of the three-level neural network model varies from simple to complex. Different crop disease leaf features are extracted from the different neural network levels. And images are screened to complete the detection of crop disease leaf. What's more, a space pyramid pooling layer is added to each network level. This pooling strategy does not require fixed size input, which increases the size selection of input model. The region segmentation network is established based on the Encoder-Decoder structure. The multi-scale convolution kernel is used to improve the local receptive field of the original convolution kernel and accurately segment the crop disease leaf area. Finally, we conduct experiments on the crop disease leaf images under different conditions, the results show that the proposed method has higher segmentation accuracy. In terms of Precision, Correct segmentation, over-segmentation and under-segmentation indexes, etc., the average values of proposed method are more than 90%. The average dice similarity coefficient is over 95% under different background. Moreover, it can meticulously reflect the external morphological features of the crop disease leaf and relatively better retain the color and texture information. © 2013 IEEE.","Crop disease leaf segmentation; Encoder-decoder cascade convolution neural network; Pooling strategy; Spatial pyramid","Convolution; Crops; Decoding; Image segmentation; Ion beams; Network coding; Plants (botany); Textures; Color and textures; Convolution kernel; Convolution neural network; Morphological features; Neural network model; Region segmentation; Segmentation accuracy; Similarity coefficients; Neural networks",Article,Scopus

Once the patterns of a crop are obtained, the correspondence of the declaration with the model of the neural network can be systematically predicted, and can be used for monitoring the CAP.

This study showed that using observations of pasture growth along with environmental and pasture management variables enabled both models, GAM and RF to predict the pre-grazing pasture biomass production at field scale with an average error below 20%. If predictive variables (i.e. post-grazing pasture biomass) were excluded, model performance was reduced, generating errors up to 40%. The post-grazing biomass information at high spatial resolution (<1 m) acquired with the UAV-multispectral camera system was used as predictive variable for future pasture biomass. With the inclusion of the spatially explicit post-grazing biomass variable both models accurately predicted the pre-grazing pasture biomass with an error of 27.7% and 22.9% for RF and GAM, respectively. However, the GAM model performed better than RF in reproducing the spatial variability of pre-grazing pasture biomass.

Here we explore the importance of rainfall from September 1, which broadly corresponds to the close of the top-dressing fertilizer application window, for the remaining cropping season in determining final yield. This is assessed via sensitivity analysis of water-limited wheat potential yield totals from historical climate in the APSIM crop model. At locations where the rainfall influences wheat yield, we compare three methods to forecast wheat yields that differ based on the climate data input: 1) climatology approach, which uses 30 years of observed climate data, 2) analogue climatology, which uses information from climate drivers (El-Niño Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole) to create analogue years; and 3) dynamical climate forecasts from a general circulation model (ACCESS-S). We find that potential yields strongly depend on in-season plant available water (PAW) where years with high PAW are unaffected by the late season rainfall. Predicting the potential yield from analogue climatology (climate drivers) had the greatest skill, with smallest Root Mean Squared Error of 0.45 t/ha. This approach ranked first for 42% of the study locations compared to the climatology and ACCESS-S forecasting methods. This knowledge can help inform decision makers about the need to incorporate seasonal climate forecasts and the most appropriate climate forecasting method. © 2020","ACCESS-S; APSIM; Climate drivers; climatology; ENSO; IOD; potential wheat yield","agrometeorology; climate effect; climate prediction; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; fertilizer application; general circulation model; Indian Ocean Dipole; rainfall; seasonality; wheat; yield response; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Water scarcity due to climate change, together with the increasing demand of food, is leading experts from around the world find appropriate indicators for water-use efficiency. In this paper we propose and test different indicators for service delivery performance, productive efficiency, and economic efficiency. Since the characteristics of the studied area and the citrus cropping system in the East of Spain are particular, we include in our analysis two other variables which are key to understanding the changes in the indicators: the obtained productivity, and the applied irrigation. The indicators and these two variables are tested with the information provided by farmers of citrus orchards belonging to an irrigation community from the East of Spain. The effect of different factors, such as cultivated varieties, type of farmer (professional or non-professional), or plantations’ size, are evaluated against the productivity and irrigation performance of the evaluated orchards. The effect of excess of irrigation on the indicators is also studied with the previous factors. Finally, an artificial intelligence system is used to predict productive efficiency of an orchard, based on the size and the water supply. Among the proposed indicators, the service delivery performance indicators came out to be the least useful and might provoke overirrigation due to the lack of accuracy of the data used for its calculation. The productive and economic efficiency indicators have been useful to illustrate the remarkable effect that excess of irrigation has on water efficiency, since a reduction of 66% of productive efficiency is found for some of the analysed varieties. On other cases, a reduction of 50% in economic efficiency is detected due to the excess of irrigation. Moreover, the excess of irrigation implied higher economic efficiency in only one of the evaluated varieties. © 2020 by the authors.

Due to the high number of plants per unit area, early plant overlapping and eventual plant loss, the estimation of soybean plant density in the later stages of development should enable the determination of the final plant number and reflect the state of the harvest. In order to assess soybean plant density in a digital, nondestructive, and less intense way, analysis was performed on RGB images (containing three channels: RED, GREEN, and BLUE) taken with a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) on 66 experimental plots in 2018, and 200 experimental plots in 2019. Mean values of the R, G, and B channels were extracted for each plot, then vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated and used as predictors for the machine learning model (MLM). The model was calibrated in 2018 and validated in 2019. For validation purposes, the predicted values for the 200 experimental plots were compared with the real number of plants per unit area (m2). Model validation resulted in the correlation coefficient-R = 0.87, mean absolute error (MAE) = 6.24, and root mean square error (RMSE) = 7.47.

Biochar improves soil moisture and nutrient retention and may be used to improve vegetable water productivity. We examined the combined effect of rice straw biochar and irrigation on yield, water productivity, and phosphorus (P) uptake of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L.) grown on a sandy clay loam soil in the dry season. Biochar was applied at 0, 5, 10 Mg ha−1, and 10 Mg ha−1 biochar fortified with P [10 Mg ha−1(P)] under full irrigation (FI) and deficit irrigation (DI) and replicated in each growing season for three years. Under DI, the 10 Mg ha−1 and 10 Mg ha−1(P) biochar treatments significantly (p &lt;.05) increased okra fresh fruit yield (YFF) by 67 and 82% but had no impact on total aboveground biomass yield (YTBM) in the first growing season. Biochar at 5 Mg ha−1 had no impact on okra yield. Okra yield was higher under biochar fortified with P compared to the traditional method of applying P alone, e.g. 30 Mg ha−1(P) produced significantly higher YTBM than 30 Mg ha−1 under DI. Biochar had no impact on P uptake in the first growing season. Estimated okra water use was 224 and 193 mm under FI and DI. Yield reduction under DI compared to FI was only 8%. Amid water scarcity, a minimum of 10 Mg ha−1 rice straw biochar under DI is therefore recommended for farmers in the area. © 2020 The Authors.

Thus, crop yield forecasting based on seasonal weather information remains a challenge for the agricultural sector. In this study, non-linear regression analysis was carried out to model long-term meteorological data. To assess the predictability of weather based on long-term meteorological data representing a continental climate with four seasons, principal component analysis was done. Predictability of crop yield based on previous long-term yield data was tested with the Wald-Wolfowitz Runs method. Finally, non-linear regression analysis was applied to investigate the predictability of maize yield based on winter wheat yield. The hypothesis that the weather of a season would be predictable based on long-term daily temperature and precipitation dataset was disproved, although results showed that for the investigated region, if winter is warm, spring can be expected to be warm, as well. It was also statistically disproved that crop yield would be predictable based on time series analysis of previous yield data. However, a cross effect between the yields of maize and wheat as model crops was proved; when the crop yield of winter wheat is low, that of maize is expected also to be low, while in case of high winter wheat yield, maize yield can be high in cases where there is no climate stress in the flowering and ripening periods. However, as an overall conclusion, even if relations are found between weather variabilities and responding crop yield variations, crop yield cannot be estimated, since weather represented by a chaotic model with scale-independent distribution cannot be predicted in advance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate; Crop yield; Prediction; Principal component analysis; Season; Weather","Agricultural robots; Climate models; Crops; Forecasting; Meteorology; Principal component analysis; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Weathering; Agricultural sector; Climate; Continental climate; Crop yield; Crop yield forecasting; Non-linear regression analysis; Season; Weather information; Weather forecasting; climate change; climate conditions; crop yield; principal component analysis; seasonal variation; Central Europe; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

It can be achieved with empirical models developed with the information provided by vegetation indices (VI). This work evaluated the performance of different time series of VI for the predictive modelling of wheat production and yield in Spain comparing two sources of cropland masks: wheat mask using Common Agricultural Policy declarations (CAP), and arable land from Corine Land Cover (CLC). Both sources were used to analyse the improvement derived from considering specific wheat masks. The wheat production and yield were modelled using time series of MODIS NDVI and EVI2 (2006 to 2016) from weekly surface reflectance products (MOD09Q1 v6) at 250 meters. The sum of VI values of one month after the maximum was used as this period is related with yield and production. VI indicators were filtered and aggregated to NUTS-3 level. The cropland masks were obtained either by combining the parcel boundaries with the CAP wheat reports, or from the CLC arable land category of 2006 and 2012 maps. Production (t) and yield (t ha-1) estimates were obtained from official statistics. Subsequently, different regression analyses were carried to build an overall model and single models for some NUTS2. Models using CAP wheat masks outperformed those of CLC, predicting more accurately production than yield. The best performance for production models using CAP was that of EVI2 in Castille and Leon (R2=96% and Normalized Relative Error (NRE)=14.72%) and the best for CLC that of EVI2 in Spain (R2=55% and NRE=58.01%). Regarding yield modelling, CAP with EVI2 in Aragon was the best (R2=81% and NRE=10.57%) as well as CLC with EVI2 in Spain overall model (R2=50% and NRE=22.34%). The findings of this work suggest that the use of specific crop masks is of paramount importance for the predictive modeling of crop production. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Positive effects of F. albida on crop production are widely recognised. However, the effects of tree pruning, zone and fertiliser interactions on crop growth have not been addressed in earlier studies. A field experiment containing three levels of tree pruning (100% pruned, 50% pruned, and unpruned) as main plots, and application of recommended rates of N and P fertilisers as sub-plots, was conducted during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons. Maize grain yield and biomass, light intensity, and soil nutrients and moisture were measured at different positions from each F. albida tree trunk (0–2, 2–4 and 4–6 m) and in crop-only plots. Biomass and yield of maize were significantly greater under tree canopies compared to crop-only plots in both the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons, regardless of pruning levels. Fertilisation significantly increased yields under tree canopies compared to crop-only plots in both years. Light intensity increased with distance from trees and with greater pruning levels. Soil carbon and nutrient concentrations and moisture content decreased with increasing distance from tree and with soil depth. These results suggest that maize production and profitability could be maintained or improved through only partial pruning of F. albida rather than pollarding, and by preferentially applying fertilisers in normal and wet years.

For the Java language, the XML DOM parser despite performing in-memory operations is unable to achieve peak execution performance on modern systems, especially for parsing large XML files. The issue of inefficient execution may be mitigated by selecting appropriate runtime parameters for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This entails to exploring parameter space in an exhaustive manner that is not practically feasible for rapid application development. This paper aims at performance enhancement of XML parsing through selection of optimal set of JVM runtime parameters. The proposed approach works independent of parser design. It reduces JVM parameter space through machine learning-based models which are trained using profile data. The impact of parameters is determined using linear regression and artificial neural network-based models.

Only few instances, called primary instances, contribute to the bag labels. The remaining ones are noisy observations. The goal in MIR is to identify the primary instances within each bag and learn a regression model that can predict the label of a previously unseen bag. In this paper, we show that regression models can be identified as clusters when appropriate features and distances are used. We introduce an algorithm, called Robust Fuzzy Clustering for Multiple Instance Regression (RFC-MIR), that can learn multiple linear models simultaneously. First, RFC-MIR uses constrained fuzzy memberships to obtain an initial partition where instances can belong to multiple models with various degrees. Then, it uses unconstrained possibilistic memberships to allow the initial local models to expand and converge to the global model. These memberships are also used to identify the primary instances within each bag. After clustering, the possibilistic memberships are used to identify the optimal number of regression models. We evaluate our approach on synthetic data sets generated by varying the dimensionality of the feature space, the number of instances per bag, and the noise level. We also validate the RFC-MIR using two real applications: prediction of the yearly average yield of a crop using remote sensing data; and drug activity prediction. These applications have been used consistently to validate existing MIR algorithms. We show that our approach achieves higher accuracy than existing methods. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Fuzzy clustering; Multiple instance regression; Multiple model regression; Possibilistic clustering","Forecasting; Fuzzy clustering; Remote sensing; Multiple instance regressions (MIR); Multiple instances; Multiple linear models; Multiple-modeling; Noisy observations; Possibilistic clustering; Remote sensing data; Robust fuzzy clustering; Regression analysis",Article,Scopus

The estimation of leaf area index (LAI) in tropical savanna ecosystems is therefore fundamental for the proper planning and management of this natural capital. In this study, we assess the spatio-temporal seasonal LAI dynamics (dry and wet seasons) as a proxy for rangeland condition and productivity in the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. The 30 m Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) spectral bands, derived vegetation indices and a non-parametric approach (i.e., random forest, RF) were used to assess dry and wet season LAI condition and variability in the KNP. The results showed that RF optimization enhanced the model performance in estimating LAI. Moderately high accuracies were observed for the dry season (R2 of 0.63-0.72 and average RMSE of 0.60 m2/m2) and wet season (0.62-0.63 and 0.79 m2/m2). Derived thematic maps demonstrated that the park had high LAI estimates during the wet season when compared to the dry season. On average, LAI estimates ranged between 3 and 7 m2/m2 during the wet season, whereas for the dry season most parts of the park had LAI estimates ranging between 0.00 and 3.5 m2/m2. The findings indicate that Kruger National Park had high levels of productivity during the wet season monitoring period. Overall, this work shows the unique potential of Landsat 8-derived metrics in assessing LAI as a proxy for tropical savanna rangelands productivity. The result is relevant for wildlife management and habitat assessment and monitoring. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate variability; Natural capital; Rangeland productivity; Seasonal variability; Wildlife","Animals; Climate change; Decision trees; Drought; Ecosystems; Maps; Number theory; Tropics; Assessment and monitoring; Climate variability; Dry and wet seasons; Natural capital; Nonparametric approaches; Operational land imager; Seasonal variability; Wildlife; Productivity",Article,Scopus

The overarching goal of this study was to develop a higher-spatial-resolution vegetation outlook (VegOut-UBN) model that integrates multiple satellite, climatic, and biophysical input variables for the Upper Blue Nile (UBN) basin. VegOut-UBN uses current and historical observations in predicting the vegetation condition at multiple leading time steps of 1, 3, 6, and 9 dekades. VegOut-UBN was developed to predict the vegetation condition during the main crop-growing season locally called ""Kiremt"" (June to September) using historical input data from 2001 to 2016. The rule-based regression tree approach was used to develop the relationship between the predictand and predictor variables. The results for the recent historic drought (2009 and 2015) and non-drought (2007) years are presented to evaluate the model accuracy during extreme weather conditions. The result, in general, shows that the predictive accuracy of the model decreases as the prediction interval increases for the cross-validation years. The coefficient of determination (R2) of the predictive and observed vegetation condition shows a higher value (R2 &gt; 0.8) for one-month prediction and a relatively lower value (R2 ≅= 0.70) for three-month prediction. The result also reveals strong spatial integrity and similarity of the observed and predicted maps. VegOut-UBN was evaluated and compared with the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) (derived from independent rainfall datasets from meteorological stations) at different aggregate periods and with a food security status map. The result was encouraging and indicative of the potential application of VegOut-UBN for drought monitoring and prediction. The VegOut-UBN model could be informative in decision-making processes and could contribute to the development of operational drought monitoring and predictive models for the UBN basin. © 2019 by the authors.","Drought; Regression model; Upper Blue Nile; VegOut-UBN","Cultivation; Decision making; Developing countries; Food supply; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Vegetation; Blue Nile; Coefficient of determination; Decision making process; Extreme weather conditions; Historical observation; Regression model; Standardized precipitation index; VegOut-UBN; Drought",Article,Scopus

Each of the models was constructed in such a way that the yield prediction can be carried out on three dates: April 15th, May 31st, and June 30th. For model building, artificial neural networks with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) topology were used, on the basis of meteorological data (temperature and precipitation) and information about mineral fertilisation. The data were collected from the years, 2008-2015, from 328 production fields located in Greater Poland, Poland. An assessment of the quality of forecasts produced based on neural models was verified by determination of forecast errors using RAE (relative approximation error), RMS (root mean square error), MAE (mean absolute error) error indicators, and MAPE (mean absolute percentage error). An important feature of the produced prediction models is the ability to realize the forecast in the current agrotechnical year on the basis of the current weather and fertiliser information. The lowest MAPE error values were obtained for the neural model WR15_04 (April 15th) based on the MLP network with structure 15:15-18-11-1:1, which reached 7.51%. Other models reached MAPE errors of 7.85% for model WR31_05 (May 31st) and 8.12% for model WR30_06 (June 30th). The performed sensitivity analysis gave information about the factors that have the greatest impact on winter rapeseed yields. The highest rank of 1 was obtained by two networks for the same independent variable in the form of the sum of precipitation within a period from September 1st to December 31st of the previous year. However, in model WR15_04, the highest rank obtained a feature in the form of a sum of molybdenum fertilization in the current year (MO_CY). The models of winter rapeseed yield produced in the work will be the basis for the construction of new forecasting tools, which may be an important element of precision agriculture and the main element of decision support systems. © 2018 by the authors.","MLP network; Neural model; Precision agriculture; Sensitivity analysis; Winter rapeseed; Yield prediction","agricultural technology; artificial neural network; crop yield; fertilizer application; molybdenum; precision agriculture; sensitivity analysis; topology; Poland [Central Europe]; Brassica napus",Article,Scopus

The tools used allow knowing the trends of spatial and temporal prediction models of PC1 semivariances and to judge the adjustment between observed and predicted variables by analyzing prediction statistics as: root-mean-squared error, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, mean error, and mean percentage error. From the observation of statistics, the best spatio-temporal adjustment can be selected. The prediction of LULC changes through the PC1 prediction can be followed for different future time into the time series. The samples evaluated of PC1 prediction in the validation stage give a correlation coefficient upper to 0.8 and adjusted determination coefficient upper to 0.7; being a successful adjustment between observed and predicted values allowing to select the hybrid model proposed to forecast the PC1 variable in a future time.

This study aimed to demonstrate the potential use of 35 selected hyperspectral vegetation indices (HVI), collected at the R5 growth stage, for predicting soybean seed yield and FBIO. Two artificial intelligence algorithms, ensemble-bagging (EB) and deep neural network (DNN), were used to predict soybean seed yield and FBIO using HVI. Considering HVI as input variables, the coefficients of determination (R2 ) of 0.76 and 0.77 for yield and 0.91 and 0.89 for FBIO were obtained using DNN and EB, respectively.

In order to address these issues, we develop a model to predict potato yield using satellite remote sensing. In an effort to offer a good predictive model that improves the state of the art on potato precision agriculture, we use images from the twin Sentinel 2 satellites (European Space Agency-Copernicus Programme) over three growing seasons, applying different machine learning models. First, we fitted nine machine learning algorithms with various pre-processing scenarios using variables from July, August and September based on the red, red-edge and infra-red bands of the spectrum. Second, we selected the best performing models and evaluated them against independent test data. Finally, we repeated the previous two steps using only variables corresponding to July and August.

It is then tested for timely estimation of maize grain yields and their year-on-year variability in Burkina Faso. Outputs from the SARRA-O crop model were used as a proxy for observed data for calibration. The final remote sensing-based yield model was constructed on the interaction between aboveground biomass at flowering (AGB-F) and crop water stress (Cstr) over the reproductive and maturation phases. Various vegetation and drought-related indices were derived from different spectral domains and tested. Model performance was evaluated by cross-validation against (a) simulated yields and (b) independent yields from ground surveys aggregated at village level. The results showed that the RF (Random Forest) model outperformed the MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) model for year-on-year yield estimation at the end of the season when compared to simulated yields. Surface soil moisture (SSM) information, as a proxy for soil water available for plant growth, together with information on the temperature of the canopy cover, helped to improve the RF maize yield model, impacting more particularly the estimation of crop water stress. Lastly, two months before harvest the RF model predicted 46% of the observed end-of-season maize grain yield variability. The combined remote sensing, crop model and machine learning method is thus an effective approach for estimating and forecasting inter-annual maize crop yields in environments where field data are scarce, such as in most parts of the African continent.

We hypothesized that the use of N nutrition index and N uptake combined with red-edge or green reflectance would provide extended linearity and higher accuracy in estimating N status across different years, genotypes, and densities, and the accuracy of N status estimation will be further improved by using artificial neural network based on multiple spectral reflectance wavelengths. Multifactorial field experiments on interactive effects of N nutrition, sowing density, and genotype were conducted in 2011–2013 to develop methods for estimation of N status and to reduce dependency on changing environmental conditions, genotype, or barley management. N nutrition index (NNI) and total N uptake were used to correct the effect of biomass accumulation and N dilution during plant development. We employed an artificial neural network to integrate data from multiple reflectance wavelengths and thereby eliminate the effects of such interfering factors as genotype, sowing density, and year. NNI and N uptake significantly reduced the interannual variation in relationships to vegetation indices documented for N content. The vegetation indices showing the best performance across years were mainly based on red-edge and carotenoid absorption bands. The use of an artificial neural network also significantly improved the estimation of all N status indicators, including N content. The critical reflectance wavelengths for neural network training were in spectral bands 400–490, 530–570, and 710–720 nm. In summary, combining NNI or N uptake and neural network increased the accuracy of N status estimation to up 94%, compared to less than 60% for N concentration. © 2021 by the authors.

We designed artificial shading systems using black polyethylene screen of varying density (21 %, 44 and 74%reductions in light intensity) at the jointing (approximately 70 d of shading), booting (approximately 55 d of shading), and anthesis (approximately 40 d of shading) stages, with full solar radiation (S0) as a control. Reduced light intensity significantly decreased the number of fertile florets per spike, resulting in a marked decline in grains per spike. Decreased light intensity also significantly decreased photosynthetic rates, grain yield and associated components (spike number, grains per spike, and thousand-grain weight), Furthermore, when applied at the anthesis stage, shading had the strongest negative impact on wheat productivity via decreases in thousand-grain weight. Decreased light intensity substantially enhanced grain and stalk nitrogen concentrations, as well as protein and wet gluten contents. However, the increase in grain quality did not compensate for the decreased final grain yield. Our evaluation of the effect of heterogeneous spatio-temporal light patterns on wheat yield and quality via an artificial shade system may help plantation managers to optimize agroforestry practices in Southern Xinjiang, Northwest China. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Agroforestry; Grain quality; Grain yield; Heterogeneous spatio-temporal light patterns; Light intensity; Shading period","agricultural production; agroforestry; budburst; crop production; crop yield; deciduous tree; food quality; light intensity; resource use; understory; wheat; China; Juglans; Juglans regia; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

MIF provides a key performance shop floor metric called the value of information flow (VIF). Previous methods have been used to analyze VIF in developed countries. However, these methods are sometimes limited when applied to developing countries where the shop floor is disorganized. It then renders the MIF with the imported software inefficient because of the gap between the user environments. Taking Cameroon as a case study, this study proposes a new method of modeling and analyzing the information flow and its value based on the characteristics of information flow (CIF) for developing countries. In addition, a predictive analysis of the VIF based on CIF using an artificial neural network (ANN) on one hand and optimized ANN with particle swarm optimizer (PSO) and genetic algorithms (GA) on the other is performed. The ANN model of regression developed has the following performance: coefficient of determination: 0.99 and mean squared error (MSE): 0.00043. For the PSO-ANN, the MSE decreased to 0.00011, and this model result was similar to that of the deep learning model used for regression. The GA-ANN model results were not as satisfactory as those of the PSO-ANN model.

The quadratic polynomial regression model was used to construct the model of the trend of normalized difference vegetation index-based vegetation indexes (NDVI-based VIs) between pre-tillering and panicle differentiation stages. The slope of the quadratic polynomial regression model tended to be alleviated in the period in which the panicle initiation stage should occur.

Accordingly, we compiled plant compositional traits from chrysanthemum and gerbera plants in four treatments: non-infested, or infested with mites, thrips or whiteflies, and we acquired hyperspectral leaf reflectance data from the same plants over time (0–14 days). RESULTS: Plant compositional traits changed significantly in response to arthropod infestations, and individual chrysanthemum and gerbera plants were classified with 78% and 80% accuracy, respectively. Based on leaf reflectance, individual plants from the four treatments were classified with moderate accuracy levels of 76% (gerbera) and 73% (chrysanthemum) but with a clear distinction between non-infested and infested plants. Accurate and consistent diagnosis of biotic stressors was not achieved. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study in which infestations by multiple economically important arthropod pests are directly compared and associated with leaf reflectance responses and changes in plant compositional traits. It is important to highlight that imposed stress levels were low, period of infestation was short, and hyperspectral remote-sensing data were acquired at four time points with analyses based on large data sets (3826 leaf reflectance profiles for chrysanthemum and 4041 for gerbera). This study provides novel insight into crop responses to different biotic stressors and into possible associations between plant compositional traits and hyperspectral leaf reflectance data acquired from crop leaves. © 2021 The Authors.

However, estimating daily SST with both high precision and high spatial completeness remains a challenge. This article attempts to solve this problem by merging two complementary daily SST products, that is, the 25 km-resolution Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) SST and 4 km-resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) SST, using a genetic algorithm–assisted deep neural network model (GA-DNNM). The merged SST with a spatial resolution of 4 km and a temporal resolution of 1 day is achieved. Experiments in the Asia and Indo-Pacific Ocean (AIPO) region in 2005 were conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of the proposed method. Results showed that the spatial coverages of the original MODIS SST and AMSR-E SST are ranging from 25.0 to 48.1%, and 31.5 to 47.6%, respectively, while the merged SST achieves a spatial coverage ranging from 56.1 to 73.1%, with improvements ranging from 50.2 to 131.7% relative to the original MODIS SST. Comparisons with drifting buoy observations indicate that the merged SST is accurate, with an average bias of 0.006°C and an average RMSE of 0.502°C, in places where the MODIS SST data are missing before being merged in the AIPO area, and with an average bias of −0.082 °C, and an average RMSE of 0.603°C for the merged SST in the whole study area.

Here we present a novel approach investigating the effect of compaction due to in-field traffic by continuously monitoring crop canopy temperature and soil profile moisture and measuring crop yield in individual crop rows to determine the economic impact on cotton farming systems. Traffic by a tractor weighing 19.2 Mg either side of the plant row reduced lint yield by 27 % due to lower crop height, leaf area, biomass and fruit number. Elevated canopy temperature (Tc) in the compacted plots resulted in 30 % higher stress time (i.e. cumulative time when Tc is higher than the optimum Tc for cotton growth) compared with the non-compacted plots. Higher stress time in compacted plots was correlated with a 72 % and 27 % reduction in crop water use (estimated from change in soil water) at 0.3−0.5 m and 0.5 – 0.7 m depths, respectively. Water recharge in the soil profile from irrigation and rainfall was reduced by 16 % due to compaction with the highest reduction being 86 % at 0.3 – 0.5 m depth. These results demonstrate that compaction likely reduced root access to water below 0.3 m inducing water stress resulting in yield reduction. Tractors used for farm operations only compact one side of the bed, however, both sides are compacted in the absence of permanent wheel tracks. By comparison a dual tyre round module cotton picker weighing ∼32 Mg compacts 67 % of the rows on both sides and 33 % on one side suggesting greater economic loss in the following season compared to that estimated from the current study. Reductions in soil water recharge following irrigation and rainfall events due to compaction will further decrease farm efficiency and profitability. To our knowledge this is the first study related to soil compaction in any crop to show the direct relationship between yield, plant stress time and soil water dynamics at specific depths in profile. It is suggested that short term agronomic decisions (eg irrigation scheduling) need to be considered differently where compaction has been identified as limiting productivity. We recommend case studies be conducted to monitor the effect of compaction on commercial farm productivity and to demonstrate the cost of compaction across agricultural industries to drive practice change. Demonstrating the potential economic consequences of soil compaction by the integrated approach used in this study may encourage practice change to minimize compaction on farms. © 2021 The Author(s)","Canopy temperature; Crop water use; Soil strength; Soil water recharge; Water stress","Compaction; Cotton; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Irrigation; Losses; Plants (botany); Productivity; Rain; Soil mechanics; Soil moisture; Tractors (agricultural); Tractors (truck); Water supply; Weighing; % reductions; Canopy temperature; Case-studies; Crop water use; Soil compaction; Soil strength; Soil water; Stress time; Water recharges; Water stress; Crops; compaction; cotton; economic impact; soil profile; soil water; water stress; water use; Gossypium hirsutum; Varanidae",Article,Scopus

Mechanical transplanting is gaining popularity as a cost-saving and on-time operation with less labor orientation in rice cultivation. This experiment was performed to investigate the relation of rice yield (g m−2) with four mechanical rice transplanting parameters (i.e., seedling density in the tray (nos.cm−2), missing hill percentage, floating hill percentage, and seedling number per hill), and to develop an Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) model to predict the yield from the transplanting parameters. A regression analysis was also conducted to validate the accuracy of the trained ANN model. This study reveals that the dependency of yield on these four parameters is not ignorable and significant. The ANN model performed an accurate match in predicting yield from transplanting parameters with an R2 value of 0.994 and adjusted R2 of 0.993. The ANN model possessed an RMSE of 4.577 in predicting yield which lied in the allowable range of 10 %. The ANN model showed better accuracy in predicting yield than the regression model and pretended to be an alternative to numerical models in predicting yield. The findings of this study showed that ANN-based models would be an alternative to the regression model and a more accurate method of yield prediction based on the transplanting field parameters. © 2021","ANN; Mechanical rice transplantation; Regression; Transplanting parameters; Yield prediction model",,Article,Scopus

The machine learning-based methods produced greater accuracy than the Jarvis-type model in predicting gs from leaf age, atmospheric [CO2], photosynthetically active radiation, vapour pressure deficit, temperature, time of day, and soil water availability (i.e. phenological and environmental variables determining gs).

The outcome of leaving its vulnerabilities unchecked can be detrimental and henceforth demands efficient ways to establish security. A vast and ever-changing system like CPS demands a modern solution to tackle the problem of establishing security and that is what brings machine learning (ML) based methods into the picture. This chapter begins with an introduction towards ML and explains the motivation towards using ML-based methods to establish security. The chapter having made the reader familiar with the key terms of ML will then go on to talk about their applications in fostering security for CPS. This will be done in two phases of classification, where firstly we will discuss ML methods from the perspective of the security domain they aim to tackle, i.e. methods of thread monitoring, mitigation techniques, etc. Then we will talk about ML security based on the architecture of CPS and explain where various methods sit inside the whole architecture, consisting of the application, communication, and the physical layers. The chapter will follow these methods with real-world examples and promising research of them being used, while also discussing their effectiveness in doing the same.

This study intended to tackle the fertilizer consumption inefficiencies by utilizing non-destructive remote sensing technologies, soil macronutrient distribution analysis, and a deep learning model. Specifically, an Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) was used in a cornfield to capture the plant's reflectance information for retrieving the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during the vegetative and reproductive growth stages. Consequently, the field's soil samples were examined for their Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, and Carbon (NPKC) macronutrient constituencies. Finally, a Convolutional Neural Network-Regression model was developed to predict infield NPKC spatiotemporal variations in soil using the NDVI measurements. The deep learning model effectively determined the surpluses or shortages of the NPKC macronutrients within the cornfield throughout the growth stages.

This study focuses on the land cover classification and change detection with multitemporal and multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite data. To address the challenging land cover change detection task, we rely on two different deep learning architectures and selected pre-processing steps. For example, we define an excluded class and deal with temporal water shoreline changes in the pre-processing. We employ a fully convolutional neural network (FCN), and we combine the FCN with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The FCN can only handle monotemporal input data, while the FCN combined with LSTM can use sequential information (multitemporal). Besides, we provided fixed and variable sequences as training sequences for the combined FCN and LSTM approach. The former refers to using six defined satellite images, while the latter consists of image sequences from an extended training pool of ten images. Further, we propose measures for the robustness concerning the selection of Sentinel-2 image data as evaluation metrics. We can distinguish between actual land cover changes and misclassifications of the deep learning approaches with these metrics. According to the provided metrics, both multitemporal LSTM approaches outperform the monotemporal FCN approach, about 3 to 5 percentage points (p.p.). The LSTM approach trained on the variable sequences detects 3 p.p. more land cover changes than the LSTM approach trained on the fixed sequences. Besides, applying our selected pre-processing improves the water classification and avoids reducing the dataset effectively by 17.6%. The presented LSTM approaches can be modified to provide applicability for a variable number of image sequences since we published the code of the deep learning models.

In previous research, different crop phenology models were compared, and different parameterization methods for crop model calibration were evaluated, which revealed that both model structures and parameterization methods were important for crop modeling. However, few studies have considered the combination of both factors and compared these influences simultaneously. Therefore, information regarding the extent of variation in model accuracy and uncertainty depending on model structure and parameterization method is lacking. In this study, we developed three winter wheat phenology models with different structures, i.e., the Agricultural Production System Simulator model for wheat (APSIM-wheat), Wang and Engel model, and sigmoid and exponential function based model, to predict the heading date as a case study. We calibrated these models using three different parameterization methods (augmented Lagrange multiplier method, Nelder-Mead method, and Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process) to investigate their effects on model accuracy and uncertainty. Six-fold cross validation of nine combinations of model calibration (3 models × 3 parameterizations) and their validation revealed that accuracies ranged mostly from 2 to 7 days in the root mean square error (RMSE). The coefficient of variation of RMSE varied widely in among model structures and parameterization methods (∼0.01–0.6). Furthermore, the coefficient of variation of model parameters also varied substantially depending both on model structure and parameterization method. Especially for the model with more parameters, we found that the prediction and parameter stability varied depending on parameterization methods. These findings suggest that both prediction and parameter uncertainty varied with model structure and parameterization method and emphasize the importance of which models and parameterization methods modelers use for robust crop phenology model. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Model structure; Optimization; Parameter uncertainty; Parameterization; Prediction uncertainty; Wheat phenology model","agricultural modeling; Bayesian analysis; calibration; error analysis; Gaussian method; optimization; parameterization; uncertainty analysis; wheat; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

We present an experimental study of identification of Parkinson's disease and assessment of disease progress from speech using Gaussian processes, which is further combined with Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) for efficient feature selection. Hyperparameters of ARD covariance functions are learned for each individual feature; therefore, can be used for evaluation of their importance. In that way only a small subset of highly relevant acoustic features is selected, leading to models with better performance and lower complexity. The performance of the proposed method was assessed on two datasets: Parkinson's disease detection dataset, which contains a range of biomedical voice measurements obtained from 31 subjects, 23 of them suffering from Parkinson's disease and 8 healthy subjects; and Parkinson's telemonitoring dataset, containing biomedical voice measurements collected from 42 Parkinson's disease patients for estimation of the disease progress.

Model learning and planning, as a well-known method to improve the sample efficiency, is achieved by learning a system dynamics model first and then using it for planning. However, the convergence of the algorithm will be slowed if the system dynamics model is not captured accurately, with the consequence of low sample efficiency. Therefore, to solve the problems with continuous state and action spaces, a model-learning-based actor-critic algorithm with the Gaussian process approximator is proposed, named MLAC-GPA, where the Gaussian process is selected as the modeling method due to its valuable characteristics of capturing the noise and uncertainty of the underlying system. The model in MLAC-GPA is firstly represented by linear function approximation and then modeled by the Gaussian process. Afterward, the expectation value vector and the covariance matrix of the model parameter are estimated by Bayesian reasoning. The model is used for planning after being learned, to accelerate the convergence of the value function and the policy. Experimentally, the proposed method MLAC-GPA is implemented and compared with five representative methods in three classic benchmarks, Pole Balancing, Inverted Pendulum, and Mountain Car.

Significant research progress can be found to date in devising variants of neural network (NN) models to fulfil this requirement by improving feature extraction and dynamic process representation power. Nevertheless, all these existing NN models are built upon rigid structures that often fail to maintain tradeoff between bias and variance, and consequently, need to spend a lot of time to empirically determine the most appropriate network configuration. This article proposes a self-adaptive recurrent deep incremental network model (SARDINE) which is a novel variant of the deep recurrent neural network with intrinsic capability of self-constructing the network structure in a dynamic and incremental fashion while learning from observed data samples. Moreover, the proposed SARDINE is able to model the spatial feature evolution while scanning the data in a single pass manner, and this further saves significant time when dealing with remote sensing imagery containing millions of pixels. Subsequently, we employ SARDINE in combination with a spatial influence mapping unit to accomplish the prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated in terms of predicting a time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)-5 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra satellite imagery.

Individual feed intake of dairy cows is an important variable currently unavailable in commercial dairies. An RGB-D camera was positioned above the feeding area in an open cowshed. Feed intake was estimated by combining information from the RGB and depth images. Cow identification was conducted using the RGB image. Deep learning algorithms for identification and intake estimation were developed using CNN models. Data for CNN training were acquired by a specially developed automatic data acquisition system. A range of feed weights under varied configurations were collected over a period of seven days with the setup, which included an automatic scale, cameras, and a micro-controller. Test data for feed intake was acquired in an open cowshed research dairy farm, wherein the cows were fed Total Mix Ration (TMR). Images of cows eating over a period of 36 h provided the test data for cow identification. The system was able to accurately identify 93.65% of the cows. The amount of feed consumed, which ranged from 0 to 8 kg per meal, was measured with mean absolute and square errors (MAE and MSE) of 0.127 kg, and 0.034kg2 respectively. The analysis showed that the amount and diversity of data are important for model training. Better results were achieved for the model that was trained with high-diversity data than the model trained with homogeneous data (MAE of 1.025 kg, and MSE of 2.845 kg2 for a model trained on shadow conditions only). Additionally, the training analysis shows that the model based on RGB-D data shows better results than the model based on depth channel data without RGB (MAE of 0.241 kg, and MSE of 0.106 kg2).

A mass mechanical harvesting of apples offers an alternative and promising solution. In addition to harvester design elements, it is important to understand the key canopy parameters of apple trees as they are closely integrated and interact with each other during the harvest process. In this study, the impact of eleven canopy parameters on mechanical harvesting were investigated for vertically-trained “Scifresh” and V-trellis grown “Envy” trees during harvesting trials. A supervised machine learning algorithm with weighted k-nearest neighbours (kNN) was adopted to analyse our canopy datasets. Overall, 2678 ground-truth data points (apples) were classified into two binary classes of fruit removal status: “mechanically harvested” and “mechanically unharvested” apples. For the training dataset (85%), the adopted algorithm achieved overall prediction accuracies of 76–92% and 62–74% for “Scifresh” and “Envy”. With the remaining 15% dataset, the overall test accuracies were 81–91% on “Scifresh” but only 36–79% on “Envy”. The principal components analysis (PCA) was adopted to determine the key canopy parameters by calculating the coefficients of principal components (PCs). The PC1–PC5 explained at least 80% of the data variance. By assuming a coefficient greater than 0.5 as being highly relevant, fruit load per branch, branch basal diameter, and shoot length were the most relevant among all.

To generate an NDVI map, a relatively high-cost multispectral sensor is required; but currently, most UAVs are equipped with low-cost RGB cameras. For that reason, other indices that utilize RGB data have been developed to generate maps similar to NDVI and minimize the data acquisition cost, such as the triangular greenness index (TGI) and the visible atmospheric resistant index (VARI). However, several studies found that these indices cannot be recommended as reliable general-purpose crop health indicators. This study utilizes a genetic algorithm to develop a new visible index (visible NDVI; vNDVI) that estimates NDVI values of vegetation from uncalibrated RGB cameras mounted on UAVs (or other remote sensing platforms). Three experiments were conducted to create and validate the proposed index. First, the NDVI values generated from a multispectral camera were compared with the NDVI values generated by a hyperspectral camera. In the second experiment, the vNDVI formula was created using a genetic algorithm. The third experiment validates the proposed vNDVI, generated from two uncalibrated RGB cameras, in three different crops (citrus, grapes, and sugarcane). The proposed vNDVI proved to be highly accurate on estimating NDVI values by just using RGB cameras, with an overall mean percentage error of 6.89% and a mean average error of 0.052 in all three crops, providing a low-cost alternative for remote sensing and plant phenotyping. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Big data; Genetic algorithm; Hyperspectral; Multispectral; NDVI; RGB; Vegetation index","Big data; Cameras; Costs; Crops; Data acquisition; Genetic algorithms; Vegetation; Hyper-spectral cameras; HyperSpectral; Multi-spectral; Multi-spectral cameras; NDVI; Normalized difference vegetation index; Remote sensing platforms; Vegetation index; Remote sensing; data acquisition; estimation method; experimental study; genetic algorithm; index method; NDVI; sensor; visible spectrum; Citrus; Vitaceae",Article,Scopus

Here we used a machine learning approach to investigate the determinants of almond yield variation in California’s almond orchards, based on a unique 10-year dataset of field measurements of light interception and almond yield along with meteorological data. We found that overall the maximum almond yield was highly dependent on light interception, e.g., with each one percent increase in light interception resulting in an increase of 57.9 lbs/acre in the potential yield. Light interception was highest for mature sites with higher long term mean spring incoming solar radiation (SRAD), and lowest for younger orchards when March maximum temperature was lower than 19°C. However, at any given level of light interception, actual yield often falls significantly below full yield potential, driven mostly by tree age, temperature profiles in June and winter, summer mean daily maximum vapor pressure deficit (VPDmax), and SRAD. Utilizing a full random forest model, 82% (±1%) of yield variation could be explained when using a sixfold cross validation, with a RMSE of 480 ± 9 lbs/acre. When excluding light interception from the predictors, overall orchard characteristics (such as age, location, and tree density) and inclusive meteorological variables could still explain 78% of yield variation. The model analysis also showed that warmer winter conditions often limited mature orchards from reaching maximum yield potential and summer VPDmax beyond 40 hPa significantly limited the yield. Our findings through the machine learning approach improved our understanding of the complex interaction between climate, canopy light interception, and almond nut production, and demonstrated a relatively robust predictability of almond yield. This will ultimately benefit data-driven climate adaptation and orchard nutrient management approaches. © Copyright © 2020 Jin, Chen, Lampinen and Brown.","artificial intelligence; big data; light interceptioon; nutrient management; Prunus dulcis; yield gap",,Article,Scopus

Pakistan has its GDP based on agriculture, however it relies on manual monitoring of crops, which is a labour intensive and ineffective method. In contrast to this, several cutting edge technology-based solutions are being employed in the developed countries to enhance the crop yield with the optimal use of resources. To this end, we have proposed an integrated approach for monitoring crop health using IoT, machine learning and drone technology. The integration of these sensing modalities generate heterogeneous data which not only varies in nature (i.e. observed parameter) but also has different temporal fidelity. The spatial resolution of these methods is also different, hence, the optimal integration of these sensing modalities and their implementation in practice are addressed in the proposed system. In our proposed solution, the IoT sensors provide the real-time status of environmental parameters impacting the crop, and the drone platform provide the multispectral data used for generating Vegetation Indices (VIs) such as Normalized Difference vegetation Index (NDVI) for analyzing the crop health. The NDVI provides information about the crop based on the chlorophyll content, which offers limited information regarding the crop health. In order to obtain a rich and detailed knowledge about crop health, the variable length time series data of IoT sensors and multispectral images were converted to a fixed-sized representation to generate crop health maps. A number of machine and deep learning algorithms were applied on the collected data wherein deep neural network with two hidden layers was found to be the most optimal model among all the selected models, providing an accuracy of (98.4%). Further, the health maps were validated through ground surveys and by agriculture experts due to the absence of reference data. The proposed research is basically an indigenous, technology based agriculture solution capable of providing important insights into the crop health by extracting complementary features from multi-modal data set, and minimizing the crop ground survey effort, particularly useful when the agriculture land is large in size. © 2013 IEEE.","crop health; Internet of Things (IoT); NDVI; precision agriculture","Agricultural robots; Crops; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Drones; Health; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Modal analysis; Multilayer neural networks; Remote sensing; Surveys; Vegetation; Chlorophyll contents; Complementary features; Cutting edge technology; Environmental parameter; Internet of Things (IOT); Multi-modal approach; Multispectral images; Normalized difference vegetation index; Internet of things",Article,Scopus

These discrepancies have an economic cost for the company (e.g. waste disposal), as well as an environmental impact (food waste and increased carbon footprint). This research aims to develop tools based on data analytics to predict the magnitude of these discrepancies, improving enterprise profitability while, at the same time, reducing environmental impact aiding food waste management. A food company that produces liquid products based on fruits and vegetables was analyzed. Data was gathered on 1,795 batches, including the characteristics of the product (recipe, components used…) and the difference between the input and the output weight. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were used to predict deviations in production, reducing uncertainties related to the amount of waste produced. The ML models had greater predictive capacity than a linear model with stepwise parameter selection. Then, uncertainty is included in the predictions using a normal distribution based on the residuals of the model. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that ML models can be used as a tool to identify possible production anomalies. This research shows innovative ways to deal with uncertainty in production planning using modern methods in the field of operation research. These tools improve classical methods and provide production managers with valuable information to assess the economic benefits of improved machinery or process controls.

This study is aimed to evaluate the ability of cluster analysis based on Vegetation Indices (VIs) that were obtained from UAVs to predict the spatial variability on agronomic traits of ten winter wheat cultivars. Five VIs groups were identified and the ground truth yield-related data were analyzed for clusters validation. The yield data revealed a value of 6.91 t ha-1 for the first cluster with the highest VIs value and a decrease of -12%, -21%, and -27% for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th clusters; respectively; the 5th cluster; with the lowest VIs value showed the lower yield values (4 t ha-1). Agronomic traits, such as dry biomass, spike numbers, and weight were grouped according to VIs clusters and analyzed and showed the same trends. The analysis of spatial distribution and agronomic data of the ten cultivars within the single clusters highlighted that the most productive varieties showing a greater value of spike weight and numbers and a greater presence of areas with high values of VIs and vice versa the less productive once, though two cultivars showed productions not linked to cluster classification and high data range variability were recorded.

Therefore, alternative options are needed to be developed to mitigate the dangers associated with crop failure due to prevalence of disease and changing weather conditions that causes drought and loss of fertility in arable lands. Furthermore, It is also important to identify commercialisation potential of underutilised crops apart from biophysical and land qualities. The economic and demographic characteristics of an area which is conducive for normal commercial crops can be used to benchmark commercialisation potentials for underutilised crops. Hence, this project aims to assess the commercialisation possibility of underutilised crops on a large scale for under-developed areas with currently no possibility of growing commercial crops probably due to climate, soil characteristics. Support Vector Machine (SVM) method was implemented in conjunction with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and associated fitness functions to generate training data from approximate models which was developed for normal cash crops. The results showed that accurate classifications are obtainable even when the training is done with data from approximate and artificially generated data through implementation of a Genetic algorithm which includes constraints that reflect physical conditions found in rural villages. The simulation results showed that SVM is capable of acting as a filter for the inaccuracy in training data which is inherently present in the approximate models, thus allowing for better classification to be done on training data.

Remotely sensed plant stress indicators, based on the visible and near-infrared spectral regions, provide an alternative to traditional field measurements of plant stress parameters, as this provides information about the spatial and temporal variability of crops and soil. The present study is a proof of concept on the feasibility of using narrow-band hyperspectral derived indices for monitoring water stress in tomato plants (Solanum Lycopersicum L.). Spectral reflectance data were acquired from tomato plants, with five different irrigation regimes namely 100, 80, 60, 40, and 20% of plant available water, in a completely randomized design. Also, plant water stress indicators including canopy temperature (Tc) and relative leaf water content (RWC), as well as volumetric soil moisture content (SMC) were concurrently measured with spectral data acquisition. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index (RDVI), Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI), Photochemical Reflectance Index centered at 570 nm (PRI570), normalized PRI (PRInorm), Water Index (WI), and Normalized Water Index (NWI) were computed from the spectral data. The relationships between canopy reflectance and water stress indicators were analyzed at different water stress levels. The result showed that the PRI centered at 550 nm wavelength (PRI550), WI, OSAVI, and WI/NDVI were the most sensitive indices to distinguish water stress levels in tomato plants.

This study compares the utility of ant colony optimization (ACO), genetic algorithm (GA), and K-means methods to cluster climatic variables affecting the yield of rainfed wheat in northeast Iran from 1984 to 2010 (27 years). These variables included sunshine hours, wind speed, relative humidity, precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and the number of wet days. Seven climatic factors with higher correlations with detrended rainfed wheat yield were selected based on Pearson correlation coefficient significance (P value < 0.1). Three variables (i.e., sunshine hours, wind, and average relative humidity) were excluded for clustering. In the next step based on Pearson correlation (P value < 0.05) between the yield, and the seven climate attributes, fitness function, and silhouette index, only four attributes with higher correlation in its cluster were selected for reclustering. Four climate attributes had an extensive association with yield, so we used four-dimensional clustering to describe the common characteristics of low-, medium-, and high-yielding years, and this is the significance of this research that we have done four-dimensional clustering. The silhouette index showed that the best number of clusters for each station was equal to three clusters. At the last step, reclustering was done through the best-selected method.

The methodology integrated a time series of RS-based vegetation indices (VI) into a simple model based on the water productivity. Thus, the study analyzed if the biophysical parameters deduced from the VI could be used for the quantification of the differences in crop growth and yield assuming that in operative scenarios, the spatial distribution of the factors limiting the crop growth is unknown. The results of the model were analyzed in terms of the absolute values and the within-field variability with respect to space-continuous measurements of yield and biomass data. The variability registered in the fields was quantified as the ratio between actual yield or biomass in any given location and the mean value for the analyzed variable in each field. The good correlation between measured and modelled variability demonstrated the potential of the proposed approach to reproduce variability even under stress conditions. The proposed approach defined differences in crop growth similar to the ground measurements. The additional evidence obtained point to the necessity of considering the individual time-trajectory of each pixel for the assessment of within field variability.

Model performance is assessed according to three coefficients of accuracy, i.e., Bias, Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS), and coefficient of determination (R 2 ). Model performance of SWAT and the modified version of SWAT (i.e., MSWAT; equipped with the physically-based soil temperature module) is also compared in winter and non-winter seasons. Results show that R 2 and NS for different soil depths across 10 stations are all greater than 0.95 and 0.90, respectively, for both SWAT and MSWAT. This indicates that both SWAT and MSWAT reproduce well variations of measured soil temperatures at all soil depths for all stations. The results also show that SWAT and MSWAT tend to underestimate soil temperatures in both winter and non-winter seasons at all soil depths across 10 stations, and MSWAT improves soil temperature simulation by reducing absolute values of Bias, especially at surface soil layers in winter.

Traditional approaches separately evaluate variable performance, which may lead to an inappropriate selection of physics parameterization combinations. Besides traditional approaches, we suggest an additional selection approach by considering the joint dependence structure (covariance structure) between key meteorological variables, i.e., precipitation P and temperature T. This is accomplished by empirical P and T copula functions and the X2-test, and is demonstrated in two locations in Kenya with different major precipitation processes. It is shown that the selection based on traditional approaches alone may lead to nonoptimal decisions in terms of joint dependence structure between P and T. It was found that the copula-based approach may reduce the need for complex multivariate bias correction, as demonstrated using local intensity scaling for P and linear scaling for T.

We obtained real-farm data for this analysis from a biological farming and management company (referred to as bio-farming), and benchmarked this footprint against a conventional farm baseline.

Deep neural networks (DNN) have exhibited superior performance in many classification problems, such as high-dimensional remote sensing data. Detection of wildfires is an imbalanced classification problem where one class contains a much smaller or larger sample size, and performance of DNNs can decline. We take a known weight-selection strategy during DNN training and apply those weights to MODIS variables (e.g., NDVI, surface reflectance) for binary classification (i.e., wildfire or no-wildfire) across Alaska during the 2004 wildfire year, when Alaska experienced a record number of large wildfires. The method splits the input training data into subsets, one for training the DNN to update weights and the other for performance validation to select the weights based on the best validation-loss score. This approach was applied to two sampled datasets, such as where the no-wildfire class can significantly outweigh the wildfire class.

In the second stage, crop productivity of three major crops namely winter wheat, corn, and cotton derived from image classification was modelled spatially and temporally through the CropSyst model. Additionally, the model was also revealed irrigation return flow from the drainage and the related N load. In the last stage, conservation principles and policies were recommended to diminish the detrimental impacts of agricultural fertilizer loads to the biotopes through drainage channels. The model results indicated that crop productivity of wheat, cotton, first crop corn, and second crop corn 21%, 28%, 47%, and 4% of total production in LSP, respectively. The average annual crop production of the wetlands region was 161,548 tons and equal to 16,5% of the total plain area. The largest amount of drainage water comes from cotton and second crop corn cultivation; the smallest amount comes from wheat and first crop corn cultivation. The largest amount of nitrogen remaining within the system was from second-crop corn, whereas, the smallest amount from wheat.

As a result of this reduction fertilizer uptake efficiency will increase and N load to the wetlands will decrease. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Crop yield; CropSyst; Remote sensing; Wetlands","Artificial intelligence; Cotton; Cultivation; Decision support systems; Nitrogen fertilizers; Productivity; Remote sensing; Wetlands; Agricultural landscapes; Agricultural productivity; Conservation Principles; Crop yield; CropSyst; Eastern Mediterranean; Irrigation return flows; Satellite sensor data; Crops; agricultural land; agricultural modeling; crop plant; crop production; crop yield; decision support system; drainage water; fertilizer application; image classification; irrigation; nitrogen; optimization; remote sensing; satellite sensor; wetland; Turkey; Gossypium hirsutum; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

In Sahelian countries, irregular spatial and temporal rainfall distribution remains a threat for rainfed agriculture despite the use of a wide range of techniques for soil conservation. Objectives. To analyze several irrigation strategies for rainfed crops and to assess the likely economic incentives to support the adoption of supplemental irrigation from farm ponds in response to dry spells. Method. The supplemental irrigation strategies and economic incentives were analyzed using an applied bio-economic model in a typical farm. Results. The simulations showed that supplemental irrigation from small individual ponds would increase farmers’ income compared to the situation without irrigation. Maize, sorghum and millet production under supplemental irrigation in a dry year would increase expected income by 26.49% (133,030 CFA francs equivalent to 202.80 euros) compared to the situation without irrigation. Simulations with incentives to promote supplemental irrigation focused on four subsidy modalities and the introduction of a credit system for agricultural households. Conclusions. Of the incentives studied, the food-for-work subsidy to mobilize labor for basin building seems particularly suitable for scaling-up supplemental irrigation. © 2019 FAC UNIV SCIENCES AGRONOMIQUES GEMBLOUX.

To fulfill the demands of rapidly growing population, there is need of healthy products along with better production techniques. Agricultural production is affected by environmental factor such as weather, temperature, etc. Weather affected the crop growth, production, yield, etc. Researchers are trying to develop sustainable system which can be dealt with many challenges of agriculture. At this time, crop modeling technique is very useful in agriculture because these techniques estimate the effect of factors on system, the interaction of the soil–plant–atmosphere system and researcher can also find that which factor is most useful in system. Modeling is a better way of transferring the research knowledge of a system to farmer/ users. The modeling can also be used to evaluate the economic impacts on agricultural land and crop.

The mechanisms of action are complex and interwoven, making it difficult to identify relevant management and adaptation options. The present study uses random forests to investigate such highly non-linear systems for predicting yield anomalies in winter wheat at district levels in Germany. In order to take into account sub-seasonality, monthly features are used that explicitly take soil moisture into account in addition to extreme meteorological events. Clustering is used to show spatially different damage potentials, such as a higher susceptibility to drought damage from May to July in eastern Germany compared to the rest of the country. In addition, relevant heat effects are not detected if the clusters are not sufficiently defined. The variable with the highest importance is soil moisture in March, where higher soil moisture has a detrimental effect on crop yields. In general, soil moisture explains more yield variations than the meteorological variables. The approach has proven to be suitable for explaining historical extreme yield anomalies for years with exceptionally high losses (2003, 2018) and gains (2014) and the spatial distribution of these anomalies. The highest test R-squared (R2) is about 0.68. Furthermore, the sensitivity of yield variations to soil moisture and extreme meteorological conditions, as shown by the visualization of average marginal effects, contributes to the promotion of targeted decision support systems. © 2021 Michael Peichl et al.",,"Crops; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Linear systems; Machine learning; Sensitivity analysis; Agricultural productions; Clusterings; Machine learning methods; Mechanism of action; Non linear system; Non-linear damages; Seasonality; Spectra's; Winter wheat; Winter wheat yields; Soil moisture; assessment method; crop yield; machine learning; soil moisture; soil water; wheat; Germany",Article,Scopus

Abstract: Predicting phenotypes from genetic (G), environmental (E), and management (M) conditions is a long-standing challenge with implications to agriculture, medicine, and conservation. Most methods reduce the factors in a dataset (feature engineering) in a subjective and potentially oversimplified manner. Deep neural networks such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MPL) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can overcome this by allowing the data itself to determine which factors are most important. CNN models were developed for predicting agronomic yield from a combination of replicated trials and historical yield survey data. The results were more accurate than standard methods when tested on held-out G, E, and M data (r = 0.50 vs. r = 0.43), and performed slightly worse than standard methods when only G was held out (r = 0.74 vs. r = 0.80). Pre-training on historical data increased accuracy compared to trial data alone. Saliency map analysis indicated the CNN has “learned” to prioritize many factors of known agricultural importance. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",,"Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Environmental management; Forecasting; Agronomic yields; Feature engineerings; Genomic predictions; Historical data; Management data; Pre-training; Saliency map; Survey data; Multilayer neural networks; crop; data mining; genetics; genomics; growth, development and aging; machine learning; maize; phenotype; procedures; Crops, Agricultural; Data Mining; Genomics; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Phenotype; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Parameter estimation is challenging, especially for time-dependent parameters such as cultivar parameters with 2–3 years of lifespan. Manual calibration of the parameters is time-consuming, requires expertise, and is prone to error. This research develops a new automated framework to estimate time-dependent parameters for crop models using a parallel Bayesian optimization algorithm. This approach integrates the power of optimization and machine learning with prior agronomic knowledge. To test the proposed time-dependent parameter estimation method, we simulated historical yield increase (from 1985 to 2018) in 25 environments in the US Corn Belt with APSIM. Then we compared yield simulation results and nine parameter estimates from our proposed parallel Bayesian framework, with Bayesian optimization and manual calibration. Results indicated that parameters calibrated using the proposed framework achieved an 11.6% reduction in the prediction error over Bayesian optimization and a 52.1% reduction over manual calibration. We also trained nine machine learning models for yield prediction and found that none of them was able to outperform the proposed method in terms of root mean square error and R2. The most significant contribution of the new automated framework for time-dependent parameter estimation is its capability to find close-to-optimal parameters for the crop model. The proposed approach also produced explainable insight into cultivar traits’ trends over 34 years (1985–2018). © 2021, The Author(s).",,"algorithm; article; calibration; crop; cultivar; machine learning; nonhuman; prediction; simulation",Article,Scopus

A new conceptual framework to adopt the ML in OPB will be presented at the end of this paper. At first, data types, phenotype traits, current ML models, and evaluation technique will be identified through a literature survey. This study found that the phenotype and genotype data are widely used in oil palm breeding programs. The average bunch weight, bunch number, and fresh fruit bunch are the most important characteristics that can influence the genetic improvement of progenies. Although machine learning approaches have been applied to increase the productivity of the crop, most studies focus on molecular markers or genotypes for plant breeding, rather than on phenotype. Theoretically, the use of phenotypic data related to offspring should predict high breeding values by using ML.

Appropriate selection of traits and novel methods are required to forecast yield and to identify water stress tolerant wheat genotypes on sodic soils. In this study, we proposed a thermal remote sensing and machine learning-based approach to help predict the biomass and grain yields of wheat genotypes grown with variable water stress in sodic soil environments. We employed unmanned aerial vehicle-based thermal imaging to quantify water stress of 18 contrasting wheat genotypes grown on moderately sodic (MS) and highly sodic (HS) soils in north-eastern grains growing regions of Australia and related these to ground-measured plant biomass and grain yields. We evaluated crop water stress indices; standardized canopy temperature index, crop water stress index, stomatal conductance index, vapour pressure deficit, and crop stress index, which were computed from thermal imagery and on-site agro-meteorological parameters close to flowering. We then employed a classification and regression tree (CRT) as a supervised machine learning algorithm to classify crop water stress and predict biomass and grain yields as a function of crop water stress indices. The CRT accurately predicted biomass yield (coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.86; root mean square error (RMSE) = 41.3 g/m2 and R2 = 0.75; RMSE = 47.7 g/m2 for the MS and HS site) and grain yield (R2 = 0.78; RMSE = 16.7 g/m2 and R2 = 0.69; RMSE = 23.2 g/m2 for the MS and HS site, respectively). High sodic soil constraints increased crop water stress more than moderately sodic constraints soil that limits wheat yield ~40%. Wheat genotypes; Bremer, Gregory, Lancer, Mace, and Mitch were more productive than Gladius, Flanker, Scout, Emu Rock, and Janz in sodic soil environments.

Crop phenotyping may assist in identifying cultivars tolerant to soil sodicity. However, studies to identify the most appropriate traits and reliable tools to assist crop phenotyping on sodic soil are limited. Hence, this study evaluated the ability of multispectral, hyperspectral, 3D point cloud, and machine learning techniques to improve estimation of biomass and grain yield of wheat genotypes grown on a moderately sodic (MS) and highly sodic (HS) soil sites in northeastern Australia. While a number of studies have reported using different remote sensing approaches and crop traits to quantify crop growth, stress, and yield variation, studies are limited using the combination of these techniques including machine learning to improve estimation of genotypic biomass and yield, especially in constrained sodic soil environments. At close to flowering, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and ground-based proximal sensing was used to obtain remote and/or proximal sensing data, while biomass yield and crop heights were also manually measured in the field. Grain yield was machine-harvested at maturity. UAV remote and/or proximal sensing-derived spectral vegetation indices (VIs), such as normalized difference vegetation index, optimized soil adjusted vegetation index, and enhanced vegetation index and crop height were closely corresponded to wheat genotypic biomass and grain yields. UAV multispectral VIs more closely associated with biomass and grain yields compared to proximal sensing data. The red-green-blue (RGB) 3D point cloud technique was effective in determining crop height, which was slightly better correlated with genotypic biomass and grain yield than ground-measured crop height data. These remote sensing-derived crop traits (VIs and crop height) and wheat biomass and grain yields were further simulated using machine learning algorithms (multitarget linear regression, support vector machine regression, Gaussian process regression, and artificial neural network) with different kernels to improve estimation of biomass and grain yield. The artificial neural network predicted biomass yield (R2 = 0.89; RMSE = 34.8 g/m2 for the MS and R2 = 0.82; RMSE = 26.4 g/m2 for the HS site) and grain yield (R2 = 0.88; RMSE = 11.8 g/m2 for the MS and R2 = 0.74; RMSE = 16.1 g/m2 for the HS site) with slightly less error than the others. Wheat genotypes Mitch, Corack, Mace, Trojan, Lancer, and Bremer were identified as more tolerant to sodic soil constraints than Emu Rock, Janz, Flanker, and Gladius. The study improves our ability to select appropriate traits and techniques in accurate estimation of wheat genotypic biomass and grain yields on sodic soils.

Yield is a complex trait and reliant on various related variables called yield components. In this study, the five most important yield component traits in soybean were measured using a panel of 250 genotypes grown in four environments. These traits were the number of nodes per plant (NP), number of non-reproductive nodes per plant (NRNP), number of reproductive nodes per plant (RNP), number of pods per plant (PP), and the ratio of number of pods to number of nodes per plant (P/N). These data were used for predicting the total soybean seed yield using the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Random Forest (RF), machine learning (ML) algorithms, individually and collectively through an ensemble method based on bagging strategy (E-B). The RBF algorithm with highest Coefficient of Determination (R2) value of 0.81 and the lowest Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of 148.61 kg.ha-1, and 185.31 kg.ha-1, respectively, was the most accurate algorithm and, therefore, selected as the meta- Classifier for the E-B algorithm. Using the E-B algorithm, we were able to increase the prediction accuracy by improving the values of R2, MAE, and RMSE by 0.1, 0.24 kg.ha-1, and 0.96 kg.ha-1, respectively. Furthermore, for the first time in this study, we allied the E-B with the genetic algorithm (GA) to model the optimum values of yield components in an ideotype genotype in which the yield is maximized.

Linear regression models based on NG, TGW and yield were fitted on the training dataset and applied to a validation dataset composed of 58 on-field collected samples. It was found that globally TGW and NG presented weak (r = 0.50) and strong (r = 0.92) linear relationships with yield, respectively. In addition to that, applying the fitted models to the validation dataset, model based on NG presented the highest accuracy, coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.70, mean absolute error (MAE) of 639.99 kg ha−1 and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 726.67 kg ha−1. © 2020 by the authors.

Process-based crop models are useful tools to evaluate climate change impacts on crop productivity but are usually limited in modelling the effects of ECEs due to over-simplification or vague description of certain process and uncertainties in parameterization. In this study, we firstly developed a hybrid model by incorporating the APSIM model outputs and growth stage-specific ECEs indicators (i.e. frost, drought and heat stress)into the Random Forest (RF)model, with the multiple linear regression (MLR)model as a benchmark. The results showed that the APSIM + RF hybrid model could explain 81% of the observed yield variations in the New South Wales wheat belt of south-eastern Australia, which had a 33% improvement in modelling accuracy compared to the APSIM model alone and 19% improvement compared to the APSIM + MLR hybrid model. Drought events during the grain-filling and vegetative stages and heat events immediately prior to anthesis were identified as the three most serious ECEs causing yield losses. We then compared the APSIM + RF hybrid model with the APSIM model to estimate the effects of future climate change on wheat yield. It was interesting to find that future yield projected from single APSIM model might have a 1–10% overestimation compared to the APSIM + RF hybrid model. The APSIM + RF hybrid model indicated that we were underestimating the effects of climate change and future yield might be lower than predicted using single APSIM informed modelling due to lack of adequately accounting for ECEs-induced yield losses. Increasing heat events around anthesis and grain-filling periods were identified to be major factors causing yield losses in the future. Therefore, we conclude that including the effects of ECEs on crop yield is necessary to accurately assess climate change impacts. We expect our proposed hybrid-modelling approach can be applied to other regions and crops and offer new insights of the effects of ECEs on crop yield. © 2019","APSIM; Extreme climate events; Hybrid model; Random forest; Wheat yield","agricultural modeling; agricultural practice; agronomy; algorithm; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; drought; extreme event; growth; hybrid; machine learning; wheat; Australia; New South Wales; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

In this chapter, artificial neural network (ANN) model is trained with three neighboring station-based wheat yields to predict the yield for two nearby objective stations that share a common geographic boundary in the agricultural belt of Pakistan. A total of 2700 ANN models (with a combination of hidden neurons, training algorithm, and hidden transfer/output functions) are developed by trial-and-error method, attaining the lowest mean square error, in which the 90 best-ranked models for 3-layered neuronal network are utilized for wheat prediction. Models such as learning algorithms comprised of pure linear, tangent, and logarithmic sigmoid equations in hidden transfer/output functions, executed by Levenberg-Marquardt, scaled conjugate gradient, conjugate gradient with Powell-Beale restarts, Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno quasi-Newton, Fletcher-Reeves update, one-step secant, conjugate gradient with Polak-Ribiére updates, gradient descent with adaptive learning, gradient descent with momentum, and gradient descent with momentum adaptive learning method are trained. For the predicted wheat yield at objective station 1 (i.e., Toba Taik Singh), the optimal architecture was 3-14-1 (input-hidden-output neurons) trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and logarithmic sigmoid as activation and tangent sigmoid as output function, while at objective station 2 (i.e., Bakkar), the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm provided the best architecture (3-20-1) with pure liner as activation and tangent sigmoid as output function. The results are benchmarked with those from minimax probability machine regression (MPMR) and genetic programming (GP) in accordance with statistical analysis of predicted yield based on correlations (r), Willmott’s index (WI), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (EV), root mean-squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). For objective station 1, the ANN model attained the r value of approximately 0.983, with WI ≈ 0.984 and EV ≈ 0.962, while the MPMR model attained r ≈ 0.957, WI ≈ 0.544, and EV ≈ 0.527, with the results attained by GP model, r ≈ 0.982, WI ≈ 0.980, and EV ≈ 0.955. For optimal ANN model, a relatively low value of RMSE ≈ 192.02 kg/ha and MAE ≈ 162.75 kg/ha was registered compared with the MPMR (RMSE ≈ 614.46 kg/ha; MAE ≈ 431.29 kg/ha) and GP model (RMSE ≈ 209.25 kg/ha; MAE ≈ 182.84 kg/ha). For both objective stations, ANN was found to be superior, as confirmed by a larger Legates-McCabe’s (LM) index used in conjunction with relative RMSE and MAE. Accordingly, it is averred that ANN is considered as a useful data-intelligent contrivance for predicting wheat yield by using nearest neighbor yield. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies have focused on investigating the hydrology of shallow drains at discrete locations. However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated the profitability of shallow drains across a wide range of soil and climatic conditions. The main objective of this study was to comparatively evaluate the effects of 75-cm shallow drains versus 125-cm deep drains on profitability and hydrology of subsurface drainage systems across the eastern USA. We conducted DRAINMOD simulations under continuous corn production (Zea mays L.) using 30 years of weather data (1990–2019) for combinations of three factors: two drain depths, four soils, and seven locations. Simulations were optimized for crop production that maximized annual economic return on investment. The results showed that corn yield for shallow drains went from 1.6% increase to –1.3% decrease with increasing growing-season rainfall from northeast to southeast USA. Shallow drains provided the benefit of reduced year-to-year corn yield variability across the region. Corn yield for coarse-textured soil benefited more from shallow drains than fine-textured soil across the region. Even though shallow drains increased annual benefit from higher corn yield under certain soil and weather conditions, they were less profitable than deep drains (lower benefit-cost ratio and higher payback period). The benefit of drainage discharge reduction under shallow drains generally intensified with increasing annual precipitation from northeast to southeast USA. Results were used to develop an empirical equation for estimating the benefit of drainage discharge reduction with shallow drains in the eastern USA. In conclusion, even though shallow drains were less profitable than deep drains, they provide benefits that may be of interest to farmers and policymakers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Corn yield; Drainage discharge; DRAINMOD; Shallow drains; Time for drawdown; Water-table depth","Cost benefit analysis; Crops; Cultivation; Drainage; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Hydrology; Investments; Soils; Textures; Water levels; Corn yields; Discharge reductions; Drain depth; Drainage discharge; DRAINMOD; Shallow drain; Subsurface drainage design; Subsurface drainage system; Time for drawdown; Water table depths; Profitability; crop production; drainage; equation; hydrology; profitability; simulation; subsurface flow; United States; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Aiming at the real-time identification of rice weeds by UAV low-altitude remote sensing, two improved identification models, MobileNetV2-UNet and FFB-BiSeNetV2, were proposed based on the semantic segmentation models U-Net and BiSeNetV2, respectively. The MobileNetV2-UNet model focuses on reducing the amount of calculation of the original model parameters, and the FFB-BiSeNetV2 model focuses on improving the segmentation accuracy of the original model. In this study, we first tested and compared the segmentation accuracy and operating efficiency of the models before and after the improvement on the computer platform, and then transplanted the improved models to the embedded hardware platform Jetson AGX Xavier, and used TensorRT to optimize the model structure to improve the inference speed. Finally, the real-time segmentation effect of the two improved models on rice weeds was further verified through the collected low-altitude remote sensing video data. The results show that on the computer platform, the MobileNetV2-UNet model reduced the amount of network parameters, model size, and floating point calculations by 89.12%, 86.16%, and 92.6%, and the inference speed also increased by 2.77 times, when compared with the U-Net model. The FFB-BiSeNetV2 model improved the segmentation accuracy compared with the BiSeNetV2 model and achieved the highest pixel accuracy and mean Intersection over Union ratio of 93.09% and 80.28%. On the embedded hardware platform, the optimized MobileNetV2-UNet model and FFB-BiSeNetV2 model inferred 45.05 FPS and 40.16 FPS for a single image under the weight accuracy of FP16, respectively, both meeting the performance requirements of real-time identification.

Therefore, the Dubai Emirate began relying on new technology to increase productivity and efficiency. Agriculture applications also depend on accurate land monitoring for timely food security control and support actions. However, traditional monitoring requires field surveys to be performed by experts, which is costly, slow, and rare. Agriculture monitoring systems must be furnished with sustainable land use monitoring solutions, starting with remote sensing using drone surveys for affordable, efficient, and time-sensitive agriculture mapping. Hence, the Dubai Municipality is currently using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to map the farming areas all over the Emirate, support locating lands conducive to cultivation, and create an accurate agriculture database contributing to the decision-making process in determining areas suitable for crop growth. This study used a novel object detection method coupled with geospatial analysis as an integrated workflow to detect individual crops. The UAV flights were executed using a Trimble UX5 (HP) over twelve communities across the Dubai Emirate for six months. Detection methods were applied to high-resolution drone images, consisting of RGB and near-infrared (NIR) bands. Advanced geoprocessing tools were also used to analyze, evaluate, and enhance the results. The performance of detection of the selected deep learning models are discussed (vegetation cover accuracy = 85.4%, F1-scores for date palms and ghaf trees = 96.03% and 94.54% respectively, with respect to visual interpretation ground truth); moreover, sample images from the datasets are used for demonstrations. The main aim is to offer specialists a solution for measuring and assessing living green vegetation cover derived from the processed images that is integrated.

The fruit development stage was classified into immature, breaking, and mature stages with a CNN using images. The immature stage was internally divided into four stages with an MLP, so a total of six stages were classified using the CNN–MLP ensemble model. The plant growth and environmental data and the information from the CNN output were used for the MLP input. The average accuracy of the six stages was F1 score = 0.77 and IoU = 0.86. The ensemble model showed acceptable performance in predicting fruit development stages. The CNN-only model could classify the mature and breaking stages well, but the immature stages were not distinguished, while the MLP-only model could hardly classify the fruit stage except the immature stages.

However, through pass survey analysis, we found that there are no studies comparing the classification performance of ML and DL for the tomato disease classification problem. The performance and outcomes of different traditional ML and DL (a subset of ML) methods may vary depending on the datasets used and the tasks to be solved. This study generally aimed to identify the most suitable ML/DL models for the PlantVillage tomato dataset and the tomato disease classification problem.

An artificial neural network analyst model was advanced based on the information from the well-tested model HYDRUS-2D/3D. Artificial neural network knowledge is reported as an intermittent to physical-based modeling of subsurface water distribution from trickle emitters. Three options are prospected to create input-output functional relations from information created using a numerical model (HYDRUS-2D). Artificial neural networks are a tool for modeling of non-linear systems in various engineering fields. These networks are effective tools for modeling non-linear systems. Each artificial neural network includes an input layer and an output layer between which there are one or some hidden layers. In each layer, there are one or several processing elements or neurons. The neurons of the input layer are independent variables of the understudy issue and the neurons of the output layer are its dependent variables. An artificial neural system, through exerting weight on inputs and by using an activation function, attempts to achieve a desirable output. In this research, in order to calculate the drain spacing in an unsteady state in a region situated in the northeast of Ahwaz, Iran, with different soil properties and drain spacing, the artificial neural networks have been used. The neurons in the input layer were specific yield, hydraulic conductivity, depth of the impermeable layer, and height of the water table in the middle of the interval between the drains in two-time steps. The neurons in the output layer were drain spacing. The network designed in this research included a hidden layer with four neurons. The distance of drains computed via this method had a good agreement with real values and had a high precision in comparison with other methods. This was done for three types of linear activation functions and hyperbolic and sigmoid tangents.

Most studies have only estimated the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity at a regional or national level. This overlooks localized effects at the subnational level, especially within defined agro-ecological regions. Using 30 years (1981–2011) of crop yield and weather data in Zambia, we apply the Just and Pope framework to determine how rainfall and temperature affect yield and yield variability of beans and maize at the national and agro-ecological region levels. At the national level, we find significant negative effect of a rise in temperature on bean and maize yield, while rainfall increases have a positive effect on bean and maize yields. These results differ by agro-ecological region. Rainfall has a positive and significant effect on maize yield in the low rainfall regions I and II, but it has a negative effect on maize yield in the high-rainfall region III and no significant effect on bean yield. Temperature has varied effects by regions and crops. Predicted impacts using HadGEM-ES2 global circulation model show that major yield decreases (25% for maize and 34% for beans) by 2050 will be in region II and will be driven mainly by temperature increase offsetting the positive gains from rainfall increase. The model predominantly overpredicts bean yield and under predicts maize yields. These results call for agro-ecological region-specific adaptation strategies and inventive agricultural policy interventions which are more robust to climate change. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Beans; Climate change; Crop production; Just and Pope model; Maize; Zambia","agricultural ecosystem; agricultural policy; climate change; crop yield; high temperature; maize; policy making; rainfall; Zambia",Article,Scopus

However, research on SIF retrieval using hyperspectral data is performed in narrow spectral windows, assuming that SIF remains constant. In this paper, based on the singular vector decomposition (SVD) technique, we present an approach for retrieving SIF, which can be applied to remotely sensed data with ultra-high spectral resolution and in a broad spectral window without assuming that the SIF remains constant. The idea is to combine the first singular vector, the pivotal information of the non-fluorescence spectrum, with the low-frequency contribution of the atmosphere, plus a linear combination of the remaining singular vectors to express the non-fluorescence spectrum. Subject to instrument settings, the retrieval was performed within a spectral window of approximately 7 nm that contained only Fraunhofer lines. In our retrieval, hyperspectral data of the O2-A band from the first Chinese carbon dioxide observation satellite (TanSat) was used. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was introduced to self-adaptively determine the number of free parameters and reduce retrieval noise. SIF retrievals were compared with TanSat SIF and OCO-2 SIF. The results showed good consistency and rationality. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to verify the performance of this approach. To summarize, the approach would provide more possibilities for retrieving SIF from hyperspectral data. © 2021 by the authors.

The empirical model based on the remotely sensed data provides an efficient approach to predict the rapeseed yield at small scale. The vegetation indices (VIs) derived from the remotely sensed data at the stage of the peak leaf area index (LAI) are usually the main determinant of the empirical model. The LAI of oilseed rape reaches the peak during the flowering stage. However, yellow flowers elevate the reflectance in the red band, making it difficult to capture the maximum LAI with the commonly-used VIs, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This study tested the hypothesis that the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) may be more sensitive to the LAI in the oilseed rape throughout different growth stages, particularly in the flowering stage, and thus may provide more accurate early prediction of the rapeseed yield as well as the above-ground dry mass (DM). In addition, a random forest (RF) regression model based on the multi-stage NIRv was built to predict the rapeseed yield. Three small-plot experiments with different nitrogen and potassium fertilizer treatments were conducted at two sites in Hubei province, China. NIRv and the studied VIs were derived from multi-spectral images captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle. NIRv was calculated with the DN values (NIRv_DN) and the reflectance values (NIRv_refl) of the near-infrared band separately. Results demonstrated that NIRv_DN and NIRv_refl were strongly and consistently correlated with the LAI before the flowering stage and in the flowering stage. In comparison, the relationships between the studied VIs and LAI in the flowering stage deviated from the relationships of all growth stages. The NIRv features and VIs were all significantly correlated with the above-ground DM, but the DM estimation by NIRv_DN had a lower RMSE value. The NIRv_DN and NIRv_refl in the flowering stage showed the strongest correlation with the rapeseed yield (Cali_ R2 = 0.74 and Vali_RMSE = 389.84 kg/ha for NIRv_DN; Cali_ R2 = 0.73 and Vali_RMSE = 410.85 kg/ha for NIRv_refl). The NIRv_DN, NIRv_refl, and the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) in the budding stage were also strongly correlated with the rapeseed yield. The variable importance score derived from the RF model corroborated the significant contribution of the NIRv in the flowering and budding stage to the yield prediction. The RF model using the NIRv_DN in the flowering and budding stage achieved the high accuracy of the rapeseed yield prediction (Cali_ R2 = 0.91, Cali_RMSE = 248.48 kg/ha, and Vali_RMSE = 282.44 kg/ha). Results from this research demonstrated the great potential of the NIRv in the flowering stage to provide the accurate early prediction of the rapeseed yield. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Multi-spectral remote sensing; Near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv); Oilseed rape; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Yield prediction","Antennas; Decision trees; Forestry; Infrared devices; Oilseeds; Potassium; Reflection; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Aerial vehicle; Flowering stage; Leaf Area Index; Multi-spectral remote sensing; Near infra-red reflectances; Near infrared reflectance; Near-infrared reflectance of vegetation; Oil seed rape; Vegetation index; Yield prediction; Forecasting; correlation; herb; image analysis; NDVI; near infrared; numerical model; prediction; remote sensing; seed; spectral reflectance; unmanned vehicle; vegetation index; winter; yield response; China; Hubei; Brassica napus",Article,Scopus

This work considers early forecasting of macadamia nut yield at the individual orchard block level with input variables derived from spatio-temporal datasets including remote sensing, weather and elevation. Yield data from 2012–2019, for 101 blocks belonging to 10 orchards, was obtained. We forecast yield on each test year from 2014–2019 using models trained on data from years prior to the test year. Forecasts are generated in January, for the coming harvest in March–September. A linear model using ridge regularized regression produced consistently good predictions compared with other machine learning algorithms including lasso, support vector regression and random forest. Adding meteorological variables offered little improvement over using only remote sensing variables. The 2019 forecast root mean square error at the block level was 0.8 t/ha, and mean absolute percentage error was 20.9%. When block level predictions were aggregated across the multiple orchards per region, production prediction errors were between 0–15% from 2016–2019. The ridge regression model can be easily implemented in GIS platforms to deliver block-level yield forecast maps to end users. © 2021","Climate; Macadamia; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Statistical models; Yield forecasting","agrometeorology; algorithm; forecasting method; orchard; remote sensing; seasonality; spatiotemporal analysis; support vector machine; yield response; Macadamia",Article,Scopus

Many studies have examined spatial heterogeneity in the regression model, but only limited research has attempted to account for both spatial autocorrelation and temporal variation. In this article, we develop a novel spatiotemporally varying coefficient (STVC) model to understand non-stationary relationships between crop yields and meteorological variables. We compare the proposed model with variant models specialized for time or spatial, namely spatial varying coefficient (SVC) model and temporal varying coefficient (TVC) model. This study was conducted using the county-level corn yield and meteorological data, including seasonal Growing Degree Days (GDD), Killing Degree Days (KDD), Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD), and precipitation (PCPN), from 1981 to 2018 in three Corn Belt states, including Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa. Allowing model coefficients varying in both temporal and spatial dimensions gives the best performance of STVC in simulating the corn yield responses toward various meteorological conditions. The STVC reduced the root-mean-square error to 10.64 Bu/Ac (0.72 Mg/ha) from 15.68 Bu/Ac (1.06 Mg/ha) for TVC and 16.48 Bu/Ac (1.11 Mg/ha) for SVC. Meanwhile, the STVC resulted in a higher R2 of 0.81 compared to 0.56 for SVC and 0.64 for TVC. The STVC showed better performance in handling spatial dependence of corn production, which tends to cluster estimation residuals when counties are close, with the lowest Moran's I of 0.10. Considering the spatiotemporal non-stationarity, the proposed model significantly improves the power of the meteorological data in explaining the variations of corn yields. © 2021","Bayesian hierarchical model; Crop yields; Meteorology; Spatiotemporal analysis; Spatiotemporally varying coefficient","agricultural modeling; crop yield; maize; meteorology; spatiotemporal analysis; United States",Article,Scopus

Typhoon Lekima is among the top five most devastating typhoons in China and caused economic losses totaling over USD 8 billion in Zhejiang Province alone during 9–12 August 2019. However, there still is no assessment of its impacts on forests. Here we detected forest damage and its spatial distribution caused by Typhoon Lekima by classifying Landsat 8 OLI images using the random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm and the univariate image differencing (UID) method on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The accuracy assessment indicated a high overall accuracy (&gt;87%) and kappa coefficient (&gt;0.75) for forest-damage detection, as evaluated against field-investigated plot data, with better performance using the RF method. The total affected forest area by Lekima was 4598.87 km2, accounting for 8.44% of the total forest area in Zhejiang Province. The light-, moderate-and severe-damage forest areas were 2106.29 km2, 2024.26 km2 and 469.76 km2, respectively. Considering the damage severity, the net forest canopy loss fraction was 2.57%. The affected forest area and damage severity exhibited large spatial variations, which were affected by elevation, slope, precipitation and forest type. Our study indicated a larger uncertainty for affected forest area and a smaller uncertainty for the proportion of damage severity, based on multiple assessment approaches. This is among the first studies on forest damage due to typhoons at a regional scale in China, and the methods can be extended to examine the impacts of other super-strong typhoons on forests. Our study results on damage severity, spatial distribution and controlling factors could help local governments, the forest sector and forest landowners make decision on tree-planting planning and sustainable management after typhoon strikes and could also raise public and governmental awareness of typhoons’ damage on China’s inland forests. © 2021 by the authors.

Uncertainties in projections of crop growth may derive from different sources in modelling. The parameter-induced uncertainty is one of the important aspects. Here we calibrated the parameters for rice, wheat and maize combined with observed data of aboveground biomass (AGB) and leaf area index (LAI) at 16 Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN) sites under different rotation systems and subsequently validated the model at these sites using the data independent of calibration. The results showed that the simulated AGB and LAI exhibited good agreement with the observations. The model performance for rice and maize was better than that for wheat. The statistical analysis of model performance showed that the RMSE (root mean square error), RMD (relative mean deviation) and EF (model efficiency) were 32.52%, − 0.95% and 0.87 of the means, respectively. The three components of the modelling uncertainty, bias of mean (UM), bias of slope (UR) and random residue (UE) accounted 0.1%, 0.9% and 99% of the total errors, respectively. The main contributor to the error was the random disturbances, indicating that the parameters calibration in this study had reached relatively reasonable conditions on the whole. Although the model displayed an overall good prediction in crops AGBs and LAI, there were still notable bias at some sites due to non-random errors (UM and UR). This indicated that there were still uncertainties in the modelling procedure, e.g. the model mechanism or parameterization. The uncertainty of the simulated results may greatly restrict the application of a model. To effectively and reasonably apply a model, it is necessary to evaluate and analyse the main sources of uncertainty in the simulated results. The parameter-induced uncertainty analysis in this study showed that, at the site scale, the range of uncertainty brought by the changes in three parameters (SLA, PL and α) to the modelling results (95% CI) of Agro-C covered more than 90% of the observations and brought approximately 21% uncertainty to the simulated AGBs of the three major crops. © 2021, ISB.","Aboveground biomass; Agro-C model; Parameterization; Uncertainty analysis","crop; ecosystem; maize; reproducibility; uncertainty; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Reproducibility of Results; Uncertainty; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

To accomplish this goal, numerous areas are required for Napier grass plantations. Before introducing crops, the land potential of the country and the impact of crops on the environment should be assessed. The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model is very useful in investigating crop impacts and land potential. Unfortunately, the crop growth parameters of Napier grass are yet to be identified and, thus, conducting effective analysis has not been possible. Accordingly, in this study, parameter calibration and SWAT model validation of Napier grass production in Thailand was carried out using datasets from eight sites with 93 samples. Parameter sensitivity analysis was performed prior to parameter calibration, the results of which suggest that the radiation use efficiency and potential harvested index are both highly sensitive. The crop growth parameters were calibrated in order of their sensitivity index ranking, and the final values were obtained by reducing the root mean square error from 10.77 to 1.38 t·ha−1 . The validation provides satisfactory results with coefficient of determination of 0.951 and a mean error of 0.321 t·ha−1 . Using the developed model and calibrated parameters, local Napier grass dry matter yield can be evaluated accurately. The results reveal that, if only abandoned area in Thailand is used, then Napier grass can provide roughly 33,600–44,900 GWh of annual electricity, and power plant carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions can be reduced by approximately 21.2–28.3 Mt-CO2 . The spatial distribution of estimated yield obtained in this work can be further utilized for land suitability analysis to help identify locations for Napier grass plantations, anaerobic digesters, and biogas power plants. © 2021 by the authors.

However, intercropping productivity has failed to meet expectations in many agroforestry systems as tree aged. Therefore, this study invested why this occurred. We chose walnut (Juglans regia L. Wen-185) tree-based agroforestry systems to investigate the influence of walnut tree shade intensity on the grain yield and quality of intercropped wheat (Triticum aestivum). This replicated study was conducted in Southern Xinjiang China in 2011 and 2012. Walnut tree canopy reduced understory photosynthetically active radiation, decreased photosynthetic rates of intercropped wheat, decreased grain yield, spike number, grains per spike, and thousand-grain weight. However, grain protein and wet gluten contents were improved. Significant negative linear correlations were detected between grain yield and N content with walnut tree age, but significant positive correlations were found between protein and wet gluten contents with walnut tree age. Protein and wet gluten contents were negatively correlated with grain yield, and with thousand-grain weight. In conclusion, although grain yield was significantly decreased, grain quality was enhanced in walnut tree-based agroforestry systems.

Two tomato varieties, HeZuo 903 and WanShiRuYi, were used in protected cultivation for two seasons. Three water treatments were conducted (normal watering, no watering during the first fruit-swelling period, and no watering during the both fruit-swelling periods). The visible near-infrared reflection spectra of the tomato canopies were collected during the fruiting period. Three spectral datasets were used, including the original reflection spectra, the first derivative of the reflection spectra, and the absorbance spectra. The successive projections algorithm(SPA) was used to select data from six wavebands (483, 557, 674, 783, 869, and 964 nm) as optimal wavebands. The cloud computing platform was built using the Hadoop and Spark frameworks. The MLlib machine-learning library from the Spark framework was used to build a multilayer perceptron classifier (MLPC) and one-vs.-rest classifier (ORC). These multi-class classifiers were applied to the spectral datasets (original, first derivative, and absorbance) for the two tomato varieties under different water treatments. For each classifier, 70% of the data was randomly selected for training and the remaining 30% was used for prediction. Training and prediction were conducted on the cloud computing platform. The MLPC had better classification accuracy than the ORC. Among the three spectral datasets, the first derivative of the spectra had the best classification performance, while the reflection and absorbance spectra had similar performances. Using the full waveband spectrum provided higher classification accuracy than using only the optimal wavebands. Furthermore, the tomato canopy spectrum classification performance was better for the WanShiRuYi plants than the HeZuo 903 plants. Moreover, the collected spectral dataset was increased in size to evaluate the operating efficiency of the cloud computing platform when processing ‘big data.’ The operating efficiency was significantly improved by increasing the size of the spectral dataset or the number of nodes in the platform. Finally, the python and TensorFlow were used to implement the CNN algorithm, and conducted classification and analysis of the spectral datasets. The results showed that the MLPC and ORC algorithm had better classification performance than the CNN algorithm in classification of spectral data. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud computing; Greenhouse tomato; Machine learning; Visible-near infrared spectroscopy; Water stress","Cloud computing; Efficiency; Fruits; Infrared devices; Large dataset; Multilayer neural networks; Near infrared spectroscopy; Plants (botany); Classification accuracy; Classification performance; Cloud computing platforms; Cloud computing technologies; Multi-class classifier; Multi-layer perceptron classifiers; Successive projections algorithms (SPA); Visible near-infrared spectrum; Classification (of information); absorbance; classification; computer simulation; cultivation; dicotyledon; fruit; optimization; performance assessment; visible spectrum; water stress; water treatment; Lycopersicon esculentum",Article,Scopus

One of the strategies for managing saline water consumption is by using simulator models that can help in understanding the physiological response of crops. In this study the number of germinated seeds, shoot fresh weight and plant leaf area index as three of the main parameters of the vegetative stage of maize plants were investigated. In order to quantify the effect of different salinities on vegetative growth parameters, the macroscopic models of Homaee et al., Dirksen et al., van Genuchten and Hoffman and Maas and Hoffman were tested. The fitting of different models to measured data of germinated seeds showed that the Maas and Hoffman model was superior over the other three models with r and NSE values of 0.87 and 0.79, respectively. Similarly, the model of Homaee et al. with the values of r = 0.98 and NSE = 0.89 was the best model for the maize fresh weight variable.

Soil data analysis is usually related to practice in agricultural production management or discovery in agro-ecosystem process, so it is not easy to obtain labeled data that requires human intervention, and it is also not realistic to set specified pattern in advance. It is desirable to review the research work on soil data analysis using spatial clustering techniques in context of agricultural applications, which is the object of this survey. Soil properties (including physical, chemical, and biological properties) and the characteristics of the spatial soil data are first introduced. Spatial clustering techniques are then summarized in five different categories. Soil data analysis using spatial clustering is reviewed in four categories of agricultural applications: agricultural production management zoning, comprehensive assessment of soil and land, soil and land classification, and correlation study for agro-ecosystem. The traditional clustering algorithms generally work well, and prototype-based clustering methods are more preferred in practice. Some machine learning models can be further introduced into the spatial clustering algorithms for better accommodation to various characteristics of soil dataset. © 2021 IEEE.","agricultural application; data mining; soil data analysis; spatial clustering","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Chemical analysis; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Ecosystems; Industrial management; Learning systems; Soils; Spatial variables measurement; Unsupervised learning; Agricultural production management; Biological properties; Comprehensive assessment; Correlation studies; Machine learning models; Prototype-based clustering; Traditional clustering; Unsupervised learning method; Cluster analysis",Conference Paper,Scopus

Accurate evaluation of weed density is of great significance for field management, especially precision weeding. In this paper, a weed density calculating and mapping method in the field is proposed. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to capture field images. The excess green minus excess red index, combined with the minimum error threshold segmentation method, was used to segment green plants and bare land. A modified U-net was used to segment crops from images. After removing the bare land and crops from the field, images of weeds were obtained. The weed density was evaluated by the ratio of weed area to total area on the segmented image. The accuracy of the green plant segmentation was 93.5%. In terms of crop segmentation, the intersection over union (IoU) was 93.40%, and the segmentation time of a single image was 35.90 ms. Finally, the determination coefficient of the UAV evaluated weed density and the manually observed weed density was 0.94, and the root mean square error was 0.03.

The study area is located in the Little Hungarian Plain, including the former swamp basins of Hanság and Tóköz in Hungary. The vegetation survey data were evaluated by statistical methods (TWINSPAN method), and vegetation maps of the areas were prepared. Topsoil samples near the relevés were gathered for further laboratory tests. Soil profiles were opened by a Pürckhauer soil sampler for on-site description of the soil horizons and classification. Surface models provided a base for the preparation of contour maps that could be compared with the vegetation pattern. We found that of the two dominant vegetation types, mesotrophic wet meadows were associated with Mollic Gleysols, while non-tussock sedge beds were associated with Histic Gleysols. At the transitions of the two soil classes, the subgroup of non-tussock sedge beds is the dominant type. The soil class only determined the plant association on a habitat level, but it could not reason the fine pattern of the plant communities on the same soil class. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed to investigate the relationship between the distribution of dominant species and soil parameters. Several soil parameters combined have a significant effect on the distribution of dominant species. In conclusion, we found that the formation of association types strongly depends on the soil characteristics of the area, and that it is closely related to it. However, in the formation of the fine mosaic pattern, the driving ecological factors are the microrelief and the length of the saturated or flooded soil conditions. © 2021 Sciendo.

The current trend can generate favorable conditions for pests, plant diseases and changes in the interaction between pests, natural enemies and hosts. Early blight and late blight are fungal diseases produced by Alternaria and Phytophthora infestans, respectively. Both diseases cause significant economic losses every year in the Northwest Spanish potato sector. This chapter includes an analysis of interannual and seasonal evolution of meteorological parameters and the relationships with fungal pathogen levels. The aim was to evaluate the impact of climate change on these potato diseases in A Limia region. The results showed an increasing trend in temperature and a decrease in the number of rainy days, with more pronounced episodes last years. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the development of both fungal potato pathogens is strongly temperature dependent. The high Alternaria levels were accompanied by high temperatures and low mean relative humidity. The highest P. infestans levels were favored by low temperature, but high mean relative humidity and rain. Considering the daily weather data and the daily levels of airborne pathogens from the days before, it was possible to estimate the concentration of Alternaria and P. infestans with acceptable results. With the current climate forecasting for Spain, a greater intensity of the Alternaria and P. infestans epidemics is expected in potato crops. Therefore, the study and control of both epidemics can be a great challenge for the sustainable management of potato crop in the present and near future. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Climate change; Early blight; Late blight; Potato; Sustainable management",,Book Chapter,Scopus

The primary motivation for this work is one such problem; the efficient management of invasive species - invading flora and fauna that are estimated to cause damages in the billions of dollars annually. As an ongoing collaboration with the New York Natural Heritage Program, we consider the use of unsupervised deep learning techniques for dimensionality reduction of remote sensing images, which can reduce sample complexity for downstream tasks and decreases the need for large labeled data sets. We consider spatially augmenting contrastive learning by training neural networks to correctly classify two nearby patches of a landscape as such. We demonstrate that this approach improves upon previous methods and naive classification for a large-scale data set of remote sensing images derived from invasive species observations obtained over 30 years. Additionally, we simulate deployment in the field via active learning and evaluate this method on another important challenge in computational sustainability - landcover classification - and again find that it outperforms previous baselines.

Huanglongbing disease is a major bottleneck in the export of citrus fruits from Pakistan. It is being responsible for huge citrus economic losses globally. In the current study, several prediction models were developed based on regression algorithms of machine learning to monitor different phenological stages of Asian citrus psyllid to predict its population about different abiotic variables (average maximum temperature, average minimum temperature, average weekly temperature, average weekly relative humidity, and average weekly rainfall) and biotic variable (host plant phenological patterns) in citrus-growing regions of Pakistan. The pest prediction models can be used for proper applications of pesticides only when needed for reducing the environmental and cost impacts of pesticides. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to find the relationship between different predictor (abiotic and biotic) variables and pest infestation rate on citrus plants. Multiple linear regression, random forest regressor, and deep neural network approaches were compared to predict population dynamics of Asian citrus psyllid.

The proposed framework addresses the gaps in policymaking, the role of all stakeholders, and uses historical data of crop production in different sectors of land in optimizing the profits that shall meet the defined constraints including national requirement, and export demand of different crops. There are many agro-economy-based countries where agriculture is the main contributor to their GDP, while there are others who always struggle to meet their national need while optimizing the agro-economy component of their earnings. Crops are not always produced with keeping the demand and production balance. Rather, the crops are mostly produced according to the farmer's ease and last year's prices for profit maximization leading to excessive production of one type of crop, lowering of profit margins, and shortage of some key crops for national need. This paper presents a decision aiding tool that can be used for farmer's awareness for crop production planning that meets the national and export needs while maximizing farmer's earnings. The model is tested on historical data of different segments of cultivated lands in Pakistan for validation, with the first experiment performed on single farmland with multi-fields while the second performed for multi-locations and multi-fields. The results are promising and provide estimates of net profit, expected production against the demand for each crop, and analysis that aids in crop planning, before and after the application of our model while meeting all necessary constraints. © 2013 IEEE.","Agriculture; Decision making; Decision support systems; Intelligent systems; Linear programming; Optimization; Planning; Prediction methods; Yield estimation","Cultivation; Decision making; Decision support systems; Intelligent systems; Linear programming; Planning; Production control; Profitability; Crop production; Decision support framework; Decisions makings; Historical data; Linear-programming; Multi-field; Optimisations; Prediction methods; Production Planning; Yield estimation; Crops",Article,Scopus

One can highlight the following features of the search: spell check (if the search query is misspelt, the search for relevance will try to find close matches based on what was entered); recognition of standard abbreviations and acronyms (this search will be able to recognize standard abbreviations or acronyms, such as MK (Michael Kors), NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration)); better understanding (a search for relevance will try to understand the query better, applying well-known knowledge, recognizing frequently used synonyms and limited knowledge of the natural language); filters and sorting (the use of filters by specific categories and sorting will allow to more comfortably and quickly find the necessary information).

Field experiments were conducted in 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons in south eastern Nigeria to evaluate the effect of 2–3 years old Allanblackia floribunda alley systems on soil chemical properties and growth and yield of maize and mungbean. The experimental design was a factorial arranged in a randomized complete block design (RCBD). Standard labouratory procedures were used for the soil chemical properties while data on growth and yield were collected for maize and mungbean. All the data collected in the experiments were subjected to analysis of variance using GenStat Release 12.1. Before the commencement of first year double cropping and after two years of cropping, soil samples were collected from the respective plots and analysed for soil chemical properties. The maize experiment had two maize spatial arrangements grown between the tree alleys and in monocrop plots. After the harvest of maize, mungbean was introduced at two plant spacings of 30 × 20 cm and 20 × 20 cm. Soil phosphorus was significantly increased in Allanblackia tree alley than in the control by 55.6%. Soil pH, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and calcium increased significantly with tree age. Maize under sole cropping intercepted higher photosynthetically active radiation than maize under alley cropping. Double row maize in both cropping systems produced taller plants in 2017 and greater leaf area index in both years than single row maize at 10 and 12 weeks after planting (WAP). Alley cropping with Allanblackia floribunda tree significantly reduced maize seed yield relative to double row maize in sole cropping. The wider spacing of 30 × 20 cm of mungbean significantly reduced average seed yield in alley cropping but increased number of pods per plant in the monocrop in 2017. In contrast, the 20 × 20 cm mungbean spacing in alley cropping produced comparable high seed yield as sole cropping in either of the two spacings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Allanblackia; Alley cropping; Maize; Mungbean; Seed yield",,Article,Scopus

Since plants integrate their genetics, surrounding environments, and management conditions, crop phenotypes have been measured over cropping seasons to represent the traits of varieties. These days, UAS (unmanned aircraft system) provides a new opportunity to collect high-quality images and generate reliable phenotypic data efficiently. Here, we propose high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) from multitemporal UAS images for tomato yield estimation. UAS-based RGB and multispectral images were collected weekly and biweekly, respectively. The shape of the features of tomatoes such as canopy cover, canopy, volume, and vegetation indices derived from UAS imagery was estimated throughout the entire season. To extract time-series features from UAS-based phenotypic data, crop growth and growth rate curves were fitted using mathematical curves and first derivative equations. Time-series features such as the maximum growth rate, day at a specific event, and duration were extracted from the fitted curves of different phenotypes. The linear regression model produced high R2 values even with different variable selection methods: all variables (0.79), forward selection (0.7), and backward selection (0.77). With factor analysis, we figured out two significant factors, growth speed and timing, related to high-yield varieties. Then, five time-series phenotypes were selected for yield prediction models explaining 65 percent of the variance in the actual harvest. The phenotypic features derived from RGB images played more important roles in prediction yield. This research also demonstrates that it is possible to select lower-performing tomato varieties successfully.

The Marmara region is an important region located in the northwest of Turkey. The impact of economic, environmental, and social dimensions in the region is high. For this reason, the Marmara region is in a situation that can be affected more by climate change and drought. Precipitation forecasting is the first step for the management of agricultural planning, flood controls, and use of drinking water resources. Time series analysis is an important statistics tool that allows forecasting the amount of future precipitation based on the historical data analysis. Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models are the most common statistical methods used to estimate precipitation based on time series. The ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA models are based on the assumption that past conditions will remain the same in the future. In this study, precipitation for the 9 cities in Turkey’s Marmara region is examined based on the 51-year (1969–2019) historical data and the ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA models are used to predict the precipitation in the next 60 months (up to 2024). While determining the model, the lowest AIC (Akaike information criterion) and AICc (corrected Akaike information criterion) are preferred and, generally, the AICc value is used to select the prediction model. After, the forecast measure errors of the models are checked with mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute scaled error (MASE) indicators. Finally, the ARIMA model is chosen as the most suitable model with the lowest estimation error. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Forecasting; Marmara region; Precipitation; Time series; Turkey",,Article,Scopus

This paper examines multiple-year maize grain yield maps (2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018) and their spatial and temporal variability of within-field datasets (soil electrical conductivity [EC], soil organic matter [OM], and elevation) and climate data. The research was undertaken on a non-irrigated field at New Zealand’s Foundation for Arable Research (FAR) in the Waikato region, to provide a simple, heuristic method to delineate dynamic MZs for crop inputs. Supervised statistical learning models (stepwise multiple linear regression [SMLR], feedforward neural network (FFNN), classification and regression tree (CART), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and Cubist regression) were implemented to predict spatial yield. Prediction accuracies of the trained models were evaluated by withholding one subset of data for testing.

Various regression models using crop N nutrition parameters and image indices have been suggested, but their accuracy and generalization performance for N estimation have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this study, a commercial digital camera was used to capture rice canopy RGB images in a 2-year field experiment, and three regression methods (simple nonlinear regression, SNR; backpropagation neural network, BPNN; and random forest regression, RF) were used for rice shoot dry matter (DM), N accumulation (NA), and leaf area index (LAI) estimation. A repeated random subsampling validation method was performed 1000 times on all three regression methods for the evaluation of model performance and stability. The RF regression models had the highest accuracy for the validation dataset, with average testing prediction accuracy (ATPA) of 80.17%, 79.44%, and 81.82% for DM, LAI, and NA estimation, respectively, followed by BPNN and SNR models. According to the distribution of ATPA in 1000-time calculations, the highest standard deviation (SD) and interval range (5%–95%) of ATPA was observed in BPNN models, which indicated that the BPNN model was most susceptible to dataset splitting. The lower SD and interval range of ATPA were followed by RF and SNR models, which indicated that the RF and SNR models were less affected by dataset splitting and were able to produce robust regression models consistently. In conclusion, the ensemble algorithm of the RF model effectively prevents overfitting when dealing with different dataset segmentations; thus, the RF model has strong generalization performance.

Given the recent commercialization of low-cost multispectral cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles and advances in machine learning techniques, prediction systems for crop characteristics can be more precisely developed using machine learning techniques. Therefore, the model performances for predicting wheat grain yield and protein content between the machine learning algorithms based on spectral reflectance and plant height (e.g. random forest and artificial neural network) and the traditional linear regression based on vegetation indices were compared. Although the machine learning approaches based on reflectance could not improve the grain yield prediction accuracy, they have great potential for development in predicting protein content. The linear regression model based on a 2-band enhanced vegetation index was capable of predicting the yield with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 972 kg ha−1. The random forest model based on reflectance was capable of predicting the protein content with an RMSE of 1.07%. The reflectance may have been linearly correlated with total biomass; thus, it was also linearly correlated with grain yield. There was a nonlinear relationship between the grain yield and protein content, which may have resulted in the higher model performance of the machine learning approaches in predicting protein content. However, this relationship would be variable according to the environment and agronomic practice. Further, field-scale research is required to assess how this relationship can be varied and affect the model generality, particularly when predicting protein content. © 2020 The Author(s).

This work provides a comparative analysis through the model implementation of the two renowned machine learning models, the support vector machine (SVM) and deep learning (DL), for plant disease detection using leaf image data. Until recently, most of these image processing techniques had been, and some still are, exploiting what some considered as ""shallow"" machine learning architectures. The DL network is fast becoming the benchmark for research in the field of image recognition and pattern analysis. Regardless, there is a lack of studies concerning its application in plant leaves disease detection. Thus, both models have been implemented in this research on a large plant leaf disease image dataset using standard settings and in consideration of the three crucial factors of architecture, computational power, and amount of training data to compare the duos. Results obtained indicated scenarios by which each model best performs in this context, and within a particular domain of factors suggests improvements and which model would be more preferred.

These practices which are based on the site-specific or variety-specific treatment of an orchard include applications like remote recognition of tree species, variety-specific orchard agrochemical applications, orchard yield mapping, robotic fruit picking, fruit tree disease treatment, etc. For this purpose, in the current work a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed and optimized for fruit recognition based on RGB images. The images from six classes of on-branch fruits i.e. green apples, nectarine, apricot, peach, sour cherry, and amber-colored plums were captured from local orchards at Semnan province, Iran. To avoid over-fitting, the dataset was then augmented to create more training data from existing samples. The model consisted of multiple convolutional, max-pooling, Global Average Pooling (GAP), and fully connected layers. Using GAP instead of the Flatten layer improved the performance of the model by increasing the accuracy as well as significantly reducing the trainable parameters (about 65 times reduction). The optimization phase of the model development was performed by testing four optimizers (RMSprop, SGD, Adam, and Nadam) with three batch sizes (16, 32, and 64) each with 50 epochs. Accordingly, Nadam optimizer with batch size = 32 demonstrated the best results. The best configuration achieved the accuracy of 99.8% and the cross-entropy loss of 0.019 for the test dataset. This result shows that the model is well developed and has good generalization. This reflects the potential of the method for the remote recognition and classification of different varieties of fruits in an orchard regardless of the environmental effects like complex background, variable light, overlaps, and occlusions with other plant parts, etc. The proposed network was also compared with popular structures like VGG11, ResNet50, ResNet152, and YOLOv3. The processing time of this model was about 8 ms per image while it was 351 ms for ResNet152, proving that the proposed network is much better for real-time applications. Consequently, this study presents a robust method for fulfilling the requirements of a PH practice in a high-tech horticulture system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Classification; Deep CNN; Fruit recognition; Global average pooling; Precision horticulture","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Forestry; Fruits; Orchards; Statistical tests; Agrochemical application; Complex background; Disease treatment; Fruit recognition; Model development; Processing time; Real-time application; Robotic fruit pickings; Mapping",Article,Scopus

Rural landscapes are of vital importance for ecosystem productivity, ecosystem services, and biological diversity to continue sustainably. The purpose of this paper was to detect LUCC and its effects on landscape ecology through landscape metrics in the Eastern Mediterranean of Turkey. In this study, a hybrid classification approach was used to classify the Land-Use/Cover (LUC) and detailed forest tree diversity considering topography, plant density, and satellite waveband reflectance values. To this extent, detailed LUC classification, LUCC analyses from 2003 to 2014, habitat quality differences by generating landscape metrics in two levels are called landscape and class-level metrics were carried out in the study area. Habitat quality evaluation on forest formation scale using a hybrid classification approach provided a great advantage and made it possible to examine the landscape metrics of the plant types within the scope of temporal change. The study method was implemented in seven stages including: (1) classification of forest–no forestlands with the K-Means algorithm, (2) creating a data set of reflected signals over stand types, (3) determining the rules and thresholds of decision tree algorithm, (4) object-based classification of agricultural, rocky, and settlement areas, (5) obtaining the land-cover maps for 2003 and 2014, (6) post-classification change detection analyses, and (7) assessing the habitat quality via landscape metrics.

This study hypothesized that canopy reflectance (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) measured at tillering (Feekes 2–3) and expressed as a sufficiency index (SI), can estimate the likelihood of a site-specific response to in-season N fertilizer in malting barley. Canopy reflectance was measured from plots at tillering with a GreenSeeker and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) borne multispectral cameras in trials across heterogeneous California agroecosystems. Field experiments included a range of N fertilizer application rates (0–168 kg N ha−1) and timings (pre-plant, tillering, or evenly split), and resulted in a range of crop N sufficiency/deficiency. NDVI-based SI measurements were categorized into one of three quantitative categories (low, medium, and high) without additional experimental context using Gaussian mixture modeling. Despite that 85% of variation in protein yield was due to site-year, the reflectance-based categories indicated whether N fertilizer applied in-season would increase protein yield (p &lt;.01). Nitrogen application at tillering increased yield and protein for plots in the “low” and “medium” SI categories (45 and 4% for yield and 16 and 12% for protein, respectively) (p &lt;.05), while “high” SI plots had neither yield (p =.23) nor protein (p =.26) increases.

Closing these gaps requires quantifying them, identifying major factors constraining the attainable yield and gross margins, and developing mitigation measures. Past literature predominantly focused only on quantification of yield gaps, using yields from experimental stations as the potentially attainable yields. This body of literature overlooked the gaps in gross margins, and more importantly, factors responsible for these gaps – thereby failing to provide sufficient policy guidance to increase productivity. We used a random sample of 2296 fields in 21 major wheat-growing provinces of Morocco as a case study to carry analysis of both yield and gross margin gaps. We used the random forest model to identify factors responsible for variations in yield and gross margins. Our results show that average yield in rainfed areas was 0.9 t ha−1 with yield and gross margin gaps of 41% and 75%, respectively. In irrigated areas, average yield stands at 4.0 t ha−1 with yield and gross margin gaps of 29% and 34%, respectively – indicating that there is substantial scope for increasing yields and gross margins in both environments. In the rainfed environment, tillage method was the most important variable in determining yield, followed by quantity of phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizer, seed quality, and type of preceding crop. In the irrigated environment, preceding crop was the most important variable in explaining yield gap, followed by variety, seed quality, and quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers. Grain yield and grain price were the most important variables explaining gross margins. Top performer farmers in both environments had applied higher quantities of inputs and hence incurred higher costs but still had higher nitrogen and phosphorus use efficiencies and higher gross margins than the rest as the yield gains more-than offset the increases in costs. Policy and institutional implications of these results are: 1) The irrigated environments should be targeted with efforts and incentives to motivate wider adoption of legume-based rotations; 2) Incentive mechanisms should be created to encourage farmers in the rainfed environments to adopt no-tillage, use more phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizers, and buy certified seeds; 3) Legume-based rotations reduce need for nitrogen and enhance phosphorus use efficiency in subsequent crop, targeting rainfed environments also with rotation can be used as a strategy to enhance sustainability of the production system and reducing financial burden of higher doses of chemical inputs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Gross margin gap; Improved agronomic practices; Machine learning; Morocco; Random forest; Yield gap","agricultural intensification; alternative agriculture; crop yield; fertilizer application; food security; Mediterranean environment; nutrient use efficiency; rainfed agriculture; wheat; Morocco; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Prevailing weather conditions during the crop growth period determine the yield of sorghum. Hence, the crop yield forecasting models based on weather parameters will be an appropriate option for policymakers and researchers to develop sustainable cropping strategies. In the present study, six multivariate weather‐based models viz., least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), elastic net (ENET), principal component analysis (PCA) in combination with stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), artificial neural network (ANN) alone and in combination with PCA and ridge regression model are examined by fixing 90% of the data for calibration and remaining dataset for validation to forecast rabi sorghum yield for different districts of Karnataka. The R2 and root mean square error (RMSE) during calibration ranged between 0.42 to 0.98 and 30.48 to 304.17 kg ha−1, respectively, without actual evapotranspiration (AET) whereas, these evaluation parameters varied from 0.38 to 0.99 and 19.84 to 308.79 kg ha−1, respectively with AET inclusion. During validation, the RMSE and nRMSE (normalized root mean square error) varied between 88.99 to 1265.03 kg ha−1 and 4.49 to 96.84%, respectively without AET and including AET as one of the weather variable RMSE and nRMSE were 63.48 to 1172.01 kg ha−1 and 4.16 to 92.56%, respectively. The performance of six multivariate models revealed that LASSO was the best model followed by ENET compared to PCA_SMLR, ANN, PCA_ANN and ridge regression models because of reduced overfitting through penalisation of regression coefficient. Thus, it can be concluded that LASSO and ENET weather‐based models can be effectively utilized for the district level forecast of sorghum yield. © 2020 by the authors.

Tea yield, however, has stagnated in recent years, due to changes in temperature, precipitation, the age of the tea bushes, and diseases. Developing an approach for monitoring tea bushes by remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) might be a way to alleviate this problem. Using multi-temporal remote sensing data, the paper details an investigation of the changes in tea health and yield forecasting through the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In this study, we used NDVI as a support tool to demonstrate the temporal and spatial changes in NDVI through the extract tea NDVI value and calculate the mean NDVI value. The results of the study showed that the minimum NDVI value was 0.42 during January 2013 and February 2015 and 2016. The maximum NDVI value was in August 2015 and June 2017. We indicate that the linear relationship between NDVI value and mean temperature was strong with R2 = 0.79 Our results confirm that the combination of meteorological data and NDVI data can achieve a high performance of yield prediction. Three models to predict tea yield were conducted: support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and the traditional linear regression model (TLRM). For period 2009 to 2018, the prediction tea yield by the RF model was the best with a R2 = 0.73, by SVM it was 0.66, and 0.57 with the TLRM. Three evaluation indicators were used to consider accuracy: the coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and percentage error of tea yield (PETY). The highest accuracy for the three models was in 2015 with a R2 ≥ 0.87, RMSE &lt; 50 kg/ha, and PETY less 3% error. In the other years, the prediction accuracy was higher in the SVM and RF models. Meanwhile, the RF algorithm was better than PETY (≤10%) and the root mean square error for this algorithm was significantly less (≤80 kg/ha).

To estimate potato (Solanum tubersum L.) yield over Mexico at a municipal level, we used meteorological data provided by the ERA5 (ECMWF Re-Analysis) dataset developed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service, satellite imagery from the TERRA platform, and field information. Five different machine learning algorithms were used to build the models: Random forest (rf), support vector machine linear (svmL), support vector machine polynomial (svmP), support vector machine radial (svmR), and general linear model (glm). The optimized models were tested using independent data (2017 and 2018) not used in the training and optimization phase (2004-2016). In terms of percent root mean squared error (%RMSE), the best results were obtained by the rf algorithm in the winter cycle using variables from the first three months of the cycle (R2 = 0.757 and %RMSE = 18.9). For the summer cycle, the best performing model was the svmP which used the first five months of the cycle as variables (R2 = 0.858 and %RMSE = 14.9). Our results indicated that adding predictor variables of the last two months before the harvest did not significantly improved model performances. These results demonstrate that our models can predict potato yield by analyzing the yield of the previous year, the general conditions of NDVI, meteorology, and information related to the irrigation system at a municipal level. © 2020 by the authors.","Machine learning; Meteorological data; Municipal level; Potato yield; Satellite imagery",,Article,Scopus

Moreover, the prediction of crop growth stages is related to the scheduling of planting and tillage, the determination of machine harvest time, and the prediction of crop yield. However, highly complex dynamics cause large volatility in meteorological factors, so it is very challenging to predict the crop growth stage accurately, based on weather data. To solve this problem, we propose a data-driven encoder-decoder model, using long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM), which can be applied to forecast daily sunshine duration, cumulative precipitation, and average temperature for the coming year. To further test the performance of the ConvLSTM-based model, it is compared with the conventional LSTM encoder-decoder model and the convolutional neural network (CNN)-LSTM encoder-decoder model. The results demonstrate that, the ConvLSTM-based model is more accurate than the others for forecasting temperature (MAE = 2.602 °C, RMSE = 3.456 °C), precipitation (MAE = 3.878 mm, RMSE = 10.503 mm), and sunshine hours (MAE = 3.445 h, RMSE = 4.172 h) in 2014–2016. Furthermore, precise forecasting of meteorological factors allows us to develop a hybrid model and a data-driven model for the prediction of each growth stage separately. The hybrid model combines the ConvLSTM encoder-decoder model with empirical models, whereas the data-driven model comprises the ConvLSTM encoder-decoder model and traditional neural network structures. Finally, we compared the two types of models on a real-world dataset from Dandong, and concluded that the data-driven model is more accurate than the hybrid model for prediction of maize growth stages, with R2 in the range of 0.755–0.883, MAE 0.588–2.205 days, and RMSE 0.978–2.729 days. In the future, these models can also be used to predict the growth stages of other crops. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","ConvLSTM encoder-decoder model; Daily weather forecast; Data-driven model; Hybrid model; Maize growth stages","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Decoding; Deep learning; Signal encoding; Weather forecasting; Cumulative precipitation; Data-driven model; Encoder-decoder; Growth stages; Hybrid model; Meteorological factors; Neural network structures; Sunshine duration; Long short-term memory; artificial neural network; atmospheric modeling; data set; growth rate; machine learning; maize; numerical model; prediction; weather forecasting; China; Dandong; Liaoning; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and, particularly, the ArcSWAT interface was used for the watershed simulation. The ERA-Interim reanalysis climate data regarding the period from 1981 to 2000 were used for the historical simulation of the watershed. The ArcSWAT simulated data were evaluated against the observed discharge data for the periods with the available data. The statistical evaluation confirmed the ArcSWAT model’s capability in simulating the hydrological process of the research area. The climate change consequences on the hydrological components of the research area until the end of the twenty-first century were estimated by driving the ArcSWAT model with the Regional Climate Model Version 4 (RegCM4) forcing data under the extreme RCP 8.5 scenario, namely the simulations of the MPI and HadGEM2 general circulation models (GCMs), resulted from the spatio-temporal kriging approach. Based on the results, the increase in the minimum and the maximum temperature contributed to an increase in the actual evapotranspiration and the surface runoff. In contrast, the temperature increase caused a reduction in the infiltration. An increase (reduction) in the precipitation led to an increase (reduction) in the hydrological components. The climate change impact analysis of the Greek watershed showed that not only the precipitation changes but the temperature changes as well directly influence the water balance components of the research area and particularly the infiltration. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"catchment; climate change; climate effect; data processing; hydrological cycle; hydrological modeling; infiltration; precipitation (climatology); soil and water assessment tool; temperature effect; water budget; Greece",Article,Scopus

The purpose of this monitoring is to provide an advantage in terms of on-farm management decision making, crop marketing planning, and support for policy decision-making. We identified here which VI's can be used to predict soybean grain yield (GY) by using UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and remote multispectral sensor. For this purpose, experiments were carried out in three sites during the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 crop seasons in Brazil. The VI's were measured together with the plant stand assessment at 25 days after emergency (DAE) when the plants were at V4 phenological stage. The processing of the VI models was performed based on the imaging reflectance factor data performed in the field. For statistical data analyses, a correlation network was used to express the relationship between GY and VI's graphically. Path analysis was performed for identifying the cause-and-effect relationship between VI's and GY. Subsequently, a decision tree algorithm was generated considering GY as a dependent variable. At last, the relative deviation coefficient was used to illustrate the differences between the VI's in the construction of the decision tree and GY. Our results showed potential for predicting soybean yield based on UAV and the multispectral sensor coupled.

It helps to effectively use the agricultural resources and management tools and monitors different parameters to attain better quality yield and production. WSN makes use of Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), a wireless technology to transmit data over long distances with minimal power consumption. LoRaWAN is one of the most successful LPWAN technologies despite its low data rate and because of its low deployment and management costs. Greenhouses are susceptible to different types of interference and diversification, demanding an improved WSN design scheme. In this paper, we contemplate the viable challenges for PA in greenhouses and propose the successive steps essential for effectual WSN deployment and facilitation. We performed a real-time, end-to-end deployment of a LoRaWAN-based sensor network in a greenhouse of the ’Proefcentrum Hoogstraten’ research center in Belgium. We have designed a dashboard for better visualization and analysis of the data, analyzed the power consumption for the LoRaWAN communication, and tried three different enclosure types (commercial, simple box and airflow box, respectively). We validated the implications of real-word challenges on the end-to-end deployment and air circulation for the correct sensor readings. We found that temperature and humidity have a larger impact on the sensor readings inside the greenhouse than we initially thought, which we successfully solved through the airflow box design. © 2020 by the authors.

It is quite possible that the yield response to any modification may vary from positive in one location to negative in another location. Therefore, tools to undertake geospatial analysis are required to assess the overall impact. It is argued that mechanistic models based on the physics and physiology of plant development, growth, and yield formation are required for such tasks. Several criteria in selecting model tools are discussed. First, models that need to be “calibrated” are not suited for geospatial assessments because the calibration processes causes the model to be an empirical representation of the calibration data and limited to the calibration environment. Extreme caution is needed to extrapolate model use beyond the domain of calibration, since geospatial analysis requires the model to be run for a range of geographical locations over a number of growing seasons. Second, to readily understand the output from simulations across space and time, models needs to be compact and transparent so output that seems inconsistent or not intuitively obvious can be tracked to the critical features in the model. Models with a smaller number of parameters are likely to be more transparent. Finally, it is necessary that the robustness of the model has been tested against a range of environmental conditions. In this paper, we discuss the example of the Simple Simulation Model (SSM) as an option that meets these criteria. © 2020 The Authors.

Seasonal forecasting in the grainbelt of Western Australia (WA) is difficult because climate drivers that affect the Australian continent have little influence on the south-west corner. The Statistical Seasonal Forecast system was developed to provide skilful forecasts to assist on-farm decision making in the south-west of WA. It has now been operational from 2013 to 2018. This article describes the models and methods used to create forecasts, the results of forecast validation, and verification of the accuracy of six years of operational seasonal forecasts. Forecast validation was performed using leave-one-out cross-validation. It showed positive skill, lower for late spring and summer forecasts that rises in autumn and is highest for forecasting winter rainfall. Skill for forecasting growing season (May to October) is good for lead times of up to three months. Verified skill of the operational forecasts is lower than estimated using cross-validation. The operational system performed reasonably well at forecasting 3-month periods, and for most years it showed better skill than climatology. Verified skill for growing season forecasts is higher than that of forecasting any 3-month period, with higher skill in the south. With only a small sample of six years of forecasts, longer-term accuracy may be better or worse. To test whether declining accuracy is a risk, use of a less generous measure of forecast validation is recommended. © 2019","Forecast accuracy; Forecast validation; Forecast verification; Partial least squares regression; Seasonal rainfall; South-West Western Australia; Statistical seasonal forecast","Decision making; Least squares approximations; Rain; Risk assessment; Statistical methods; Forecast accuracy; Forecast verifications; Partial least squares regression; Seasonal forecasts; Seasonal rainfall; Western Australia; Forecasting; accuracy assessment; agricultural application; climatology; least squares method; rainfall; seasonal variation; statistical analysis; weather forecasting; Australia; Western Australia",Article,Scopus

In the U.S., yearly crop data layers (CDLs) are available starting in the early 2000s and have been developed using combined field information and sets of temporal imagery from multiple sensors. Development of long-term crop-type layers similar to CDLs is restricted by reduced accessibility to imagery and the necessary auxiliary datasets. In this study, a procedure to generate a historical crop type was developed and evaluated. Time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets from Landsat 5 TM sensor for the Lower Bear Creek watershed were collected and processed. Object-based pseudo phenology curves, represented by the NDVI time series, were generated using noise filtering and dimensionality standardization procedures for the years 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005. Classifiers were developed and evaluated using random-forest machine learning algorithms and CDL datasets as the reference. Increased generalization performance was obtained when the model was developed using multi-year datasets. This can be attributed to improved crop type representation during the training phase coupled with characterization of yearly variations due to natural (weather) and anthropogenic factors (farming management). Source of uncertainties were the presence of multiple crops within objects, phenological similarities between soybean and corn/maize, and the accuracy of CDL itself. The proposed procedure supports the development of historic crop types for long-term studies at the field scale in agricultural watersheds. © 2020 by the authors.","Agricultural watershed; Crop-type classification; Cropland data layer; Random forest","Classification (of information); Crops; Decision trees; Random forests; Remote sensing; Time series; Watersheds; Agricultural watersheds; Anthropogenic factors; Crop type classification; Data layer; Generalization performance; Machine learning approaches; Normalized difference vegetation index; Temporal and spatial; Machine learning",Article,Scopus

Recently, HTP using unmanned aerial systems (UAS) has shown advantages in both cost and efficiency. However, scalability and efficiency have not been well studied when processing images in complex contexts, such as using multispectral cameras, and when images are collected during early and late growth stages. These challenges hamper further analysis to quantify phenotypic traits for large-scale and high-precision applications in plant breeding. To solve these challenges, our research team previously built a three-step data processing pipeline, which is highly modular. For this project, we present improvements to the previous pipeline to improve canopy segmentation and crop plot localization, leading to improved accuracy in crop image extraction. Furthermore, we propose a novel workflow based on a trie data structure to compute vegetation indices efficiently and with greater flexibility. For each of our proposed changes, we evaluate the advantages by comparison with previous models in the literature or by comparing processing results using both the original and improved pipelines. The improved pipeline is implemented as two MATLAB programs: Crop Image Extraction version 2 (CIE 2.0) and Vegetation Index Derivation version 1 (VID 1.0). Using CIE 2.0 and VID 1.0, we compute canopy coverage and normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVIs) for a soybean phenotyping experiment. We use canopy coverage to investigate excess water stress and NDVIs to evaluate temporal patterns across the soybean growth stages. Both experimental results compare favorably with previous studies, especially for approximation of soybean reproductive stage. Overall, the proposed methodology and implemented experiments provide a scalable and efficient paradigm for applying HTP with UAS to general plant breeding. © 2020 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

However, very few studies have been performed to adapt crop models to simulate these systems. The aim of this study was to parameterize the CROPGRO-Perennial Forage model for estimating Piatã palisade grass growth in monoculture and in a silvopastoral system with eucalyptus. To generate the dataset required for that, two field experiments were carried out. The first experiment was conducted between February 2011 and July 2012 with Piatã palisade grass under irrigated and rainfed conditions and cut-and-carry management. The second experiment was conducted from December 2014 to January 2016, in a single pasture of Piatã palisade grass and in a silvopastoral system with the same forage species and eucalypt trees. The trees were arranged in single rows, in East-West orientation, with 15 m between rows and 2 m between trees in the rows. This experiment was conducted under grazing management and rainfed conditions, during 11 growth cycles, with the pasture variables being assessed at four distances from the North row of eucalypt (0.00 m, 3.75 m, 7.50 m and 11.25 m), in the silvopastoral system, and in the single pasture. CROPGRO testing for the silvopastoral system considered only the competition for solar radiation since the model does not allow simulating belowground competition. For this, measured data of incoming solar radiation at each position were used as input for the simulations. The model was able to simulate forage live mass in the single pastures (R2 from 0.72 to up to 0.89, Agreement index from 0.88 to up to 0.95, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency between 0.65 and 0.85), and in the silvopastoral system (R2 from 0.76 to up to 0.89, Agreement index between 0.93 and 0.96, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency between 0.71 and 0.86). Despite these results, improvements should be performed in the model for simulating the effect of flowering on pasture growth, changes on pasture canopy caused by animals trampling, and competition for resources in silvopastoral systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agroforestry; Brachiaria brizantha; DSSAT; grazing; Pasture modeling; Shading","agricultural modeling; agroforestry; biological production; climate change; evergreen tree; experimental study; forage; grass; grazing management; growth; monoculture; parameterization; pastoralism; rainfed agriculture; shading; silviculture; simulation; Animalia; Eucalyptus; Urochloa brizantha",Article,Scopus

Remote sensing, as a non-destructive measurement technology, has been proved to be useful for estimating vegetation growth parameters, especially at large scale. With the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), this novel remote sensing platform has been widely used to provide remote sensing images which have much higher spatial resolution. Previous reports have shown that the spectral feature of remote sensing images could be an effective indicator to estimate vegetation growth parameters. However, the texture feature of high-resolution remote sensing images is rarely employed for this purpose. Besides, the physical mechanism between the texture feature and vegetation growth parameters is still unclear. Results: In this study, a Fourier spectrum texture based on the UAV Image was developed to estimate rice LAI. And the relationship between Fourier spectrum texture and rice LAI was also analyzed. The results showed that Fourier spectrum texture could improve the accuracy of rice LAI estimation. Conclusions: In conclusion, the texture feature of high-resolution remote sensing images may be more effective in rice LAI estimation than the spectral feature. © 2019 The Author(s).","Fourier spectrum texture; Remote sensing; Rice LAI; UAV; Vegetation index",,Article,Scopus

This study modeled upland rice yield responses to climate factors using multiple linear regression, boosted tree regression, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Four ANNs were explored: ANNMLP (multilayer perceptron), ANNPNN (probabilistic neural network), ANNGFF (generalized feedforward), and ANNLR (linear regression). Then the modeled rice yield function was calibrated and tested against the observed yield data and climate variables of three provinces of Burkina Faso, West Africa. The global climate model (GCM) outputs under the AR4-SR-A1B, A2, and B1 mean ensemble CO2 emissions scenarios were then downscaled and used as input of the calibrated yield response model, in order to forecast yield trends over 2052. The results are three-fold: first, rain (R = 0.402) is the most dominant climate driver in Sahel, followed by the maximum and minimum temperatures (R = -0.313 and R = -0.237, respectively), which clearly reduce yield. Second, the ANNPNN (R = 0.952, MSE = 0.033 ton/ha, NMSE = 0.109 ton/ha, MAE = 0.115 ton/ha) has a great capability in rice yield responses function modeling outperforming boosted tree (R = 0.920, MSE = 0.077 ton/ha, NMSE = 0.208 ton/ha, MAE = 0.223 ton/ha) and the multiple linear regression (R = 0.385, MSE = 0.259 ton/ha, NMSE = 0.852 ton/ha, MAE = 0.340 ton/ha). All linear models performed unsatisfactorily. Third, the projected yields showed a gap of 57.29% with the site-recorded maximum average yields over 2052. From application of ANNPNN, we anticipate that site-specific rice yield may substantially decline with climate change, as rainfall is projected to decrease while temperatures increase. These results should assist in identifying priority adaptation measures for Sahel, such as village rainwater catchment basins supplemented with adapted irrigation technologies, to enhance the resilience of crops. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Boosted tree; Climate change; Neural network; Rice yield forecasting; Sahel","Catchments; Climate models; Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Forestry; Landforms; Linear regression; Multilayer neural networks; Neural networks; Rain; Boosted tree; Function modeling; Global climate model; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Multiple linear regressions; Probabilistic neural networks; Rice yield; Sahel; Climate change; agricultural modeling; agrometeorology; artificial neural network; climate change; crop yield; prediction; rainwater; regression analysis; rice; upland region; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]",Article,Scopus

Mapping the spatial variability of yield, protein content, and total grain N uptake (Ng) can be a useful tool for post-harvest evaluation of N sufficiency that, in turn, can guide precision N fertilization. We evaluated the applicability of combining RapidEye satellite imagery-derived vegetation indices with topographic variables derived from high-resolution data obtained from proximal sensors to estimate winter wheat yield, protein content, and Ng. Results indicate that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference red edge index (NDRE), terrain curvature, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index, and solar radiation are the most relevant co-variables that contribute to spatial variability of yield and Ng. Yield and Ng exhibited strong relationships with NDVI and NDRE from late June through early July during grain filling stage, with nearly all R2 &gt; 0.6. We found greater yield and Ng values in concave-shaped terrain; 0-5° and 10-20° slopes; and flat, eastern, or northern aspects. In contrast, protein content exhibited weak relationships with vegetation indices and nearly all terrain factors. Prediction models demonstrated that these variables can provide good estimations of yield and Ng, with R2 of 0.848 and 0.864, respectively, and RMSE of 48.47 and 0.0136, respectively.

Consequently, VIs originally developed for traditional airborne and spaceborne sensors have become applicable to UAV systems. In this study, we investigated the difference in tillage treatments for cotton and sorghum using various RGB and NIR VIs. Minimized tillage has been known to increase farm sustainability and potentially optimize productivity over time; however, repeated tillage is the most commonly-adopted management practice in agriculture. To this day, quantitative comparisons of plant growth patterns between conventional tillage (CT) and no tillage (NT) fields are often inconsistent. In this study, high-resolution and multi-temporal UAV data were used for the analysis of tillage effects on plant health and the performance of various vegetation indices investigated. Time series data over ten dates were acquired on a weekly basis by RGB and multispectral (MS) UAV platforms: a DJI Phantom 4 Pro and a DJI Matrice 100 with the SlantRange 3p sensor. Ground reflectance panels and an ambient illumination sensor were used for the radiometric calibration of RGB and MS orthomosaic images, respectively. Various RGB and NIR-based vegetation indices were then calculated for the comparison between CT and NT treatments. In addition, a one-tailed Z-test was conducted to check the significance of VIs' difference between CT and NT treatments. The results showed distinct differences in VIs between tillage treatments during the whole growing season. NIR-based VIs showed better discrimination performance than RGB-based VIs. Out of 13 VIs, the modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) and optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) showed better performance in terms of quantitative difference measurements and the Z-test between tillage treatments. The modified green red vegetation index (MGRVI) and excess green (ExG) showed reliable separability and can be an alternative for economic RGB UAV application. © 2019 by the authors.","Tillage effect; Time series analysis; UAV; Vegetation indices comparison","Antennas; Computerized tomography; Cultivation; Infrared devices; Time series analysis; Vegetation; Ambient illumination; Conventional tillage; Difference measurements; Management practices; Quantitative comparison; Radiometric calibrations; Tillage effects; Vegetation index; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)",Article,Scopus

The paper presents a theoretical approach for investigating frequency vegetation indices (VIs) in different areas of the experimental plot for early detection of agronomic spatial variability. Four flights were carried out with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to calculate high-resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) images. Ground agronomic data (biomass, leaf area index (LAI), spikes, plant height, and yield) have been linked to the vegetation indices (VIs) at different growth stages. Regression coefficients of all samplings data were highly significant for both the cultivars and VIs at anthesis and tillering stage. At harvest, the whole plot (W) data were analyzed and compared with two sub-areas characterized by high agronomic performance (H) yield 20% higher than the whole plot, and low performances (L), about 20% lower of yield related to the whole plot). The whole plot and two sub-areas were analyzed backward in time comparing the VIs frequency curves. At anthesis, more than 75% of the surface of H sub-areas showed a VIs value higher than the L sub-plot. The differences were evident also at the tillering and seedling stages, when the 75% (third percentile) of VIs H data was over the 50% (second percentile) of the W curve and over the 25% (first percentile) of L sub-plot. The use of high-resolution images for analyzing the frequency value of VIs in different areas can be a useful approach for the detection of agronomic constraints for precision agriculture purposes. © 2019 by the authors.","Cultivars; Precision agriculture; Relative frequencies; UAV; Vegetation indices; Yield",,Article,Scopus

Therefore, the objective of this research was to evaluate the efficacy of the plant stress algorithms in Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate corn (Zea mays L.) responses to deficit irrigation treatments. Results showed simulated corn leaf area index (LAI), biomass, and yield under full irrigation scenarios matched measured data reasonably well at two study sites. However, clear reductions in model performance statistics for corn LAI simulations were found under the deficit irrigation scenarios for both sites (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency [NSE] <0.49; percent bias [PBIAS] >14%). Additionally, considerable overestimation of yield occurred in the deficit irrigation scenarios for both sites (PBIAS >30% in most years). The unsatisfactory results from simulations of both LAI and yield under the deficit irrigation scenarios suggested potential deficiencies of the plant stress algorithms in SWAT. Two apparent limitations of the plant stress algorithms were (i) the equation for computing actual plant growth factor using a singular stress factor, determined by the maximum value of four plant stress factors of water, temperature, nitrogen, and phosphorus, and (ii) the computed actual plant growth factor only adjusting potential daily accumulations of LAI rather than modifying the shape of the LAI development by adjusting related parameters. © 2019 by the American Society of Agronomy 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711 USA All rights reserved.",,,Article,Scopus

Understanding the spatial and temporal variabilities of water security can play a pivotal role in sustainable management of fresh water resources. In this study, a long-term water security analysis of the Grand River watershed (GRW), Ontario, Canada, was carried out using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). Analyses on blue and green water availability and water security were carried out by dividing the GRW into eight drainage zones. As such, both anthropogenic as well as environmental demand were considered. In particular, while calculating blue water scarcity, three different methods were used in determining the environmental flow requirement, namely, the presumptive standards method, the modified low stream-flow method, and the variable monthly flow method. Model results showed that the SWAT model could simulate streamflow dynamics of the GRW with 'good' to 'very good' accuracy with an average Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.75, R2 value of 0.78, and percentage of bias (PBIAS) of 8.23%. Sen's slope calculated using data from over 60 years confirmed that the blue water flow, green water flow, and storage had increasing trends. The presumptive standards method and the modified low stream-flow method, respectively, were found to be the most and least restrictive method in calculating environmental flow requirements. While both green (0.4-1.1) and blue (0.25-2.0) water scarcity values showed marked temporal and spatial variabilities, blue water scarcity was found to be the highest in urban areas on account of higher water usage and less blue water availability. Similarly, green water scarcity was found to be highest in zones with higher temperatures and intensive agricultural practices. We believe that knowledge of the green and blue water security situation would be helpful in sustainable water resources management of the GRW and help to identify hotspots that need immediate attention. © 2019 by the authors.","Blue water; Grand River watershed; Green water; Soil and water assessment tool (SWAT); Water security","agricultural practice; assessment method; soil and water assessment tool; spatiotemporal analysis; streamflow; water availability; water management; water resource; watershed; Canada; Grand River [Ontario]; Ontario [Canada]",Article,Scopus

The current use of pretrained deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) is usually constrained to three-band images (i.e., RGB) obtained from a single optical sensor. Additional spectral bands from a multiple sensor setup introduce challenges for the use of DCNN. We fuse the RGB feature information obtained from a deep learning framework with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) features to obtain semantic labeling. Specifically, we propose a decision-level multisensor fusion technique for semantic labeling of the very-high-resolution optical imagery and LiDAR data. Our approach first obtains initial probabilistic predictions from two different sources: one from a pretrained neural network fine-tuned on a three-band optical image, and another from a probabilistic classifier trained on LiDAR data. These two predictions are then combined as the unary potential using a higher-order conditional random field (CRF) framework, which resolves fusion ambiguities by exploiting the spatialcontextual information. We utilize graph cut to efficiently infer the final semantic labeling for our proposed higher-order CRF framework. Experiments performed on three benchmarking multisensor datasets demonstrate the performance advantages of our proposed method. © 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Conditional random fields; Deep convolutional neural networks; Light detection and ranging; Multisensor remote sensing; Semantic segmentation","Antennas; Benchmarking; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Geometrical optics; Graphic methods; Image segmentation; Neural networks; Random processes; Remote sensing; Semantics; Conditional random field; Convolutional neural network; Light detection and ranging; Multisensor remote sensing; Semantic segmentation; Optical radar",Article,Scopus

The recent availability of long time series of remote sensing data offers opportunities for crop monitoring. In this paper, four machine learning models, namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were adopted to estimate the seasonal corn biomass based on field observation data and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data from 2012 to 2019 in the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin, China. Nine variables were selected with the forward feature selection approach from among twenty-seven variables potentially influencing corn biomass: soil-adjusted total vegetation index (SATVI), green ratio vegetation index (GRVI), Nadir_B7 (2105–2155 nm), Nadir_B6 (1628–1652 nm), land surface water index (LSWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Nadir_B4 (545–565 nm), and Nadir_B3 (459–479 nm). The results indicated that the corn biomass was suitably estimated (the coefficient of determination (R2) was between 0.72 and 0.78) with the four machine learning models. The XGBoost model performed better than the other three models (R2 = 0.78, root mean squared error (RMSE) = 2.86 t/ha and mean absolute error (MAE) = 1.86 t/ha). Moreover, the RF model was an effective method (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 2.91 t/ha and MAE = 1.91 t/ha), with a performance comparable to that of the XGBoost model. This study provides a reference for estimating crop biomass from MOD43A4 datasets. In addition, the research demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques to achieve a relatively accurate estimation of daily corn biomass at a large scale. © 2021 by the authors.

The accuracy of these methods has been found to be influenced by soil properties, weather conditions, and crop management practices. It is important to effectively incorporate these variables to improve in-season N management. Machine learning (ML) methods are promising due to their capability of processing different types of data and modeling both linear and non-linear relationships. The objectives of this study were to (1) determine the potential improvement of in-season prediction of corn N nutrition index (NNI) and grain yield by combining soil, weather and management data with active sensor data using random forest regression (RFR) as compared with Lasso linear regression (LR) using similar data and simple regression (SR) models only using crop sensor data; and (2) to develop a new in-season side-dress N fertilizer recommendation strategy at eighth to ninth leaf stage (V8-V9) of corn developement using the RFR model. Twelve site-year experiments examining corn N rates and planting densities were conducted in Northeast China. The GreenSeeker sensor data and corn NNI were collected at V8-V9 stage, and grain yield was determined at the harvest stage (R6). The soil information was obtained at planting and the weather data was measured throughout the growing season. The results indicated that corn NNI and grain yield were better predicted by combining soil, weather and management information with GreenSeeker sensor data using RFR model (R2 = 0.86 and 0.79) and LR model (R2 = 0.85 and 0.76) as compared with only using GreenSeeker sensor data (R2 = 0.66 and 0.62–63) based on the test dataset. An innovative in-season side-dress N recommendation strategy was developed using the RFR grain yield prediction model to simulate corn grain yield responses to a series of side-dress N rates at V8-V9 stage. Based on these response curves, site-, and year-specific optimum side-dress N rates can be determined. The scenario analysis results indicated that this RFR model-based in-season N recommendation strategy could recommend side-dress N rates similar to those based on measured agronomic optimum N rate (AONR) or economic optimum N rate (EONR), with root mean square error (RMSE) of 17 kg ha−1 and relative error (RE) of 14–15 %. It is concluded that combining soil, weather and management information with crop sensor data using RFR can significantly improve both in-season corn NNI and grain yield prediction and N management, compared with the approach based only on crop sensor data. More studies are needed to further improve and evaluate this approach under diverse on-farm conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Active canopy sensor; Corn grain yield; Machine learning; Nitrogen nutrition index; Precision nitrogen management","agronomy; fertilizer application; machine learning; maize; plantation; prediction; scenario analysis; seasonality; sensor; China",Article,Scopus

Karst comprises exposed carbonate bedrock over approximately 1.30×106 km2 of this area, which suffers from soil degradation and poor crop yield. This paper aims to gain a better understanding of the environmental controls on crop yield in order to enable more sustainable use of natural resources for food production and development. More precisely, four kinds of artificial neural network were used to analyse and simulate the spatial patterns of crop yield for seven crop species grown in Guizhou Province, exploring the relationships with meteorological, soil, irrigation and fertilization factors. The results of spatial classification showed that most regions of high-level crop yield per area and total crop yield are located in the central-north area of Guizhou. Moreover, the three artificial neural networks used to simulate the spatial patterns of crop yield all demonstrated a good correlation coefficient between simulated and true yield. However, the Back Propagation network had the best performance based on both accuracy and runtime. Among the 13 influencing factors investigated, temperature (16.4%), radiation (15.3%), soil moisture (13.5%), fertilization of N (13.5%) and P (12.4%) had the largest contribution to crop yield spatial distribution. These results suggest that neural networks have potential application in identifying environmental controls on crop yield and in modelling spatial patterns of crop yield, which could enable local stakeholders to realize sustainable development and crop production goals. © The Author(s) 2020.","artificial neural network; critical zone; crop model; crop yield; Guizhou; Karst","artificial neural network; back propagation; crop yield; environmental factor; fertilizer application; karst; radiation exposure; soil moisture; spatial distribution; temperature effect; China; Guizhou",Article,Scopus

Nevertheless, the implementation of large datasets generated by high-throughput phenotyping tools such as hyperspectral reflectance in cultivar development programs is still challenging due to the essential need for intensive knowledge in computational and statistical analyses. In this study, the robustness of three common machine learning (ML) algorithms, multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF), were evaluated for predicting soybean (Glycine max) seed yield using hyperspectral reflectance. For this aim, the hyperspectral reflectance data for the whole spectra ranged from 395 to 1005 nm, which were collected at the R4 and R5 growth stages on 250 soybean genotypes grown in four environments. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) approach was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the hyperspectral reflectance data and select variables with the largest importance values. The results indicated that R5 is more informative stage for measuring hyperspectral reflectance to predict seed yields. The 395 nm reflectance band was also identified as the high ranked band in predicting the soybean seed yield. By considering either full or selected variables as the input variables, the ML algorithms were evaluated individually and combined-version using the ensemble–stacking (E–S) method to predict the soybean yield. The RF algorithm had the highest performance with a value of 84% yield classification accuracy among all the individual tested algorithms. Therefore, by selecting RF as the metaClassifier for E–S method, the prediction accuracy increased to 0.93, using all variables, and 0.87, using selected variables showing the success of using E–S as one of the ensemble techniques. This study demonstrated that soybean breeders could implement E–S algorithm using either the full or selected spectra reflectance to select the high-yielding soybean genotypes, among a large number of genotypes, at early growth stages. © Copyright © 2021 Yoosefzadeh-Najafabadi, Earl, Tulpan, Sulik and Eskandari.","artificial intelligence; data-driven model; ensemble methods; high-throughput phenotyping; random forest; recursive feature elimination",,Article,Scopus

Precisely predicting rice yields are of vital importance to ensure the food security in countries like China, where rice accounts for one-fifth of the total agricultural production. Previous studies found that the rice yields had been significantly impacted by climate change. In addition, phenological variables were found to be important factors concerning rice yields due to its fundamental role in carbon allocation between plant organs, but its impacts on rice yields were seldom evaluated. In this study, eleven combinations of phenology, climate and geography data were tested to predict the site-based rice yields using a traditional regression-based method (MLR, multiple linear regression), and more advanced three machine learning (ML) methods: backpropagation neural network (BP), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). The results showed that ML methods were more precise than MLR method. The combination using the integrated phenology, climate during growing season and geographical information was better for yields predictions than other combinations across the ML methods, e.g. the difference RMSE (R2) between prediction and observed rice yields were 800 (0.24), 737 (0.33), and 744 (0.31) kg/ha for BP, SVM and RF, respectively. The SVM had achieved the highest precisions in yield predictions and the phenological variables substantially improved the accuracy of yield predictions, and the relative importance of phenological variables were even similar as climatic variables.

In this study, we simulate US maize yield using process-based models, traditional regression model and a machine-learning algorithm, and importantly, identify the weakness and strength of each method in simulating the average, variability and extremes of maize yield across the country. We show that both regression and machine learning models can well reproduce the observed pattern of yield averages, while large bias is found for process-based crop models even fed with harmonized parameters. As for the probability distribution of yields, machine learning shows the best skill, followed by regression model and process-based models. For the country as a whole, machine learning can explain 93% of observed yield variability, followed by regression model (51%) and process-based models (42%). Based on the improved capability of the machine learning algorithm, we estimate that US maize yield is projected to decrease by 13.5% under the 2 C global warming scenario (by ∼2050 s). Yields less than or equal to the 10th percentile in the yield distribution for the baseline period are predicted to occur in 19% and 25% of years in 1.5 C (by ∼2040 s) and 2 C global warming scenarios, with potentially significant implications for food supply, prices and trade.

(commonly known as fennel) is used in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries. Fennel widely used as a digestive, carminative, galactagogue and diuretic and in treating gastrointestinal and respiratory disorders. Improving low heritability traits such as essential oil yield (EOY%) and trans-anethole yield (TAY%) of fennel by direct selection does not result in rapid gains of EOY% and TAY%. Identification of high-heritable traits and using efficient modeling methods can be a beneficial approach to overcome this limitation and help breeders select the most advantageous traits in medicinal plant breeding programs. The present study aims to compare the performance of the artificial neural network (ANN) and multilinear regression (MLR) to predict the EOY% and TAY% of fennel populations. Stepwise regression (SWR) was used to assess the effect of various input variables. Based on SWR, nine traits—number of days to 50% flowering (NDF50%), number of days to maturity (NDM), final plant height (FPH), number of internodes (NI), number of umbels (NU), seed yield per square meter (SY/m2), number of seeds per plant (NS/P), number of seeds per umbel (NS/U) and 1000-seed weight (TSW)—were chosen as input variables. The network with Sigmoid Axon transfer function and two hidden layers was selected as the final ANN model for the prediction of EOY%, and the TanhAxon function with one hidden layer was used for the prediction of TAY%. The results revealed that the ANN method could predict the EOY% and TAY% with more accuracy and efficiency (R2 of EOY% = 0.929, R2 of TAY% = 0.777, RMSE of EOY% = 0.544, RMSE of TAY% = 0.264, MAE of EOY% = 0.385 and MAE of TAY% = 0.352) compared with the MLR model (R2 of EOY% = 0.553, R2 of TAY% = 0.467, RMSE of EOY% = 0.819, RMSE of TAY% = 0.448, MAE of EOY% = 0.624 and MAE of TAY% = 0.452). Based on the sensitivity analysis, SY/m2, NDF50% and NS/P were the most important traits to predict EOY% as well as SY/m2, NS/U and NDM to predict of TAY%.

Owing to the extreme arid climate conditions and scarce precipitation in the arid oasis regions, groundwater plays a key role in restricting the development of the vegetation. The Qira Oasis is located on the southern margin of the Taklimakan Desert (Tarim Basin, China) that is one of the most vulnerable regions regarding vegetation growth and water scarcity in the world. Based on remote sensing images of the Qira Oasis and daily meteorological data measured by the ground stations during the period 2006–2019, this study analyzed the temporal and spatial patterns of NPP in the oasis as well as its relation with the variation of groundwater depth using a modified Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model. At the spatial scale, NPP of the vegetation decreased from the interior of the Qira Oasis to the margin; at the temporal scale, NPP of the vegetation in the oasis fluctuated significantly (ranging from 29.80 to 50.07 g C/(m2·month)) but generally showed an increasing trend, with the average increase rate of 0.07 g C/(m2·month). The regions with decreasing NPP occupied 64% of the total area of the oasis. During the study period, NPP of both farmland and grassland showed an increasing trend, while that of forest showed a decreasing trend. The depth of groundwater was deep in the south of the oasis and shallow in the north, showing a gradual increasing trend from south to north. Groundwater, as one of the key factors in the surface change and evolution of the arid oasis, determines the succession direction of the vegetation in the Qira Oasis. With the increase of groundwater depth, grassland coverage and vegetation NPP decreased.

The proposed categorization method assesses urban space broadly on two dimensions—the states of urbanization and the architectural form of the units observed. This paper shows how the sixteen sub-categories can be used by state-of-the-art deep learning modules (fully convolutional network FCN-8, U-Net, and DeepLabv3+) to categorize formal and informal urban areas in seven urban cities in the developing world—-Dhaka, Nairobi, Jakarta, Guangzhou, Mumbai, Cairo, and Lima. Firstly, an expert visually annotated and categorized 50 × 50 km Google Earth images of the cities. Each urban space was divided into four socioeconomic categories: (1) highly informal area; (2) moderately informal area; (3) moderately formal area, and (4) highly formal area. Then, three models mentioned above were used to categorize urban spaces. Image encompassing 70% of the urban space was used to train the models, and the remaining 30% was used for testing and validation of each city. The DeepLabv3+ model can segment the test part with an average accuracy of 90.0% for Dhaka, 91.5% for Nairobi, 94.75% for Jakarta, 82.0% for Guangzhou city, 94.25% for Mumbai, 91.75% for Cairo, and 96.75% for Lima. These results are the best for the DeepLabv3+ model among all. Thus, DeepLabv3+ shows an overall high accuracy level for most of the measuring parameters for all cities, making it highly scalable, readily usable to understand the cities’ current conditions, forecast land use growth, and other computational modeling tasks. Therefore, the proposed categorization method is also suited for real-time socioeconomic comparative analysis among cities, making it an essential tool for the policymakers to plan future sustainable urban spaces. © 2021 by the authors.

The selection of suitable hybrids and fertilizers is among the methods that can directly influence sustainable agriculture and economic efficiency at the farm level, providing accurate site-specific nutrient management strategies for yield maximization. This experiment included two fertilizer sources in ten maize hybrids in four replications for three consecutive years (2018–2020). The experiment was carried out at the Látókép Crop Production Experimental Site of the University of Debrecen, Hungary. The results of the ANOVA showed that genotype, year, and fertilizer levels had various effects on grain yield, oil, protein, and starch content. FAO340 had maximum grain yield on different fertilizers (NPK and N), and FAO350 had maximum protein content. To gain the best performance and maximum yield of maize on protein and oil, FAO350 is recommended for protein and FAO340 for oil content. The parameters of grain yield, oil content, protein content, and starch content affected by NPK fertilizer provide the stability of grain yield parameters. FAO360, FAO420, and FAO320 hybrids had their maximum desirable N fertilizer doses and NPK fertilizer stability in this research. These results indicate that FAO360, FAO420, and FAO330 hybrids had their maximum potential yield in different fertilizer and environmental conditions. Based on this multi-year study, the complete NPK fertilizer with 150 kg/ha nitrogen, 115 kg/ha potassium, 135 kg/ha phosphorus is recommended to be used on maize hybrids. © 2021 by the authors.

It is significant to ensure security in the IoT network. In the scalable and dynamic IoT environment, conventional security mechanisms such as cryptography techniques, key management, intrusion detection system, anomaly detection, etc cannot be applicable, because it consumes more energy. Therefore, the IoT network requires a lightweight security mechanism for reliable and secure data transmission. A trust-based security solution solves many security-related problems. The proposed RFTrust model provides a trust-based lightweight solution for ensuring security in the IoT network. It is primarily designed to address the sinkhole attack in Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy networks (RPL) based IoT environments. It enhances the trusted routing in the IoT environment by finding and removing sinkhole nodes in the network. The proposed model uses Random Forest (RF) and Subjective Logic (SL) to improve the network performance by identifying sinkhole attack.

Improving the reliability and accuracy of wind and solar energy predictions can enhance the power system stability. This study aims to contribute to the issues of wind and solar energy fluctuation and intermittence by proposing a high-quality prediction model based on neural networks (NNs). The most efficient technology for analyzing the future performance of wind speed and solar irradiance is recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Bidirectional RNNs (BRNNs) have the advantages of manipulating the information in two opposing directions and providing feedback to the same outputs via two different hidden layers. A BRNN’s output layer concurrently receives information from both the backward layers and the forward layers. The bidirectional long short-term memory (BI-LSTM) prediction model was designed to predict wind speed, solar irradiance, and ambient temperature for the next 169 h. The solar irradiance data include global horizontal irradiance (GHI), direct normal irradiance (DNI), and diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI). The historical data collected from Dumat al-Jandal City covers the period from 1 January 1985 to 26 June 2021, as hourly intervals. The findings demonstrate that the BI-LSTM model has promising performance in terms of evaluation, with considerable accuracy for all five types of historical data, particularly for wind speed and ambient temperature values.

However, eco-hydrological modelling usually neglects crop rotations. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we present a Crop Generator to reproduce the stochastic characteristics of crop rotations at regional scale. METHODS: The Crop Generator emulates farmers’ decision making on crop rotation planning. We combined the Crop Generator with the eco-hydrological Soil and Water Integrated Model to show the hydrological relevance of considering crop rotations in a study region in central Europe including the Elbe River basin. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A spatial validation showed that the Crop Generator reproduced the given cropping patterns well. Higher daily discharge, runoff and groundwater seepage and lower evapotranspiration were simulated based on crop rotations compared with a simplified representation of cropping patterns. The Crop Generator is a solution to simulate more realistic cropping patterns in large-scale eco-hydrological modelling. It closes the gap between aggregated agricultural statistics and the requirement of representing crop rotations in a realistic way in eco-hydrological modelling.

In this work, to consider the farmers’ risk-aversion behavior, we slightly shifted the typical focus to the risk associated with a crucial farming decision in a rainfed paddy rice field, the transplanting timing. Using a simple crop model and a semi-parametric weather generator, we tested hypothetical and real sets of climate forecasts for the rice field under nutrient deficiency in Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). Results showed that the first climatic risk in the study field was an occational dry conditions, and the traditional timing of transplanting seemed to minimize the worst effect of potential dry conditions. It was found that the transplanting timing needs to be 5–10 days earlier than the farming tradition when fertility stress delays foliage development. The tests with hypothetical climate forecasts suggest that duration of a potential dry condition needs to be reliably forecasted to manage the climatic risk by adjusting the transplanting timing. The yield simulations for the 2015 El-Niño event also implcate that adjusting the transplanting timing could effectively reduce the potential impact of dry climate at a cost of slightly reduced yield expectation.

For instance, Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) from a triangle NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)-Ts feature space (TVDIt), TVDI from bi-parabolic NDVI-Ts feature space (TVDIc), TFDI from FPAR (Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation)-Ts feature space, TVDI from LAI (Leaf Area Index)-Ts feature space (TLDI), TVDI from EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index)-Ts feature space (TEDI), TVDI from SAVI (Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index)-Ts feature space (TSDI) and Vegetation Condition Albedo Dryness Index (VCADI) from NDVI-Albedo feature space.

The capability of statistical models to forecast coffee yields at different lead times during the growing season at the farm scale was assessed. Using data collected during a 10-year period (2008-2017) from 558 farmers across the four major coffee-producing provinces in Vietnam (Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Gia Lai, and Lam Dong), the models were built through a robust statistical modelling approach involving Bayesian and machine learning methods. Overall, coffee yields were estimated with reasonable accuracies across the four study provinces based on agroclimate variables, satellite-derived actual evapotranspiration, and crop and farm management information. Median values of prediction mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranged generally from 8% to 13%, and median root mean square errors (RMSE) between 295 kg ha−1 and 429 kg ha−1. For forecasts at four to one month before harvest, errors did not vary markedly when comparing the median MAPE and RMSE values. For farms in Dak Lak, Dak Nong, and Lam Dong, the median forecasting MAPE and RMSE varied between 13% and 16% and between 420 kg ha−1 and 456 kg ha−1, respectively. Using readily and freely available data, the modelling approach explored in this study appears flexible for an application to a larger number of coffee farms across the Vietnamese coffee-producing regions.

The decrease in the value of the quality indices was manifested by the increase of the number of mistakes, either of the number of double planting holes (with at least two seeds), or of the number of missing planting holes. Both cases are unfavorable for the agricultural producer, generating production losses. This paper discusses the influence of the degree of soil grinding on sowing precision in operating conditions, by determining the spectrum of the vibrations induced in the mechanical structure of row units of a precision planter in contact with the soil of three different plots for three working speeds: 4, 6, and 8 km·h−1. Later, the vibrations were simulated under laboratory conditions, on the stand, by means of rubber hemispheres (with diameters between 30 and 100 mm, corresponding to soil fractions resulting from the determination of the degree of soil grinding) mounted on rubber bands, which actuated the seed meters, for testing under an accelerated regime, outside of the optimal agricultural periods (out of season: Beginning mid-May until the end of March), in order to obtain the accuracy of the precision planters. It was found that the sowing precision determined in stationary conditions on the stand, and on a plot with an appropriate degree of seedbed preparation, decreased between 2.92% (at 4 km·h−1) and 6.67% (at 8 km·h−1). The main objective of the tests was to reduce labor costs, which was necessary for the staff involved for determining the qualitative indices of work in real field operating conditions, eliminating fuel consumption, while reducing the duration of testing dependent on meteorological factors (season, temperatures, and precipitation, etc.). © 2021 by the authors.

However, the magnitudes of low- and high-temperature stresses may have been altered by global warming. In this study, the major climatic constraints to the yield and yield components of temperate japonica rice grown in field conditions under the current climates were assessed using the random forests method with 14-yr field trial data (n = 499). Low temperatures had negligible impacts on rice yield under the current climates (2005–2018) in South Korea. Meanwhile, high-temperature stress was most significant during the ripening stage, followed by the reproductive stage. Yield losses by high temperatures were primarily associated with reduced filled-grain percentage, followed by reduced 1,000-grain weight. During the vegetative stage, higher temperature (or higher growing degree days, GDD) decreased the number of panicles per m2 and increased the number of spikelets per panicle, resulting in negligible changes in the number of spikelets per m2 and yield. The effect of solar radiation was most significant during the ripening stage. More solar radiation during the ripening stage enhanced rice yield by increasing filled-grain percentage and 1,000-grain weight. This study highlights that the primary constraints to temperate japonica rice grown under the current climates are high-temperature stresses during the ripening and reproductive stages rather than low-temperature stresses. Thus, there is an urgent need to explore options for improving the adaptation of temperate japonica rice to anticipated global warming. © 2021 The Authors.

They include affordable but profit-oriented products, active consideration of consumer-oriented conditions, strong internal position and controls, and favourable external factors. Further, 39 challenges associated with supplying microlife insurance products were identified and divided into five major groups: poor premium income, asymmetric information, weak internal systems, increased industry-related challenges and unfavourable external factors. The findings could serve as a checklist for microlife insurers to develop measures to sustain microlife insurance products while they mitigate obstacles to improve net profits from products. The results could also stimulate dialogue within the insurance industry as well as the research community on advancing microlife insurance to support the general populace. However, the article is limited in scope and so caution must be exercised in generalising the application of the findings. © 2021, The Geneva Association.","Challenges; Determinants; Factor analysis; Microlife insurance; Principal component analysis; Supply",,Article,Scopus

In ICLS with trees, the tree modifies the light and water availability, and might generate root competition for nutrients, like potassium (K). The study aims to evaluate dry matter (DM) and macronutrients accumulation in white oat, DM and grain yield of maize, and the K use efficiency (KUE) by these crops cultivated in an ICLS with eucalyptus. The experimental design was a randomized block in a split-plot design with three replications. Plots consisted of four cultivation positions (CP) between the tree rows, where CP1 (0 to 4 m distance) refers to a position close to the trees; CP2 (4 to 8 m distance) and CP4 (12 to 16 m distance) corresponds to two intermediate positions between rows; and CP3 (8 to 12 m distance) corresponds to a central position between rows. In subplots, four potassium oxide (K2O) annual doses were assigned, with potassium chloride being applied on the surface, where each rate was half the rate applied at sowing of each crop. DM and macronutrients accumulation in white oat shoot decreased due to eucalyptus shadow (64.5% light restriction). Responses of maize DM and grain yield to K2O addition were different among CPs, possibly owing to different light patterns. No changes in the maize yield were observed with K2O application in CP1 and CP2. However, for other positions, quadratic responses in grain yield were observed. In ICLS with eucalyptus in a subtropical region of Brazil, the reduction of K fertilization led to lower yields in white oat and maize. As KUE was high in plots with low K rate, the production cost in ICLS with trees may be decreased if massive production is not required. © 2020 Japanese Society of Grassland Science","agroforestry systems; Avena sativa L; Eucalyptus dunnii Maiden; potassium use efficiency; Zea mays L","agroforestry; crop plant; efficiency measurement; fertilizer application; light availability; maize; mixed farming; potassium; water availability; zero tillage; Avena sativa; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus dunnii; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

As with most precision agriculture technologies and methodologies, management zones began with arable cropping systems but have been adopted into perennial cropping systems. This review brief explores the evolution of management zones in agriculture (with an emphasis on horticulture), the basic concept, the key research areas in management zone delineation to date and the diverse ways that management zones have been applied into arable and perennial systems to support crop management. The future role of management zones, including their relevance in cropping systems with higher resolution information sources is discussed, along with the future need to have more spatio-temporally dynamic zones to respond to decision-specific management and to accommodate increasing availabilities of in-season information. To support this, a new concept of decision zones is proposed that is decision driven, more flexible in its data-fusion processing and simplifies the final zoning process. Management zones are expected to continue to be an important first step in understanding spatial relationships when entering into precision horticulture. They will also be important for site-specific crop management in the early stages of adoption when data layers are likely to be limited. However, as data and information layers accrue for a cropping system, and spatial understanding of production drivers and interactions develops, then ‘decision zoning’ should replace the current idea of management zones. © 2021 International Society for Horticultural Science.

Three inbred lines (G) of maize (G1-L217RfC, G2-L335/99 and G3-L76B004) were used in the study. The trials were performed in two years (Y) (Y1 = 2016 and Y2 = 2017) and in two locations (L) (L1 and L2) under four ecological conditions of the year-location interaction (E1-E4) and in two densities (D1 and D2) (50,000 and 65,000 plants ha−1). Prior to tasselling, the following five treatments of detasseling and defoliation (T) were applied: T1-control, no leaf removal only detasseling, T2-T5-removal of tassels and top leaves (from one to four top leaves). The defoliation treatments had the most pronounced effect on the yield reduction in G1 (T1-Tn+1… T5), p < 0.05. The ecological conditions on yield variability were expressed under poor weather conditions (E3 and E4), while lower densities were less favorable for the application of defoliation treatments. The result of joint effects of factors was the lowest grain yield (896 kg/ha) in G3 in the variant E3D1 for T2 and the highest grain yield (11,389 kg/ha) in G3 in the variant E2D2 for T1.

We investigated how effective crop canopy properties, including leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content, and canopy height, are as predictors of winter wheat yield over various lead times. Models were calibrated and validated on fertiliser trials over two years in fields in the UK. Correlations of LAI and plant height with yield were stronger than for yield and chlorophyll con-tent. Yield prediction models calibrated in one year and tested on another suggested that LAI and height provided the most robust outcomes. Linear models had equal or smaller validation errors than machine learning. The information content of data for yield prediction degraded strongly with time before harvest, and in application to years not included in the calibration. Thus, impact of soil and weather variation between years on crop phenotypes was critical in changing the interactions between crop variables and yield (i.e., slopes and intercepts of regression models) and was a key contributor to predictive error. These results show that canopy property data provide valuable information on crop status for yield assessment, but with important limitations. © 2021 by the author.

The objective of this article is to identify, assess, and synthesize the papers that discuss the application of machine learning in the dairy farm management context. Using a systematic literature review (SLR) protocol, we retrieved 427 papers, of which 38 papers were determined as primary studies and thus were analysed in detail. More than half of the papers (55 %) addressed disease detection. The other two categories of problems addressed were milk production and milk quality. Seventy-one independent variables were identified and grouped into seven categories. The two prominent categories that were used in more than half of the papers were milking parameters and milk properties. The other categories of independent variables were milk content, pregnancy/calving information, cow characteristics, lactation, and farm characteristics. Twenty-three algorithms were identified, which we grouped into four categories. Decision tree-based algorithms are by far the most used followed by artificial neural network-based algorithms. Regression-based algorithms and other algorithms that do not belong to the previous categories were used in 13 papers. Twenty-three evaluation parameters were identified of which 7 were used 3 or more times. The three evaluation parameters that were used by more than half of the papers are sensitivity, specificity, RMSE. The challenges most encountered were feature selection and unbalanced data and together with problem size, overfitting/estimating, and parameter tuning account for three-quarters of the challenges identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SLR study on the use of machine learning to improve dairy farm management, and to this end, this study will be valuable not only for researchers but also practitioners in dairy farms. © 2020 The Author(s)","Dairy cows; Decision support; Disease detection; Machine learning; Systematic literature review","artificial neural network; dairying; decision tree; dependent variable; disease classification; evaluation study; feature selection; food quality; human; independent variable; machine learning; milk production; priority journal; Review; sensitivity and specificity; systematic review; animal; bovine; dairying; female; machine learning; procedures; Animals; Cattle; Dairying; Female; Machine Learning",Review,Scopus

It argues that while fully or partially automating discretionary EIA decisions is legally and technically problematic, there is significant potential for data-driven decision-making tools to provide superior analysis and predictions to better inform EIA processes. Discretionary decision-making is desirable for EIA decisions given the inherent complexity associated with environmental regulation and the prediction of future impacts. This article demonstrates that current ADM tools cannot adequately replicate human discretionary processes for EIAs—even if there is human oversight and review of automated outputs. Instead of fully or partially automating EIA decisions, data-driven decision-making can be more appropriately deployed to enhance data analysis and predictions to optimise EIA decision-making processes. This latter type of ADM can augment decision-making processes without displacing the critical role of human discretion in weighing the complex environmental, social and economic considerations inherent in EIA determinations. © The Author/s 2021","automated decision making; data-driven decision making; discretionary decisions; Environmental impact assessments",,Article,Scopus

Plant stress response is one of the major concerns for crop productivity. “Climate change and global warming turned out to be the main contributors to crop loss by imparting both abiotic and biotic stress to the plant. Identifying the reasons and solutions to the problems related to crop loss is one of the major areas of concentration for researchers worldwide. The traditional method of identification, classification and quantification of plant stress by visual phenotyping needs specialized human resources and is often associated with erroneous results. An array of different parameters contributes significantly to the decrease in crop yield. Machine Learning (ML) has revolutionized the way in which we approach and deal with such problems nowadays, i.e., predicting the outcome with a reliable accuracy score, thus preventing the crop loss significantly. Researches concerned with Plant Stress Biology (PSB) have gained significant impetus due to the advent of ML techniques, where prediction studies can be carried out based on the feature space for both image and numeric datasets. This feature space is generally large, owing to the correlation between different features with the final outcome for classification. In this book chapter, we have particularly aimed towards introducing the concept of Dimensionality Reduction and have dealt with the part of “Feature Extraction” in particular. Dimensionality Reduction is a part of data pre- processing and is focused on reducing the original feature space by getting rid of the redundant and less important attributes. Our chapter will focus on the understanding the different feature extraction techniques for both numeric and image data for effective prediction of plant disease as a result of biotic stress. We will also focus on the implementation of some of these techniques on publicly available datasets to understand how the dimensionality reduction methods work to provide us with reliable outcomes for prediction of crop diseases and assist in their management. © 2021 Scrivener Publishing LLC.","Dimensionality reduction; Feature extraction; Image analysis; Machine learning (ML); Numerical data analysis; Plant disease detection; Principal component analysis (PCA); Smart agriculture",,Book Chapter,Scopus

Although statistical modeling is commonly used in the water sector, machine learning is still an emerging tool and can provide insights to optimize operations. Random forest (RF), a machine learning model, and multiple linear regression (MLR) were used in this study to model the mass balance of biosolids from a complex biosolids management area. The RF model outperformed (R2 = 0.89) the MLR model (R2 = 0.49) and showed that rainfall was a major factor impacting distribution. Storage for dried biosolids would help decouple drying operations from wet weather and increase distribution. This study demonstrated how machine learning can assist in decision-making processes for long-term planning at WRRFs.

This research proposes two machine learning models for the prediction of food production. The adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) methods are used to advance the prediction models. In the present study, two variables of livestock production and agricultural production were considered as the source of food production. Three variables were used to evaluate livestock production, namely livestock yield, live animals, and animal slaughtered, and two variables were used to assess agricultural production, namely agricultural production yields and losses. Iran was selected as the case study of the current study. Therefore, time-series data related to livestock and agricultural productions in Iran from 1961 to 2017 have been collected from the FAOSTAT database. First, 70% of this data was used to train ANFIS and MLP, and the remaining 30% of the data was used to test the models. The results disclosed that the ANFIS model with generalized bell-shaped (Gbell) built-in membership functions has the lowest error level in predicting food production. The findings of this study provide a suitable tool for policymakers who can use this model and predict the future of food production to provide a proper plan for the future of food security and food supply for the next generations. © 2021 by the authors.

Remote sensing imagery obtained from different satellite sensors has different crop identification capability owing to the different spatial and spectral resolutions. This study aims to discriminate the major crop types and to estimate the corresponding acreage in Hazaribagh district during Rabi season 2018–2019 using a multispectral satellite image of Sentinel-2B with 10 m of spatial resolution. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm was deployed for land use land cover classification and crop types mapping. The accuracy assessment for crop types showed a satisfactory overall accuracy and kappa coefficient as ~ 87.36% and 0.81, respectively. Three crops were broadly identified, namely wheat, mustard, and other Rabi crops, and their corresponding acreages were estimated as ~ 39.8, 10.7, and 70.5 km2, respectively. Furthermore, wheat and mustard yields were predicted as ~ 1.75 and 0.74 ton/ha, respectively using a regression-based yield model. These estimated yields were quite close to reported crop statistics with a mean yield of 1.7 (for wheat) and 0.6 (for mustard) ton/ha. AquaCrop model was also used to simulate the wheat yield during the Rabi season 2018–2019, and the mean yield was simulated as ~ 1.92 ton/ha. The simulated yield from the AquaCrop model was comparable with the regression-based estimates (i.e., 1.75 ton/ha) and also with the historical crop statistics (i.e., 1.70 ton/ha) of the Hazaribagh district. This comprehensive study concluded that the Sentinel-2B satellite data have the capabilities to discriminate the heterogeneous land cover features and crop types with considerable classification accuracy.

Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown ground-breaking performance for image classification tasks by encoding local contextual information, in some cases outperforming trained analysts. In this study, we investigate the development of a CNN to automate the classification of agriculture from medium-resolution satellite imagery as an alternative to manual interpretation. The residual network (ResNet50) CNN architecture was trained and validated for delineating the agricultural area using labelled multi-seasonal Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) satellite imagery (32 m) of Helmand and Kandahar provinces. The effect of input image chip size, training sampling strategy, elevation data, and multi-seasonal imagery were investigated. The best-performing single-year classification used an input chip size of 33 × 33 pixels, a targeted sampling strategy and transfer learning, resulting in high overall accuracy (94%). The inclusion of elevation data marginally lowered performance (93%). Multi-seasonal classification achieved an overall accuracy of 89% using the previous two years’ data. Only 25% of the target year’s training samples were necessary to update the model to achieve >94% overall accuracy.

Considering the potential of agroforestry systems as strategy to improve the balance of crop production and environmental health, the aims of this study were (i) to analyze the canonical correlations among groups of tree growth and climatic variables during four seasons of the year; and (ii) to characterize the relationships between sugarcane growth, yield, and quality variables in two agroforestry arrangements and sugarcane monocropping system. A field experiment was conducted from September 2011 to June 2016. The information generated in this study is relevant, as it provides information to farmers and can assist in the planning of new agroforestry systems due to the better knowledge of tree–crop interactions and climate effects in Southern Brazil. In this study, we demonstrated that crops and trees interact dynamically as a result of variations in the interception of solar radiation by trees in time due to the effect of tree age and arrangement, and we concluded that larger tree arrangements are suggested to benefit sugarcane growth and yield in agroforestry systems in Southern Brazil. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.","Agroforestry arrangements; environmental preservation; integrated land use; principal component analysis; sustainable systems; tree-crop interactions","Crops; Cultivation; Multivariant analysis; Agroforestry system; Canonical correlations; Climate variables; Climatic variables; Environmental health; Field experiment; Growth and yield; Multi variate analysis; Forestry; agroforestry; climate effect; climate variation; crop yield; cropping practice; growth rate; land use; principal component analysis; solar radiation; sustainable development; Cultivation; Farm Crops; Forestry; Growth; Systems; Trees; Variables; Yield; Brazil",Article,Scopus

Over the past four decades a considerable number of pedotransfer functions (PTFs) have been developed to predict SWCC. The goal of this study was to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 30 PTFs, 11 discrete functions and 19 continuous functions. The SWCC predicted by different PTFs was statistically compared to SWCC measured for 2046 United States soils. The performance of each function was evaluated for soils of different textural classes and at four matric potentials: −4, −10, −33 and − 1,500 kPa. The results showed that for point PTFs, the PTF developed by Adhikary et al. (2008), was the best function to predict SWCC in very fine soils, whereas the PTF developed by Fooladmand (2011), showed the best performance in fine, medium fine, medium and coarse soils. For continuous PTFs, the PTF developed by Saxton et al. (1986), showed the best performance in very fine soil; the PTF developed by Cosby et al. (1984), showed the best performance in fine soil; the PTF developed by Rawls and Brakensiek (1985) showed the best performance in medium fine soil; and the PTF of Zacharias and Wessolek (2007), showed the best performance in medium and coarse soils. With respect to matric potentials, the PTFs of Gupta and Larson (1979), Dashtaki et al. (2010), and Hua et al. (2011), were the best performing point PTFs to predict SWCC at −4, −10, −33 and − 1,500 KPa, respectively. The continuous PTFs developed by Mayr and Jarvis (1999), Rosetta SSC (Schaap et al. 2001), Cosby et al. (1984), and Al Majou et al. (2007), showed the best performance to predict SWCC at −4, −10, −33 and − 1,500 kPa, respectively. The results of this study may be useful to hydrologic modelling as it identifies the most accurate PTF for each soil textural class and across the matric potential ranges. Highlights: Performances of 30 pedotransfer functions of SWCCs were evaluated using soil database from the USA.

This study quantified the spatial patterns of variability in soil and crop properties to delineate MZs for site-specific soil fertility characterization of potato fields through proximal sensing of fields. Grid sampling strategy was adopted to collect soil and crop data from two potato fields in Prince Edward Island (PEI). DUALEM-2 sensor, Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR-300), GreenSeeker were used to collect soil ground conductivity parameter horizontal coplanar geometry (HCP), soil moisture content (θ), and normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI), respectively. Soil organic matter (SOM), soil pH, phosphorous (P), potash (K), iron (Fe), lime index (LI), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) were determined from soil samples collected from each grid. Stepwise regression shortlisted the major properties of soil and crop that explained 71 to 86% of within-field variability. The cluster analysis grouped the soil and crop data into three zones, termed as excellent, medium, and poor at a 40% similarity level. The coefficient of variation and the interpolated maps characterized least to moderate variability of soil fertility parameters, except for HCP and K that were highly variable. The results of multiple means comparison indicated that the tuber yield and HCP were significantly different in all MZs. The significant relationship between HCP and yield suggested that the ground conductivity data could be used to develop MZs for site-specific fertilization in potato fields similar to those used in this study. © 2020 by the authors.","Management zones; Precision agriculture; Proximal sensing; Soil health; Soil variability",,Article,Scopus

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of projected temperature and precipitation changes on crop yields in the Monocacy River Watershed in the Mid-Atlantic United States based on climate change scenarios. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to simulate watershed hydrology and crop yield. To evaluate the effect of future climate projections, four global climate models (GCMs) and three representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5, 6, and 8.5) were used in the SWAT model. According to all GCMs and RCPs, a warmer climate with a wetter Autumn and Spring and a drier late Summer season is anticipated by mid and late century in this region. To evaluate future management strategies, water budget and crop yields were assessed for two scenarios: current rainfed and adaptive irrigated conditions. Irrigation would improve corn yields during mid-century across all scenarios. However, prolonged irrigation would have a negative impact due to nutrients runoff on both corn and soybean yields compared to rainfed condition. Decision tree analysis indicated that corn and soybean yields are most influenced by soil moisture, temperature, and precipitation as well as the water management practice used (i.e., rainfed or irrigated). The computed values from the SWAT modeling can be used as guidelines for water resource managers in this watershed to plan for projected water shortages and manage crop yields based on projected climate change conditions. © 2020 by the authors.

Late-season biomass production is information growers need to maximize cover crop benefits and schedule field operations. Statistical learning, built upon statistical and computational algorithms that “learn” from data, may help to improve predictions of cover crop biomass as a function of initial soil inorganic nitrogen levels. Three models—Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Ridge, and Random Forest (RF)—were trained and optimized on a 3-yr allometric and remote sensing dataset of cereal rye responses to N fertilization in the mid-Atlantic northern and southeastern United States. Shoot biomass (mean, 9,800 kg ha−1) was accurately predicted with a RF model (RMSE, 2,039 kg ha−1). Targeting shoot N content (mean, 107 kg ha−1), on the other hand, LASSO made accurate and more stable predictions (RMSE, 34 kg ha−1). Early-season information (cover crop C/N ratio, tiller counts, and ground-sensed normalized difference vegetation index) contributed to enhancing biomass and N content predictions. A final test on untrained data revealed that 92 and 73% of the predictions from either algorithm corresponded to ground-truthed biomass and shoot N content observed under different N regimes.

Modern bioenergy using resources such as agricultural wastes and residues and through growing energy crops can provide alternative low carbon renewable energy opportunities. This research applies the Biomass Resource Model to explore potential bioenergy opportunities in Kenya. Attributional LCA analyses is undertaken to evaluate the potential GHG savings that may be achieved if briquettes produced from Kenyan biomass are used to replace fossil and traditional bioenergy fuels for household cooking and for industry.

New datasets on bicycling incidents are available via crowdsourcing applications, with opportunity for analyses that characterize reporting patterns. Our goal was to characterize patterns of injury in crowdsourced bicycle incident reports from BikeMaps.org. We extracted 281 incidents reported on the BikeMaps.org global mapping platform and analyzed 21 explanatory variables representing personal, trip, route, and crash characteristics. We used a balanced random forest classifier to classify three outcomes: (i) collisions resulting in injury requiring medical treatment; (ii) collisions resulting in injury but the bicyclist did not seek medical treatment; and (iii) collisions that did not result in injury. Results indicate the ranked importance and direction of relationship for explanatory variables. By knowing conditions that are most associated with injury we can target interventions to reduce future risk. The most important reporting pattern overall was the type of object the bicyclist collided with. Increased probability of injury requiring medical treatment was associated with collisions with animals, train tracks, transient hazards, and left-turning motor vehicles. Falls, right hooks, and doorings were associated with incidents where the bicyclist was injured but did not seek medical treatment, and conflicts with pedestrians and passing motor vehicles were associated with minor collisions with no injuries. In Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, bicycling safety would be improved by additional infrastructure to support safe left turns and around train tracks. Our findings support previous research using hospital admissions data that demonstrate how non-motor vehicle crashes can lead to bicyclist injury and that route characteristics and conditions are factors in bicycling collisions.

First, we compared CFSR precipitation against rain gauge measurements at an annual time step. Two models were set up, one with conventional gauge weather data obtained from the South African Weather Services (SAWS) and the Agricultural Research Council (ARC), and the other with CFSR data. Calibration and validation of the models were performed using Sequential Uncertainty Fitting ver.2 (SUFI-2) algorithm of the SWAT Calibration Uncertainties Program (SWAT- CUP) at five stream gauge sites, with the data split between 2003 to 2008 and 2009 to 2013 for calibration and validation respectively. A low statistical agreement between CFSR precipitation and rain gauge data was obtained. The model with gauge data slightly outperformed CFSR model before calibration and during validation, whereas CFSR performed better mainly during calibration. Overall, both models achieved fair simulations of streamflow and long-term monthly streamflow regime at both the main catchment outlet and interior sub-catchments.

Traditional approaches like manual survey investigate multiple factors, such as foot traffic, neighborhood structure, and available workforce, which are typically hard to measure. In this article, we propose to explore both satellite data (e.g., satellite images and nighttime light data) and urban data for business location selection tasks of various businesses. We extract discriminative features from the two kinds of data and perform empirical analysis to evaluate the correlation between extracted features and the business popularity of locations. A novel neural network approach named R2Net is proposed to learn deep interactions among features and predict the business popularity of locations. The proposed approach is trained with a regression-and-ranking combined loss function to preserve accurate popularity estimation and the ranking order of locations simultaneously. To support the location selection for multiple businesses, we propose an approach named AR2Net with three attention modules, which enable the approach to focus on different latent features according to business types. Comprehensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the satellite features are effective and our models outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms of four metrics. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.","Business location selection; Nighttime light; Satellite data; Satellite images","Neural networks; Satellites; Discriminative features; Location selection; Neighborhood structure; Night-time lights; Satellite data; Satellite images; State-of-the-art methods; Traditional approaches; Location",Article,Scopus

The farmers of irrigation projects incur more expenditure due to assured supply and suffer huge economic loss in dry years. In the present study, a water balance of reservoir for computation of runoff coupled with the application of spatially distributed Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, the SWAT model and SWAT–CUP application have been proposed for hydrological modeling can be used asses the inflows for efficient reservoir operation and planning of releases. The proposed methodology has been applied on Tandula reservoir catchment in Chhattisgarh state of India, which is well-known for its paddy cultivation and any short supply affect the economic status of marginal farmers in the command. The water balance of Tandula reservoir has been carried out for the period of 1991 to 2015 using daily reservoir levels, releases, evaporation, seepage, supplies from other sources, and spillway information. The percentage error in water balance analysis of Tandula reservoir varied between − 6.87 and 3.39% and seem reasonably well matched. The runoff obtained from water balance was checked with the SCS–CN technique and found close resemblance on the monthly and yearly basis. The digital image processing of remote sensing data has been used for determination of land uses and found that forest and agriculture land with rice cultivation are the principal land uses covering nearly 86% area of the catchment. The sensitivity analysis suggested that SCS curve number (r_CN2), saturated hydraulic conductivity (sol_k), soil antecedent water content (sol_AWC), and Manning’s N for the main channel (Ch_N2) are the most sensitive parameters. The sequential uncertainty fitting (SUFI2) technique has been used for calibration of model for the period of 1995 to 2007 and validated for 2008 to 2015. The model performance was adjudged using P-factor, r-factor, and Nash–Sutcliff efficiency, and best-fit model parameters were determined. The Nash–Sutcliff efficiency for calibration and validation were found as 0.75 and 0.65 respectively suggested that the developed model can be used for assessment of runoff from the catchment. The knowledge of the availability of water using the amalgamation of water balance, SWAT model, and SWAT CUP application can be used for reservoir operation, irrigation management, and assessment of the impact of climate and land use change on runoff from the catchment. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Efficiency; Hydrological modeling; SCS curve number; SWAT; Water balance","catchment; digital image; efficiency measurement; electrical conductivity; hydraulic conductivity; hydrological modeling; image processing; runoff; soil and water assessment tool; water budget; Chhattisgarh; India; Equus asinus",Article,Scopus

In this area, the nutritional management and the dairy control practices must be carefully analyzed, since they are directly related to the cows’ productivity in terms of quantity and quality of the milk produced by the animals. To the best of our knowledge, there is a research gap on proposing and evaluating computational models to automate and individualize the feeding of the animals and its impact on milk production. In this way, this work proposes the MooCare model, designed to assist producers in the management of dairy cattle, in order to obtain better productivity indexes. Using the Internet of Things devices, MooCare performs the automation and individualization of the animals feeding. Data gathered using such devices enable the MooCare scientific contribution, which consists of providing the milk production forecasting of each cow, using the ARIMA prediction engine. Thus, farmers can be notified in advance, so enabling them to react in terms of designing a better nutritional plan, which can be individualized for each cow. The evaluations comprise a simulation based on data of cow lactation obtained from a real farm. The experiments presented encouraging results since the assertiveness of the prediction indicated small differences if compared to the actual milk production.

The sustainability of groundwater is uncertain, as little is known about its extent and availability, a challenge that requires a quantitative assessment of its current use. This study assessed groundwater use for irrigated agriculture in the Venda-Gazankulu area of Limpopo Province in South Africa using crop evapotranspiration and irrigated crop area derived from the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). Evapotranspiration data was derived from the Water Productivity through Open access of Remotely sensed Actual Evapotranspiration and Interception (WaPOR) dataset (250 m resolution), and irrigated areas were characterised using dry season NDVI data derived from Landsat 8. Field surveys were conducted for four years to assess accuracy and for post-classification correction. Daily ET for the dry season (May to September) was developed from the actual ET for the irrigated areas. The irrigated areas were overlaid on the ET map to calculate ET for only irrigated land parcels. Groundwater use during the 2015 dry period was 3627.49 billion m3 and the irrigated area during the same period was 26% of cultivated land. About 82 435 ha of cultivated area was irrigated using 44 million m3/ha of water, compared to 186.93 million m3/ha on a rainfed area of 237 847 ha.

Leaf area has also been established as an important factor affecting water consumption. We analyzed a multivariable time series composed of both meteorological and vegetative variables with a daily temporal resolution for the growing seasons of 2013–2016 for Vitis vinfera ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ vineyards in the mountainous region in Israel. Time-series analysis of this data was used to characterize seasonal patterns affecting water consumption (ETc) of vines and to quantify interrelations between meteorological and vegetative factors affecting vine water consumption. Moreover, we applied a machine learning regression model to determine the relative influence of meteorological and vegetative factors on ETc during four growing seasons. Finally, we developed an ensemble model for temporally forecasting vine ETc for an additional season using a training dataset of multiple variables. Our findings show that decomposing the time-series dataset uncovered a wider variety of underlying temporal patterns, and enabled quantification of seasonal and daily relationships. Leaf area had a substantial impact on ETc and was found to have a relative influence ranging between 62 and 86% for the different growing seasons. Mean temperature was ranked second followed by minor effects of relative humidity, solar radiation and wind speed that were interchangeably ordered. The ensemble model produced reliable results, with cross validation coefficients ~ 0.9. Incorporating leaf area measurements into the regression model improved both the performance of the model and the training data correlation.

Even though superior bias correction methods can correct the distribution of daily precipitation amounts, as well as the wet-day frequency, they usually fail to correct the temporal sequence or structure of precipitation occurrence. To solve this problem, we presented a hybrid bias correction method for simulating the temporal sequence of daily precipitation occurrence. We did this by combining a first-order two-state Markov chain with a quantile-mapping (QM) based bias correction method. Specifically, a QM-based method was used to correct the distributional attributes of daily precipitation amounts and the wet-day frequency simulated by climate models. Then, the sequence of precipitation occurrence was simulated using the first-order two-state Markov chain with its parameters adjusted based on linear relationships between QM-corrected mean monthly precipitation and the transition probabilities of precipitation occurrence. The proposed Markov chain-based bias correction (MCBC) method was compared with the QM-based method with respect to reproducing the temporal structure of precipitation occurrence over 10 meteorological stations across China. The results showed that the QM-based method was unable to correct the temporal sequence, with the cumulative frequency of wet-and dry-spell length being considerably underestimated for most stations. The MCBC method can could reproduce the temporal sequence of precipitation occurrence, with the generated cumulative frequency of wet-and dry-spell lengths fitting that of the observation well. The proposed method also performed reasonably well with respect to reproducing the mean, standard deviation, and the longest length of observed wet-and dry-spells. Overall, the MCBC method can simulate the temporal sequence of precipitation occurrence, along with correcting the distributional attributes of precipitation amounts. This method can be used with crop and hydrological models in climate change impact studies at the field and small watershed scales. © 2020 by the authors.

This topic is currently relevant, as in the context of the rapid technological development and various innovations in the digital sphere; there is still considerable uncertainty about using AI in agricultural production. During the preparatory phase, an analysis of publications in the Web of Science (WoS) allowed to identify the nature and scope of the application of AI technologies in agriculture. Relying on a survey of managers from 55 agricultural organizations, the study determines the problems and prospects of using AI technologies in the regional agriculture. The respondents claim it is appropriate to use AI technologies for producing livestock products (26.0 %) and ensuring animal welfare (18.5 %). Considering the application of such technologies, the respondents expect an increase in production (23.2 %) and a decrease in costs (20.3 %). More than half of the respondents express their belief that AI technologists will significantly change agricultural production, reducing low-skilled labour employment while creating new jobs in the intellectual sphere. However, a positive perception of AI technologies may be the reason for somewhat unrealistic expectations from their use. A large part of the surveyed managers (65.5 %) presumes that these technologies will increase the production profitability, even though only 9.8 % of the respondents are currently using them. The application of AI technologies in the regional agriculture is limited due to their high cost and the lack of funds. In order to overcome these constraints, it is necessary to increase state support and train staff. AI technologies will enable forecast accuracy in various areas of agriculture that will attract additional investments in the regional agriculture.

When modeling yield, the difference between potential and actual yield consistently changes because of advances in technology. Considering historical yield potential would help determine spatiotemporal trends in agricultural development. Comparing current and historical yields in Denmark is possible because yield potential has been documented throughout history. However, the current national winter wheat yield map solely uses soil properties within the model. The aim of this study was to generate a new Danish winter wheat yield map and compare the results to historical yield potential. Utilizing random forest with soil, climate, and topography variables, a winter wheat yield map was generated from 876 field trials carried out from 1992 to 2018. The random forest model performed better than the model based only on soil. The updated national yield map was then compared to yield potential maps from 1688 and 1844. While historical time periods are characterized by numerous low yield potential areas and few highly productive areas, current yield is evenly distributed between low and high yields. Advances in technology and farm practices have exceeded historical yield predictions, mainly due to the use of fertilizer, irrigation, and drainage. Thus, modeling yield projections could be unreliable in the future as technology progresses. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

We focus on a historically water-rich, highly agricultural watershed in the US Midwest-theWabash River Basin. The results show likely increases in the frequency of soil moisture and hydrological drought, despite minimal changes in the frequency of meteorological drought. We use multiple linear regression models to interpret these results in the context of climate warming and show that increasing temperatures amplify soil moisture and hydrological drought, with the same amount of precipitation yielding significantly lower soil moisture and significantly lower runoff in the future than in the past.

This study aimed to quantify and map the dry matter yield (DMY) and nitrogen yield (NY) of French grasslands resulting from cutting and grazing practices, based on the existing diversity of grassland vegetation, management, soil and climate conditions, using a research version of the STICS crop model called PâturSTICS. This model simulates daily dry matter (DM), nitrogen (N) and water fluxes involved in the functioning of grasslands and crops in response to management and environmental conditions. It was improved to represent deposition of animal waste on grassland soils during grazing and to simulate DM production and N content of grasses and legumes more accurately. Simulations were performed for locations across France on a high-resolution grid composed of pedoclimatic units (PCU) obtained by combining the spatial resolutions of climate and soil. The main grassland types and associated management types were determined for each PCU and then simulated over 30 years (1984–2013). Using the simulated values, predictive metamodels of annual grassland DMY and NY were developed from easily accessible explanatory variables using a random forest approach. Annual model predictions were aggregated and averaged at the PCU scale, then compared to regional observations. Predicted DMY agreed with available observations, except in semi-mountainous and mountainous regions, where PâturSTICS tended to overpredict DMY, probably because it ignores effects of snow, frost and slope, and due to how it represents effects of temperature and water stress on plant growth. According to results, three-quarters of French grasslands produce and export at least 7.6 t DM ha−1 yr−1 and 172 kg N ha−1 yr−1, respectively. One-quarter of French grasslands produce and export at least 10.7 t DM ha−1 yr−1 and 254 kg N ha−1 yr−1, respectively. The latter are located mainly in north-western France, the north-western Massif Central, the French Alps and the western Pyrénées, all of which have environmental conditions favourable for grass growth. The metamodels developed are interesting proxies for PâturSTICS’ predictions of grassland DMY and NY. Our results provided valuable knowledge that promotes better use of the potential forage production of French and European grasslands to improve protein self-sufficiency and N fertilisation management in ruminant livestock systems. © 2019","Dry matter yield; France; Grassland; Modelling; Nitrogen yield; STICS","agricultural modeling; crop yield; dry matter; environmental conditions; grassland; nitrogen; resolution; water stress; Alps; France; Massif Central; Pyrenees; Animalia; Poaceae",Article,Scopus

However, due to the hybridization of numerous parents and the low production rate of haploid, the haploid data collection becomes a burden for engineering this technology. Biologically, there are considerable similarities between the progeny of the same female parent and different male parents. Based on this advantage, similar spectral data can be transferred when the NIR technology is employed. A revised method of Transfer adaptive boost (TrAdaBoost) is proposed to improve identifying for the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) classifier. To avoid the negative transfer, a screening thresh is used to select out similar data, and the amount of these data are limited to join current training. The results show that the identification performances are improved significantly when the data amount is small. This method shows a high ability to make the seed identification more convenient for engineering maize haploid breeding. © 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","backpropagation neural network; data transfer; maize haploid seed identification; near-infrared diffuse transmittance; TrAdaBoost",,Article,Scopus

The ability of thermal remote sensing to detect nitrogen deficiency in corn may enable precision agriculture to modify nitrogen rates according to field conditions. This study applies the exergy destruction principle as a theory to explain the inverse relationship between surface temperature and nitrogen rate. Two hypotheses were developed. First, it was hypothesized that agricultural crops experiencing greater growth and providing greater yield will have lower surface temperature. The second hypothesis was that corn grown under optimum levels of nitrogen will have lower surface temperatures compared to corn grown under nitrogen stressed conditions. Field studies were conducted during two summer seasons (2016 and 2017) on an established long-term field trial of corn yield response to varying rates of nitrogen. It was found that corn surface temperature decreased as the rate of nitrogen increased. A shallow but statistically significant (P < 0.05) negative slope was observed consistently with increasing rates of nitrogen. Surface temperature measurements, however, were variable. This variability was the result of external and weather dependent variables that influenced leaf surface temperature. Despite this variability, the exergy destruction principle provides a theory from which thermal remote sensing can be applied through the use of surface temperature measurements to detect physiological stress in crop plants. © 2019 The author(s)publisher.",,,Article,Scopus

Current research has been conducted to estimate and map soil nutrient contents in large areas using hyper-spectral techniques, however, it is difficult to obtain accurate estimates. In order to improve the estimation accuracy of soil nutrient contents, we introduced a GA-BPNN method, which combined a back propagation neural network (BPNN) with the genetic algorithm optimization (GA). This study was conducted in Guangdong, China, based on soil nutrient contents and hyperspectral data. The prediction accuracies from a partial least squares regression (PLSR), BPNN and GA-BPNN were compared using field observations. The results showed that (1) Among three methods, the GA-BPNN provided the most accurate estimates of soil total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and total potassium (TK) contents; (2) Compared with the BPNN models, the GA-BPNN models significantly improved the estimation accuracies of the soil nutrient contents by decreasing the relative root mean square error (RRMSE) values by 15.9%, 5.6% and 20.2% at the sample point level, and 20.1%, 16.5% and 47.1% at the regional scale for TN, TP and TK, respectively. This indicated that by optimizing the parameters of BPNN, the GA-BPNN provided greater potential to improving the estimation; and (3) Soil TK content could be more accurately mapped by the GA-BPNN method using HuanJing-1A Hyperspectral Imager (HJ-1A HSI) (manufacturer: China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation; Beijing, China) data with a RRMSE value of 20.37% than the soil TN and TP with the RRMSE values of 40.41% and 34.71%, respectively. This implied that the GA-BPNN model provided the potential to map the soil TK content for the large area.

Additionally, climate extremes have recently highlighted the vulnerability of the agricultural system to climate variability. This study seeks to fill two important gaps in current knowledge: how irrigation impacts the large-scale response of crops to varying climate conditions and how we can explicitly account for uncertainty in yield response to climate. To address these, we developed a statistical model to quantitatively estimate historical and future impacts of climate change and irrigation on US county-level crop yields with uncertainty explicitly treated. Historical climate and crop yield data for 1970-2009 were used over different growing regions to fit the model, and five CMIP5 climate projections were applied to simulate future crop yield response to climate. Maize and spring wheat yields are projected to experience decreasing trends with all models in agreement. Winter wheat yields in the Northwest will see an increasing trend. Results for soybean and winter wheat in the South are more complicated, as irrigation can change the trend in projected yields. The comparison between projected crop yield time series for rainfed and irrigated cases indicates that irrigation can buffer against climate variability that could lead to negative yield anomalies. Through trend analysis of the predictors, the trend in crop yield is mainly driven by projected trends in temperature-related indices, and county-level trend analysis shows regional differences are negligible. This framework provides estimates of the impact of climate and irrigation on US crop yields for the 21st century that account for the full uncertainty of climate variables and the range of crop response. The results of this study can contribute to decision making about crop choice and water use in an uncertain future climate. © 2019 The Author(s).

DL comprises a wide variety of algorithms which depend on numerous hyperparameters. Careful optimization of hyperparameter values is critical to avoid overfitting. Among the DL architectures currently tested in genomic prediction, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) seem more promising than multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). A limitation of DL is in interpreting the results. This may not be relevant for genomic prediction in plant or animal breeding but can be critical when deciding the genetic risk to a disease. Although DL technologies are not ”plug-and-play”, they are easily implemented using Keras and TensorFlow public software.

Therefore, robust, fast, and automated algorithms are highly required to obtain reliable image segmentation results. This research was aimed to develop efficient unsupervised clustering algorithms for oilseed rape image segmentation in the field. The Naïve Bayes rule was first employed to select a supreme color feature from ten color models. An initialization approach based on the genetic algorithm (GA) was then used to define the initial cluster centroids for subsequent Gaussian mixture model (GMM), self-organizing map (SOM), fuzzy c-mean (FCM), and k-means algorithms. The length of the chromosome was determined using cluster validity indices. Finally, the performances of these algorithms were evaluated based on the image segmentation quality and computation time. After testing the proposed method on the image datasets from two fields, the results revealed that the highest segmentation accuracy of 96% was obtained using the optimized SOM and the lowest computation time was obtained using the k-means. The GA-based initialization speeded up the convergence process and ensured consistent labeling between runs.

The evidence is provided by long-term observations of weather and insurance records that are also a foundation for the majority of insurance products covering weather related damages. The insurers around the world are concerned, however, that the past records used to assess and price the risks underestimate the risk and incurred losses in recent years. The growing insurance risks are largely attributed to climate change that brings increasingly more alterations and permanent impact on all aspects of human life and welfare. From floods to hail to excessive wind, adverse atmospheric events are a poignant reminder of how vulnerable our society is across a broad range of threats posed by environmental extremes. Indeed, as climate change effects become more pronounced, we face a new era of risk with increasing weather related damages and losses. This in turn, coupled with challenges of massive climatic data, requires developing innovative analytic approaches that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries of statistical, actuarial and environmental sciences. Nevertheless, the multidisciplinary nature of climate risk assessment and its impact on insurance is often overlooked and neglected.

In this paper, crop models are distilled by CNN to evaluate the ability of deep learning to identify the plant physiology knowledge behind such crop models simply by learning. Due to difficulty in collecting big data on crop growth, a crop model was used to generate datasets. The generated datasets were fed into CNN for distillation of the crop model. The models trained by CNN were evaluated by the visualization of saliency maps. In this study, three saliency maps were calculated using all datasets (case 1) and using datasets with spikelet sterility due to either high temperature at anthesis (case 2) or cool summer damage (case 3). The results of case 1 indicated that CNN determined the developmental index of paddy rice, which was implemented in the crop model, simply by learning. Moreover, CNN identified the important individual environmental factors affecting the grain yield. Although CNN had no prior knowledge of spikelet sterility, cases 2 and 3 indicated that CNN realized about paddy rice becoming sensitive to daily mean and maximum temperatures during specific periods. Such deep learning approaches can be used to accelerate the understanding of crop models and make the models more portable. Moreover, the results indicated that CNN can be used to develop new plant physiology theories simply by learning. © 2019 Kyosuke Yamamoto.

However, the representation of freeze-thaw cycles has been often simplified in large scale watershed models. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which has been widely used to understand and assess hydrologic budgets and water resources management, employs a simplified empirical approach to estimate soil temperature and determine the freezing and thawing status of soils. Here, we compared the performance of a physically-based soil temperature module and the built-in empirical approach in SWAT against field measurements at surface and 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 cm depths at six stations of the U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) within the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). In general, SWAT consistently underestimated winter soil temperatures and overestimated frozen days at all soil depths, while the modified version of SWAT (equipped with the physically-based soil temperature model; referred to as TSWAT) pronouncedly reduced the bias in estimated winter soil temperatures and frozen days compared with SWAT. Model performance assessment is conducted with three statistical coefficients, i.e., Bias (°C), the coefficient of determination (R 2 ), and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS). Statistical analyses show that TSWAT accurately simulated surface and soil temperatures at the five depths with R 2 and NS values greater than 0.82 at most sites, and Bias values were generally within the range of −1 to 1 °C during winter and ranged between −2.09 and 2.58 °C in non-winter seasons. The differences in freeze-thaw cycle representation between SWAT and TSWAT translate into noticeable discrepancies in simulated key hydrologic variables, such as surface runoff, percolation, and baseflow. Compared against long-term observed streamflow (1980–2015), TSWAT outperformed SWAT in capturing variations in monthly streamflow in both winter and non-winter seasons. These results and analyses highlight the value of improving freeze-thaw cycle representation for enhanced hydrologic modeling in large watersheds that are subject to freeze-thaw cycles. © 2019","Freeze-thaw cycles; Soil temperature; Streamflow; SWAT","Budget control; Freezing; Soils; Solvents; Stream flow; Temperature; Thawing; Water resources; Watersheds; Coefficient of determination; Freeze-thaw cycles; Model performance assessments; Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient; Soil and water assessment tool; Soil temperature; SWAT; Water resources management; Coefficient of performance; freeze-thaw cycle; hydrological modeling; performance assessment; simulation; soil and water assessment tool; soil depth; soil temperature; statistical analysis; streamflow; Mississippi River; United States",Article,Scopus

Methods: We developed models to predict indoor PM2.5 concentrations for pregnant women who were part of a randomized controlled trial of portable air cleaners in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. We used multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest regression (RFR) to model indoor PM2.5 concentrations with 447 independent 7-day PM2.5 measurements and 87 potential predictor variables obtained from outdoor monitoring data, questionnaires, home assessments, and geographic data sets. We also developed blended models that combined the MLR and RFR approaches. All models were evaluated in a 10-fold cross-validation. Results: The predictors in the MLR model were season, outdoor PM2.5 concentration, the number of air cleaners deployed, and the density of gers (traditional felt-lined yurts) surrounding the apartments. MLR and RFR had similar performance in cross-validation (R2 = 50.2%, R2 = 48.9% respectively). The blended MLR model that included RFR predictions had the best performance (cross validation R2 = 81.5%). Intervention status alone explained only 6.0% of the variation in indoor PM2.5 concentrations. Conclusions: We predicted a moderate amount of variation in indoor PM2.5 concentrations using easily obtained predictor variables and the models explained substantially more variation than intervention status alone. While RFR shows promise for modelling indoor concentrations, our results highlight the importance of out-of-sample validation when evaluating model performance. We also demonstrate the improved performance of blended MLR/RFR models in predicting indoor air pollution.

This study estimated the potential impacts of the projected precipitation and temperature based on the downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP-5) on hydrology and crop yield of a rural watershed in Oklahoma, USA. The Soil andWater Assessment Tool was used to model the watershed with 43 sub-basins and 15,217 combinations of land use, land cover, soil, and slope. The model was driven by the observed climate in the watershed and was first calibrated and validated against the monthly observed streamflow. Three statistical matrices, coefficient of determination (R 2 ), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and percentage bias (PB), were used to gauge the model performance with satisfactory values of R 2 = 0.64, NS = 0.61, and PB = +5% in the calibration period, and R 2 = 0.79, NSE = 0.62, and PB = -15% in the validation period for streamflow. The model parameterization for the yields of cotton (PB = -4.5%), grain sorghum (PB = -27.3%), and winter wheat (PB = -6.0%) resulted in an acceptable model performance. The CMIP-5 ensemble of three General Circulation Models under three Representative Concentration Pathways for the 2016-2040 period indicated an increase in both precipitation (+1.5%) and temperature (+1.8 °C) in the study area. This changed climate resulted in decreased evapotranspiration (-3.7%), increased water yield (23.9%), decreased wheat yield (-5.2%), decreased grain sorghum yield (-9.9%), and increased cotton yield (+54.2%) compared to the historical climate. The projected increase in water yield might provide opportunities for groundwater recharge and additional water to meet future water demand in the region. The projected decrease in winter wheat yield-the major crop in the state-due to climate change, may require attention for ways to mitigate these effects. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Crop yield; Global climate models; Southern Great Plains; Surface runoff; SWAT","Climate change; Cotton; Crops; Grain (agricultural product); Land use; Recharging (underground waters); Stream flow; Watersheds; Crop yield; Global climate model; Southern great plains; Surface runoffs; SWAT; Climate models; climate change; climate modeling; CMIP; cotton; crop yield; evapotranspiration; global climate; groundwater; precipitation (climatology); runoff; soil analysis; soil and water assessment tool; sorghum; streamflow; water demand; water yield; watershed; wheat; winter; Oklahoma [United States]; United States; Gossypium hirsutum; Sorghum bicolor bicolor; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

In this study, water consumption for irrigated agriculture was estimated across the U.S. to improve understanding of water budgets in different regions. Published data on cropping patterns and water application were used in conjunction with a national-scale analysis to estimate water application and crop water consumption using the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) watershed model. Crop water consumption estimates were based on evapotranspiration, with supporting information on the diversity of crops, irrigated area, water quantity and source, and local weather conditions. Quantification of water consumption supports broader analyses of the food-energy-water nexus and allows evaluation of the efficiency of irrigation water use at different spatial scales. Focusing on 2005 data, it is estimated that 60% of water reported as withdrawn from various sources is applied to fields, indicating a potentially large and poorly understood conveyance loss that occurs in a small number of states. Of the field-applied irrigation water, roughly 65% is directly used by crops or is lost in the field, with large regional variations. This may be compared to consumption estimates in prior studies that ranged from 16% to 90%. Areas that dominate the national aggregate estimate of crop water consumption include California’s Central and Imperial Valleys, areas overlying the Ogallala Aquifer in the central U.S., the Lower Colorado Basin, and the eastern part of the Pacific Northwest Basin. © 2019 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers","Crop water use; Irrigated agriculture; SWAT; Water withdrawal; Watershed model","Aquifers; Budget control; Crops; Groundwater resources; Irrigation; Watersheds; Crop water use; Irrigated agriculture; SWAT; Water withdrawal; Watershed modeling; Water supply; estimation method; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; soil and water assessment tool; water use; watershed; California; Central Valley [California]; Colorado Basin [North America]; Imperial Valley; Ogallala Aquifer; Pacific Northwest; United States",Article,Scopus

This heterogeneity often arises from landscape elements like forests, hedges, or single trees and shrubs that cast shadows. Shading from forested areas or shrubs has effects on transpiration, temperature, and soil moisture, all of which affect the crop yield in the adjacent arable land. Transitional gradients of solar irradiance can be described as a function of the distance to the zero line (edge), the cardinal direction, and the height of trees. The magnitude of yield reduction in transition zones is highly influenced by solar irradiance—a factor that is not yet implemented in crop growth models on a landscape level. We present a spatially explicit model for shading caused by forested areas, in agricultural landscapes. With increasing distance to forest, solar irradiance and yield increase. Our model predicts that the shading effect from the forested areas occurs up to 15 m from the forest edge, for the simulated wheat yields, and up to 30 m, for simulated maize. Moreover, we estimated the spatial extent of transition zones, to calculate the regional yield reduction caused by shading of the forest edges, which amounted to 5% to 8% in an exemplary region. © 2019 by the authors.

In the recent two decades, the number of models has grown rapidly, but the increase in their quality does not match the growth in number. Often, an ensemble of multiple models is required to make a useful prediction. This ensemble approach does not facilitate the improvement of models as a tool to understand crop physiological mechanisms. On the other hand, following a bottom-up approach that tries to assemble all elements along different scales of biological organisation may result in numerically clumsy models that are not necessarily more robust than existing models in simulating phenotypes at the crop scale. We argue that to model complex crop phenotypes in a simple yet accurate manner, crop modellers should be inspired by experiences in some fundamental sciences. For example, physicists used sound theories and solid mathematics in thought experiments, and came up with seemingly simple equations to explain the behaviour of very diverse systems, from sub-atomic particles to the largest clusters of galaxies. We review examples, where biological insights and mathematics are combined to derive simple equations that apply to different processes of crop growth. The essence of this modelling approach is a combination of simplicity, elegance and robustness. Models integrating those equations can predict crop phenotypes as well as generate hypotheses or emerging properties to assist in knowing the unknowns. Thus, crop models should not only provide practical predictions, but should especially be considered as a research tool for data interpretation, system design, and heuristic understanding. © 2021 The Author(s)","Algorithm simplicity; Crop model improvement; Model heuristics; Systems behaviour","crop performance; mathematics; numerical model; phenotype; physiology",Review,Scopus

Despite this, plant diseases and unfavorable weather patterns continue to threaten the delicate balance between vegetable production and consumption. It is critical to utilize machine learning (ML) in this setting because it provides context for decision-making related to breeding goals. Cutting-edge technologies for crop genome sequencing and phenotyping, combined with advances in computer science, are currently fueling a revolution in vegetable science and technology. Additionally, various ML techniques such as prediction, classification, and clustering are frequently used to forecast vegetable crop production in the field. In the vegetable seed industry, machine learning algorithms are used to assess seed quality before germination and have the potential to improve vegetable production with desired features significantly; whereas, in plant disease detection and management, the ML approaches can improve decision-support systems that assist in converting massive amounts of data into valuable recommendations. On similar lines, in vegetable breeding, ML approaches are helpful in predicting treatment results, such as what will happen if a gene is silenced. Furthermore, ML approaches can be a saviour to insufficient coverage and noisy data generated using various omics platforms.

Limited hydroclimate and yield data, however, hamper drought impact monitoring and assessment at the farm field scale. This study demonstrates the potential of using field-scale soil moisture simulations to support highresolution agricultural yield prediction and drought monitoring at the smallholder farm field scale. We present a multiscale modeling approach that combines HydroBlocks a physically based hyper-resolution land surface model (LSM) with machine learning. We used HydroBlocks to simulate root zone soil moisture and soil temperature in Zambia at 3 h 30 m resolution. These simulations, along with remotely sensed vegetation indices, meteorological data, and descriptors of the physical landscape (related to topography, land cover, and soils) were combined with district-level maize data to train a random forest (RF) model to predict maize yields at district and field scales (250 m). Our model predicted yields with an average testing coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.57 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 310 kgha-1 using year-based cross-validation. Our predicted maize losses due to the 2015 2016 El Niño drought agreed well with losses reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Our results reveal that soil moisture is the strongest and most reliable predictor of maize yield, driving its spatial and temporal variability. Soil moisture was also a more effective indicator of drought impacts on crops than precipitation, soil and air temperatures, and remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based drought indices.

To better quantify the responses of crop yield to hydrological variability in the rainfed Corn Belt of the United States (U.S.), we analyzed the relationships between corn/soybean yield and hydrological cycle metrics, as well as their spatio-temporal dynamic at the agricultural district and interannual scale between 2003 and 2014. We used Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) to optimally integrate different hydrological metrics and drought indices to define a crop-specific new drought index that uses crop yield as the target, and investigated the contributions of those hydrological cycle components to the new drought index. We used both observed and modeled hydrological cycle metrics, as well as several drought indices in this study, including evapotranspiration (ET) and potential ET (PET), terrestrial water storage change (ΔS), surface soil moisture (SSM), river discharge (Q), Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), fET (the ratio of ET to PET), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Our results revealed that: (1) VPD, SSM, and fET showed the strongest correlations with crop yield, among the observation-based hydrological cycle metrics and drought indices considered here. Most of the hydrological cycle metrics and drought indices showed similar seasonal correlation patterns with crop yield, and this pattern revealed that the sensitivity of crop growth to water stress peaked in July for corn and in August for soybean in the rainfed U.S. Corn Belt. (2) The drought in 2012 started with higher water demand (reflected in abnormally high ET, PET, and VPD) and lower water supply (reflected in abnormally low P), followed by soil water depletion (as revealed in SSM and ΔS), leading to massive crop yield losses due to increased constraints on both water supply and demand. (3) The R2 of the PLSR-based crop yield model reached 0.76 and 0.70 for corn and soybean, respectively. For both corn and soybean, the first PLSR component was mainly composed of information from VPD, fET, ΔS and SSM, indicating atmospheric water deficit and soil water storage both play critical roles in quantifying corn and soybean yield loss due to water stress. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Crop yield; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Groundwater; Soil moisture; U.S. Corn Belt; VPD","Agricultural robots; Drought; Economics; Evapotranspiration; Plants (botany); Soil moisture; Water supply; Hydrological variability; Palmer drought severity indices; Partial least square regression; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Surface soil moisture; Terrestrial water storage; Vapor pressure deficit; Water supply and demands; Crops; agrometeorology; connectivity; crop yield; drought stress; evapotranspiration; hydrological cycle; least squares method; precipitation assessment; rainfed agriculture; seasonality; soil water; soybean; water storage; Corn Belt; United States; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Thus, accurate and timely information on wheat production can help mitigate food price fluctuations. Within the existing operational regional and global scale agricultural monitoring systems that provide information on global crop yield and area forecasts, there are still fundamental gaps: #1. Lack of quantitative Earth Observation (EO) derived crop information, #2. Lack of global but detailed (national or subnational level) and timely crop production forecasts and #3. Lack of information on forecast uncertainties. In this study we present the Agriculture Remotely-sensed Yield Algorithm (ARYA) an EO-based method, advancing the state of EO-data application and usage (addressing gap #1) to forecast wheat yield. The algorithm is based on the evolution of the Difference Vegetation Index (DVI) using MODIS data at 1 km resolution and the Growing Degree Days (GDD) from reanalysis data. Additionally, we explore how Land Surface Temperature (LST) can be included into the model and whether this parameter adds any value to the model performance when combined with the optical information. ARYA is implemented at the national and subnational level to forecast winter wheat yield in the main wheat exporting countries of US, Russia, Ukraine, France, Germany, Australia and Argentina from 2001 to 2019 (covering over 70% of wheat exports globally) in a timely manner by providing daily forecasts (addressing gap #2).

This means that ARYA can provide crop yield estimates of wheat yield with 5–15% error at national and 7–20% error at subnational level starting from 2 to 2.5 months prior to harvest. © 2021 The Author(s)","Agriculture; DVI; LST; MODIS; Wheat; Yield forecast","algorithm; crop production; crop yield; export; food market; forecasting method; MODIS; remote sensing; wheat",Article,Scopus

First, formulated with the multibranch high-resolution capsule network architecture assisted by multiscale feature propagation and fusion, the SAHR-CapsNet can extract semantically strong and spatially accurate feature semantics at multiple scales. Second, integrated with the efficient capsule-based self-attention module, the SAHR-CapsNet functions promisingly to attend to target-specific spatial features and informative channel features. Finally, adopted with the capsule-based sparse anchoring network, the SAHR-CapsNet performs efficiently in generating a fixed number of lightweight, high-quality sparse region proposals.

This study applied the Soil and Water Assessment Tool and the threshold drainage area (TDA) technique to evaluate the impacts of watershed subdivision on hydrological simulations at a 5,913-km2 Arctic watershed, Målselv. The watershed was discretized according to four TDA scheme scales including 200, 2,000, 5,000, and 10,000 ha. The impacts of different TDA schemes on hydrological simulations in water balance components, snowmelt runoff, and stream-flow were investigated. The study revealed that the complexity of terrain and topographic attributes altered significantly in the coarse discretizations: (1) total stream length (47.2 to 74.6%); (2) average stream slope (68 to 83%); and (3) drainage density (24.2 to 51.5%). The spatial density of weather grid integration reduced from 5 to 33.33% in the coarse schemes. The annual mean potential evapo-transpiration, evapotranspiration, and lateral flow slightly decreased, while areal rainfall, surface runoff, and water yield slightly increased with the increases of TDAs. It was concluded that the fine TDAs produced finer and higher ranges of snowmelt runoff volume across the watershed. All TDAs had similar capacities to replicate the observed tendency of monthly mean streamflow hydrograph, except overestimated/underestimated peak flows. Spatial variation of streamflow was well analyzed in the fine schemes with high density of stream networks, while the coarse schemes simplified this. Watershed subdivisions affected model performances, in the way of decreasing the accuracy of monthly streamflow simulation, at 60% of investigated hydro-gauging stations (3/5 stations) and in the upstream. Furthermore, watershed subdivisions strongly affected the calibration process regarding the changes in sensitivity ranking of 18 calibrated model parameters and time it took to calibrate. © 2021 The Authors.","Arctic watershed Målselv; Hydrological simulations; Snowmelt runoff; SWAT; Threshold drainage area (TDA); Watershed subdivisions","Evapotranspiration; Rivers; Runoff; Snow melting systems; Stream flow; Arctic watershed malselv; Drainage area; Hydrological simulations; Norwegian Arctic; Snowmelt runoff; Spatial densities; SWAT; Threshold drainage area; Watershed subdivision; Weather inputs; Watersheds; drainage basin; hydrological modeling; quantitative analysis; runoff; snowmelt; soil and water assessment tool; spatial variation; watershed; weather; Arctic; Norway",Article,Scopus

For many of those applications, precise knowledge of the distribution of crop types is essential. Various machine and deep learning models have been used for automated crop classification using microwave remote sensing time series. However, the application of these approaches on a large spatial and temporal scale is barely investigated. In this study, the performance of two frequently used algorithms, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forest (RF), for crop classification based on Sentinel-1 time series and meteorological data on a large spatial and temporal scale is assessed. For data from Austria, the Netherlands, and France and the years 2015–2019, scenarios with different spatial and temporal scales were defined. To quantify the complexity of these scenarios, the Fisher Discriminant measurement F1 (FDR1) was used. The results demonstrate that both classifiers achieve similar results for simple classification tasks with low FDR1 values. With increasing FDR1 values, however, LSTM networks outperform RF. This suggests that the ability of LSTM networks to learn long-term dependencies and identify the relation between radar time series and meteorological data becomes increasingly important for more complex applications. Thus, the study underlines the importance of deep learning models, including LSTM networks, for large-scale applications. © 2021 by the authors.

First, ascertain the important variables that predict tomato yields from plant height (PH) and vegetation index (VI) maps. The maps were derived from images taken by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Second, examine the accuracy of predictions of tomato fresh shoot masses (SM), fruit weights (FW), and the number of fruits (FN) from multiple machine learning algorithms using selected variable sets. To realize our objective, ultra-high-resolution RGB and multispectral images were collected by a UAV on ten days in 2020’s tomato growing season. From these images, 756 total variables, including first- (e.g., average, standard deviation, skewness, range, and maximum) and second-order (e.g., gray-level co-occurrence matrix features and growth rates of PH and VIs) statistics for each plant, were extracted. Several selection algorithms (i.e., Boruta, DALEX, genetic algorithm, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and recursive feature elimination) were used to select the variable sets useful for predicting SM, FW, and FN. Random forests, ridge regressions, and support vector machines were used to predict the yield using the top five selected variable sets. Results: First-order statistics of PH and VIs collected during the early to mid-fruit formation periods, about one month prior to harvest, were important variables for predicting SM. Similar to the case for SM, variables collected approximately one month prior to harvest were important for predicting FW and FN. Furthermore, variables related to PH were unimportant for prediction. Compared with predictions obtained using only first-order statistics, those obtained using the second-order statistics of VIs were more accurate for FW and FN. The prediction accuracy of SM, FW, and FN by models constructed from all variables (rRMSE = 8.8–28.1%) was better than that from first-order statistics (rRMSE = 10.0–50.1%). Conclusions: In addition to basic statistics (e.g., average and standard deviation), we derived second-order statistics of PH and VIs at the plant level using the ultra-high resolution UAV images. Our findings indicated that our variable selection method reduced the number variables needed for tomato yield prediction, improving the efficiency of phenotypic data collection and assisting with the selection of high-yield lines within breeding programs. © 2021, The Author(s).","Gray-level co-occurrence matrix; Machine learning; Plant-level; Tomato yield prediction; Unmanned aerial vehicle",,Article,Scopus

The use of machine learning algorithms for the classification of leaf wetness measurements from 30 meteorological stations in North Western Europe during the period of January 2014 to October 2018 was assessed in this study.

Increasing the relative humidity threshold led to an average increase in the classification accuracy of 1.12%. The use of machine learning classification algorithms consistently provided more accurate results for the prediction of leaf wetness when compared to the empirical models that were studied with an average increase in the classification accuracy of 4.85%. The sub-division of the data into regional subsets had a greater effect on the accuracy of the models than the temporal sub-division of the data.

A high-throughput phenotyping platform (HTPP) generates the data of the complete life cycle of a plant. However, the data are rarely used for yield prediction because of the lack of quality image analysis methods, yield data associated with HTPP, and the time-series analysis method for yield prediction. To overcome limitations, this study employed multiple deep learning (DL) networks to extract high-quality HTTP data, establish an association between HTTP data and the yield performance of crops, and select essential time intervals using machine learning (ML). The images of Arabidopsis were taken 12 times under environmentally controlled HTPP over 23 days after sowing (DAS). First, the features from images were extracted using DL network U-Net with SE-ResXt101 encoder and divided into early (15–21 DAS) and late (∼21–23 DAS) pre-flowering developmental stages using the physiological characteristics of the Arabidopsis plant. Second, the late pre-flowering stage at 23 DAS can be predicted using the ML algorithm XGBoost, based only on a portion of the early pre-flowering stage (17–21 DAS). This was confirmed using an additional biological experiment (P < 0.01). Finally, the projected area (PA) was estimated into fresh weight (FW), and the correlation coefficient between FW and predicted FW was calculated as 0.85. This was the first study that analyzed time-series data to predict the FW of related but different developmental stages and predict the PA. The results of this study were informative and enabled the understanding of the FW of Arabidopsis or yield of leafy plants and total biomass consumed in vertical farming. Moreover, this study highlighted the reduction of time-series data for examining interesting traits and future application of time-series analysis in various HTPPs.

By knowing the symptoms, severity, and spatial distribution of CLR, farmers can improve disease management procedures and reduce losses associated with it. Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)-based images, in conjunction with machine learning (ML) techniques, helped solve multiple agriculture-related problems. In this sense, vegetation indices processed with ML algorithms are a promising strategy. It is still a challenge to map severity levels of CLR using remote sensing data and an ML approach. Here we propose a framework to detect CLR severity with only vegetation indices extracted from UAV imagery. For that, we based our approach on decision tree models, as they demonstrated important results in related works. We evaluated a coffee field with different infestation classes of CLR: class 1 (from 2% to 5% rust); class 2 (from 5% to 10% rust); class 3 (from 10% to 20% rust), and; class 4 (from 20% to 40% rust). We acquired data with a Sequoia camera, producing images with a spatial resolution of 10.6 cm, in four spectral bands: green (530–570 nm), red (640–680 nm), red-edge (730–740 nm), and near-infrared (770–810 nm). A total of 63 vegetation indices was extracted from the images, and the following learners were evaluated in a cross-validation method with 10 folders: Logistic Model Tree (LMT); J48; ExtraTree; REPTree; Functional Trees (FT); Random Tree (RT), and; Random Forest (RF). The results indicated that the LMT method contributed the most to the accurate prediction of early and several infestation classes. For these classes, LMT returned F-measure values of 0.915 and 0.875, thus being a good indicator of early CLR (2 to 5% of rust) and later stages of CLR (20 to 40% of rust). We demonstrated a valid approach to model rust in coffee plants using only vegetation indices and ML algorithms, specifically for the disease's early and later stages. We concluded that the proposed framework allows inferring the predicted classes in remaining plants within the sampled area, thus helping the identification of potential CLR in non-sampled plants. We corroborate that the decision tree-based model may assist in precision agriculture practices, including mapping rust in coffee plantations, providing both an efficient non-invasive and spatially continuous monitoring of the disease. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Logistic model tree; Multispectral imagery; Plant disease; Precision agriculture","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Decision trees; Infrared devices; Machine learning; Precision agriculture; Random forests; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Coffee plantation; Leaf rust; Logistic model tree; Logistics model; Machine learning algorithms; Model trees; Multispectral imagery; Plant disease; Precision Agriculture; Vegetation index; Remote sensing; coffee; machine learning; mapping; precision agriculture; remote sensing; rust disease; spatial distribution; vegetation; Indicator indicator; Sequoia",Article,Scopus

The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) system on board the International Space Station (ISS) is the latest FW spaceborne LiDAR instrument for the continuous observation of Earth's forests. FW systems rely on very sophisticated pre-processing steps to generate a priori metrics in order to leverage their capabilities for the accurate estimation of the aforementioned forest characteristics. The ever-expanding volume of acquired GEDI data, which to date comprises more than 25 billion acquired unfiltered shots, and along with the pre-processed data, amounting to more than 90 TB of data, raises new challenges in terms of adapted preprocessing methods for the suitable exploitation of such a huge and complex amount of LiDAR data. To overcome the issues related to the generation of relevant metrics from GEDI data, we propose a new metric-free approach to estimate canopy dominant heights (Hdom) and wood volume (V) of Eucalyptus plantations over five different regions in Brazil. To avoid metric computation, we leverage deep learning techniques and, more in detail, convolutional neural networks with the aim to analyze the GEDI Level 1B geolocated waveforms. Performance comparisons were conducted between four convolutional neural network (CNN) variants using GEDI waveform data (either untouched, or subsetted) and a metric based Random Forest regressor (RF). Additionally, we tested if our framework can improve the generalization of the models to different distant regions. First, the models were trained using data from all the study regions. Cross validated results showed that the CNN based models compared well against their RF counterpart for both Hdom and V. The RMSE on the estimation of Hdom from the CNN based models varied between 1.54 and 1.94 m with a coefficient of determination (R2) between 0.86 and 0.91, while the RF model produced an accuracy on Hdom estimates of 1.45 m (R2 = 0.92). For V, CNN based estimations ranged from 27.76 to 33.33 m3.ha−1 (R2 between 0.82 and 0.88), while for RF, the RMSE was 27.61 m3.ha−1 (R2 = 0.88). Next, model generalization was assessed by means of a spatial transfer experiment. For Hdom, both the CNN and RF approaches showed similar performances to a global model, however, the CNN based approach showed higher variability on the estimation accuracy, and the variability was related to the forest structure between the trained and tested data (similar tree heights yield better accuracies). For the estimation of V, considering both approaches, the accuracy was dependent on the allometric relationship between Hdom and V in the training and testing regions while lower accuracies on V were obtained when the testing and training regions exhibited a different allometric relationship. © 2021","Brazil; Convolutional neural networks; Dominant height; Eucalyptus; GEDI; Lidar; Wood volume","Convolution; Decision trees; Deep learning; Earth (planet); Neural networks; Wood; Brazil; Convolutional neural network; Dominant height; Ecosystem dynamics; Eucalypti; Full-waveforms; Global ecosystem dynamic investigation; Network-based approach; Random forests; Wood volume; Optical radar; accuracy assessment; allometry; biophysics; canopy architecture; data processing; ecosystem dynamics; estimation method; lidar; vertical profile; waveform analysis; wood; Brazil; Eucalyptus",Article,Scopus

The insufficient knowledge of the whole agricultural production system and conventional ways of irrigation have limited agricultural yields in the past. The remote sensing innovations recently implemented in agriculture have dramatically revolutionized production efficiency by offering unparalleled opportunities for convenient, versatile, and quick collection of land images to collect critical details on the crop’s conditions. These innovations have enabled automated data collection, simulation, and interpretation based on crop analytics facilitated by deep learning techniques. This paper aims to reveal the transformative patterns of old Chinese agrarian development and fruit production by focusing on the major crop production (from 1980 to 2050) taking into account various forms of data from fruit production (e.g., apples, bananas, citrus fruits, pears, and grapes). In this study, we used production data for different fruits grown in China to predict the future production of these fruits. The study employs deep neural networks to project future fruit production based on the statistics issued by China’s National Bureau of Statistics on the total fruit growth output for this period. The proposed method exhibits encouraging results with an accuracy of 95.56% calculating by accuracy formula based on fruit production variation. Authors further provide recommendations on the AGR-DL (agricultural deep learning) method being helpful for developing countries. The results suggest that the agricultural development in China is acceptable but demands more improvement and government needs to prioritize expanding the fruit production by establishing new strategies for cultivators to boost their performance. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we used a systematic quantitative approach to classify plant community types in the subtropical forests of Hubei Province (central China), and then quantified the relative contribution of drivers responsible for variation in species composition and diversity. We classified the subtropical forests in the study area into 12 community types. Of these, species diversity indices of three communities were significantly higher than those of others. In each community type, species richness, abundance, basal area and importance values of evergreen and deciduous species were different. In most community types, deciduous species richness was higher than that of evergreen species. Linear regression analysis showed that the dominant factors that affect species composition in each community type are elevation, slope, aspect, soil nitrogen content, and soil phosphorus content. Furthermore, structural equation modeling analysis showed that the majority of variance in species composition of plant communities can be explained by elevation, aspect, soil water content, litterfall, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus. Thus, the major factors that affect evergreen and deciduous species distribution across the 12 community types in subtropical evergreen-deciduous broadleaved mixed forests include elevation, slope and aspect, soil total nitrogen content, soil total phosphorus content, soil available nitrogen content and soil available phosphorus content. © 2021 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences","Detrended correspondence analysis; Environmental factors; Evergreen-deciduous broadleaved mixed forests; Northwestern of Hubei; Plant community; Two-way indicator species analysis",,Article,Scopus

The present study aims to project future soil erosion and sediment deposition in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) using climate projections by five Global Circulation Models (GCMs) under the Representative Concentrations Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario. To understand the importance of freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) for soil erosion and sediment deposition estimation with climate change, this study compared two Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models with different representations of the FTCs, with the standard SWAT using a simple regression method and SWAT-FT employing a physically based method. Modeling results show that future climate change can pronouncedly intensify soil erosion and increase sediment deposition, and the impacts are sensitive to how FTCs are represented in the model. The standard SWAT projected an increase in soil erosion by nearly 40% by the end of the 21st century, which is much lower than the projected over 65% increase in soil erosion by SWAT-FT. For sediment deposition, the projected percent changes by the standard SWAT and SWAT-FT also deviate from each other (i.e., about 70% by the standard SWAT vs about 120% by SWAT-FT).

This study investigates the use of Landsat NDVI sequences for estimating wheat yields in fields in Western Australia (WA). By fitting statistical crop growth curves, identifying the timing and intensity of phenological events, the best single integrated NDVI metric in any year was used to estimate yield. The hypotheses were that: (1) yield estimation could be improved by incorporating additional information about sowing date or break of season in statistical curve fitting for phenology detection; (2) the integrated NDVI metrics derived from phenology detection can estimate yield with greater accuracy than the observed NDVI values at one or two time points only. We tested the hypotheses using one field (~235 ha) in the WA grain belt for training and another field (~143 ha) for testing. Integrated NDVI metrics were obtained using: (1) traditional curve fitting (SPD); (2) curve fitting that incorporates sowing date information (+SD); and (3) curve fitting that incorporates rainfall-based break of season information (+BOS). Yield estimation accuracy using integrated NDVI metrics was further compared to the results using a scalable crop yield mapper (SCYM) model. We found that: (1) relationships between integrated NDVI metrics using the three curve fitting models and yield varied from year to year; (2) overall, +SD marginally improved yield estimation (r = 0.81, RMSE = 0.56 tonnes/ha compared to r = 0.80, RMSE = 0.61 tonnes/ha using SPD), but +BOS did not show obvious improvement (r = 0.80, RMSE = 0.60 tonnes/ha); (3) use of integrated NDVI metrics was more accurate than SCYM (r = 0.70, RMSE = 0.62 tonnes/ha) on average and had higher spatial and yearly consistency with actual yield than using SCYM model. We conclude that sequences of Landsat NDVI have the potential for estimation of wheat yield variation in fields in WA but they need to be combined with additional sources of data to distinguish different relationships between integrated NDVI metrics and yield in different years and locations. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, knowing the exact location of fields and their boundaries is a prerequisite. Unlike property boundaries, which are recorded in local council or title records, field boundaries are not historically recorded. As a result, digital services currently ask their users to manually draw their field, which is time-consuming and creates disincentives. Here, we present a generalized method, hereafter referred to as DECODE (DEtect, COnsolidate, and DElinetate), that automatically extracts accurate field boundary data from satellite imagery using deep learning based on spatial, spectral, and temporal cues. We introduce a new convolutional neural network (FracTAL ResUNet) as well as two uncertainty metrics to characterize the confidence of the field detection and field delineation processes. We finally propose a new methodology to compare and summarize field-based accuracy metrics. To demonstrate the performance and scalability of our method, we extracted fields across the Australian grains zone with a pixel-based accuracy of 0.87 and a field-based accuracy of up to 0.88 depending on the metric. We also trained a model on data from South Africa instead of Australia and found it transferred well to unseen Australian landscapes.

It is well known that temporal assessment of land surface temperature and UHI are inevitable for city planning and ecosystem monitoring. Landsat-derived LST is widely used for urban temperature studies including the study of the urban heat island (UHI). In this study, remote sensing (RS) techniques have been used for the estimation and forecasting of LST and identification of UHI in one of the fast-growing cities of Tamil Nadu state, India, using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. Satellite data between the period 2008 and 2018 was used in the model study. Analysis of the images and model results show that there is a progressive increasing trend of LST in built-up areas. LST values obtained from model study exhibited a negative relationship with land use and land cover (LULC) for Chennai city and surrounding area. LST maps developed from the model study depicted growing UHI hotspots in the southeastern and western parts of the city where the development of the city is fast. The present study would help in forecasting the LST of a city and in identifying UHI hotspots for proper urban planning. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","ARIMA model; GIS; Land surface temperature; Land use and Land cover; Remote sensing; Urban heat island","heat island; land cover; land surface; modeling; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; surface temperature; urban area; urbanization; Chennai; India; Tamil Nadu",Article,Scopus

This study aims to define homogenous regions and optimum planting dates for sugarcane using simulated water-limited yield in the state of Goiás, Brazil. Yw was simulated using crop model and 24 planting dates across the year, including gridded weather data and soil water availability to the crop over the state in a grid cell size of 0.5 × 0.5°. The crop model was evaluated comparing simulated and measured yield tendency across planting dates. Homogeneous regions were obtained based on Yw, using the Ward’s method and Euclidean distance. The crop model was able to replicate yield tendency across planting dates. The clustering divided the state into four homogenous regions, where optimum planting period had different intervals due to the interaction with climate and soil. The optimum planting window had four dates for the region with lower Yw (105 t ha−1). The region with higher Yw (131 t ha−1) had the longer optimum window, with seven dates, but with the higher yield reduction (− 6%) than other regions (− 3%) when planting date was changed from 1st to 2nd better dates. This way, the results and the approach used in this study defines yield level and optimal planting dates, which can be apply to define harvest period and the area required to supply the sugarcane mill demands, leading to better machinery and labor work management, helping to elaborate mills and state-level strategies to increase sugarcane production. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","FAO—agroecological zone model; Saccharum spp; Sugarcane harvest; Water-limited yield; Yield gap",,Article,Scopus

It is therefore economically significant to specify the period as precisely as possible. The harvest maturity of silage corn is currently determined from the targeted sampling of plants cultivated over large areas. In this context, the paper presents an alternative, more detail-oriented approach for estimating the correct harvest time; the method focuses on the relationship between the ripeness data obtained via photogrammetry and the parameters produced by the chemical analysis of corn. The relevant imaging methodology utilizing a spectral camera-equipped unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) allows the user to acquire the spectral reflectance values and to compute the vegetation indices. Furthermore, the authors discuss the statistical data analysis centered on both the nutritional values found in the laboratory corn samples and on the information obtained from the multispectral images. This discussion is associated with a detailed insight into the computation of correlation coefficients. Statistically significant linear relationships between the vegetation indices, the normalized difference red edge index (NDRE) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in particular, and nutritional values such as dry matter, starch, and crude protein are evaluated to indicate different aspects of and paths toward predicting the optimum harvest time.

As a result, models calibrated in one region cannot normally be migrated to another without significant modifications. Currently in these regions, non-transferable machine learning models are habitually trained over small local data sets. Here we show that transfer learning (TL), in the senses of weight initialization and weight freezing, allows long short-term memory (LSTM) streamflow models that were pretrained over the conterminous United States (CONUS, the source data set) to be transferred to catchments on other continents (the target regions), without the need for extensive catchment attributes available at the target location. We demonstrate this possibility for regions where data are dense (664 basins in Great Britain), moderately dense (49 basins in central Chile), and scarce with only remotely sensed attributes available (5 basins in China). In both China and Chile, the TL models showed significantly elevated performance compared to locally trained models using all basins. The benefits of TL increased with the amount of available data in the source data set, and seemed to be more pronounced with greater physiographic diversity. The benefits from TL were greater than from pretraining LSTM using the outputs from an uncalibrated hydrologic model. These results suggest hydrologic data around the world have commonalities which could be leveraged by deep learning, and synergies can be had with a simple modification of the current workflows, greatly expanding the reach of existing big data.

Thus, appropriate and reliable yield forecasts are fundamental to ensure price stability and food security around the globe. In this study, we developed a Machine Learning (ML) approach to combine satellite and climate data with antecedent wheat yield information (YieldBaseLine) from 2004 – 2018, at municipal level, in Mexico. We compared the performance of four linear (generalized linear model –glm-, ridge regression –ridge-, lasso, partial least squares –pls-) and four non-linear algorithms (k-nearest neighbours –kknn-, support vector machine radial –svmR-, extreme gradient boosting -xgbTree- and random forest –rf) before harvest time. Additionally, we evaluated their performance using five different feature selection scenarios (No FS, FS = 0.9, FS = 0.75, FS = 0.9 and YieldBaseLine). The models were independently tested using two different approaches: random sampling and selective sampling. In the random sampling, the non-linear models performed generally better under the FS = 0.5 scenario, whereas the non-linear models were less sensitive to feature reduction. The results also evidenced the capacity of the YieldBaseLine predictor, combined with satellite and climate data, to address the inter-annual and spatial variability in the study area. The highest prediction accuracy was obtained by the rf method (No FS) with R2 = 0.84. To further prove the model's operability in a simulated real-case scenario, we held out the last year records (2018) to test the models. The best performing model was again the rf (R2 = 0.81). This study proposes a robust methodology to model crop yield (at large scale) and it may be used with operative purposes. Therefore, it can be of interest to decision and law makers, producers, authorities or the wheat industry. In addition, it can help to establish appropriate food security and trading policies. A similar approach can be applied to other regions or crops. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate data; Food security; Machine learning; Satellite data; Wheat yield","algorithm; bootstrapping; crop yield; demand analysis; food security; machine learning; performance assessment; regression analysis; sampling; satellite data; spatial variation; wheat; Mexico [North America]",Article,Scopus

The regression models developed with six vegetation indices (green normalization difference vegetation index (GNDVI), normalization difference red-edge index (NDRE), chlorophyll index red edge (CIrededge), difference NIR/Green green difference vegetation index (GDVI), green-red NDVI (GRNDVI), and medium resolution imaging spectrometer terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI)), calculated from the spectral bands, were applied to single years (2018, 2019, and 2020) and multiple years (2018 + 2019, 2018 + 2020, 2019 + 2020, and all years). The regression models were cross-validated through mutual prediction against the vegetation indices in nonoverlapping years, and the prediction errors were evaluated via root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP). The ANN model was reproducible, with low and sustained prediction errors of 24.2 kg/1000 m2 ≤ RMSEP ≤ 59.1 kg/1000 m2 in rice yield and 0.14% ≤ RMSEP ≤ 0.28% in rice-protein content in all single-year and multiple-year analyses. When the importance of each vegetation index of the regression models was evaluated, only the ANN model showed the same ranking in the vegetation index of the first (MTCI in both rice yield and protein content) and second importance (CIrededge in rice yield and GRNDVI in rice-protein content).

The aim of this research was to explore machine learning use with hyperspectral datacubes over agricultural fields. Hyperspectral imagery was collected over a mature cotton crop, which had high spatial (~5.2 cm) and spectral (5 nm) resolution over the spectral range 475–925 nm that allowed discrimination of individual crop rows and field features as well as a continuous spectral range for calculating derivative spectra. The nominal reflectance and its derivatives clearly highlighted the different treatment blocks and were strongly related to N concentration in leaf and petiole samples, both in traditional vegetation indices (e.g., Vogelman 1, R2 = 0.8) and novel combinations of spectra (R2 = 0.85). The key hyperspectral bands identified were at the red-edge inflection point (695–715 nm). Satellite multispectral was compared against the UAV hyperspectral remote sensing’s performance by testing the ability of Sentinel MSI to predict N concentration using the bands in VIS-NIR spectral region. The Sentinel 2A Green band (B4; mid-point 559.8 nm) explained the same amount of variation in N as the hyperspectral data and more than the Sentinel Red Edge Point 1 (B5; mid-point 704.9 nm) with the lower 10 m resolution Green band reporting an R2 = 0.85, compared with the R2 = 0.78 of downscaled Sentinel Red Edge Point 1 at 5 m. The remaining Sentinel bands explained much lower variation (maximum was NIR at R2 = 0.48). Investigation of the red edge peak region in the first derivative showed strong promise with RIDAmid (R2 = 0.81) being the best index. The machine learning approach narrowed the range of bands required to investigate plant condition over this trial site, greatly improved processing time and reduced processing complexity. While Sentinel performed well in this comparison and would be useful in a broadacre crop production context, the impact of pixel boundaries relative to a region of interest and coarse spatial and temporal resolution impacts its utility in a research capacity. © 2021 by the authors.

Five relevant vegetation indices, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), rice growth vegetation index (RGVI), moisture stress index (MSI), and leaf area index (LAI), were used to develop several empirical yield prediction models for rice production. For this research, Sentinel-2 images with 10 m spatial resolution was used for the haor area of Bangladesh. To calibrate and validate the remote sensing images at such large spatial and temporal scales, ground reference data of the vegetation indices were used. The generated models were validated using both parametric (simple and multiple) and nonparametric (artificial neural network, ANN) regression analyses. The crop yield models that were developed using regression analyses showed very significant agreement with the ground reference yield information. The best estimated performances for the RGVI (R2 = 0.44), NDVI (R2=0.63), NDVI (R2 = 0.55), and NDVI (R2 = 0.67) in the simple regression analyses were observed for 2017, 2018, and 2019 and the average of seasons from 2017 to 2019. On the other hand, the composite NDVI-RGVI (R2 = 0.65), NDVI-NDWI (R2 = 0.56), and NDVI-MSI (R2 = 0.69) indices were the best-performing vegetation indices for developing boro rice yield prediction models using multiple regression. Nevertheless, in the ANN-based machine-learning results, NDVI exhibited higher accuracy for the average boro rice season (2017–2019) by using a simple regression approach (R2 = 0.84) and multiple regression analysis (R2 = 0.91) of the average NDVI-MSI composite index. Validation between the actual and predicted yields showed that more than 70% of the study area can be accurately predicted using vegetation indices with ground reference mean yield data. Moreover, in 2018, the predicted yields by using simple and multiple linear regression were 4.25 and 4.23 MT/ha, respectively. The developed models are applicable 118–132 days after planting (DAT) in any similar environment for agricultural practices. Therefore, the yield prediction models of boro rice at the maturity stage can be useful for farm risk management, insurance premium determinations, and relevant stakeholder decision-making to mitigate the effects of extreme flash flood events. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial neural network; Boro rice; Flash flood; Regression analyses; Remote sensing; Satellite; Vegetation indices; Yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

Imagery for each location is used as an input to train a CNN to distinguish fatal from non-fatal events. Using 2014 imagery, we are able to predict the result of conflict events in the following year (2015) with 80% accuracy. While our approach does not replace the need for causal studies into the drivers of conflict death, it provides a low-cost solution to prediction that requires only publicly available imagery to implement. Findings suggest that the information contained in moderate-resolution imagery can be used to predict the likelihood of a death due to conflict at a given location in Nigeria the following year, and that CNN-based methods of estimating development-related indicators may be effective in applications beyond those explored in the literature. © 2020 The Authors.

Comparative analysis of pixel-based and object-based classifications was performed and classification results were further refined based on three types of object features (layer spectral, geometry, and texture). Static recognition using layer spectral features had the highest accuracy of 75.4% in object-based classification, and dynamic recognition had the highest accuracy of 88.0% in object-based classification based on layer spectral and geometry features. Dynamic identification could not only attenuate the effects of variations on planting dates and plant growth conditions on the results, but also amplify the differences between different features. Object-based classification produced better results than pixel-based classification, and the three feature sets (layer spectral alone, layer spectral and geometry, and all three) resulted in only small differences in accuracy in object-based classification. Dynamic recognition combined with object-based classification using layer spectral and geometry features could effectively improve crop classification accuracy with high resolution aerial imagery.

Wheat production represents a main national agricultural activity in this region. Usually, regression techniques have been used in order to generate wheat yield models, at regional and subregional scales. In a whole regional analysis, using these techniques, climate and soil properties explained 64% of the spatial and interannual variability of wheat yield. Recently, an artificial neural network (ANN) approach was developed for wheat yield estimation in the region. In this chapter we compared the performance of multiple regression methods with the ANN approach as wheat yield estimation tools and propose developing productivity indexes by the latter technique. The ANN approach was able to generate a better explicative model than regression, with a lower RMSE. It could explain 76% of the interannual wheat yield variability with positive effects of harvest year, soil available water holding capacity, soil organic carbon, photothermal quotient and the ratio rainfall/crop potential evapotranspiration. Considering that the input variables required to run the ANN can be available 40-60 days before crop harvest, the model has a yield forecasting utility. The results of the ANN model can be used for estimating climate and soil productivity. A climate productivity index developed assessed the effect of the climate scenario and its changes on crop yield. A soil productivity index was also elaborated which represents the capacity to produce a certain amount of harvest grain per hectare, depending on soil characteristics. These indices are tools for characterizing climatic regions and for identifying productivity capabilities of soils at regional scale. The methodology developed can be applied in other cropping areas of the World and for different crops. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Argentine pampas; Productivity indices; Wheat yield",,Book Chapter,Scopus

However, many statistical prediction models using remote sensing data cannot extend to the regional scale without considering the regional climate. This paper first introduced the hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) method to solve maize-yield prediction problems over years and regions. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), calculated by the spectrum of the Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI), and meteorological data were introduced as input parameters in the maize-yield prediction model proposed in this paper. We built models using 100 samples from 10 areas, and used 101 other samples from 34 areas to evaluate the model’s performance in Jilin province. HLM provided higher accuracy with an adjusted determination coefficient equal to 0.75, root mean square error (RMSEV) equal to 0.94 t/ha, and normalized RMSEV equal to 9.79%. Results showed that the HLM approach outperformed linear regression (LR) and multiple LR (MLR) methods. The HLM method based on the Landsat 8 OLI NDVI and meteorological data could flexibly adjust in different regional climatic conditions. They had higher spatiotemporal expansibility than that of widely used yield estimation models (e.g., LR and MLR). This is helpful for the accurate management of maize fields. © 2021 by the authors.

Due to this, the objective of this study is to explore the potential of multi-temporal imagery data as an alternative for sugarcane yield mapping. The study was based on developing predictive sugarcane yield models integrating time-series orbital imaging and a machine learning technique. A commercial sugarcane site was selected, and Sentinel-2 images were acquired from the beginning of the ratoon sprouting until harvesting of two consecutive cropping seasons. The predictive yield models RF (Random forest) and MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) were developed using orbital images and yield maps generated by a commercial sensor-system on harvesting. Original yield data were filtered and interpolated with the same spatial resolution of the orbital images. The entire dataset was divided into training and testing datasets. Spectral bands, especially the near-infrared at tillering crop stage showed greater contribution to predicting sugarcane yield than the use of derived spectral vegetation indices. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) obtained for the RF regression based on multiple spectral bands was 4.63 Mg ha−1 with an R2 of 0.70 for the testing dataset.

Machine learning has two main branches: supervised and unsupervised learning. In plant breeding, supervised learning is used for genomic prediction, where phenotypic traits are modeled as a function of molecular markers. The key supervised learning algorithms for genomic prediction are linear methods, kernel methods, neural networks, and tree ensembles.

Hence, the purpose of the present study was to assess plant species composition and distribution in a freshwater wetland Mekeiman Marsh, Northeastern Algeria and to analyze the influence of environmental factors on local plant species. To explore the distribution of plant species in this Marsh and analyze their associations with edaphic soil factors, the mapping and types of plant species in this area were analyzed by MapInfo and principal component analysis (PCA) ordination. For this purpose, four stations were chosen according to a stratified sampling method and phytosociological surveys were carried out in 12 plots, which were sampled using the Braun-Blanquet method. Multivariate analyses were used to determine the relationship between plant species distribution and edaphic factors. The R i386 (version 4.0.3) software was used for data analysis. We have identified 48 plant species belonging to 21 families. Results of biological types in the study area revealed the dominance of hemicryptophytes and therophytes, which indicates the presence of therophytization in this Marsh. Spatial distribution maps showed that plant species were divided into two categories viz. sparse and scattered plants according to the humidity gradient. The most important edaphic factors associated with plant species in Mekeiman Marsh were Sodium, Phosphorus, active limestone, Magnesium, clay, organic matter, C/N and Azot. By combining mapping and influence of edaphic factors on the structure and distribution of plant species in this wetland, it was known that the plant assemblages of this Marsh make disproportionately important contributions to wetland-level diversity. © 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

It has been used in numerous fields such as numerical optimization, engineering problems, and machine learning. The different variants of GWO have been developed in the last five years for solving optimization problems in diverse fields. Like other metaheuristic algorithms, GWO also suffers from local optima and slow convergence problems, which result in degraded performance. An adequate equilibrium among exploration and exploitation is a key factor to the success of metaheuristic algorithms, especially for optimization tasks. In this paper, a new variant of GWO, called inertia motivated GWO (IMGWO), was proposed. The aim of IMGWO was to establish better balance between exploration and exploitation. Traditionally, artificial neural network (ANN) with backpropagation (BP) depends on initial values and in turn, attains poor convergence. The metaheuristic approaches are better alternatives instead of BP. The proposed IMGWO was used to train ANN to prove its competency in terms of prediction. The proposed IMGWO-ANN was applied for medical diagnosis tasks. Several benchmark medical datasets including heart disease, breast cancer, hepatitis, and Parkinson's diseases were used for assessing the performance of IMGWO-ANN. The performance measures were described in terms of mean squared errors, classification accuracies, sensitivities, specificities, the area under the curve, and receiver operating characteristic curve. It was found that IMGWO outperformed three popular metaheuristic approaches including GWO, genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization. Results confirmed the potency of IMGWO as a viable learning technique for an ANN. © 2021.

To increase the accuracy of HYDRUS-2D simulations in SPD, three effective strategies, including the resistance layer (RL), actual infiltration surface (AIS), and equivalent radius (ER) treatments, were proposed to replace the standard seepage boundary (SSB) for subsurface pipes in HYDRUS-2D. First, the accuracy of the three strategies was calibrated using laboratory experiments with the multi-objective calibration method of the PEST program. Second, additional laboratory experiments were conducted to validate the three strategies. The RL, AIS, and ER strategies obtained a relatively high simulation accuracy in terms of the soil salt content (SSC), soil water content (SWC), and drainage and salt discharge processes that was significantly higher than that obtained with the standard seepage boundary (SSB) strategy. Moreover, compared with the AIS, ER, and SSB strategies, the RL strategy attained the highest simulation accuracy regarding the water drainage (root mean square error (RMSE) = 3.42 L; mean absolute error (MAE) = 2.91 L) and salt discharge (RMSE = 0.12 kg; MAE = 0.11 kg) in SPD. The relative position of the subsurface pipe has an important effect on the desalting rate of the clay layer (CL). Based on the SPD simulation by HYDRUS-2D with the RL strategy, we recommend placing the subsurface pipe below the clay layer to obtain the best water drainage and salt discharge effects in regions containing CLs. Furthermore, a positive logarithmic relationship between the drainage rate of the subsurface pipe and the CL saturated hydraulic conductivity was found (R2 = 0.99). Future research should focus on the upper and lower boundary conditions of HYDRUS-2D to further increase the SPD simulation accuracy. © 2020","Clay layer; HYDRUS-2D; Soil salinization; Subsurface pipe boundary","Arid regions; Automatic identification; Desalination; Hydraulic conductivity; Mean square error; Seepage; Soil moisture; Arid and semi-arid regions; Laboratory experiments; Logarithmic relationship; Lower boundary conditions; Multi-objective calibration; Root mean square errors; Saturated hydraulic conductivity; Water and salt transports; Electric resistance; calibration; drainage; hydraulic conductivity; hydrological modeling; infiltration; pipe flow; salinity; seepage; soil water; subsurface flow; water content",Article,Scopus

A smart collection of electric devices would gather data about Acer mono sap exudation per hour on outdoor temperature, humidity, conductivity, and wind direction and velocity, and was installed in four areas in the Republic of Korea, including Sancheong, Gwangyang, Geoje, and Inje. Collected data were used to analyze correlations between environmental information and Acer mono sap exudation using four different algorithms, including linear regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and random forest, to predict Acer mono sap exudation. Remarkable outcomes were obtained across all the algorithms except for linear regression, demonstrating close connections between environmental information and Acer mono sap exudation.

Agroforestry may improve food security by increasing soil fertility, crop production, and livelihoods. Agroforestry simulation models can be useful for predicting the effects of tree management on crop growth when designing modifications to these systems. The Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) agroforestry tree-proxy model was used to simulate the response of maize yield to N fertilizer applications and tree pruning practices in the parkland agroforestry system in the Central Rift Valley, Ethiopia. The model was parameterized and tested using data collected from an experiment conducted under trees and in crop-only plots during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons. The treatments contained three levels of tree pruning (100% pruned, 50% pruned, and unpruned) as the main plots, and N fertilizers were applied to maize at two rates (9 or 78 kg N ha−1) as sub-plots. Maize yield predictions across two years in response to tree pruning and N applications under tree canopies were satisfactorily simulated (NSE = 0.72, RSR = 0.51, R2 = 0.8). Virtual experiments for different rates of N, pruning levels, sowing dates, and cultivars suggest that maize yield could be improved by applying fertilizers (particularly on crop-only plots) and by at least 50% pruning of trees. Optimal maize yield can be obtained at a higher rate of fertilization under trees than away from them due to better water relations, and there is scope for improving the sowing date and cultivar. Across a 34-year range of recent climate, small increases in yields due to optimum N-fertilizing and pruning were probably limited by nutrient limitations other than N, but the highest yields were consistently in the 2–4 m zone under trees. These virtual experiments helped to form hypotheses regarding fertilizers, pruning, and the effects of trees on soil that warrant further field evaluation. © 2020 by the authors.

We examined responses of nitrate loading to climate change in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) with an enhanced Soil and Water Assessment Tool with physically based Freeze-Thaw cycle representation (SWAT-FT), as compared with the original SWAT model that employs an empirical equation. Driven by future climate projections from five General Circulation Models (GCMs) from 1960 to 2099 under the Representative Concentrations Pathways (RCP) 8.5 scenario, we analyzed changes in riverine nitrate loadings, as well as terrestrial surface and subsurface contributions of the UMRB in the 21st century relative to the baseline period of 1960–1999. By the end of the 21st century, the original SWAT model predicted about a 50% increase in riverine nitrate loadings which is nearly twice as much as that estimated by SWAT-FT (ca. 25%). Such a large difference in projected nitrate changes can potentially mislead mitigation strategies that aim to reduce nitrogen runoff from the UMRB. Further analysis shows that the difference between the original SWAT model and SWAT-FT led to substantial discrepancies in the spatial distribution of surface and subsurface nitrate loadings in the UMRB. In general, SWAT-FT predicted more nitrate leaching for northwestern parts of the UMRB which are more sensitive to freeze-thaw cycle, mainly because SWAT-FT simulated less frequent frozen soils. This study highlights the importance of using physically based freeze-thaw cycle representation in water quality modeling.

The material used in the study were taste scores of 232 grape varieties from the Don Ampelographic Collection (47°250 N 40°030 E) 1981-2019. The correlation analysis, ANOVA, and regression were used. It was shown that GS negatively correlated with productivity, and WS with the berry mass of variety. In recent decades, GS have increased in groups of varieties of various interspecies origin, and WS have not changed. Regression models revealed that the reason for GS improvement was in the growth of average temperature above 15 _C, while WS varied depending on the sum of precipitation for the period with temperatures above 20 °C, which did not have a reliable trend.

A near-real-time i.e., half-hourly significant wave height (Hsig) forecast model is designed using a suite of selected model input variables where the multiple linear regression (MLR) model, considering the influence of several variables, is optimized by covariance-weighted least squares (CWLS) estimation algorithm to generate a hybridized MLR-CWLS model with a capability to forecast 30-min ahead Hsig values. First, a diagnostic statistical test based on the correlation coefficient is performed to determine relationships between inputs denoting historical behaviour and the target (Hsig) at one lag of 30-min (t – 1) scale. Subsequently, the data are split into training and testing subsets, following a normalization process, and the MLR-CWLS hybridized model is then trained and validated on the testing dataset adopted from eastern coastal zones of Australia that has a high potential for wave energy generation. Hybridized MLR-CWLS model is benchmarked against competing modelling approaches (multivariate adaptive regression splines-MARS, M5 Model Tree, and MLR) via statistical score metrics. The results show that the hybridized MLR-CWLS model is able to generate reliable forecasts of Hsig relative to the counterpart comparison models.

In silvopastoral systems, contrasting shading levels caused by the presence of trees interferes in the productive responses of the pasture under grazing. The environment in which plants develop in a pasture canopy is dynamic and complex due to the nature of soil-plant-animal interactions. These dynamic aspects can be rationalized, evaluated, and explained using mathematical modeling. The objective of the present study was to parameterize the APSIM-Tropical Pasture model to simulate palisadegrass [Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst A Rich) Stapf, syn. Urochloa brizantha] growth under continuous stocking and variable stocking rate, in a full sun system and in contrasting shading conditions of a silvopastoral setting with eucalyptus (Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex Maiden × Eucalyptus urophylla S. T. Blake). Trees were planted in triple-row groves, with three groves per 2-ha silvopasture area. The spacing between groves was 30 m, and tree density was 135 ha−1, in East-West orientation. The data used to calibrate and validate the model were collected in a 36-month experiment with full sun and shade treatments of the silvopastoral setting in Sinop, MT, Brazil. Live forage mass estimates had coefficient of determination varying between 0.76 and 0.94, Willmott agreement index ranged from 0.93 to 0.96, and root mean square error between 275 and 610 kg DM ha−1. The APSIM-Tropical Pasture model can simulate Marandu palisadegrass growth under continuous stocking with variable stocking rate, but improvements are needed to better simulate the effect of N fertilizations in different periods on growth. The model can simulate pasture growth under shading levels but our simulations did not consider competition for soil moisture, which should be considered in the future, since it can be an important factor for other silvopastoral designs or microclimatic conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural systems modeling; Agroforestry; APSIM-Tropical Pasture; Brachiaria brizantha cv.

Given the importance of soil moisture (SM) for crop development, the objective of this study was to investigate the use of passive microwave-derived estimates of surface SM obtained by the SM Ocean Salinity Mission (SMOS) satellite for forecasting canola yields across the Canadian Prairies within Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's (AAFC) Canadian Crop Yield Forecaster (CCYF) model. Weekly SMOS SM observations were combined with climate variables and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) platform and used as an input for forecasting canola yields at the township-scale across the Canadian Prairies from 2010 to 2016. Top predictors were identified, and regression models were built using a robust least angle regression (RLARS) and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) scheme. SM was found to provide a better descriptor of canola stress than the more widely utilized NDVI, being selected as a predictor in 74.2 % of developed ecodistrict models over the 7-year period, compared to just 41.2 % for NDVI. The difference between model R2 values (i.e. R2diff) when SMOS SM predictors were included and excluded from the forecast, respectively, revealed varying degrees of model improvements; however, the majority of ecodistricts under study (53.3 %) showed improved model fit (i.e. R2diff &gt; 0) with observed canola yields when SMOS SM indices were included as potential predictors within the CCYF. Overall, greater improvements in the CCYF performance were observed in Manitoba and Saskatchewan where meteorological stations are more sparsely distributed. However, performance for both sets of model inputs was relatively low with R2 values ranging from 0 to 0.74 (mean = 0.13) and from 0 to 0.52 (mean = 0.12) across the study area both when SM was included and excluded from the model, respectively. These findings suggest that while SMOS SM observations may provide a more effective indicator of canola yields, the CCYF's performance at the township-scale, where interannual yield variability is often quite high, is limited by the short temporal satellite record. © 2020","Canola; CCYF; Passive microwave; SMOS; Soil moisture; Yield forecast","AVHRR; crop yield; forecasting method; NDVI; satellite imagery; soil moisture; Canada; Manitoba; Prairie Provinces; Saskatchewan; Brassica napus var. napus; Indicator indicator",Article,Scopus

Our study focuses on quantifying the uncertainty due to ICV in projections of crop productions in Canada. We utilize climate scenarios from two large ensembles (LEs, CanESM2-LE and CanRCM4-LE with 25 members each) as inputs to the crop models in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer. We simulate crop yields for canola, maize and spring wheat under the future climates of four global warming levels. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the projected crop production across the LE members is used to quantify the uncertainty related to ICV and this is compared with the CVs generated using the 20 GCMs in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Crop production in Canada could increase with global warming, e.g. spring wheat production could increase by up to 21% at the warming level of 3.0 °C. The projections often produce larger uncertainty associated with the GCMs than from ICV at all warming levels above 2.0 °C. The results from an asymptotic test for the equality of CVs show a significant difference in CVs of projections of canola production between CanESM2-LE/CanRCM4-LE and CMIP5 for the warming level of 3.0 °C. However, the test results do not indicate a significant difference among the ensembles at all four warming levels for maize and spring wheat. The uncertainty due to ICV is often comparable to that associated with GCMs at the warming level of 1.5 °C, e.g. a CV of 6.0 and 6.4% for CanESM2-LE and CanRCM4-LE and 6.6% for CMIP5 in the projections of spring wheat production. We conclude there is a need to account for uncertainty related to ICV in projections of Canadian crop production, especially at lower warming levels. © 2020 Canadian Crown Copyright.

This study aimed to estimate, forecast, and model the green and blue water footprints (WFg and WFb, respectively) of maize by using an artificial neural network (ANN). Three Egyptian Nile Delta governorates were selected as major maize-producing sites: Ad Daqahliyah, Al Gharbiyah, and Ash Sharqiyah. The monthly data of minimum temperature (Tmin), maximum temperature (Tmax), precipitation (P), solar radiation (SR), soil moisture (SM), wind speed (WS), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) data were obtained from open access data over the period from 2006 to 2016. The analyzed data were divided into two parts from 2006 to 2012 and from 2013 to 2016 for model training and testing, respectively. To predict WFb in the three governorates, the results show that the models with SR, humidity (H) and VPD; Tmean, crop coefficient (Kc), and H; and SM, WS, VPD, and Kc were the best ANNs with different hidden layers (5, 3), (2, 6) and (7, 3), respectively. Furthermore, the findings showed that the optimal ANN for forecasting WFg included Tmean, WS, and P; P, WS, VPD, and SR; WS, Tmax, and VPD with hidden neuron layers (7, 3), (7, 5) and (8, 5), respectively, for the three locations. The calculated WF values achieved a high statistical significant versus those simulated in the three sites with the lowest distributional variations, and the accuracy and coefficients of determination were close to 1. Moreover, for model testing, the findings indicated that the deviations between the actual and predicted WFs ranged from - 2.6 to 6.63 % and from - 2.4 to 3.16 % for the blue and green WFs, respectively. Thus, the developed models generated relatively better results and can help promote the decision-making process for both water managers and development planners. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","ANN models; Blue water footprint; Green water footprint; Hidden layers; Limited meteorological data","Agricultural robots; Crops; Forecasting; Governors; Meteorology; Neural networks; Soil moisture; Wind; Ann models; Blue water; Green water; Hidden layers; Meteorological data; Decision making; agricultural policy; artificial neural network; decision making; moisture content; relative humidity; soil moisture; soil temperature; solar radiation; vapor pressure; water footprint; water use efficiency; wind velocity; Daqahliya; Egypt; Gharbiya; Nile Delta; Sharqiya; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

This study incorporated the DSSAT-CERES-Maize model with a new algorithm for dynamic within-season irrigation scheduling for maize (Zea mays L.) based on trends in daily forecasted yields. Field experiments were undertaken at four arid and semiarid sites in Northwest China, including Changwu (2010 and 2011, rainfed), Yangling (2014 and 2015, irrigated), Jingyang (2015, irrigated), and Shiyanghe (2015, irrigated). Historical 50-year (1968–2017) weather data were available for each site. In daily yield forecasts, weather data before forecast dates were observed from local weather stations, while the unknown data between forecast and harvest dates were supplemented by local 50-year continuous weather series in the same periods. Then 50 maize yields could be obtained on each forecast day, and the median values were calculated as the prediction on that day. As the growing season advanced, historical weather data were gradually replaced by actual weather data. Further, the dynamics of daily forecasted yields were used to schedule irrigation based on a new algorithm. The new algorithm schedule irrigations by considering the feedbacks of maize grain yield to interactions of actual weather, environment, and management. The results showed that forecasted maize yield had considerable uncertainty before tasseling but rapidly converged to the actual yield about one month before harvest. The mean absolute relative errors (MAREs) of daily forecasted yields were 11.7% and 7.3% at Changwu in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Simulated irrigation use efficiency (IUE) for almost all sites and years were improved. The new irrigation scheduling algorithm will help to improve irrigation scheduling in arid and semiarid areas where precipitation is the main limited factor to maize yield. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CERES-Maize; Crop model; Irrigation scheduling; Meteorology, Yield forecast","agricultural modeling; agrometeorology; algorithm; crop production; forecasting method; growing season; maize; management practice; seasonal variation; water use; Changwu; China; Shaanxi; Yangling; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

To identify crop varieties with high yield potential, plant scientists and breeders evaluate the performance of hundreds of lines in multiple locations over several years. To facilitate the process of selecting advanced varieties, an automated framework was developed in this study. A hyperspectral camera was mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle to collect aerial imagery with high spatial and spectral resolution in a fast, cost-effective manner. Aerial images were captured in two consecutive growing seasons from three experimental yield fields composed of hundreds experimental wheat lines. The grain of more than thousand wheat plots was harvested by a combine, weighed, and recorded as the ground truth data. To investigate the yield variation at sub-plot scale and leverage the high spatial resolution, plots were divided into sub-plots using image processing techniques integrated by domain knowledge. Subsequent to extracting features from each sub-plot, deep neural networks were trained for yield estimation. The coefficient of determination for predicting the yield was 0.79 and 0.41 with normalized root mean square error of 0.24 and 0.14 g at sub-plot and plot scale, respectively. The results revealed that the proposed framework, as a valuable decision support tool, can facilitate the process of high-throughput yield phenotyping by offering the possibility of remote visual inspection of the plots as well as optimizing plot size to investigate more lines in a dedicated field each year. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Deep learning; Endmember; Hyperspectral imaging; Neural network; Phenotyping; UAV; Unmixing; Yield","Aerial photography; Antennas; Cost effectiveness; Crops; Cultivation; Decision support systems; Deep learning; Hyperspectral imaging; Knowledge management; Mean square error; Neural networks; Spectroscopy; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Coefficient of determination; Endmembers; Hyper-spectral imageries; Image processing technique; Phenotyping; Remote visual inspection; Unmixing; Yield; Deep neural networks; aerial survey; alternative agriculture; artificial neural network; crop production; crop yield; high yielding variety; image processing; imaging method; machine learning; phenotype; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; spectral analysis; spectral resolution; unmanned vehicle; wheat; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

It is also the primary agricultural production area in the country. Groundwater levels in some regions of the valley have decreased by &gt;15 m in the last five years. Water use estimates at the regional and the field scale for this valley are crucial for enhancing resilience and for managing competing sectorial water demands. In this research, we derive a novel time series of field-scale actual evapotranspiration for the Bekaa Valley using two one-source energy balance models for the period 1984–2017, utilizing local weather data and all available original Level 1 Landsat thermal imagery and Level 2 surface reflectance products. We compare a modified METRIC model with an automated hot and cold pixel identification procedure run in batch mode to pySEBAL, a new version of SEBAL, which also has its automated anchors pixel selection algorithm. Analysis of 1200 cloud-masked and gap-filled Landsat-derived ET products show that the two models give comparable water use estimates at the seasonal and annual time steps. We estimate an average annual ET of 652 ± 53 mm (or 800 mcm) over the heavily cultivated valley in the last 34 years (with high agreement between both METRIC and pySEBAL models). Most (64%) of the ET is consumed from blue water in the dry season of May–October. ET in the wet season of November–April consumes &gt;70% of the precipitation in the Bekaa valley. Annual analysis shows no discernable trend in ET across the valley, but there is an increase in irrigated agriculture in the Orontes Basin in the last five years. METRIC yields 15% higher ET than pySEBAL for the non-agricultural lands in summer. A water balance analysis shows that groundwater storage in the Litani basin is decreasing at a rate of 330 ± 50 mm yr−1. The outcome of this research also offers unique opportunities for estimating past and future trends of groundwater withdrawals.

In this work, we show that when developed with a dataset comprised of typical weather patterns, the outputs of empirical models that have been recently developed are qualitatively analogous to those of a process-based model and have smaller errors. However, when the training data is not representative, the same doesn't happen and they are not consistent with known responses from sugarcane and with the output of mechanistic models.

A bias-corrected ensemble mean of three CORDEX-SA driving GCM experiments (CNRM-CM5, CCSM4, and MPI-ESM-LR) was used with the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to predict water yield and evapotranspiration for three future periods (2011–2040, 2041–2070, and 2071–2099) under two representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), and the results were compared with the data of a historical period (1979–2008). The SUFI-2 method was used for the calibration and validation of the SWAT model. The model was calibrated for the period of five years (1982–1986) and validated for the next five years (1987–1991). The values of R2, NSE, bR2, PBIAS, and RSR were, respectively, 0.78, 0.77, 0.61, 47.4 and 0.48 during the calibration period, and 0.71, 0.65, 0.60, 72.1 and 0.59 during the validation period. Trend analysis was also performed for annual future predicted flows using the Sen Slope method. From the results, it can be predicted that precipitation, evapotranspiration, and water yield will increase in all the three future periods under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Water availability in the future in the basin (zone wise) was identified using appropriate indicators. Per-capita water availability and meteorological variation were used to calculate future water availability and, considering these indicators, it can be concluded that zone 3 will better than the other zones. Zone 3 exhibits high values of per capita water availability and meteorological variation.

Our approach is applied to state-scale maize yield and meteorological data for the US Corn Belt from 1981 to 2014 as an exemplar, but would be readily transferable to other crops, locations and spatial scales. Experimentation with a number of models shows that maize growth rates can be characterised by a two-dimensional Gaussian function of temperature and precipitation with monthly contributions accumulated over the growing period. This approach accounts for non-linear growth responses to the individual meteorological variables, and allows for interactions between them. Our models correctly identify that temperature and precipitation have the largest impact on yield in the six months prior to the harvest, in agreement with the typical growing season for US maize (April to September). Maximal growth rates occur for monthly mean temperature 18 °C–19 °C, corresponding to a daily maximum temperature of 24 °C– 25 °C (in broad agreement with previous work) and monthly total precipitation 115 mm. Our approach also provides a self-consistent way of investigating climate change impacts on current US maize varieties in the absence of adaptation measures. Keeping precipitation and growing area fixed, a temperature increase of 2 °C, relative to 1981–2014, results in the mean yield decreasing by 8%, while the yield variance increases by a factor of around 3. We thus provide a flexible, data-driven framework for exploring the impacts of natural climate variability and climate change on globally significant crops based on their observed behaviour. In concert with other approaches, this can help inform the development of adaptation strategies that will ensure food security under a changing climate. © 2020 The Author(s).

GCM forecasts typically require postprocessing to reduce biases and improve reliability; however, current seasonal postprocessing methods often ignore multivariate dependence. In low-dimensional settings, fully parametric methods may sufficiently model intervariable covariance. On the other hand, empirical ensemble reordering techniques can inject desired multivariate dependence in ensembles from template data after univariate postprocessing. To investigate the best approach for seasonal forecasting, this study develops and tests several strategies for calibrating seasonal GCM forecasts of rainfall, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature with intervariable dependence: 1) simultaneous calibration of multiple climate variables using the Bayesian joint probability modeling approach; 2) univariate BJP calibration coupled with an ensemble reordering method (the Schaake shuffle); and 3) transformation-based quantile mapping, which borrows intervariable dependence from the raw forecasts. Applied to Australian seasonal forecasts from the ECMWF System4 model, univariate calibration paired with empirical ensemble reordering performs best in terms of univariate and multivariate forecast verification metrics, including the energy and variogram scores. However, the performance of empirical ensemble reordering using the Schaake shuffle is influenced by the selection of historical data in constructing a dependence template. Direct multivariate calibration is the second-best method, with its far superior performance in in-sample testing vanishing in cross validation, likely because of insufficient data relative to the number of parameters. The continued development of multivariate forecast calibration methods will support the uptake of seasonal climate forecasts in complex application domains such as agriculture and hydrology. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.",,"Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Calibration; Natural resources management; Statistical tests; Forecast calibrations; Forecast verifications; Multivariate calibration; Postprocessing methods; Quantitative modeling; Seasonal climate forecast; Simultaneous calibration; Transformation based; Forecasting; air temperature; calibration; climate modeling; climate prediction; climate variation; general circulation model; multivariate analysis; quantitative analysis; rainfall; seasonal variation; Australia",Article,Scopus

To combat such hurdles, developed techniques are being employed. Through a survey of existing literature, this chapter provides a comprehensive overview of various image processing means that could come in handy for ameliorating the present scenario and shows their implied extension in the smart farming world. © 2020, IGI Global.",,,Book Chapter,Scopus

Water stress makes this region vulnerable to drought, but glaciers are a uniquely drought-resilient source of water. Here I show that seasonal glacier meltwater is equivalent to the basic needs of 221 ± 59 million people, or most of the annual municipal and industrial needs of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. During drought summers, meltwater dominates water inputs to the upper Indus, Aral and Chu/Issyk-Kul river basins. This reduces the risk of social instability, conflict and sudden migrations triggered by water scarcity, which is already associated with the large, rapidly growing populations and hydro-economies of these basins. Regional meltwater production is, however, unsustainably high—at 1.6 times the balance rate—and is expected to increase in future decades before ultimately declining.

Furthermore, we propose a post-processing method to calibrate the raw ETo forecasts to observations and improve overall reliability and skill. The post-processing method comprises: (1) the Yeo-Johnson transformation to handle the non-normal distribution of daily ETo, (2) the bi-variate normal distribution to formulate the relationship between transformed raw forecasts and observations, and (3) the Schaake shuffle to establish realistic temporal behaviour in each ensemble member. For three distinct Australian case-study locations, ETo forecasts derived from raw ACCESS-S1 outputs are positively correlated with observations up to 16 days ahead. However, raw forecasts verify more poorly than naïve climatology forecasts because of significant bias and poor ensemble spreads. Post-processing the raw ACCESS-S1 ETo improves skill and reliability markedly. Skilful daily ETo forecasts are achieved in the first week, and the skill of cumulative ETo forecasts extends beyond two weeks into the future.

Improving our understanding of their impacts on crop yields is crucial to enhance the resilience of the global food system. This study analyses, to our knowledge for the first time, the impacts of climate extremes on yield anomalies of maize, soybeans, rice and spring wheat at the global scale using sub-national yield data and applying a machine-learning algorithm. We find that growing season climate factors - including mean climate as well as climate extremes - explain 20%-49% of the variance of yield anomalies (the range describes the differences between crop types), with 18%-43% of the explained variance attributable to climate extremes, depending on crop type. Temperature-related extremes show a stronger association with yield anomalies than precipitation-related factors, while irrigation partly mitigates negative effects of high temperature extremes. We developed a composite indicator to identify hotspot regions that are critical for global production and particularly susceptible to the effects of climate extremes. These regions include North America for maize, spring wheat and soy production, Asia in the case of maize and rice production as well as Europe for spring wheat production.

For large-scale watershed modeling, weather data are either generated by using interpolation methods or derived from assimilated datasets. In the present study, we compared model performances of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), as driven by interpolation weather data, and NASA North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase Two (NLDAS2) weather dataset in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). The SWAT model fed with different weather datasets were used to simulate monthly stream flow at 11 United States Geological Survey (USGS) monitoring stations in the UMRB. Model performances were evaluated based on three metrics: coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS), and percent bias (Pbias). The results show that, after calibration, the SWAT model compared well at all monitoring stations for monthly stream flow using different weather datasets indicating that the SWAT model can adequately produce long-term water yield in UMRB. The results also show that using NLDAS2 weather dataset can improve SWAT prediction of monthly stream flow with less prediction uncertainty in the UMRB. We concluded that NLDAS2 dataset could be used by the SWAT model for large-scale watersheds like UMRB as a surrogate of the interpolation weather data. Further analyses results show that NLDAS2 daily solar radiation data was about 2.5 MJ m-2 higher than the interpolation data. As such, the SWAT model driven by NLDAS2 dataset tended to underestimate stream flow in the UMRB due to the overestimation in evapotranspiration in uncalibrated conditions. Thus, the implication of overestimated solar radiation by NLDAS2 dataset should be considered before using NLDAS2 dataset to drive the hydrological model. © 2019 by the authors.","Reanalysis climate data; Stream flow; SWAT; Watershed modeling","Interpolation; Large dataset; Meteorology; NASA; Rivers; Solar radiation; Stream flow; Watersheds; Climate data; Coefficient of determination; Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient; North american land data assimilation systems; Soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; United states geological surveys; Watershed modeling; Digital storage; data set; evapotranspiration; hydrological modeling; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; water yield; watershed; Mississippi River; United States",Article,Scopus

Improved agronomy and the release of cultivars suited to a wider range of environments have facilitated the expansion of canola production into new environments. To maximise grain yield at earlier sowing dates and in new environments, growers need to know the most suitable development pattern for their environment and sowing date to reduce production losses associated with frost, heat and drought at flowering. A simulation analysis was conducted at 77 locations across the Australian cropping zone to determine the optimal period for flowering to start in order to maximise long-term yield. The simulation accounted for effects of frost, heat and water stress on yield as well as duration of biomass accumulation. The optimal start of flowering period (OSF) was a function of the environment rather than the cultivar, and the relative importance of frost, heat and water stress varied with location. We found that the OSF was earlier (mid to late July), in most Mediterranean environments of Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria and later (August to September) in the southern temperate environments of Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales (NSW). In medium and low rainfall areas of NSW, temperature extremes and rainfall interacted so that the OSF occurred in mid-July to mid-August. In low rainfall environments the duration of the optimal period was shorter (19–35 days) in most cases than in high rainfall environments (30–52 days). Knowledge of the OSF for a location, will allow breeders to develop cultivars with appropriate phenological characteristics for target environments. For growers, an understanding of the OSF, combined with an appropriate phenology classification of commercial cultivars, will allow selection of cultivar and sowing date combinations which decrease the risk of stress and maximise productivity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Critical period; Drought; Frost; Heat; Phenology; Rapeseed; Simulation model; Stress","agronomy; canola; cultivar; drought; environmental stress; farm size; flowering; frost; heating; Mediterranean environment; numerical model; phenology; rainfall; simulation; sowing date; temperature; water stress; yield response; Australia; Brassica napus; Brassica napus var. napus",Article,Scopus

Many successful applications have been made in crop yield estimation using remotely sensed products, such as vegetation index (VI) from multispectral imagery. However, VI-based approaches are only suitable for estimating rice grain yield at the middle stage of growth but have limited capability at the ripening stage. In this study, an efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was proposed to learn the important features related to rice grain yield from low-altitude remotely sensed imagery. In one major region for rice cultivation of Southern China, a 160-hectare site with over 800 management units was chosen to investigate the ability of CNN in rice grain yield estimation. The datasets of RGB and multispectral images were obtained by a fixed-wing, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which was mounted with a digital camera and multispectral sensors. The network was trained with different datasets and compared against the traditional vegetation index-based method. In addition, the temporal and spatial generality of the trained network was investigated. The results showed that the CNNs trained by RGB and multispectral datasets perform much better than VIs-based regression model for rice grain yield estimation at the ripening stage. The RGB imagery of very high spatial resolution contains important spatial features with respect to grain yield distribution, which can be learned by deep CNN. The results highlight the promising potential of deep convolutional neural networks for rice grain yield estimation with excellent spatial and temporal generality, and a wider time window of yield forecasting. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CNN; Deep learning; Rice crop; UAV; Yield estimation","agricultural management; artificial neural network; crop yield; developmental stage; estimation method; machine learning; policy making; remote sensing; rice; ripening; satellite imagery; unmanned vehicle; yield response; China",Article,Scopus

Currently, a number of machine learning methods would resort to using averaged spectral information over wide bandwidths resulting in loss of crucial information available in those contiguous bands. The loss of information could mean a drop in the discriminative power when it comes to land cover classes with comparable spectral responses, as in the case of cultivated fields versus fallow lands. In this study, we proposed and tested three new optimized novel algorithms based on Moment Distance Index (MDI) that characterizes the whole shape of the spectral curve. The image classification tests conducted on two publicly available hyperspectral data sets (AVIRIS 1992 Indian Pine and HYDICE Washington DC Mall images) showed the robustness of the optimized algorithms in terms of classification accuracy. We achieved an overall accuracy of 98% and 99% for AVIRIS and HYDICE, respectively. The optimized indices were also time efficient as it avoided the process of band dimension reduction, such as those implemented by several well-known classifiers. Our results showed the potential of optimized shape indices, specifically the Moment Distance Ratio Right/Left (MDRRL), to discriminate between types of tillage (corn-min and corn-notill) and between grass/pasture and grass/trees, tree and grass under object-based random forest approach. © 2019 Salas, Subburayalu.

A constant monitoring of salinity affected areas is imperative to prevent land degradation, agricultural and livelihood losses. With this aim, we developed three soil salinity models with direct, indirect and a combination of both of these soil salinity measurement techniques, for south-western Bangladesh. The five salinity indexes (direct) and eleven environmental variables (indirect) were integrated using Principal Component Analysis, and the predictability of the models was evaluated against ground-based soil salinity measurements from soil survey and land cover maps generated during the model development. Delineation based solely on salinity indexes yielded results that contradicted with models developed from indirect variables and combining all the variables. Results suggest that the salinity model developed by combining direct and indirect techniques has the highest prediction capacity and can also be explained in terms of land cover changes. Therefore, an integrated approach yielded better delineation of salt-affected areas, characterized by active hydrological processes and vegetation cover.

Therefore, agricultural producers, researchers and policy makers need to pay more attention to appropriate land management as an important strategy to achieve greater yield per unit area and to use soil and water resources in an optimal way. So, the present study was conducted to model the relationships between pistachio yield and soil, water and management variables in Rafsanjan region, the southeast of Iran. One hundred and ninety nine mature orchards were selected and sampled in such a way that an acceptable range of soil and water quality and management were included. The data set consisted of a dependent variable (pistachio yield) and 67 independent variables including soil, water and management characteristics. The results of hybrid genetic algorithm-artificial neural network (GA-ANN) showed that the lowest error was related to the case in which the 23 features were used in modeling. Then, stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques were applied to estimate pistachio yield. The results indicated that MLR could explain only 28% of the pistachio yield variation, whereas its accuracy increased when the data became more homogeneous via geographically dividing the study area into four parts with the highest densities of pistachio orchards. ANN-based model had a 90% accuracy to predict pistachio yield in the study area. Thus, an accurate estimation of pistachio yield could be achieved by reducing the data dimensionality using feature selection techniques and modeling with ANN. As the models were highly sensitive to irrigation water features, special attention should be paid to new irrigation methods and management practices as an effective strategy to minimize water losses and increase water use efficiency. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial neural network; Feature selection; Hybrid models; Multiple linear regression; Pistachio orchard management; Soil quality","Cultivation; Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Irrigation; Linear regression; Neural networks; Orchards; Precipitation (meteorology); Soils; Water quality; Water supply; Feature selection techniques; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Hybrid model; Independent variables; Management characteristics; Multiple linear regressions; Soil quality; Stepwise multiple linear regression; Data reduction; artificial neural network; crop yield; cultivation; estimation method; exploitation; genetic algorithm; groundwater; homogeneity; land management; management practice; nut; soil property; soil quality; water management; water quality; water resource; Iran; Kerman [Iran]; Rafsanjan; Pistacia vera",Article,Scopus

The use of remote sensing to measure crop production at high latitudes is hindered by intrinsic challenges, such as a low sun elevation angle and a coastal climate with high humidity, which influences the spectral signatures of the sampled vegetation. We used a portable spectrometer (ASD FieldSpec 3) to assess spectra of grass crops and found that when applying multivariate models to the hyperspectral datasets, results show significant predictability of yields (R2 &gt; 0.55, root mean squared error (RMSE) &lt; 180), even when captured under sub-optimal conditions. These results are consistent both in the full spectral range of the spectrometer (350-2500 nm) and in the 350-900 nm spectral range, which is a region more robust against air moisture. Sentinel-2A simulations resulted in moderately robust models that could be used in qualitative assessments of field productivity. In addition, simulation of the upcoming hyperspectral EnMap satellite bands showed its potential applicability to measure yields in northern latitudes both in the full spectral range of the satellite (420-2450 nm) with similar performance as the Sentinel-2A satellite and in the 420-900 nm range with a comparable reliability to the portable spectrometer. The combination of EnMap and Sentinel-2A to detect fields with low productivity and portable spectrometers to identify the fields or specific regions of fields with the lowest production can help optimize the management of fodder production in high latitudes. © 2019 by the authors.","Arctic agriculture; Crop; EnMap; Grass; Partial least squares (PLS); Remote sensing; Yield","Crops; Cultivation; Least squares approximations; Mean square error; Productivity; Satellites; Spectrometers; EnMap; Grass; Low growth temperature; Multivariate models; Partial least square (PLS); Qualitative assessments; Root mean squared errors; Yield; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

To plan the location of such tile drain measures, it is important to know where in the landscape drain flow is generated and to understand the key factors governing drain flow dynamics. In the present study, we test two approaches to assess spatial patterns in drain flow generation and thereby assess the importance of including geological information. The approaches are the widely used topographical wetness index (TWI), based solely on elevation data, and hydrological models that include the subsurface geology. We set-up an ensemble of 20 hydrological models based on 20 stochastically generated geological models to predict drain flow dynamics in the clay till Norsminde catchment in Denmark and test the results against TWI. We find that the hydrological models predict observed daily drain flow reasonably well. High drain flow volumes were found in stream valleys and in wetlands and lower drain flow volumes in the more hilly parts of the catchment. In spite of the apparent connection to the landscape, there was no statistically significant correlation between TWI and drain flow at grid scale (100 × 100 m). TWI was therefore not found to be a sufficient index on its own to assess where drain flow is generated, especially in the highlands of the catchment. The geology below 3 m was found to have a large impact on the drain flow, and correlations between sand percentage in the subsurface geology and drain flow volume were found to be statistically significant. Geological uncertainty therefore give rise to uncertainty on simulated drain flow, and this uncertainty was found to be high at the model grid scale but decreasing with increasing scale. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","drain flow; geology; hydrological modelling; spatial patterns; topographical wetness index (TWI); uncertainty","Catchments; Geology; Runoff; Drain flow; Hydrological modelling; Spatial patterns; topographical wetness index (TWI); uncertainty; Uncertainty analysis; fluid dynamics; hydrogeology; hydrological modeling; spatial data; steady-state equilibrium; subsurface flow; tile drain; uncertainty analysis; Denmark",Article,Scopus

However, the transformation of data into knowledge for decision making remains a major challenge. In the Brazilian sugarcane industry, the current use of PA technology is very far from its full potential for site-specific management, mainly because yields are not temporally or spatially monitored. The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the physical and chemical properties of soils and sugarcane yield, thereby identifying the soil parameters that determine the final productivity of the field. Two sugarcane fields were monitored from 2011 to 2014. During the crop season, soil samples and yield data were collected annually. A random forest algorithm was applied to investigate the influence of different soil attributes on yield using data that were collected spatially over the study period. The results showed that the amount of available soil organic matter (OM), clay content and cation exchange capacity (CEC) are important factors impacting sugarcane yield variation. Furthermore, it was found that the temporal variability in yield is caused mainly by the variability in soil pH over the study period. The results indicated that when OM increased over time, there was greater phosphorus availability.

The main objectives of this paper are (1) to propose a Deep Learning (DL) algorithm, the Stacked Sparse Auto-encoder (SSAE), for rice-yield estimation using climatic and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data; (2) to choose scenarios showing the best combined performance in terms of length of crop season (before and after harvest) and aggregation periods (7, 10, 15, and 30 days) of climatic data; and (3) to analyse the results in both the temporal and spatial perspectives. In this procedure, the SSAE model was built around the study objectives and compared with the artificial neural network (ANN) model for evaluation of its performance. According to the results, the combined 15-day-aggregated climatic data (between June and August) and MODIS data were selected as the optimal feature set for rice-yield estimation in the study area, Jeolla-do; the SSAE model outperformed ANN, showing root mean square error (RMSE) and RMSE% of 33.09 kg(10a) −1 (5.21 kg(10a) −1 lower than ANN) and 6.89% (1.14% lower than ANN).

At 5.4 t/ha, the wheat yield was the lowest recorded since 1986 and 30% below the 5-year average. Crop yield forecasting can be considered as near-real-time impact modeling, but unfortunately, none of the forecasting systems in place anticipated the extent of the impact. We summarize key insights and assess the reasons for our failure to forecast French wheat accurately in 2016, with wider implications for quantifying the impacts of extremes on agriculture. The 2015/2016 growing season was characterized by compounding warm autumn temperatures and abnormally wet conditions the following spring. High rainfall and high temperatures leading to fungal diseases, soil water lodging and anoxia, low radiation affecting grain filling, and leaching of nitrogen have all been suggested as important factors ultimately leading to the yield loss. The use of binomial logistic regressions accounting for warm autumn and wet spring conditions together with autumn precipitation and June temperatures, suggests that the odds of an extreme yield loss (i.e., < 10th percentile) in 2016 was 35 times higher than expected. The challenge now is further untangling the variety of biotic and abiotic processes interacting at different timescales that can explain observed patterns. Collecting relevant insights from field trial experiments and confronting these with statistical and biophysical crop modeling will be key to achieve this. Besides improving forecasting methodologies, improving the collection, combination, and aggregation of novel real-time data streams will be necessary. Interestingly, a map of yield estimates based on Tweets of farmers harvesting their wheat was the first indication that something was amiss. Such novel data streams can help to anticipate impacts. Improved impact relevant predictors will need to be integrated into operational crop yield forecasting systems in preparation for future compound events. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The examples are meant to stimulate discussions on how both research areas can deliver solutions to avoid looming food crises due to population growth and climate change. In the last decades, unprecedented progress has been made in the understanding of how plants grow and develop in a variety of environments and in response to biotic stresses, but appropriate management and interpretation of the resulting complex datasets remains challenging. After providing an historical overview of integrative plant physiology, we discuss possible avenues of integration, involving advances in integrative plant physiology, to sustain plant production in the current post-omics era.

Different methods have been used to forecast yield with different levels of granularity, accuracy and timing. This chapter presents a critical review of the current seasonal crop yield forecasting methods found in the scientific literature. Extensive research has been conducted on crop yield forecast, particularly for wheat, maize, rice, barley, and soybean. Yield forecast are mainly based on field surveys, statistical regressions between historical yield and in-season variables (agrometeorological, or remotely sensed data), crop simulation models, or on integration between statistical modeling with dynamic process-based crop simulation models. A low number of studies rely on field surveys as a means to forecast yield, but they remain the main methods of yield forecast and estimation in several countries (i.e., USA). This chapter aims to report results found in peer-review journals for different crops, methods, geographies, and accuracies, and to end with a critical perspective on the advantage and disadvantage of the different methods currently employed by researchers and stakeholders. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Agrometeorological models; Barley; Crop models; Crop yield forecasting; In-season predictions; Maize; Remote sensing; Rice; Soybean; Wheat",,Book Chapter,Scopus

Our objectives were to investigate the relationship between yield-related indices of winter wheat and the related climatic variables (selected using variance inflation factors) at the 20 sites of Xinjiang, China over 1981–2017. The background of climate and yield changes was analyzed from temporal and spatial respects. The number of independent climatic variables was selected with the variance inflation factor method to remove the multicollinear feature. The Pearson correlation was conducted between the first difference values of climatic variables and yield-related indices of winter wheat (namely plant height, growth period duration, 1000-kernel weight, kernel number per ear, biomass and yield) to find the key climatic variables that impacted winter wheat growth and yields. The multi-variate linear and nonlinear functions were established step by step using the selected key climatic variables. The best function was determined for each site (significant for p < 0.05). From the results, there were general wetter and warmer trends of the climatic variables. Corre-spondingly, shortened winter wheat phenology and increased growth and yields were observed for most sites. Still, the climatic trends had mixed effects on winter wheat yields. The effects of precip-itation, mean air temperature and relative humidity on plant height and growth period duration agreed well. Different sites had different major climatic drivers for winter wheat growth or yields, and the best functions of growth and yields could be linearly or nonlinearly, mostly described by multi-variate functions. The winter wheat growth or yield indices were also found to be closely connected with the soil water content status at the eight sites. The relationship between winter wheat growth or yield and climate provided useful references for forecasting crop production and for projecting the impact of future climate changes. © 2021 by the authors.

On-farm agroforestry systems can reduce dependency on off-farm fuel; however, the output of on-farm produced fuel is typically uncertain as production potentials are often not known. In this paper, we have developed allometric equations to model the above-ground woody biomass (AGWB) production from intercropped Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp (Gliricidia) shrubs and Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. (pigeon pea) plants. Methods: We used a destructive sampling approach, for measuring the dendrometric characteristics, such as the root collar diameter at a 20 cm stem height (RCD20) and the stem height to estimate the AGWB production. The models are based on 112 Gliricidia and 80 pigeon pea observations from annually pruned plants. Seven allometric equations were fitted to derive the best-fit models for the AGWB production. Results: We found that using a natural log-transformed linear model with RCD20 as a single predictor variable provides the highest explanatory value to estimate the AGWB production (Gliricidia: R2 = 95.7%, pigeon pea: R2 = 91.4%) while meeting Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimator requirements. Adding stem height as an additional variable to predict the AGWB production does not improve model accuracy enough to justify the extra work for including it. Conclusions: While on-farm pigeon pea plants produced a stable amount of woody biomass per annum, annual fuelwood production from Gliricidia shrubs increased over the years. Compared to the annual fuelwood consumption data from the literature, our results show that on-farm produced fuelwood can substantially offset the demand for off-farm fuel, potentially resulting in household fuelwood autarky. © 2021, The Author(s).","Agroforestry; Energy mix; Energy self-sufficiency; Food security; Intercropping; Smallholder farmer","Biomass; Deforestation; Fuels; Wood products; Above-ground woody biomass; Agroforestry; Biomass productions; Energy mix; Energy self-sufficiency; Food security; Fuelwood; Intercropping; Pigeon pea; Smallholder farmers; Food supply; allometry; crop production; estimation method; legume; semiarid region; shrub; spatiotemporal analysis; Tanzania; Cajanus cajan; Gliricidia; Gliricidia sepium",Article,Scopus

This study applies the technology acceptance model (TAM) of Davis (1989) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB) of Ajzen (1991) to investigate which behavioral factors are influencing the acceptance of AI in agriculture. The composite model is extended by two additional factors, expectation of property rights over business data and personal innovativeness. A structural equation analysis is used to determine the importance of factors influencing the acceptance of AI systems in agriculture. For this purpose, 84 farmers were surveyed with a letter or an online questionnaire. Results show that the perceived behavioral control has the greatest influence on acceptance, followed by farmers’ personal attitude towards AI systems in agriculture.

Drought can decrease the production of Chinese Brassica, whereas over-irrigation can waste water. It is desirable to schedule irrigation when the crop suffers from water stress. In this study, a random forest model was developed using sample data derived from meteorological measurements including air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS), and photosynthetic active radiation (Par) to predict the lower baseline (Twet) and upper baseline (Tdry) canopy temperatures for Chinese Brassica from 27 November to 31 December 2020 (E1) and from 25 May to 20 June 2021 (E2). Crop water stress index (CWSI) values were determined based on the predicted canopy temperature and used to assess the crop water status. The study demonstrated the viability of using a random forest model to forecast Twet and Tdry. The coefficients of determination (R2) in E1 were 0.90 and 0.88 for development and 0.80 and 0.77 for validation, respectively. The R2 values in E2 were 0.91 and 0.89 for development and 0.83 and 0.80 for validation, respectively. Our results reveal that the measured and predicted CWSI values had similar R2 values related to stomatal conductance (~0.5 in E1, ~0.6 in E2), whereas the CWSI showed a poor correlation with transpiration rate (~0.25 in E1, ~0.2 in E2). Finally, the methodology used to calculate the daily CWSI for Chinese Brassica in this study showed that both Twet and Tdry, which require frequent measuring and design experiment due to the trial site and condition changes, have the potential to simulate environmental parameters and can therefore be applied to conveniently calculate the CWSI. © 2021 by the authors.

The state of the art analysis concerns various methodological approaches, including selection of data in terms of spatial resolution, selection of algorithms, as well as external conditions related to arable land use, especially the structure of crops. The results achieved with use of various approaches and classifiers and subsequently reported in the literature vary depending on the crops and area of analysis and the sources of satellite data. Hence, their review and systematic conclusions are needed, especially in the context of the growing interest in automatic processes of identifying crops for statistical purposes or monitoring changes in arable land. The results of this study show no significant difference between the accuracy achieved from different machine learning algorithms, yet on average artificial neural network classifiers have results that are better by a few percent than others.

In most cases, spectral information derived from multispectral or hyperspectral images is used alone for yield estimation, while variables that contain spatial information such as textural measures were not considered. As UAV can acquire images with spatial resolution at centimeter-level, which contain rich spatial information of observed objects, the test of textural measures in improving yield estimation becomes possible. In this study, UAV-based hyperspectral images of rice in the east of China were acquired in 2017, 2018 and 2019 three consecutive year during rice growing seasons. Eight gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based texture measures were derived, and all two band combinations of these textural measures as well as spectral reflectance in three types (normalized type, differential type and simple ratio type) were calculated to developing textural and spectral index. Grain yield estimation models were established using spectral indices alone and spectral indices combining textural measures, respectively. The results show that models based on spectral indices combining textural measures all performed better than these using spectral indices alone, with coefficient of determination R2 of the best model greater than 0.8, RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 0.421 Mg ha−1 and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) of 4.66% for calibration results, and 0.521 Mg ha−1 and 6.63% for validation results. Meanwhile, spectral indices combining textural measures can adjust the problems of overestimation and underestimation in models developed with spectral indices alone. This kind of improvement is especially obvious when grain yield is below 5.0 Mg ha−1 or above 8.0 Mg ha−1. Besides, the estimation accuracy of the model based on spectral index combining textural measure at the booting stage was equivalent to the model based on spectral indices at the booting and heading stages, indicating that textural measures may be helpful in monitoring grain yield at an earlier stage. © 2021 The Authors","Grain yield; Rice; Spectral index; Textural measure; UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)","crop yield; multispectral image; rice; spectral analysis; unmanned vehicle",Article,Scopus

However, other similar agroecosystems with extensive data resources can be of use. We propose a new predictive modeling approach based upon the concept of transfer learning to solve the problem of data deficiency in predicting productivity of agroecosystems, where productivity is a nonlinear function of various interacting biotic and abiotic factors. We describe the process of building metamodels (machine learning models built and trained on simulation data) from simulations built for one agroecosystem (US wild blueberry) as the source domain, where the data resource is abundant. Metamodels are evaluated and the best metamodel representing the system dynamics is selected. The best metamodel is re-parameterized and calibrated to another agroecosystem (Northeast China bog blueberry) as the target domain where field collected data are lacking. Experimental results showed that our metamodel developed for wild blueberry achieved 78% accuracy in fruit-set prediction for bog blueberry. To demonstrate its usefulness, we applied this calibrated metamodel to investigate the response of bog blueberry to various weather conditions. We found that an 8% reduction in fruit-set of bog blueberry is likely to happen if weather becomes warmer and wetter as predicted by climate models. In addition, southern and eastern production regions will suffer more severe fruit-set decline than the other growing regions. Predictions also suggest that increasing commercially available honeybee densities to 18 bees/m2 /min, or bumble bee densities to 0.6 bees/m2 /min, is a viable way to compensate for the predicted 8% climate induced fruit-set decline in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

Such yield predictions typically are based on multi-parametric models and in-situ sampling. Here we investigate the extension of a greenhouse study, to low-altitude unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Our principal objective was to investigate snap bean crop (Phaseolus vulgaris) yield using imaging spectroscopy (hyperspectral imaging) in the visible to near-infrared (VNIR; 400–1000 nm) region via UAS. We aimed to solve the problem of crop yield modelling by identifying spectral features explaining yield and evaluating the best time period for accurate yield prediction, early in time. We introduced a Python library, named Jostar, for spectral feature selection. Embedded in Jostar, we proposed a new ranking method for selected features that reaches an agreement between multiple optimization models. Moreover, we implemented a well-known denoising algorithm for the spectral data used in this study. This study benefited from two years of remotely sensed data, captured at multiple instances over the summers of 2019 and 2020, with 24 plots and 18 plots, respectively. Two harvest stage models, early and late harvest, were assessed at two different locations in upstate New York, USA. Six varieties of snap bean were quantified using two components of yield, pod weight and seed length. We used two different vegetation detection algorithms. the Red-Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (RENDVI) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), to subset the fields into vegetation vs. non-vegetation pixels. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used as the regression model. Among nine different optimization models embedded in Jostar, we selected the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Simulated Annealing (SA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and their resulting joint ranking. The findings show that pod weight can be explained with a high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.78–0.93) and low root-mean-square error (RMSE = 940–1369 kg/ha) for two years of data. Seed length yield assessment resulted in higher accuracies (R2 = 0.83–0.98) and lower errors (RMSE = 4.245–6.018 mm). Among optimization models used, ACO and SA outperformed others and the SAM vegetation detection approach showed improved results when compared to the RENDVI approach when dense canopies were being examined. Wavelengths at 450, 500, 520, 650, 700, and 760 nm, were identified in almost all data sets and harvest stage models used. The period between 44–55 days after planting (DAP) the optimal time period for yield assessment. Future work should involve transferring the learned concepts to a multispectral system, for eventual operational use; further attention should also be paid to seed length as a ground truth data collection technique, since this yield indicator is far more rapid and straightforward. © 2021 by the authors.

The salt-affected soil is predominant in the Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve (ELWNNR) in the Northwestern China. It influences the development of agricultural economy. Rapid and accurate measurement of the soil salt content (SSC) is significant for the soil salinization control. However, the traditional method of obtaining soil salt is time-consuming and laborious. Nowadays, it is an unprecedented perspective to monitor soil salinity through Sentinel-2A multispectral remote sensing image to construct three-dimensional spectral index. In this study, through soil salt data of 97 ground-truth measurements, Sentinel-2A data-derived spectral indices, based on particle swarm optimization support vector machine (PSO-SVM), gray wolf optimization support vector machine (GWO-SVM) and differential evolution support vector machine (DE-SVM) algorithm to construct a best soil salt inversion models. The results show that three-band (3D) spectral index has better correlation with soil salinity than single band and two-band (2D) spectral index, among TBI5 and TBI7 has a high correlation with the salinity of the soil, and the points are concentrated on the 1:1 line. Therefore, this approach could be applied to estimate the soil salinity in the Ebinur Lake region. The established models were validated using the Machine learning algorithm. The DE-SVM model performed the best by the three Model of accuracy with R2, Bias, and SEP2C of 0.56, − 2.03, and 8.62, respectively. Therefore through the soil salinity value predicted by the modeling constructs a linear relationship with the indexes TBI5 and TBI7, and draw the soil salt inversion map, soil salinity around the lake is relatively high, and decreases outward along the lake, which is consistent with the field. The result from this model will be useful for soil salinization monitoring in the study area and can provide theoretical support for the estimation of SSC in arid and semi-arid areas. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Machine learning algorithm; Sentinel-2A; Spectral indices","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Arid regions; Lakes; Learning algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Remote sensing; Saline water; Soils; Support vector machines; Water quality; Accurate measurement; Agricultural economy; Arid and semi-arid areas; Differential Evolution; Farming activities; Linear relationships; Modeling construct; Multispectral remote sensing image; Soil surveys; algorithm; ground-based measurement; human activity; index method; land degradation; machine learning; remote sensing; saline soil; salinity; satellite data; Sentinel; soil analysis; spectral analysis; China; Ebinur Lake; Xinjiang Uygur; Canis lupus; Varanidae",Article,Scopus

This study aimed to explore a rapid and accurate method for varieties classification of different crop seeds under the sample-limited condition based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and deep transfer learning. Three deep neural networks with typical structures were designed based on a sample-rich Pea dataset. Obtained the highest accuracy of 99.57%, VGG-MODEL was transferred to classify four target datasets (rice, oat, wheat, and cotton) with limited samples. Accuracies of the deep transferred model achieved 95, 99, 80.8, and 83.86% on the four datasets, respectively. Using training sets with different sizes, the deep transferred model could always obtain higher performance than other traditional methods. The visualization of the deep features and classification results confirmed the portability of the shared features of seed spectra, providing an interpreted method for rapid and accurate varieties classification of crop seeds. The overall results showed great superiority of HSI combined with deep transfer learning for seed detection under sample-limited condition.

In the last decade, precision agriculture technology has become affordable in many countries; Global Positioning Systems for automatic guidance instruments and proximal sensors can be used to guide the distribution of nutrients such as nitrogen (N) fertilization using real-time applications. A two-year field experiment (2017–2018) was carried out to quantify maize yield in response to variable rate (VR) N distribution, which was determined with a proximal vigour sensor, as an alternative to a fixed rate (FR) in a cereal-livestock farm located in the Po valley (northern Italy). The amount of N distributed for the FR (140 kg N ha−1) was calculated according to the crop requirement and the regional regulation: ±30% of the FR rate was applied in the VR treatment according to the Vigour S-index calculated on-the-go from the CropSpec sensor. The two treatments of N fertilization did not result in a significant difference in yield in both years. The findings suggest that the application of VR is more economically profitable than the FR application rate, especially under the hypothesis of VR application at a farm scale. The outcome of the experiment suggests that VR is a viable and profitable technique that can be easily applied at the farm level by adopting proximal sensors to detect the actual crop N requirement prior to stem elongation. Besides the economic benefits, the VR approach can be regarded as a sustainable practice that meets the current European Common Agricultural Policy. © 2021 by the authors.

Both environmental (climatic and edaphic) conditions and management factors affect the variabilities of crop yield. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive data-driven analysis in the U.S. Corn Belt to understand and model how rainfed corn yield is affected by climate variability and extremes, soil properties (soil available water capacity, soil organic matter), and management practices (planting date and fertilizer applications). Exploratory data analyses revealed that corn yield responds non-linearly to temperature, while the negative vapor pressure deficit (VPD) effect on corn yield is monotonic and more prominent. Higher mean yield and inter-annual yield variability are found associated with high soil available water capacity, while lower inter-annual yield variability is associated with high soil organic matter (SOM). We also identified region-dependent relationships between planting date and yield and a strong correlation between planting date and the April weather condition (temperature and rainfall). Next, we built machine learning models using the random forest and LASSO algorithms, respectively, to predict corn yield with all climatic, soil properties, and management factors. The random forest model achieved a high prediction accuracy for annual yield at county level as early as in July (R2 = 0.781) and outperformed LASSO.

In particular, limited input data are the main obstacles to obtain reliable classification results for early crop mapping. This study investigates the potential of a hybrid classification approach, i.e., CNN-random forest (CNN-RF), in the context of early crop mapping, that combines the automatic feature extraction capability of CNN with the superior discrimination capability of an RF classifier. Two experiments on incremental crop classification with unmanned aerial vehicle images were conducted to compare the performance of CNN-RF with that of CNN and RF with respect to the length of the time-series and training data sizes. When sufficient time-series images and training data were used for the classification, the accuracy of CNN-RF was slightly higher or comparable with that of CNN. In contrast, when fewer images and the smallest training data were used at the early crop growth stage, CNN-RF was substantially beneficial and the overall accuracy increased by maximum 6.7%p and 4.6%p in the two study areas, respectively, compared to CNN. This is attributed to its ability to discriminate crops from features with insufficient information using a more sophisticated classifier. The experimental results demonstrate that CNN-RF is an effective classifier for early crop mapping when only limited input images and training samples are available. © 2021 by the authors.

We use London as a case study for three selected outputs, each measured in decile classes: income, overcrowding, and environmental deprivation.

A total of 10 VI were obtained from multispectral images by a camera attached to a rotary-wing RPA. The RGB orthomosaic was used to determine sampling points at the crop area, which were ranked by N levels in the plants as deficient, critical, or sufficient.

This yield may be improved by the automatic detection of diseases and the consequent reduction in the use of pesticides. A digital processing system for images was thus developed and used to identify lesions on the leaves of cotton plants. A collection of 60,659 images of sub-metric resolution showing samples of soil and both healthy and damaged leaves was obtained and processed with an algorithm for the extraction of texture from 102x102-pixel samples. Then they analyzed with a neuro-fuzzy classifier trained to discriminate the three types of regions (soil, healthy leaf, and lesioned leaf). The algorithm developed was able to recognize the three classes. It generated a great amount of information on recognition of background which was more consistent than leaf damage areas. Therefore, it surpassed the performance of areas of healthy leaves. A similar trend was found for sensitivity. The overall accuracy of the system was 71.2%, suggesting that the unbalanced data of the different classes had skewed the results of the algorithm, as the number of false positives for the less well represented classes was greater. The analysis of unbalance (F-Score) showed that, independent of the volume of data, the attributes of texture utilized yielded better results for the images containing areas of damage in relation to overall accuracy. Therefore, given the challenges involved in the automatic identification of lesions in agricultural crops, such as variations in illumination, color, and texture, as well as obstruction, overlapping, and complexity of the region of which the image was taken, the behavior of the model was deemed satisfactory.

This can lead to structural changes in entire ecosystems, and serious, persistent environmental consequences. However, many of these changes occur in vast and poorly accessible biomes and involve myriad species. As a consequence, conventional methods of measurement and data analysis are resource-intensive, restricted in scope, and in some cases, intractable for measuring species changes in remote areas. In this article, we introduce a method for detecting flowers of tundra plant species in large data sets obtained by aerial drones, making it possible to understand ecological change at scale, in remote areas. We focus on the sedge species E. vaginatum that is dominant at the investigated tundra field site in the Canadian Arctic.

The National Agriculture and Food Research Organization– Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Climate Center (NARO-APCC) Crop Forecasting Service provides yield forecasts for global cropland on a monthly basis using seasonal temperature and precipitation forecasts as the main inputs, and 1 year of testing the operation of the service was recently completed. Here we evaluate the forecasts for the 2019 yields of major commodity crops by comparing with the reported yields and forecasts from the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Forecasts for maize, wheat, soybean, and rice were evaluated for 20 countries located in the Northern Hemisphere, including 39 crop-producing states in the United States, for which 2019 reported yields were already publicly available. The NARO-APCC forecasts are available several months earlier than the JRC and USDA forecasts. The skill of the NARO-APCC forecasts was good in absolute terms, but the forecast errors in the NARO-APCC forecasts were almost always larger than those of the JRC and USDA forecasts. The forecast errors in the JRC and USDA forecasts decreased as the harvest approached, whereas those in the NARO-APCC forecasts were rather stable over the season, with some exceptions. Although this feature seems to be a disadvantage, it may turn into an advantage if skillful forecasts are achievable in the earlier stages of a season. We conclude by discussing relative advantages and disadvantages and potential ways to improve global yield forecasting. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.","Agriculture; Climate prediction; Climate services; Forecast verification/skill; Regression analysis; Seasonal forecasting","Agricultural robots; Food supply; Supply chains; Weather forecasting; Climate extremes; Economic Co-operation; European Commission; Northern Hemispheres; Precipitation forecast; Research centres; Seasonal temperature; U.s. department of agricultures; Crops; agricultural development; climate prediction; crop yield; food production; forecasting method; regression analysis; seasonal variation; United States; Glycine max",Article,Scopus

In this study, the ArcSWAT model was applied to determine the sediment yield and sediment load of the Ungauged Huluka River watershed through the parameters transfer method. This particular study calibrated and validated the ArcSWAT model on the Guder River gauging station of watershed area 659 km2. The calibrated and validated best values were extended to all the sub-basin to estimate the sediment yield and sediment load of the ungauged Huluka River watershed. The ArcSWAT model was found certain with statistical performance procedures like regression coefficient, Nash–Sutcliffe and percentage of bias. The model was calibrated and validated with accepted statistical performance values on the monthly time scale. The statistical performance like regression coefficient, Nash and percentage of biased were dramatically increased upon the validation period to very good range according to Arnold et al. The estimated average sediment yield of the whole Guder sub-basin was found to be 4.3 (ton/ha). The annual average sediment load contributed from the Huluka River watershed was found to be 37.5 Kiloton/year. The estimated average annual sediment quantities at Guder gauging station and the whole Guder sub-basin were 344.8 Kiloton/year and 1.1 Megaton/year, with data ranging from 1998 to 2014 (17 years). Three different best management practices (BMPs) such as contouring, strip cropping and terracing were evaluated to see their effectiveness on the whole sub-basin. The sediment yield reduction with these BMPs was ranged from 58 to 62% at Guder hydro-gauging station with simulation period of 1998–2014.

We modified the DRAINMOD model to simulate macropore flow using a simple approach as part of developing the DRAINMOD-P model to simulate phosphorus dynamics in artificially drained agricultural lands. The Hagen-Poiseuille's law was used to estimate the flow capacity of macropores. When ponding depths on the soil surface are greater than Kirkham's depth, water is assumed to flow through macropores directly to tile drains without interaction with the soil matrix. In the modified model, macropore size is adjusted based on wet or dry conditions while connectivity is altered by tillage. The model was tested using a 4-year data set from a subsurface drained field in northwest Ohio. The soils at the field are classified as very poorly drained and are prone to desiccation cracking. The modified model predicted the daily and monthly subsurface drainage with average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values of 0.48 and 0.59, respectively. The cumulative drainage over the 4-year simulation period was under-predicted by 8%. The new macropore component was able to capture about 75% of 60 peak drainage flow events. However, surface runoff was over-predicted for the entire study period. Annual water budgets using measured data (precipitation, subsurface drainage, and surface runoff) and model predictions (evapotranspiration, vertical seepage, and change in storage) were not balanced with an average annual imbalance of 6.4 cm. The lack of closure in the water balance suggests that errors may have occurred in field measurements, particularly, surface runoff. Overall, incorporating macropore flow into DRAINMOD improved predictions of daily drainage peaks and enabled the model to predict subsurface drainage flux contributed by macropore flow, which is critical for expanding DRAINMOD to simulate phosphorus transport in subsurface drained agricultural land. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural drainage; Cracking soil; Hydrologic modeling; Preferential flow","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Budget control; Digital storage; Forecasting; Groundwater flow; Matrix algebra; Phosphorus; Runoff; Soils; Water pollution; Agricultural fields; Agricultural land; Hagen-Poiseuille's law; Model modification; Phosphorus dynamics; Phosphorus transport; Subsurface drainages; Subsurface drains; Drainage; agricultural land; drainage; field method; macropore; model test; phosphorus; runoff; simulation; soil surface; Ohio; United States",Article,Scopus

We conducted a retrospective study using the wheat blast outbreaks in Bangladesh, which occurred for the first time in Asia in 2016, to study a what-if scenario that if there was seasonal disease risk prediction at that time, the epidemics could be prevented or reduced through prediction-based interventions. Two factors govern the answer: the seasonal disease risk prediction is accurate enough to use, and there are effective and realistic control measures to be used upon the prediction. In this study, we focused on the former. To simulate the wheat blast risk and wheat yield in the target region, a high-resolution climate reanalysis product and spatiotemporally downscaled seasonal climate forecasts from eight global climate models were used as inputs for both models. The calibrated wheat blast model successfully simulated the spatial pattern of disease epidemics during the 2014–2018 seasons and was subsequently used to generate seasonal wheat blast risk prediction before each winter season starts. The predictability of the resulting predictions was evaluated against observation-based model simulations. The potential value of utilizing the seasonal wheat blast risk prediction was examined by comparing actual yields resulting from the risk-averse (proactive) and risk-disregarding (conservative) decisions. Overall, our results from this retrospective study showed the feasibility of seasonal forecast-based early warning system for the pre-season strategic interventions of forecasted wheat blast in Bangladesh. © Copyright © 2020 Kim and Choi.","climate reanalysis; disease epidemiological model; early warning system; global crop calendar; seasonal disease risk; winter wheat",,Article,Scopus

An analysis of variance (ANOVA), linear mixed-effects model (LMM), and MP5 regression tree model were used to evaluate the grain yield response. All the methods identified fertilizer application and environmental factors as the main variables that explained 80% of the variance in grain yields. Mineral nitrogen fertilizer (NF) application was the major factor that influenced the grain yield in all methods. Farmyard manure slightly influenced the grain yield with no NF application in the ANOVA and M5P regression tree. While sources of environmental factors were unmeasured in the ANOVA test, they were quantified in detail in the LMM and M5P model. The LMM and M5P model identified the cumulative number of freezing days in December as the main climate-based determinant of the grain yield variation. Additionally, the temperature in October, the cumulative number of freezing days in February, the yield of the preceding crop, and the total nitrogen in the soil were determinants of the grain yield in both models. Apart from the common determinants that appeared in both models, the LMM additionally showed precipitation in June and the cumulative number of days in July with temperatures above 30◦C, while the M5P model showed soil organic carbon as an influencing factor of the grain yield. The ANOVA results provide only the main factors affecting the WW yield. The LMM had a better predictive performance compared to the M5P, with smaller root mean square and mean absolute errors. However, they were richer regressors than the ANOVA. The M5P model presented an intuitive visualization of important variables and their critical thresholds, and revealed other variables that were not captured by the LMM model. Hence, the use of different methods can strengthen the statement of the analysis, and thus, the co-use of the LMM and M5P model should be considered, especially in large databases involving multiple variables. © 2020 by the authors.

An important outcome of this reality is the qualitative and quantitative degradation of groundwater, which clearly indicates the need to exploit surface runoff. This study presents an integrated Geographic Information System (GIS)-based methodological framework for revealing and selecting suitable locations to build small-scale reservoirs and exploit surface runoff. In this framework, the SWAT model was used to quantify surface runoff, followed by the simulation of reservoir scenarios through reservoir simulation software. Andros Island (located in Cyclades Prefecture), Greece was selected as the study area. The obtained results indicated the most suitable location for creating a reservoir for maximizing exploitation of surface runoff, based on the specific water demands of the nearby areas and the existing meteorological, hydrological, and geological background potential. Thus, two selected dam locations are analyzed by using the proposed framework. The findings showed that the first dam site is inappropriate for creating a reservoir, as it cannot meet the demand for large water extraction volumes. In addition, the outcomes confirmed the efficiency of the proposed methodology in optimum selection of locations to construct small-scale water exploitation works. This research presents a contemporary methodological framework that highlights the capability of GIS, SWAT modeling, and reservoir simulation coupling in detecting optimal locations for constructing small reservoirs. © 2020 by the authors.

There are growing interests to study the impacts of drought on crop. However, studies on the impacts of heat stress on crop photosynthesis and yield are still lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we used both statistical models and satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data to assess the impacts of heat stress on wheat yield in a major wheat growing region, the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), India. The statistical model showed that the relationships between different accumulated degree days (ADD) and reported wheat yield were significantly negative. The results confirmed that heat stress affected wheat yield across this region. Building on such information, satellite SIF observations were used to further explore the physiological basis of heat stress impacts on wheat yield. Our results showed that SIF had strong negative correlations with ADDs and was capable of monitoring heat stress. The SIF results also indicated that heat stress caused yield loss by directly impacting the photosynthetic capacity in wheat. Overall, our findings demonstrated that SIF as an effective proxy for photosynthetic activity would improve our understanding of the impacts of heat stress on wheat yield. © 2020 by the authors.

However, mapping of crop types at high spatial resolution requires high-quality crop type reference data typically collected from the ground-based surveys to create the maps and/or to assess the map accuracy. The availability of sufficient crop type reference data is limited over large geographic regions because of the time, effort, cost, and accessibility in different parts of the world. To generate large area crop type maps, any existing, but limited reference data must be spatially extended to other regions using appropriate and available non-ground-based sources. There is the potential to classify High Resolution Imagery (HRI) using a phenology-based approach as demonstrated in this paper to generate additional reference data within similar agriculture ecological zones (AEZs) based on the crop characteristics, their types, and their growing season. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate if existing, limited crop type reference data could be extended using this approach. Multi-date, high spatial resolution satellite images were used to spatially extend the limited crop type reference data from one region [called the training region (TR)] to another region [called the test region (TE)] within the same AEZ using a phenology-based Decision Tree (DT) classifier for three different field sizes. The results demonstrate that this phenology-based classification approach can efficiently and effectively extend the limited crop type reference data to other regions in same AEZ for different field sizes. © Copyright © 2020 Yadav and Congalton.","agriculture ecological zones (AEZs); crop mapping; decision tree (DT) classifier; high resolution imagery (HRI); phenology-based classification; reference data",,Article,Scopus

The Sentinel-3 OLCI Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (OTCI) is an indicator of canopy chlorophyll content and is intended to continue the legacy of the Envisat MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI). Despite spectral similarities, validation and verification of consistency is essential to inform the user community about the product's accuracy, uncertainty, and fitness for purpose. This paper aims to: (i) describe the theoretical basis of the Sentinel-3 OTCI and (ii) evaluate the spatiotemporal consistency between the Sentinel-3 OTCI and the Envisat MTCI. Two approaches were used to conduct the evaluation. Firstly, agreement between the Sentinel-3 OTCI and the Envisat MTCI archive was assessed over the Committee for Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Land Product Validation (LPV) core validation sites, enabling the temporal consistency of the two products to be investigated. Secondly, intercomparison of monthly Level-3 Sentinel-3 OTCI and Envisat MTCI composites was carried out to evaluate the spatial distribution of differences across the globe. In both cases, the agreement was quantified with statistical metrics (R2, NRMSD, bias) using an Envisat MTCI climatology based on the MERIS archive as the reference. Our results demonstrate strong agreement between the products. Specifically, high 1:1 correspondence (R2 >0.88), low global mean percentage difference (-1.86 to 0.61), low absolute bias (<0.1), and minimal error (NRMSD ~0.1) are observed. The temporal profiles reveal consistency in the expected range of values, amplitudes, and seasonal trajectories. Biases and discrepancies may be attributed to changes in land management practices, land cover change, and extreme climatic events occurred during the time gap between the missions; however, this requires further investigation. This research confirms that Sentinel-3 OTCI dataset can be used along with the Envisat MTCI to provide a data coverage over the last 20 years. © 2020 by the authors.","Envisat; Intercomparison; Land product; Meris; Mtci; Olci; Otci; Sentinel-3; Validation","Chlorophyll; Algorithm improvements; Earth observation satellites; Land management practices; Medium resolution imaging spectrometers; OLCI Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (OTCI); Optical characteristics; Spatio-temporal consistencies; Validation and verification; Geodetic satellites",Article,Scopus

A Region-Convolutional Neural Network was trained to detect and count the number of apple fruit on individual trees located on the orthomosaic built from images taken by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The results obtained with the proposed approach were compared with apple counts made in situ by an agrotechnician, and an R2 value of 0.86 was acquired (MAE: 10.35 and RMSE: 13.56). As only parts of the tree fruits were visible in the top-view images, linear regression was used to estimate the number of total apples on each tree.

Commonly-used methods for seasonal yield forecasting are based on process-based crop models or statistical regression-based models. Both have limitations, particularly in regard to accounting for growth stage-specific climate extremes (such as drought, heat, and frost). In this study, we firstly developed a hybrid yield forecasting approach by blending of multiple growth stage-specific indicators, i.e. APSIM (a process-based crop model)-simulated biomass, and climate extremes, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index) before forecasting dates, using a regression model (random forest or multiple linear regression). Plot-scale wheat yield (2008–2017) in the southeastern Australian wheat belt was dynamically forecasted at the end of several targeted growth stages as the growing season progressed to harvest. Results showed that the forecasting accuracy increased significantly for both systems as forecast time approached harvest time. The forecasting system based on random forest outperformed the forecasting system based on multiple linear regression at each forecasting event.

Over last decades, Poland has faced several major droughts and at least one major soil moisture excess event leading to severe crop losses. This study aims to simulate the multi-annual variability of SM anomalies in Poland, using a process-based SWAT model and to assess the effect of climate change on future extreme SM conditions, potentially affecting crop yields in Poland. A crop-specific indicator based on simulated daily soil moisture content for the critical development stages of investigated crops (winter cereals, spring cereals, potato and maize) was designed, evaluated for past conditions against empirical crop-weather indices (CWIs), and applied for studying future climate conditions. The study used an ensemble of nine bias-corrected EURO-CORDEX projections for two future horizons: 2021–2050 and 2071–2100 under two Representative Concentration Pathways: RCP4.5 and 8.5. Historical simulation results showed that SWAT was capable of capturing major SM deficit and excess episodes for different crops in Poland. For spring cereals, potato and maize, despite a large model spread, projections generally showed increase of severity of soil moisture deficits, as well as of total area affected by them. Ensemble median fraction of land with extreme soil moisture deficits, occupied by each of these crops, is projected to at least double in size. The signals of change in soil moisture excesses for potato and maize were more dependent on selection of RCP and future horizon. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"annual variation; climate change; crop yield; modeling; moisture content; rainfed agriculture; reconstruction; soil moisture; Poland [Central Europe]; Solanum tuberosum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

However, current PM2.5 estimation studies rely heavily on satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, and the limited transit times of polar-orbiting satellites such as Terra and Aqua, nighttime gaps in data from geostationary satellites such as Himawari-8, and cloud contamination reported for both types of satellites challenge the estimation of spatiotemporally continuous PM2.5 concentrations. In this study, spatiotemporal PM2.5 characteristic was constructed by the spatiotemporal fusion method. Specifically, multi-source data, including spatiotemporal, periodic, meteorological, vegetation, anthropogenic and topological characteristics, were incorporated into an ensemble learning method that combined extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), k-nearest neighbour (KNN) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) algorithms in level 1 and used linear regression (LR) for integration in level 2. The optimized stacking strategy that considered PM2.5 spatiotemporal autocorrelation was called the ST-stacking model. The model was trained, validated and tested with data acquired for China in 2017. The ST-stacking model outperformed XGBoost, KNN and BPNN models by 9.27% on average, with an R2 = 0.9191.

The 14 remote sensing variables were normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), nitrogen reflectance index (NRI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), structure intensive pigment index (SIPI), plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), difference vegetation index (DVI), ratio vegetation index (RVI), Rblue (reflectance at blue band), Rgreen (reflectance at green band), Rred (reflectance at red band) and Rnir (reflectance at near infrared band). The partial least square (PLS) algorithm was used to construct and validate the multivariate remote sensing model of predicting wheat GPC. The research showed a close relationship between wheat GPC and 12 remote sensing variables other than Rblue and Rgreen of the spectral reflectance bands. Among them, except PSRI and Rblue, Rgreen and Rred, other remote sensing vegetation indexes had significant multiple correlations. The optimal principal components of PLS model used to predict wheat GPC were: NDVI, SIPI, PSRI and EVI. All these were sensitive variables to predict wheat GPC. Through modeling set and verification set evaluation, GPC prediction models’ coefficients of determination (R2) were 0.84 and 0.8, respectively. The root mean square errors (RMSE) were 0.43% and 0.54%, respectively. It indicated that the PLS algorithm model predicted wheat GPC better than models for linear regression (LR) and principal components analysis (PCA) algorithms. The PLS algorithm model’s prediction accuracies were above 90%. The improvement was by more than 20% than the model for LR algorithm and more than 15% higher than the model for PCA algorithm. The results could provide an effective way to improve the accuracy of remotely predicting winter wheat GPC through satellite images, and was conducive to large-area application and promotion. © 2020 Tan et al.

Images of a 27-ha maize field were captured using a UAV with a consumer-grade RGB camera flying at ~100 m above ground level at three maize growth stages. The collected sequential images were stitched and the Excess Green (ExG) colour feature was extracted to develop prediction models for maize yield and to examine the effect of the variable-rate N application.

However, optical image-based remote sensing methods are fraught with uncertainty issues due to the saturation effects. In this study, we evaluated the capability of the emerging terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) technique in estimating grassland AGB in the northern agro-pastoral ecotone of China. Seven variables (i.e., canopy cover, canopy volume, mean height, maximum height, minimum height, range of height, and standard deviation of height) were extracted from the TLS data of 30 plots across the northern agro-pastoral ecotone of China, and were used to build regression models with field measured AGB using four regression methods, which are simple regression (SR) model, stepwise multiple regression (SMR) model, random forest (RF) model and artificial neural network (ANN) model. The results demonstrate that TLS is a feasible technique for extracting grassland structural parameters. Mean grass height and canopy cover obtained from TLS data have good correspondence with field measurements (R2 &gt; 0.7, p-values &lt; 0.001). Among the four regression models, the SMR model yields the highest prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 48.89 g/m2), followed by the RF model (R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 68.72 g/m2), the SR model (R2 = 0.80, RMSE = 86.4 g/m2), and the ANN model (R2 = 0.73, RMSE = 101.40 g/m2). Minimum grass height and canopy coverage are the two most important variables influencing the prediction accuracy of the SMR model, and the prediction accuracy of the SMR model increases with the increase of point density.

This paper provides a novel demonstration of the use of freely available Sentinel-2 data to estimate within-field wheat yield variability in a single year. The impact of data resolution and availability on yield estimation is explored using different combinations of input data. This was achieved by combining Sentinel-2 with environmental data (e.g. meteorological, topographical, soil moisture) for different periods throughout the growing season. Yield was estimated using Random Forest (RF) regression models. They were trained and validated using a dataset containing over 8000 points collected by combine harvester yield monitors from 39 wheat fields in the UK. The results demonstrate that it is possible to produce accurate maps of within-field yield variation at 10 m resolution using Sentinel-2 data (RMSE 0.66 t/ha). When combined with environmental data further improvements in accuracy can be obtained (RMSE 0.61 t/ha). We demonstrate that with knowledge of crop-type distribution it is possible to use these models, trained with data from a few fields, to estimate within-field yield variability on a landscape scale.

The model was calibrated at the monthly time-step for flow, sediment, dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), total phosphorus (TP), nitrate, and total nitrogen (TN). Field- and watershed-scale sediment and nutrient reductions were calculated due to the implementation of 74 BMP combinations on dairy and cash grain rotations. Modeling results indicated that when multiple BMPs were placed on a field, especially those including filter strips and grassed waterways, sediment and nutrient loads generally were reduced more than single BMP implementation. The most effective in-field practice at reducing DRP and TP on dairy fields was a combination of 5 different BMPs: cover crops, crop rotation, nutrient management plan, reduced tillage, and a filter strip. Conservation cover was the single most effective practice at reducing sediment and nutrient yields. Sediment and nutrient loads decreased at the watershed scale as the quantity and coverage of BMPs increased. When all contracted BMPs were simulated at the watershed scale, sediment loads were reduced 2%, while TP, DRP, TN and nitrate loads were reduced 20%, 9%, 24%, and 17%, respectively.

The MKT model was calibrated and validated using field-scale data of soil temperature, soil moisture, and N2O emissions from three locations in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. The model evaluation statistics show good performance of the MKT model for daily soil N2O simulations. The results show that the proposed MKT model can perform better than the more widely used process-based and SWAT-based models for soil N2O simulations. This is because the multiple processes of microbial activities and environmental constraints, which govern the availability of substrates to enzymes were explicitly represented. Most importantly, the MKT model represents a step forward from conceptual carbon pools at varying rates. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Soil biogeochemical cycle modelling; Soil greenhouse gas emission modelling; Soil N2O emission; Soil organic matter decomposition modelling; Soil oxidation-reduction potential dynamics","Biogeochemistry; Carbon; Ecology; Greenhouse gases; Kinetics; Organic compounds; Oxidation; Redox reactions; Reduction; Soil moisture; Thermodynamics; Biogeochemical cycle; Environmental constraints; Environmental variables; Michaelis-Menten kinetic; Oxidation reduction potential; Soil organic matters; Soil water assessment tool; Watershed-scale models; Soil surveys; carbon; nitrogen oxide; soil organic matter; nitrogen dioxide; nitrous oxide; water; biogeochemical cycle; decomposition; emission; greenhouse gas; modeling; oxidation; reaction kinetics; reduction; soil nitrogen; soil organic matter; thermodynamics; Article; Canada; chemical reaction; conceptual framework; controlled study; decomposition; enzyme substrate; Michaelis Menten kinetics; microbial activity; microbial kinetics; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; oxidation reduction potential; soil moisture; soil temperature; soil water potential; statistical model; thermodynamics; watershed; air pollutant; analysis; bioremediation; chemistry; environment; environmental monitoring; kinetics; microbiology; oxidation reduction reaction; Saskatchewan; soil; thermodynamics; Canada; Saskatchewan; Air Pollutants; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbon; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Kinetics; Nitrogen Dioxide; Nitrous Oxide; Oxidation-Reduction; Saskatchewan; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Thermodynamics; Water",Article,Scopus

The analysis uses 30 years of datasets of rainfall, surface temperature and wind parameters (from 1980 to 2009). We performed a simulation at a spatial resolution of 50 km with the RegCM4.5 model driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis. The rainfall amount is weaker over the Sahel (western and central) and the Guinea region for the warmest years compared to the coldest ones. The analysis of heat fluxes show that the sensible (latent) heat flux is stronger (weaker) during the warmest (coldest) years. When considering the rainfall events, there is a decrease of the number of rainy days over the Guinea Coast (in the South of Cote d'Ivoire, of Ghana and of Benin) and the western and eastern Sahel during warm years. The maximum length of consecutive wet days decreases over the western and eastern Sahel, while the consecutive dry days increase mainly over the Sahel band during the warm years. The percentage of very warm days and warm nights increase mainly over the Sahel domain and the Guinea region. The model also simulates an increase of the warm spell duration index in the whole Sahel domain and over the Guinea Coast in warm years. The analysis of the wind dynamic exhibits during warm years a weakening of the monsoon flow in the lower levels, a strengthening in the magnitude of the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) in the mid-troposphere and a slight increase of the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ) in the upper levels of the atmosphere during warm years. © 2019 by the authors.","RegCM4; Warm years; West Africa","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Heat flux; Rain; Upper atmosphere; African easterly jet; RegCM4; Regional climate modeling; Surface temperatures; Tropical easterly jets; Warm years; West Africa; West African Monsoon; Climate models; climate change; climate modeling; monsoon; rainfall; regional climate; spatial resolution; upper atmosphere; warming; West Africa",Article,Scopus

Satellite remote sensing provides the possibility of continuous monitoring of large areas. In this study, we aimed to investigate the strength of vegetation indices (VIs) derived from Landsat-8 for generating the harvest schedule regional (HSR) map using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a robust prediction tool in the agriculture sector. Area of study: Qorveh plain, Iran. Material and methods: During 2015 and 2016, a total of 100 plots was selected. WAHD was determined by sampling of plots and specifying wheat maximum yield for each plot. The strength of eight Landsat-8 derived spectral VIs (NDVI, SAVI, GreenNDVI, NDWI, EVI, EVI2, CVI and CIgreen ) was investigated during wheat growth stages using correlation coefficients between these VIs and observed WAHD. The derived VIs from the required images were used as inputs of ANNs and WAHD was considered as output. Several ANN models were designed by combining various VIs data. Main results: The temporal stage in agreement with dough development stage had the highest correlation with WAHD. The optimum model for predicting WAHD was a Multi-Layer Perceptron model including one hidden layer with ten neurons in it when the inputs were NDVI, NDWI, and EVI2. To evaluate the difference between measured and predicted values of ANNs, MAE, RMSE, and R2 were calculated. For the 3-10-1 topology, the value of R2 was estimated 0.925. A HSR map was generated with RMSE of 0.86 days. Research highlights: Integrated satellite-derived VIs and ANNs is a novel and remarkable methodology to predict WAHD, optimize harvest campaign scheduling and farm management. © 2019 INIA.","Additional harvest date; Landsat-8 satellite; Remote sensing; Wheat",,Article,Scopus

This study assesses the biases in NARCliM (NSW and ACT regional climate modelling) simulations and quantifies the consequence of the climate biases in the downstream assessment of climate change impact on wheat crop system, using the Agricultural Production System sIMulator (APSIM). Results showed that post-processing bias-corrected temperature and rainfall data from NARCliM had small annual mean biases but large biases in the crop growing season (CGS). During the CGS, the mean bias error of rainfall was generally positive for rainfall probability and negative for intensity, which subsequently resulted in APSIM simulating negative biases for runoff and deep drainage and positive bias in soil evaporation. Bias in soil water balance and water availability resulted in less plant transpiration and less N uptake, ultimately, leading to large negative biases in crop yields. A simple bias correction of the simulated crop yield driven by RCMs could result in a largely consistent distribution with those generated with APSIM simulations forced by observed climate. Our results showed that RCM simulation biases could confound with the climate change signal and produced an unreliable estimate of the effects of the changes in climate and farm management variables on crop yields. The results suggested that RCM simulations with the current bias correction on the RCM-simulated outputs applied on an annual basis were inadequate for climate change assessments which involve biophysical models. Our study highlights the need for improved RCM simulations by eliminating the systemic biases associated with rainfall characteristics, although suitable post-processing bias correction on a seasonal or monthly basis may result in improved RCM simulations for agricultural impacts of climate change. © 2018 Royal Meteorological Society","APSIM; bias correction; bias propagation; bio-physical crop model; NARCliM; rainfall intensity; rainfall probability; RCMs; wheat cropping system","Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Plants (botany); Rain; Soil moisture; APSIM; Bias correction; Crop model; NARCliM; Rainfall intensity; RCMs; Wheat cropping; Climate change; biophysics; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; correction; cropping practice; farming system; precipitation intensity; probability; rainfall; regional climate; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Fusarium head blight is associated with trichothecene mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON), which contaminates grains, making them unfit for malting or animal feed industries. While genetically resistant cultivars offer the best economic and environmentally responsible means to mitigate disease, parent lines with adequate resistance are limited in barley. Resistance breeding based upon quantitative genetic gains has been slow to date, due to intensive labor requirements of disease nurseries. The production of a high-throughput genome-wide molecular marker assembly for barley permits use in development of genomic prediction models for traits of economic importance to this crop. A diverse panel consisting of 400 two-row spring barley lines was assembled to focus on Canadian barley breeding programs. The panel was evaluated for FHB and DON content in three environments and over 2 years. Moreover, it was genotyped using an Illumina Infinium High-Throughput Screening (HTS) iSelect custom beadchip array of single nucleotide polymorphic molecular markers (50 K SNP), where over 23 K molecular markers were polymorphic. Genomic prediction has been demonstrated to successfully reduce FHB and DON content in cereals using various statistical models. Herein, we have studied an alternative method based on machine learning and compare it with a statistical approach. The bi-allelic SNPs represented pairs of alleles and were encoded in two ways: as categorical (–1, 0, 1) or using Hardy-Weinberg probability frequencies. This was followed by selecting essential genomic markers for phenotype prediction. Subsequently, a Transformer-based deep learning algorithm was applied to predict FHB and DON. Apart from the Transformer method, a Residual Fully Connected Neural Network (RFCNN) was also applied. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to compare true vs. predicted outputs. Models which included all markers generally showed marginal improvement in prediction. Hardy-Weinberg encoding generally improved correlation for FHB (6.9%) and DON (9.6%) for the Transformer network. This study suggests the potential of the Transformer based method as an alternative to the popular BLUP model for genomic prediction of complex traits such as FHB or DON, having performed equally or better than existing machine learning and statistical methods.

Since Solar Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) is uniquely emitted from vegetation, it can be used to evaluate how well reflectance-based vegetation indices (VIs) can separate the vegetation and soil components. Due to the residual soil background contributions, Near-infrared (NIR) reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) and Difference Vegetation index (DVI) present offsets when compared to SIF (i.e., the value of NIRv or DVI is non-zero when SIF is zero). In this study, we proposed a simple framework for estimating the true NIR reflectance of vegetation from Hyperspectral measurements (NIRvH) with minimal soil impacts. NIRvH takes advantage of the spectral shape variations in the red-edge region to minimize the soil effects. We evaluated the capability of NIRvH, NIRv and DVI in isolating the true NIR reflectance of vegetation using the data from both the model-based simulations and Hyperspectral Plant imaging spectrometer (HyPlant) measurements. Benchmarked by simultaneously measured SIF, NIRvH has the smallest offset (0–0.037), as compared to an intermediate offset of 0.047–0.062 from NIRv, and the largest offset of 0.089–0.112 from DVI. The magnitude of the offset can vary with different soil reflectance spectra across spatio-temporal scales, which may lead to bias in the downstream NIRv-based photosynthesis estimates. NIRvH and SIF measurements from the same sensor platform avoided complications due to different geometry, footprint and time of observation across sensors when studying the radiative transfer of reflected photons and SIF. In addition, NIRvH was primarily determined by canopy structure rather than chlorophyll content and soil brightness. Our work showcases that NIRvH is promising for retrieving canopy structure parameters such as leaf area index and leaf inclination angle, and for estimating fluorescence yield with current and forthcoming hyperspectral satellite measurements. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Hyperspectral remote sensing; Near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv); Red edge; Singular value decomposition (SVD); Soil contamination; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF)","Chlorophyll; Fluorescence; Hyperspectral imaging; Infrared devices; Reflection; Remote sensing; Soils; Spectroscopy; Vegetation; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Hyperspectral measurements; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Near infra-red reflectances; Near infrared reflectance; Near-infrared reflectance of vegetation; Red edge; Singular value decomposition; Soil contamination; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Singular value decomposition; canopy reflectance; ecophysiology; leaf area index; radiative transfer; remote sensing; residual soil; spectral analysis",Article,Scopus

Our area of study around the typhoon’s path covers 15.7 Mha, and includes 47 of the 87 provinces in the Philippines. In validation areas our model predicts coconut tree density with a Mean Absolute Error of 5.9 Trees/ha. In Camarines Sur we estimated that 3.5 M of the 4.6 M existing coconut trees were damaged by the typhoon. Overall we estimated that 14.1 M coconut trees were affected by the typhoon inside our area of study. Our validation images confirm that trees are rarely uprooted and damages are largely due to reduced canopy cover of standing trees. On validation areas, our model was able to detect affected coconut trees with 88.6% accuracy, 75% precision and 90% recall. Our method delivers spatially fine-grained change maps for coconut plantations in the area of study, including unchanged, damaged and new trees.

Accurate knowledge and management of soil nitrogen is crucial for food security in rural communities, especially for smallholder maize farms. However, less research has been done on generating digital soil nitrogen maps for these farmers. This study examines the utility of Sentinel-2 satellite data and environmental variables to map soil nitrogen at smallholder maize farms. Three machine learning algorithms—random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and extreme gradient boosting (XG) were investigated for this purpose. The findings indicate that the RF (R2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.0076%) model performs slightly better than the GB (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 0.0083%) and XG (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.0077%) models. Furthermore, the variable importance measure showed that the Sentinel-2 bands, particularly the red and red-edge bands, have a superior performance in comparison to the environmental variables and soil indices. The digital maps generated in this study show the high capability of Sentinel-2 satellite data to generate accurate nitrogen content maps with the application of machine learning. The developed framework can be implemented to map the spatial pattern of soil nitrogen. This will also contribute to soil fertility interventions and nitrogen fertilization management to improve food security in rural communities.

In most cases, both rainfall and irrigation supply the water needs of crops. We postulated that meteorological precipitation could not fully represent the actual amount of water available to crops, whereas the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) can represent actual water, which monitors soil moisture. According to this, meteorological and remote-sensing data based on sunshine hours, temperature, and TVDI formed a light–temperature–water data combination, which are the three most fundamental and critical factors related to crop growth. The new data combination was used as the input variables of the integral regression model, which could predict the crop yield at a fixed date interval of any length. The dynamic results were then compared with that of the meteorology data combination (sunshine hours, temperature, and precipitation). We selected a total of seven county-level areas in semi-humid and arid regions in China. The proposed dynamic prediction approach achieved good results at the county level from March 21 to maturity at 16-day intervals with predicted R2 &gt; 0.94 and root mean squared error range of 15.54–121.01 kg ha−1 between predicted and actual yield with leave-one-year-out cross-validation for each prediction date. The trend of dynamic prediction accuracy had a relatively stable state. In addition, TVDI contained more crop water information, and prediction results using TVDI and meteorology were generally superior to that using only meteorology for semi-humid and arid areas, with the best results for arid regions. Thus, integrating meteorology and TVDI could effectively dynamically predict yield at county level for most agroclimatic regions, and particularly for arid regions. The work has implications for dynamic yield prediction and improving prediction accuracy and can be extended to other areas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","County level; MODIS; Precipitation; TVDI; Winter wheat; Yield prediction","Arid regions; Crops; Forecasting; Mean square error; Meteorology; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Vegetation; County level; Crop yield; Data combination; Dynamic prediction; Regression model; Remote sensing data; Sunshine Hour; Temperature-vegetation dryness indices; Winter wheat; Yield prediction; Precipitation (chemical); agricultural modeling; agrometeorology; crop plant; crop yield; growth; index method; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; remote sensing; soil moisture; temperature effect; Varanidae",Article,Scopus

In addition to location and sampling time (which includes the difference between bulk soil and rhizosphere) as the main variables defining the microbiome composition, the microbial inoculant applied as a treatment also had a small but significant effect in fungal communities and a marginally significant effect bacterial communities. However, treatment preserved the native communities without causing a detectable long-lasting effect on the alpha and beta-diversity patterns after harvest. Using information about the application of the microbial inoculant and considering microbiome composition and structure data, we were able to train a Random Forest model to estimate if a bulk soil or rhizosphere sample came from a low or highyield block with relatively high accuracy (84.6%), concluding that the structure of fungal communities gives us more information as an estimator of potato yield than the structure of bacterial communities. IMPORTANCE Our results reinforce the notion that each cultivar on each location recruits a unique microbial community and that these communities are modulated by the vegetative growth stage of the plant. Moreover, inoculation of a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain QST713-based product on potatoes also changed the abundance of specific taxonomic groups and the structure of local networks in those locations where the product caused an increase in the yield. The data obtained, from in-field assays, allowed training a predictive model to estimate the yield of a certain block, identifying microbiome related to microbial community structure—even with a higher predictive power than the geographical location of the block (that is, the principal determinant of microbial beta-diversity). The methods described here can be replicated to fit new models in any other crop and to evaluate the effect of any agricultural composition and structure of the soil microbiome. © 2021. Imam et al.

Both leaf/canopy level nitrogen content and accumulation are valuable for crop nutrient diagnosis. However, previous studies mainly focused on leaf nitrogen content (LNC) estimation. The effects of growth stages on the modeling accuracy have not been widely discussed. This study aimed to estimate different paddy rice N traits—LNC, plant nitrogen content (PNC), leaf nitrogen accumulation (LNA) and plant nitrogen accumulation (PNA)—from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based hyperspectral images. Additionally, the effects of the growth stage were evaluated. Univariate regression models on vegetation indices (VIs), the traditional multi-variate calibration method, partial least squares regression (PLSR) and modern machine learning (ML) methods, including artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM), were evaluated both over the whole growing season and in each single growth stage (including the tillering, jointing, booting and heading growth stages). The results indicate that the correlation between the four nitrogen traits and the other three biochemical traits—leaf chlorophyll content, canopy chlorophyll content and aboveground biomass—are affected by the growth stage. Within a single growth stage, the performance of selected VIs is relatively constant. For the full-growth-stage models, the performance of the VI-based models is more diverse. For the full-growth-stage models, the transformed chlorophyll absorption in the reflectance index/optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (TCARI/OSAVI) performs best for LNC, PNC and PNA estimation, while the three band vegetation index (TBVITian ) performs best for LNA estimation. There are no obvious patterns regarding which method performs the best of the PLSR, ANN, RF and SVM in either the growth-stage-specific or full-growth-stage models. For the growth-stage-specific models, a lower mean relative error (MRE) and higher R2 can be acquired at the tillering and jointing growth stages. The PLSR and ML methods yield obviously better estimation accuracy for the full-growth-stage models than the VI-based models. For the growth-stage-specific models, the performance of VI-based models seems optimal and cannot be obviously surpassed. These results suggest that building linear regression models on VIs for paddy rice nitrogen traits estimation is still a reasonable choice when only a single growth stage is involved. However, when multiple growth stages are involved or missing the phenology information, using PLSR or ML methods is a better option. © 2021 by the authors.

The study also simulates runoff characteristics as a response to hypothetical climatic scenarios. The scope of the study involves, first, to quantify the relative contribution of climate change and land-use change to runoff response and second, to simulate runoff characteristics as a response to hypothetical climatic scenarios. Using a combination of the SWAT model, SWAT Cup, Sequential Mann Kendall Trend Tests, surface and total runoff were generated for 1982–2017, and the mutation point was identified. The results indicate that post-2010, climate change has an overwhelming impact on runoff with its contribution being as high as 99% in the case of total runoff and 89% for surface runoff. And this finding is cemented by dynamic contribution analysis which indicates over-arching climatic impact for every decade, with a sudden increase post-2010. Change in temperature and rainfall has an expected impact on runoff, with a rise in rainfall and decrease in temperature resulting in the higher runoff than the normal, except beyond 2 °C, post which there is a sudden increase in surface runoff response, even in scenarios where there is a decrease in rainfall. While surface runoff rises 2% for every 1% increase in precipitation and decreases by 1.7% for every 1% decrease, the corresponding change for total runoff is 1.4%. The novelty of the work lies in its capacity to provide a rapid framework to the immediate stakeholders in understanding runoff response to different change-based scenario independently and in combination. © 2021, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","Climate change; Contribution analysis; Hypothetical climatic scenarios; Land-use change; Runoff response","catchment; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; hydrological modeling; land use change; river basin; runoff; scenario analysis; soil and water assessment tool; India; West Bengal",Article,Scopus

Accurate measurement of HM results in increased utilisation of grass in the herd’s diet and consequently reductions in whole-farm feed inputs, emissions and costs. The rising plate meter (RPM) is an established method of estimating HM, but there is scope to improve its accuracy. Real-time meteorological data and pasture management information have never been analysed in combination with the RPM. This study aimed to utilise such data to improve the accuracy of HM prediction using multiple linear regression (MLR) and machine learning through the random forest (RF) algorithm. Seventeen variables were assessed and models were evaluated in terms of relative prediction error (RPE). Decreases of 6–12% RPE were observed for the MLR models compared with conventional models. Further decreases of 11–17% were recorded for RF models. An MLR model comprising of management data that were readily available to farmers was deemed optimum for on-farm use and included coefficients for: compressed sward height (mm), nitrogen fertiliser rate (kg ha−1) and grazing rotation number (RMSE = 324 kg DM ha−1). The addition of meteorological variables resulted in a further 0.9% decrease in RPE (RMSE = 312 kg DM ha−1), but was not practical considering the expense of on-farm meteorological sensors. The RF model with meteorological variables (RMSE = 262 kg DM ha−1) had 1.5% lower RPE compared with the RF model without (RMSE = 243 kg DM ha−1). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Grass measurement; Grassland management; Herbage mass; Machine learning; Multiple linear regression; Rising plate meter","algorithm; climate; climate conditions; data set; grassland; grazing management; livestock farming; machine learning; meteorology; pasture",Article,Scopus

This variety can serve as a full-fledged alternative to modern wheat but has a lower yield than modern varieties. It is commonly known that wheat growth is influenced by soil tillage technology (among other things). However, it is not known how soil tillage technology affects ancient varieties. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of different soil tillage technologies on the growth of the ancient Khorasan wheat variety in comparison to the modern Kabot spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) variety. The trial was arranged in six small plots, one half of which was sown by the Khorasan wheat variety and the other half of which was sown by the Kabot wheat variety. Three soil tillage methods were used for each cultivar: conventional tillage (CT) (20–25 cm), minimum tillage (MTC) with a coulter cultivator (15 cm), and minimization tillage (MTD) with a disc cultivator (12 cm). The soil surface of all of the variants were leveled after tillage (harrows & levelling bars). An unmanned aerial vehicle with multispectral and thermal cameras was used to monitor growth during the vegetation season. The flight missions were supplemented by measurements using the GreenSeeker hand-held sensor and plant and soil analysis. The results showed that the Khorasan ancient wheat was better suited the conditions of conventional tillage, with low values of bulk density and highvalues of total soil porosity, which generally increased the nutritional value of the yield in this experimental plot. At the same time, it was found that this ancient wheat does not deplete the soil. The results also showed that the trend of developmental growing curves derived from different sensors was very similar regardless of measurement method. The sensors used in this study can be good indicators of micronutrient content in the plant as well as in the grains. A low-cost RGB camera can provide relevant results, especially in cases where equipment that is more accurate is not available. © 2021 by the authors.

Twelve UAS surveys were conducted over the trials throughout the growing season. Fifteen vegetative indices (VIs) and the 99th percentile canopy height measurement (CHMs) were extracted from processed UAS imagery (orthomosaics and point clouds) which were used to predict plot-level grain yield, days to anthesis (DTA), and silking (DTS). A novel statistical approach utilizing a nested design was fit to predict temporal best linear unbiased predictors (TBLUP) for the combined temporal UAS data. Our results demonstrated machine learning-based regressions (ridge, lasso, and elastic net) had from 4-to 9-fold increases in the prediction accuracies and from 13-to 73-fold reductions in root mean squared error (RMSE) compared to classical linear regression in prediction of grain yield or flowering time. Ridge regression performed best in predicting grain yield (prediction accuracy = ~0.6), while lasso and elastic net regressions performed best in predicting DTA and DTS (prediction accuracy = ~0.8) consistently in both trials. We demonstrated that predictor variable importance descended towards the terminal stages of growth, signifying the importance of phenotype collection beyond classical terminal growth stages.

The ability of UAV-based sensing technologies to provide high spatial (<1 m) and temporal (on-demand) resolution data facilitates monitoring of individual plants over time and can provide essential information about health, yield, and growth in a timely and quantifiable manner. Such applications would be beneficial for cropped banana plants due to their distinctive growth characteristics. Limited studies have employed UAV data for mapping banana crops and to our knowledge only one other investigation features multi-temporal detection of banana crowns. The purpose of this study was to determine the suitability of multiple-date UAV-captured multi-spectral data for the automated detection of individual plants using convolutional neural network (CNN), template matching (TM), and local maximum filter (LMF) methods in a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) software framework coupled with basic classification refinement.

Although long yield time series are available in Europe, few studies have been conducted to analyze them in order to investigate the impact of adverse climate events on yield shocks under current and future climate conditions. Here we designated the lowest 10th percentile of the relative yield anomaly as yield shock and analyzed subnational wheat yield shocks across Europe during the last four decades. We applied a data-driven attribution framework to quantify primary climate drivers of wheat yield shock probability based on machine learning and game theory, and used this framework to infer the most critical climate variables that will contribute to yield shocks in the future, under two climate change scenarios. During the period 1980–2018, our attribution analysis showed that 32% of the observed wheat yield shocks were primarily driven by water limitation, making it the leading climate driver. Projection to future climate scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 suggested an increased risk of yield shock and a paradigm shift from water limitation dominated yield shock to extreme warming induced shocks over 2070–2099: 46% and 54% of areas were primarily driven by extreme warming under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. A similar analysis conducted on yields simulated by an ensemble of crop models showed that models can capture the negative impact of low water supply but missed the impact of excess water.

Although several efficient deep learning techniques have emerged in the field of multispectral imagery analysis, the crop classification problem still needs more accurate solutions. This work introduces a competitive methodology for crop classification from multispectral satellite imagery mainly using an enhanced 2D convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) designed at a smaller-scale architecture, as well as a novel post-processing step. The proposed methodology contains four steps: image stacking, patch extraction, classification model design (based on a 2D-CNN architecture), and post-processing. First, the images are stacked to increase the number of features. Second, the input images are split into patches and fed into the 2D-CNN model. Then, the 2D-CNN model is constructed within a small-scale framework, and properly trained to recognize 10 different types of crops. Finally, a post-processing step is performed in order to reduce the classification error caused by lower-spatial-resolution images. Experiments were carried over the so-named Campo Verde database, which consists of a set of satellite images captured by Landsat and Sentinel satellites from the municipality of Campo Verde, Brazil. In contrast to the maximum accuracy values reached by remarkable works reported in the literature (amounting to an overall accuracy of about 81%, a f1 score of 75.89%, and average accuracy of 73.35%), the proposed methodology achieves a competitive overall accuracy of 81.20%, a f1 score of 75.89%, and an average accuracy of 88.72% when classifying 10 different crops, while ensuring an adequate trade-off between the number of multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) and accuracy. Furthermore, given its ability to effectively classify patches from two image sequences, this methodology may result appealing for other real-world applications, such as the classification of urban materials. © 2021 by the authors.

The objective was to describe, through land use/land cover change (LUCC), the natural physical processes under current conditions and to project them to 2029. Moreover, temperature and precipitation forecasts were estimated to detail possible effects of climate change. Using remote sensing techniques, satellite images were processed to prepare a projection to 2029. Water recharge was estimated considering the effects of slope, groundcover, and soil texture. Flash floods were estimated using lumped models, concatenating the information to HEC RAS. Water availability was estimated with a semi-distributed hydrological model (SWAT). Precipitation and temperature data were forecasted using autoregressive and exponential smoothing models. Under the forecast, forest and shrub covers show a growth of 6.6%, water recharge projects an increase of 7.16%. Flood flows suffer a reduction of up to 16.54%, and the flow regime with a 90% of probability of exceedance is 1.85% (7.72 l/s) higher for 2029 than for the 2019 scenario, so an improvement in flow regulation is evident. Forecasts show an increase in average temperature of 0.11◦C and 15.63% in extreme rainfall by 2029.

The current study evaluated the impacts of major hydrological interventions of the Zhikong and Pangduo hydropower dams on the Lhasa River, which was exposed in the form of break and change points during the double-mass curve analysis. The coefficient of variability (CV) for the hydro-meteorological variables revealed an enhanced climate change phenomena in the Lhasa River Basin (LRB), where the Lhasa River (LR) discharge varied at a stupendous magnitude from 2000 to 2016. The Mann-Kendall trend and Sen’s slope estimator supported aggravated hydro-meteorological changes in LRB, as the rainfall and LR discharge were found to have been significantly decreasing while temperature was increasing from 2000 to 2016. The Sen’s slope had a largest decrease for LR discharge in relation to the rainfall and temperature, revealing that along with climatic phenomena, additional phenomena are controlling the hydrological regime of the LR. Reservoir functioning in the LR is altering the LR discharge. The Soil andWater Assessment Tool (SWAT) modeling of LR discharge under the reservoir’s influence performed well in terms of coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE), and percent bias (PBIAS). Thus, simulation-based LR discharge could substitute observed LR discharge to help with hydrological data scarcity stress in the LRB. The simulated-observed approach was used to predict future LR discharge for the time span of 2017-2025 using a seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The predicted simulation-based and observation-based discharge were closely correlated and found to decrease from 2017 to 2025.

Available evidence shows that adoption of digital agriculture is at early stages, generally led by high-value agricultural production targeting domestic markets in Gulf countries and export markets in Mashreq countries. Economic sustainability appears the strongest force for current adoption, with less focus on social or environmental sustainability. Public policies should not only foster the adoption of digital technologies in MENA but also ensure equity of access, transparency of use, data protections, and labor protections. Policymakers should move beyond traditional, production-centric views to deliver also on social and environmental sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

Whilst index insurance can help farmers cope with the financial consequences of extreme weather, a major challenge for index insurance is basis risk, where insurance payouts cor-relate poorly with actual crop losses. We analyse to what extent the use of crop simulation models and crop phenology monitoring can reduce basis risk in index insurance. Using a biophysical pro-cess-based crop model (Agricultural Production System sIMulator (APSIM)) applied for rice pro-ducers in Odisha, India, we simulate a synthetic yield dataset to train non-parametric statistical models to predict rice yields as a function of meteorological and phenological conditions. We find that the performance of statistical yield models depends on whether meteorological or phenological conditions are used as predictors and whether one aggregates these predictors by season or crop growth stage. Validating the preferred statistical model with observed yield data, we find that the model explains around 54% of the variance in rice yields at the village cluster (Gram Panchayat) level, outperforming vegetation index-based models that were trained directly on the observed yield data. Our methods and findings can guide efforts to design smart phenology-based index insurance and target yield monitoring resources in smallholder farming environments. © 2021 by the authors.

The Upper Mississippi River Basin was selected to evaluate the effects of subbasin and/or hydrologic response unit (HRU) delineations and the density of climate dataset on the simulated streamflow and water balance components using the Hydrologic and Water Quality System (HAWQS) platform. Five scenarios were examined with the same parameter set, including 8- and 12-digit hydrologic unit codes, two levels of HRU thresholds and two climate data densities. Results showed that statistic evaluations of monthly streamflow from 1983 to 2005 were satisfactory at some gauge sites but were relatively worse at others when shifting from 8-digit to 12-digit subbasins, revealing that the hydrologic response to delineation schemes can vary across a large basin. Average channel slope and drainage density increased significantly from 8-digit to 12-digit subbasins. This resulted in higher lateral flow and groundwater flow estimates, especially for the lateral flow. Moreover, a finer HRU delineation tends to generate more runoff because it captures a refined level of watershed spatial variability. The analysis of climate datasets revealed that denser climate data produced higher predicted runoff, especially for summer months. © 2021 by the authors.

This study explored the suitability of high spatio-temporal resolution Sentinel-2 imagery and the applicability of advanced machine learning techniques for estimating aboveground biomass at the paddock level in five dairy farms across northern Tasmania, Australia. A sequential neural network model was developed by integrating Sentinel-2 time-series data, weekly field biomass observations and daily climate variables from 2017 to 2018. Linear least-squares regression was employed for evaluating the results for model calibration and validation. Optimal model performance was realised with an R2 of ≈0.6, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of ≈356 kg dry matter (DM)/ha and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 262 kg DM/ha. These performance markers indicated the results were within the variability of the pasture biomass measured in the field, and therefore represent a relatively high prediction accuracy. Sensitivity analysis further revealed what impact each farm’s in situ measurement, pasture management and grazing practices have on the model’s predictions. The study demonstrated the potential benefits and feasibility of improving biomass estimation in a cheap and rapid manner over traditional field measurement and commonly used remote-sensing methods. The proposed approach will help farmers and policymakers to estimate the amount of pasture present for optimising grazing management and improving decision-making regarding dairy farming. © 2021 by the authors.

Above all, the container terminal logistics tactical operational complexity is discussed by computational logistics, and the liner handling volume (LHV) has important influences on a series of terminal scheduling decision problems. Subsequently, a feature-extraction-based lightweight convolutional and recurrent neural network adaptive computing model (FEB-LCR-ACM) is presented initially to predict the LHV by the fusion of multiple deep learning algorithms and mechanisms, especially for the specific feature extraction package of tsfresh. Consequently, the container-terminal-oriented logistics service scheduling decision support design paradigm is put forward tentatively by FEB-LCR-ACM. Finally, a typical large-scale container terminal of China is chosen to implement, execute, and evaluate the FEB-LCR-ACM based on the terminal running log around the indicator of LHV. In the case of severe vibration of LHV between 2 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) and 4215 TEUs, while forecasting the LHV of 300 liners by the log of five years, the forecasting error within 100 TEUs almost accounts for 80%. When predicting the operation of 350 ships by the log of six years, the forecasting deviation within 100 TEUs reaches up to nearly 90%. The abovementioned two deep learning experimental performances with FEB-LCR-ACM are so far ahead of the forecasting results by the classical machine learning algorithm that is similar to Gaussian support vector machine. Consequently, the FEB-LCR-ACM achieves sufficiently good performance for the LHV prediction with a lightweight deep learning architecture based on the typical small datasets, and then it is supposed to overcome the operational nonlinearity, dynamics, coupling, and complexity of CTHS partially. © 2021 Bin Li and Yuqing He.",,,Article,Scopus

In many models, the climate projections are downscaled to individual map units represented by grid cells or subbasins. Uncertainty of downscaled climate projections are a product of uncertainties arising mainly from the model itself, from the representative concentration pathway (RCP), and from the downscaling procedure. Other sources of uncertainty may include the historical observations used for GCM bias correction and data aggregation from GCM grids to map (often subbasin) units. This study evaluated effects of three sources of historical data (ground-based weather station network, NCDC, and two gridded datasets, NEXRAD and PRISM) on historical variability, and shifts and uncertainty in precipitation and temperature projections. Climate projections from six GCMs and three RCPs were evaluated in 54 subbasins of the Smoky Hill River watershed in the U.S. Central Great Plains. Bias correction of GCM projections reduced bias of watershed-average annual precipitation in the historical period to near zero, but subbasin-specific variability remained in future projections with little difference among bias-correction data sources. For minimum and maximum temperatures, the GCM ensemble statistics for basin-average and subbasin-specific future projections were similar for all bias-correction data sources. Increase in RCP forcing was found to widen the uncertainty in future projections. Overall, the uncertainty due to data source selection was smaller than the uncertainty due to GCM model and RCP forcing selection. The results demonstrate that statistical downscaling is essential to account for local climate factors within a watershed, and that both weather station-based and gridded bias-correction data sources can be used effectively, but that future climate projections may inherit the historical bias in a selected data source. These inherent uncertainties associated with application of GCMs in hydrological and geospatial modeling should be carefully considered for understanding climate projections when building watershed models and interpreting the results. © 2021 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

Several active canopy sensors (ACS) with two or three spectral wavebands have been used for this purpose. The Crop Circle Phenom sensor is a new integrated multi-parameter proximal ACS system for in-field plant phenomics with the capability to measure reflectance, structural, and climatic attributes. The objective of this study was to evaluate this multi-parameter Crop Circle Phenom sensing system for in-season diagnosis of corn (Zea mays L.) N status across different soil drainage and tillage systems under variable N supply conditions. The four plant metrics used to approximate in-season N status consist of aboveground biomass (AGB), plant N concentration (PNC), plant N uptake (PNU), and N nutrition index (NNI). A field experiment was conducted in Wells, Minnesota during the 2018 and the 2019 growing seasons with a split-split plot design replicated four times with soil drainage (drained and undrained) as main block, tillage (conventional, no-till, and strip-till) as split plot, and pre-plant N (PPN) rate (0 to 225 in 45 kg ha−1 increment) as the split-split plot. Crop Circle Phenom measurements alongside destructive whole plant samples were collected at V8 +/−1 growth stage. Proximal sensor metrics were used to construct regression models to estimate N status indicators using simple regression (SR) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) models. The sensor derived indices tested included normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference red edge (NDRE), estimated canopy chlorophyll content (eCCC), estimated leaf area index (eLAI), ratio vegetation index (RVI), canopy chlorophyll content index (CCCI), fractional photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), and canopy and air temperature difference (∆Temp). Management practices such as drainage, tillage, and PPN rate were also included to determine the potential improvement in corn N status diagnosis. Three of the four replicated drained and undrained blocks were randomly selected as training data, and the remaining drained and undrained blocks were used as testing data. The results indicated that SR modeling using NDVI would be sufficient for estimating AGB compared to more complex machine learning methods. Conversely, PNC, PNU, and NNI all benefitted from XGB modeling based on multiple inputs. Among different approaches of XGB modeling, combining management information and Crop Circle Phenom measurements together increased model performance for predicting each of the four plant N metrics compared with solely using sensing data. The PPN rate was the most important management metric for all models compared to drainage and tillage information. Combining Crop Circle Phenom sensor parameters and management information is a promising strategy for in-season diagnosis of corn N status. More studies are needed to further evaluate this new integrated sensing system under diverse on-farm conditions and to test other machine learning models. © 2021 by the authors.

Adoption of climate-smart soil and crop management practices could buffer future extreme weather effects on maize yield. To test this hypothesis, the overarching aim of our study was to (i) calibrate and evaluation the DSSAT model for maize and parameterize the DSSAT tillage module for different tillage practices (contour ridge tillage and reduced tillage), and (ii) simulate the effects of different management options (tillage and crop residue incorporation) to buffer future extreme climate events on maize yield in four soil types (Lixisols and Plinthosols) located in two landscape positions (upslope and footslopes) of Benin and Burkina-Faso in West Africa, using two climate scenarios (baseline and 2 °C above pre-industrial period). Scenario analysis was performed using factorial combination of two tillage operations (contour ridge and reduced tillage), one crop residue treatment (with crop residue), and two N fertilizer rates (recommended N rate: 60 kg ha−1 and double recommended N rate: 120 kg ha−1) using HAPPI dataset. Model performance (calibration, evaluation and tillage model parameterization) was good as indicated by the lower normalized root mean square error (nRMSE, 12 %–18 %) and mean root absolute error (MRAE, 10 %–16 %), and higher D-index (0.78−0.93) depending on tillage practices and soil types. Long term future climate simulations and cumulative probability distribution confirmed that with both fertilization cases (recommended and double recommended), contour ridge tillage along with crop residue application could enhance maize yield (4 %–7 %) at upslope field sites under a future 2 °C warming scenario, where soil erosion and loss of water and nutrients through runoff is a serious risk. Simultaneously, reduced tillage with crop residue application under both fertilization cases could be a valuable alternative to farmer's practice in fields with deep soils at footslope position (St1 and St3), as it resulted in a higher increase of maize yield (14.5 %) under future 2 °C warming scenario compared to the baseline and could be preferred by risk-averse farmers. Maize production on gravelly soils with low water retention capacity (St1, 63−66 mm) may suffer (-11 %) from future 2 °C warming regardless of the tillage practice. However, despite the significant site-specific tillage effects, intensified N fertilizer application could reduce maize yield losses on St2, St3, and St4, irrespective of tillage practices by improving maize N uptake under elevated CO2 during future warming period. Hence, the application of site-specific tillage operations and crop residue application has the potential to buffer future warming effects on maize yield as confirmed by DSSAT simulations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CERES-Maize; Climate change adaptation; Extreme weather; Modelling","Agricultural runoff; Agricultural wastes; Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Extreme weather; Fertilizers; Mean square error; Parameter estimation; Probability distributions; Risk perception; Soils; Crop management practices; Cumulative probability distribution; Landscape positions; Management options; Model parameterization; Root mean square errors; Scenario analysis; Tillage practices; Soil surveys; buffer zone; climate change; crop production; crop residue; crop yield; fertilizer application; future prospect; maize; soil degradation; soil erosion; soil type; tillage; Benin [West Africa]; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Soil extracellular enzymes are one of the most active organic components in soil ecosystem, which is involved in almost all the biochemical reactions. Determining the importance of potential influencing factors of soil extracellular enzymes and thus estimating their activities are important for clarifying the biological mechanism of soil carbon and nitrogen cycling. In this study, the multiple linear regressions (MLR) and random forest (RF) models were conducted to estimate the activities of soil amylase and urease activities using covariates, such as soil water content (SWC), electrical conductivity (EC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and soil organic carbon (SOC) as well as the soil bulk density (BD) and pH. The results reveals that the amylase activity of fishpond was significantly higher than that of other land use types, while the urease activity of rape land, broad bean land, and fishpond were notably higher than that of bare flat, Spartina alterniflora, and uncultivated land. The RF model indicated that the SWC and TN is the main variable affecting amylase and urease activity, respectively. The RF model performed much better than MLR model in estimating the soil amylase and urease activity as it revealed much lower error indices (MAE and RMSE) and higher R2 value. The superiority of RF model in estimating amylase and urease activity is due to its advantages to handle the nonlinear and hierarchical relationships between enzyme activities and covariates, and insensitivity to overfitting and the presence of noise in the data. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coastal reclamation; Multiple linear regression; Random forest model; Soil extracellular enzyme","Decision trees; Fish ponds; Land reclamation; Land use; Linear regression; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Physicochemical properties; Random forests; Soil moisture; Biochemical reactions; Biological mechanisms; Electrical conductivity; Extracellular enzyme activity; Multiple linear regression models; Multiple linear regressions; Soil physico-chemical properties; Spartina alterniflora; Amylases; algorithm; bare soil; comparative study; enzyme; enzyme activity; estimation method; land reclamation; model; multiple regression; physicochemical property; soil ecosystem; soil nutrient; Spartina alterniflora; Vicia faba",Article,Scopus

In this study, we analyze the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) and, in particular, local convolutional neural networks (LCNN) for genomic prediction, as a region-specific filter corresponds much better with our prior genetic knowledge on the genetic architecture of traits than traditional convolutional neural networks. Model performances are evaluated on a simulated maize data panel (n = 10,000; p = 34,595) and real Arabidopsis data (n = 2,039; p = 180,000) for a variety of traits based on their predictive ability. The baseline LCNN, containing one local convolutional layer (kernel size: 10) and two fully connected layers with 64 nodes each, is outperforming commonly proposed ANNs (multi layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks) for basically all considered traits. For traits with high heritability and large training population as present in the simulated data, LCNN are even outperforming state-of-the-art methods like genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), Bayesian models and extended GBLUP, indicated by an increase in predictive ability of up to 24%. However, for small training populations, these state-of-the-art methods outperform all considered ANNs. Nevertheless, the LCNN still outperforms all other considered ANNs by around 10%. Minor improvements to the tested baseline network architecture of the LCNN were obtained by increasing the kernel size and of reducing the stride, whereas the number of subsequent fully connected layers and their node sizes had neglectable impact. Although gains in predictive ability were obtained for large scale data sets by using LCNNs, the practical use of ANNs comes with additional problems, such as the need of genotyping all considered individuals, the lack of estimation of heritability and reliability. Furthermore, breeding values are additive by design, whereas ANN-based estimates are not. However, ANNs also comes with new opportunities, as networks can easily be extended to account for additional inputs (omics, weather etc.) and outputs (multi-trait models), and computing time increases linearly with the number of individuals. With advances in high-throughput phenotyping and cheaper genotyping, ANNs can become a valid alternative for genomic prediction. © Copyright © 2020 Pook, Freudenthal, Korte and Simianer.","breeding; deep learning; genomic selection; Keras; machine learning; phenotype prediction; selection","Arabidopsis; Article; artificial neural network; convolutional neural network; gene frequency; genetic trait; genotype; maize; nonhuman; population size; quality control; simulation; single nucleotide polymorphism; whole genome sequencing",Article,Scopus

In the current research, the weighted additive soil quality index (SQIw), factor analysis (FA), and multiple linear regression (MLR) are used to assess the soil quality of rainfed winter wheat fields with two soil orders on 53.20 km2 of agricultural land in western Iran. A total of 18 soil quality indicators were determined for 100 soil samples (0–20 cm depth) from two soil orders (Inceptisols and Entisols). The soil properties measured were: PH, soil texture, organic carbon (OC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), electrical conductivity (EC), soil microbial respiration (SMR), carbonate calcium equivalent (CCE), soil porosity (SP), bulk density (BD), exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), mean weight diameter (MWD), available potassium (AK), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), available Fe (AFe), available Zn (AZn), available Mn (AMn), and available Cu (ACu). Wheat grain yield for all of the 100 sampling sites was also gathered. The SQIw was calculated using two weighting methods (FA and MLR) and maps were created using a digital soil mapping framework. The soil indicators determined for the minimum data set (MDS) were AK, clay, CEC, AP, SMR, and sand. The correlation between the MLR weighting technique (SQIw-M) and the rainfed wheat yield (r = 0.62) was slightly larger than that the correlation of yield with the FA weighted technique (SQIw-F) (r = 0.58). Results showed that the means of both SQIw-M and SQIw-F and rainfed wheat yield for Inceptisols were higher than for Entisols, although these differences were not statistically significant. Both SQIw-M and SQIw-F showed that areas with Entisols had lower proportions of good soil quality grades (Grades I and II), and higher proportions of poor soil quality grades (Grades IV and V) compared to Inceptisols. Based on these results, soil type must be considered for soil quality assessment in future studies to maintain and enhance soil quality and sustainable production. The overall soil quality of the study region was of poor and moderate grades. To improve soil quality, it is therefore recommended that effective practices such as the implementation of scientifically integrated nutrient management involving the combined use of organic and inorganic fertilizers in rainfed wheat fields should be promoted. © 2020 by the authors.","Big data; Data science; Digital soil mapping; Internet of things (IoT); Machine learning; Multiple linear regression; Principal component analysis; Smart agriculture; Soil quality index; Susceptibility; Sustainable food production; Wheat production",,Article,Scopus

It has resulted in altered regional hydrology and water quality of the river basin. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model was used to investigate the effects of spatial urbanization on key hydrological components of the study region. Time series of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps of 1980, 2001, and 2012 were prepared using the object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach. To understand the existing interrelationships between urbanization and key hydrological variables, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and correlation statistical analyses were carried out between urbanization indicators [spatial urbanization level (Us) and population urbanization level (Up)] and hydrological parameters. Results revealed that from 1980 to 2012, an increase in the water yield was observed from 433.6 to 572.7 mm [standard deviation (σ) = 69.8; sum of squares (SS) = 9,740.6], and the annual average surface runoff increased from 80.7 to 149 mm [σ = 34.8; SS = 2,425.4], however, evapotranspiration (ET) decreased from 790.9 to 675 mm [σ = 63.2; SS = 7,986.6] in the river basin, corresponding to an increase in Us from 0.36 to 2.07.

Due to the lack of a high-resolution cropland dataset, impacts of land use change (LUC) on the LMAV ecosystem services have not been fully understood. In this study, we developed a novel framework by integrating the machine learning algorithm, county-level agricultural census, and satellite-based cropland products to reconstruct the LMAV cropland distribution during 1850–2018 at a 30-m resolution. Results showed that the LMAV cropland area increased from 0.78 × 104 km2 in 1850 to 6.64 × 104 km2 in 1980 and then decreased to 6.16 × 104 km2 in 2018. Cropland expansion rate was the largest in the 1960s (749 km2 yr−1) but decreased rapidly thereafter, whereas cropland abandonment rate increased substantially in recent decades with the largest rate of 514 km2 yr−1 in the 2010s. Our dataset has three notable features: (1) the depiction of fine spatial details, (2) the integration of the county-level census, and (3) the inclusion of a machine-learning algorithm trained by satellite-based land cover product. Most importantly, our dataset well captured the continuous increasing trend in cropland area from 1930–1960, which was misrepresented by other cropland datasets reconstructed from the state-level census. Our dataset would be important to accurately evaluate the impacts of historical deforestation and recent afforestation efforts on regional ecosystem services, attribute the observed hydrological changes to anthropogenic and natural driving factors, and investigate how the socioeconomic factors control regional LUC pattern.

Due to a lack of information about crop distribution over large agricultural areas, as well as the crop separation problem (based on remote sensing data) caused by the similarity of phenological cycles, a question arises regarding the relevance of using data obtained from the arable land mask of the region to predict the yield of individual crops. This study aimed to develop a regression model for soybean crop yield monitoring in municipalities and was conducted in the Khabarovsk Territory, located in the Russian Far East. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, an arable land mask, the meteorological characteristics obtained using the VEGA-Science web service, and crop yield data for 2010-2019 were used. The structure of crop distribution in the Khabarovsk District was reproduced in experimental fields, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) seasonal variation approximating functions were constructed (both for total district sown area and different crops). It was found that the approximating function graph for the experimental fields corresponds to a similar graph for arable land. The maximum NDVI forecast error on the 30th week in 2019 using the approximation parameters according to 2014-2018 did not exceed 0.5%. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 0.054. The maximum value of the NDVI, as well as the indicators characterizing the temperature regime, soil moisture, and photosynthetically active radiation in the region during the period from the 1st to the 30th calendar weeks of the year, were previously considered as parameters of the regression model for predicting soybean yield. As a result of the experiments, the NDVI and the duration of the growing season were included in the regression model as independent variables. According to 2010-2018, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the regression model was 6.2%, and the soybean yield prediction absolute percentage error (APE) for 2019 was 6.3%, while RMSE was 0.13 t/ha. This approach was evaluated with a leave-one-year-out cross-validation procedure. When the calculated maximum NDVI value was used in the regression equation for early forecasting, MAPE in the 28th-30th weeks was less than 10%. © 2020 by the authors.","Approximation; Arable land mask; NDVI; Remote sensing; Soybean crop yield","Agricultural robots; Crops; Electromagnetic wave emission; Errors; Food supply; Forecasting; Land use; Logistic regression; Mean square error; Radiometers; Soil moisture; Web services; Independent variables; Mean absolute percentage error; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer datum; Normalized difference vegetation index; Phenological cycles; Photosynthetically active radiation; Root mean square errors; Separation problems; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

The model comparison was conducted without parameter calibration in order to assess their performance under ungauged conditions. The results indicate that SWAT-EC outperformed SWAT2012 for stream flow and NO3-N and TN loading simulation on both monthly and annual scales. For sediment, SWAT-EC performed better than SWAT2012 on a monthly time step basis, but no noticeable improvement was found at the annual scale. In addition, the performance of the uncalibrated SWAT-EC was comparable to other calibrated SWAT models reported in previous publications with respect to sediment and NO3-N loadings.

Therefore, the delineation of management zone in spatially variable farmland was thought to be crucial for a site-specific management of crops. Recent introduction of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) to precision agriculture however, changed the concept of management zone. Advancement in ICT enable to produce prescriptions tailored to each field by integrating soil fertility map, quasi real-time crop growth data, and weather data. In this review, at first, history of development in the assessment of the spatial variability of soil, crop growth, and yield will be mentioned. Then, the problem of inter year variability of crop yield is considered, which was caused by the interaction between soil properties and fluctuating weather. To overcome this temporal variability, integration of soil data, crop data, and weather data are indispensable, and crop models play a pivotal role in the solution. ICT includes global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), various sensors including machine vision, robotic technology, artificial intelligence, internet of things, and cloud computer which could realize the big data analysis by using data base supplied from public and private domains and raw field data from farms. High performance of cloud computer enables to derive an appropriate management zone and prescriptions. Agricultural machineries equipped with ICT devices such as GNSS, on-the-go machine visions, and sensors such as ECa, are already in market.

In this study, pond-induced impacts on soil erosion and sediment transport were investigated at the scale of the French Claise basin. In order to determine erosion and sediment transport patterns of the Claise, the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) erosion and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models were used. The impact of ponds on the studied processes was revealed by means of land cover change scenarios, using ponded versus pondless inputs. Results show that under current conditions (pond presence), 12.48% of the basin corresponds to no-erosion risk zones (attributed to the dense pond network), while 65.66% corresponds to low-erosion risk, 21.68% to moderate-erosion risk, and only 0.18% to high-erosion risk zones. The SWAT model revealed that ponded sub-basins correspond to low sediment yields areas, in contrast to the pondless sub-basins, which yield appreciably higher erosion rates. Under the alternative pondless scenario, erosion risks shifted to 1.12%, 0.52%, 76.8%, and 21.56% for no, low, moderate, and high-erosion risks, respectively, while the sediment transport pattern completely shifted to higher sediment yield zones.

While previous studies have identified the importance that the temporal distribution of daily rainfall has on crop production, climate models often do not represent these distributions consistently with observed trends. The objectives of this study are to (1) evaluate the relationship between rainfall variability and yields for economically important crops in the upper Southeastern United States and (2) assess the potential impact that incorporating observed trends in rainfall variability has on yield projections under future climate change. This study develops statistical models of historic crop yields for five crops, finding that an explanatory variable related to daily rainfall variability, the wet-day Gini coefficient (GC), has a statistically significant negative relationship with crop yields in all cases. These models are then used to estimate the impacts of climate change using an ensemble of downscaled general circulation model (GCM) projections and scenarios that include a continuation of observed GC trends. Most downscaled GCMs evaluated do not project changes in GC consistent with observed trends, and scenarios that assume a continuation of observed trends result in projected yields that are up to 5.8% lower than those directly based on GCM projections. While additional research is needed in the climate science community to better understand how rainfall variability may change in the future, this should be mirrored in the impacts community so that agricultural impact assessments incorporate these potentially important changes. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Rain; Agricultural impacts; Climate change impact; Explanatory variables; General circulation model; Gini coefficients; Rainfall variability; Temporal distribution; Temporal dynamics; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; crop production; crop yield; future prospect; general circulation model; precipitation assessment; prediction; temporal distribution; trend analysis; United States",Article,Scopus

Precision management relies on division of a field into areas with homogeneous characteristics, management zones (MZs), which are likely affected by multiple, interrelated factors. We present a method, based on machine learning and spatial statistics, to analyze the spatial relationship between a set of variables and determine management zones in a vineyard. The method involves: (1) fitting a model that quantifies the relationship between multiple variables and yield; (2) fitting a model that quantifies the effect of the spatial variability of multiple variables on yield spatial characteristics; and (3) developing a weighted multivariate spatial clustering model as a method to determine MZs. Twelve variables were sampled for 3893 vines in the wine grape vineyard. These variables included soil properties, terrain characteristics, and environmental impact, as well as crop-condition, using indices calculated from remote sensing images. The predictor variables were spatially characterized using hot-spot analysis (Getis Ord Gi* Z-score values) to assess their spatial variability. A gradient boosted regression trees (BRT) algorithm was used to analyze the spatial multivariable effect on yield spatial characteristics. MZs were determined using multivariate K-means clustering, with relative weights given to the predictors, based on their relative influence on yield spatial variability provided by the BRT model. This method was compared to ordinary K-means clustering and K-means with spatial representation of the variables without weights using a dissimilarity index and spatial autocorrelation measures. Model performance was found to be very high and demonstrated that among the evaluated predictors, crop condition indices were the most important regressors for yield and its spatial characteristics. The weighted multivariate spatial clustering was found to perform better in terms of separability of the points and their spatial distribution than the other two clustering techniques. Quantifying yield and its within-field spatial variability, ranking the effects of the predictors and their spatial variabilities, and segmentation of MZs through multivariable spatial analysis, are expected to benefit irrigation management and agricultural decision-making processes. © 2019","Machine learning; Precision irrigation; Spatial modeling","Cluster analysis; Crops; Decision making; Environmental impact; Irrigation; K-means clustering; Learning systems; Machine learning; Multivariable systems; Remote sensing; Trees (mathematics); Boosted regression trees; Precision irrigation; Spatial and temporal variability; Spatial autocorrelations; Spatial characteristics; Spatial modeling; Spatial representations; Terrain characteristics; Spatial variables measurement; algorithm; autocorrelation; cluster analysis; crop yield; image analysis; irrigation; machine learning; management practice; multivariate analysis; numerical model; precision agriculture; remote sensing; spatial analysis; Vitis vinifera",Article,Scopus

For a specific region, the comprehensive effects of multiple meteorological factors are important indicators for the climatic suitability of the crops. To evaluate the synthetic effects, an integrated climatic assessment indicator (ICAI) are developed in Jiangsu Province, China. A newly produced meteorological assimilation driving datasets (CMADS V1.0) combined with observation data are used in establishing the indicator. The procedure to construct the indicator involves building statistical crop models by meteorological factors and determining the indicator values by classification. In modeling, two machine learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are compared and the classification model of RF is chosen to build ICAI due to its better performance in the independent test set. To determine a reasonable division in classification, distribution detection of climatic yield is carried out and Monte Carlo simulations are applied for the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test. The generated indicator includes three values: yield loss, normal and yield increment, with the spatial and temporal prediction accuracy from 67.86% to 100% in the test set for the Northern, Central and Southern Jiangsu. The ICAI are used to estimate the past climatic suitability of winter wheat and the future suitability under global warming conditions in Jiangsu Province. The results show that the climate in 1990s has more adverse effects on wheat production than the other two sub-periods in Northern and Southern Jiangsu. The adaptability of wheat production in Southern Jiangsu has improved greatly to the local environments during the past three decades. In addition, when annual temperature accelerates upwards, both possibilities of yield loss in Northern Jiangsu and yield increment in Southern Jiangsu will increase. Therefore, more concerns should be given to the North in future warming climate, while yield potential in the South may be further improved in this circumstance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agro-meteorological indicator; Random Forest; Support Vector Machine; Winter wheat; Yield prediction","Computational complexity; Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Global warming; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Monte Carlo methods; Support vector machines; Assessment indicator; Classification models; Comprehensive effect; Meteorological condition; Meteorological factors; Random forests; Winter wheat; Yield prediction; Classification (of information); agrometeorology; algorithm; crop plant; crop production; crop yield; design method; environmental indicator; global warming; machine learning; support vector machine; wheat; yield response; China; Jiangsu; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Previous studies have revealed the close correlation between SIF and terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP), and have used SIF to estimate vegetation GPP. This study investigated the relationship between the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) SIF products at two retrieval bands (SIF757, SIF771) and the autumn crop production in China during the summer of 2015 on different timescales. Subsequently, we evaluated the performance to estimate the autumn crop production of 2016 by using the optimal model developed in 2015. In addition, the OCO-2 SIF was compared with the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation indices (VIs) (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI; enhanced vegetation index, EVI) for predicting the crop production. All the remotely sensed products exhibited the strongest correlation with autumn crop production in July. The OCO-2 SIF757 estimated autumn crop production best (R2 = 0.678, p &lt; 0.01; RMSE = 748.901 ten kilotons; MAE = 567.629 ten kilotons). SIF monitored the crop dynamics better than VIs, although the performances of VIs were similar to SIF. The estimation accuracy was limited by the spatial resolution and discreteness of the OCO-2 SIF products. Our findings demonstrate that SIF is a feasible approach for the crop production estimation and is not inferior to VIs, and suggest that accurate autumn crop production forecasts while using the SIF-based model can be obtained one to two months before the harvest. Furthermore, the proposed method can be widely applied with the development of satellite-based SIF observation technology. © 2019 by the authors.","Crop production; EVI; NDVI; OCO-2; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence","Chlorophyll; Cultivation; Fluorescence; Forecasting; Orbits; Photosynthesis; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Crop production; Enhanced vegetation index; Gross primary productivity; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; NDVI; Normalized difference vegetation index; OCO-2; Crops",Article,Scopus

The objectives of the study were to assess modelling requirements for describing shallow groundwater and tile drainage dynamics and to evaluate how tile drains affect groundwater flow across the redox interface, where nitrate reduction in the subsurface occurs. The study was conducted on a 33-hectare tile drained field within a Weichsel till area in Fensholt catchment, Denmark. The study consisted of 2.5 years high-frequency monitoring and numerical modelling using a variably-saturated 3D hydrological model (FEFLOW) with a detailed representation of the tile drain network. Field data showed extremely rapid increases, up to 1 m per day, in the groundwater heads when the autumn water surplus starts. Drain discharge was found to follow the dynamics in heads. High-frequency monitoring (at least once per day) is therefore necessary in order to capture the dynamics in shallow groundwater and tile discharge. The dynamics showed simultaneous rapid increase in groundwater heads down to a depth of 22 m, illustrating the key importance of deeper geology in understanding the hydrological processes in this area. The temporal dynamics in head and drain discharge were successfully captured by the hydrological model and the steepness of the retention curve was found to be important for this. The calibrated model was successfully tested against discharge in the stream draining a larger area. The model results showed, that tile drains affect the water flow in the area and significantly decrease the downward fluxes across the redox interface, located on average at 3.6 m depth. Tile drains therefore have a large effect on the amount of nitrate reduction in the subsurface and on the nitrate fluxes to receiving surface waters. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Field scale; High-frequency data; Hydrological modeling; Shallow groundwater; Temporal dynamics; Tile drainage","Catchments; Climate models; Cultivation; Groundwater flow; Hydraulics; Nitrates; Salinity measurement; Field scale; High frequency data; Hydrological modeling; Shallow groundwater; Temporal dynamics; Tile drainage; Groundwater; catchment; drainage; groundwater flow; groundwater-surface water interaction; hydraulic head; hydrodynamics; hydrological modeling; interface; numerical model; redox conditions; till; water table; Denmark; Poland [Central Europe]; Vistula River",Article,Scopus

A panel of 25 lines/cultivars was used during two years (2012–2014) to evaluate some of the important traits related to seed yield. PCA was used to perform feature extraction in the first stage of modeling. Based on PCA and first two components that incorporated approximately 79% of the total variability, five agro morphological and phenological traits, including plant height (PH), number of branches per plant (NBP), number of capsules per plant (NCP), thousand seed weight (TSW), and number of seeds per capsule (NSC), due to high values of Eigen vectors were selected as input. The performance of the models in predicting seed yield was determined using some of the statistical quality parameters, including coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE).

However, these studies have been limited to monitor the vertical distribution of HABs due to the optical complexity of inland water. Therefore, this study applied a deep neural network model to monitor the vertical distribution of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), phycocyanin (PC), and turbidity (Turb) using drone-borne hyperspectral imagery, in-situ measurement, and meteoroidal data. The pigment concentrations were measured between depths of 0 m and 5.0 m with 0.05 m intervals. Here, four state-of-the-art data-driven model structures (ResNet-18, ResNet-101, GoogLeNet, and Inception v3) were adopted for estimating the vertical distributions of the harmful algal pigments. Among the four models, the ResNet-18 model showed the best performance, with an R2 value of 0.70. In addition, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) substantially provided informative reflectance band ranges near 490 nm and 620 nm in the hyperspectral image for the vertical estimation of pigments. Therefore, this study demonstrated that the explainable deep learning model with drone-borne hyperspectral images has the potential to estimate Chl-a, PC, and Turb vertical distributions and to show influential features that contribute to describing the vertical profile phenomena. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cyanobacteria; Drone-borne hyperspectral image; Explainable deep learning model; Vertical profile","Deep neural networks; Drones; Hyperspectral imaging; Remote sensing; Chlorophyll a; Cyanobacterium; Drone-borne hyperspectral image; Explainable deep learning model; Harmful algal blooms; Hyper-spectral imageries; Inland waters; Learning models; Vertical distributions; Vertical profile; Spectroscopy; chlorophyll a; phycocyanin; pigment; chlorophyll; algal bloom; cyanobacterium; spectral analysis; vertical distribution; vertical profile; algal bloom; Article; concentration (parameter); deep learning; deep neural network; environmental monitoring; hyperspectral imagery; image processing; imaging and display; nonhuman; surface property; turbidity; water quality; environmental monitoring; Cyanobacteria; Varanidae; Chlorophyll; Chlorophyll A; Deep Learning; Environmental Monitoring; Harmful Algal Bloom; Phycocyanin",Article,Scopus

Three models were applied, including (1) a modified “RS- and threshold-based clustering”, (2) a “hybrid-based, unsupervised clustering”, in which data from different sources were combined for MZ delineation, and (3) a “RS-based, unsupervised clustering”. Various data processing methods including machine learning were used in the model development. Statistical tests such as the Paired Sample T-test, Kruskal-Wallis H-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were applied to evaluate the final delineated MZ maps. Additionally, a procedure for improving models based on information about phenological phases and the occurrence of agricultural drought was implemented. The results showed that information on agronomy and climate enables improving and optimizing MZ delineation. The integration of prior knowledge on new climate conditions (drought) in image selection was tested for effective use of the models. Lack of this information led to the infeasibility of obtaining optimal results. Models that solely rely on remote sensing information are comparatively less expensive than hybrid models.

Here, we first analyzed the spectral differences between MDMV-infected red leaves and healthy leaves and constructed a sensitive index (SI) for measurements. Next, based on the characteristic bands (Rλ) associated with leaf an-thocyanins (Anth), we determined vegetation indices (VIs) commonly used in plant physiological and biochemical parameter inversion and established a vegetation index (VIc) by utilizing the combination of two arbitrary bands following the construction principles of NDVI, DVI, RVI, and SAVI. Furthermore, we developed classification models based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) in order to distinguish the red leaves from healthy leaves. Finally, we performed UR, MLR, PLSR, PCR, and SVM simulations on Anth based on Rλ, VIs, VIc, and Rλ + VIs + VIc and indirectly estimated the severity of MDMV infection based on the relationship between the reflection spectra and Anth. Distinct from those of the normal leaves, the spectra of red leaves showed strong reflectance characteristics at 640 nm, and SI increased with increasing Anth. Moreover, the accuracy of the two VIc-based classification models was 100%, which is significantly higher than that of the VIs and Rλ-based models. Among the Anth regression models, the accuracy of the MLR model based on Rλ + VIs + VIc was the highest (R2c = 0.85; R2v = 0.74). The developed models could accurately identify MDMV and estimate the severity of its in-fection, laying the theoretical foundation for large-scale remote sensing-based monitoring of this virus in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

A wide range of input data are often needed to forecast crop yield in a region where sophisticated approaches such as machine learning and process-based models are used. This requires considerable effort for data preparation in addition to identifying data sources. Here, we propose a simpler approach called the Analogy Based Crop-yield (ABC) forecast scheme to make timely and accurate prediction of regional crop yield using a minimum set of inputs. In the ABC method, a growing season from a prior long-term period, e.g., 10 years, is first identified as analogous to the current season by the use of a similarity index based on the time series leaf area index (LAI) patterns. Crop yield in the given growing season is then forecasted using the weighted yield average reported in the analogous seasons for the area of interest. The ABC approach was used to predict corn and soybean yields in the Midwestern U.S. at the county level for the period of 2017–2019. The MOD15A2H, which is a satellite data product for LAI, was used to compile inputs. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of crop yield forecasts was <10% for corn and soybean in each growing season when the time series of LAI from the day of year 89 to 209 was used as inputs to the ABC approach. The prediction error for the ABC approach was comparable to results from a deep neural network model that relied on soil and weather data as well as satellite data in a previous study. These results indicate that the ABC approach allowed for crop yield forecast with a lead-time of at least two months before harvest. In particular, the ABC scheme would be useful for regions where crop yield forecasts are limited by availability of reliable environmental data. © 2021 by the authors.

These models were also evaluated to model the internal DEF (IDEF) across the northwestern, southeastern, northern, and western regions around the wetland. Furthermore, the main factors controlling DEF and IDEF were identified based on the importance value (IV) of predictors in the best model. The results showed that the ERT model increased the prediction accuracies by an average of 40%, compared to the MARS model. According to the IV obtained from the ERT model, aerosol optical depth (IV = 0.28), wetland discharge (IV = 0.25), near-surface wind speed (IV = 0.08), and erosive winds frequency (IV = 0.07) were identified as the most important factors controlling DEF across the northeastern and southwestern regions of the wetland. However, the erosive wind speed was detected as the major factor affecting the IDEF in the northern (IV = 0.16), western (IV = 0.18), and southeastern (IV = 0.65) regions of study wetland. It was also found that vapor pressure with IV of 0.32 had the greatest effect on IDEF variations across the northwestern region of the wetland. Overall, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ERT model in modeling the factors affecting DEF and IDEF, and the results may be used to mitigate dust events hazards around the Gavkhouni Wetland, in central Iran. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climatic factors; Degraded wetland; Dust pollution; Iran; Machine learning; Remote sensing","Dust; Forecasting; Forestry; Wind; Aerosol optical depths; Central iran; Major factors; Multivariate adaptive regression splines; Near-surface winds; Prediction accuracy; Randomized trees; Western region; Wetlands; algorithm; atmospheric pollution; climate effect; dust; machine learning; multivariate analysis; prediction; regression analysis; remote sensing; wetland; aerosol; article; controlled study; human; Iran; machine learning; optical depth; prediction; randomized controlled trial; remote sensing; vapor pressure; wetland; wind speed; algorithm; dust; environmental monitoring; Iran; Gavkhuni; Iran; Algorithms; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Iran; Wetlands",Article,Scopus

The number of PAs has increased remarkably over the last few decades. Yet, biodiversity is still being lost at alarming rates, even within many of those PAs. Understanding the factors that influence the levels of human pressure within PAs remains a key objective. In this study, we examined the factors associated with the human settlements' levels within the world's PAs. Using the random forests technique, an ensemble machine learning method, and a vast number of PAs (81 100-137 523), we assessed the importance of nine factors, including the PAs' management objective as reflected by their International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Category. The IUCN classifies PAs into six categories ranging from strict nature reserves to areas in which multiple human uses are permitted. The prevalent but untested assumption is that human settlements' levels within PAs vary according to their management objective, with less strict PAs having higher levels. Our results, however, show that the differences between the categories were for the most part minor. The most important predictor of human settlements was accessibility measured as the time required to reach the PA from the nearest major city. These findings were consistent across all of the world's subregions. Other less important factors included the extent of croplands within PAs, elevation, and slope. Our findings suggest that PAs nearer urban centers tend to have higher human settlements' levels regardless of their other characteristics, such as management objective and year of establishment. Managing those PAs successfully will be necessary to achieve the post-2020 global biodiversity targets and will require conservation strategies that acknowledge and engage the local communities. © 2021 The Author(s).","Aichi Target 11; Convention on biological diversity; COP-15; Global biodiversity targets; Post-2020 global biodiversity framework; Protected planet","Biodiversity; Conservation; Decision trees; Environmental protection; Biodiversity loss; Conservation strategies; Global patterns; Human pressures; Human settlements; Machine learning methods; Management objectives; Nature reserves; Learning systems; biodiversity; conservation; conservation management; conservation planning; human activity; human settlement; protected area; strategic approach",Article,Scopus

Few studies have comprehensively evaluated plant traits from multispectral cameras onboard UAV platforms. Additionally, machine learning algorithms tend to over-or underfit data and limited attention has been paid to optimizing their performance through an ensemble learning approach. This study aims to (1) comprehensively evaluate twelve rice plant traits estimated from aerial unmanned vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral images and (2) introduce Random Forest AdaBoost (RFA) algorithms as an optimization approach for estimating plant traits. The approach was tested based on a farmer’s field in Terengganu, Malaysia, for the off-season from February to June 2018, involving five rice cultivars and three nitrogen (N) rates. Four bands, thirteen indices and Random Forest-AdaBoost (RFA) regression models were evaluated against the twelve plant traits according to the growth stages. Among the plant traits, plant height, green leaf and storage organ biomass, and foliar nitrogen (N) content were estimated well, with a coefficient of determination (R2 ) above 0.80. In comparing the bands and indices, red, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), Red-Edge Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (REWDRVI) and Red-Edge Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (RESAVI) were remarkable in estimating all plant traits at tillering, booting and milking stages with R2 values ranging from 0.80–0.99 and root mean square error (RMSE) values ranging from 0.04–0.22. Milking was found to be the best growth stage to conduct estimations of plant traits. In summary, our findings demonstrate that an ensemble learning approach can improve the accuracy as well as reduce under/overfitting in plant phenotyping algorithms. © 2021 by the authors.

Cultivated in most of the world, cotton is one of the economically most important agricultural crops. Its cultivation in tropical regions has made it the target of a wide spectrum of agricultural pests and diseases, and efficient solutions are required. Moreover, the symptoms of the main pests and diseases cannot be differentiated in the initial stages, and the correct identification of a lesion can be difficult for the producer. To help resolve the problem, the present research provides a solution based on deep learning in the screening of cotton leaves which makes it possible to monitor the health of the cotton crop and make better decisions for its management. With the learning models GoogleNet and Resnet50 using convolutional neural networks, a precision of 86.6% and 89.2%, respectively, was obtained. Compared with traditional approaches for the processing of images such as support vector machines (SVM), Closest k-neighbors (KNN), artificial neural networks (ANN) and neuro-fuzzy (NFC), the convolutional neural networks proved to be up to 25% more precise, suggesting that this method can contribute to a more rapid and reliable inspection of the plants growing in the field. © 2021 by the authors.

However, there remain challenges for predicting soil phosphorus (P) content and availability, which requires a reliable model applicable for different land-use systems to upscale. Recently, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) corresponding to the spectral information of soil was developed to considerably improve the accuracy of soil property predictions. The present study investigated the predictive ability of a 1D-CNN model to estimate soil available P (oxalate-extractable P; Pox) content in soils by comparing it with partial least squares (PLS) and random forest (RF) regressions using soil samples (n = 318) collected from natural (forest and non-forest) and cultivated (upland and flooded rice fields) systems in Madagascar. Overall, the 1D-CNN model showed the best predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.878) with a highly accurate prediction ability (ratio of performance to the interquartile range = 2.492). Compared to the PLS model, the RF and 1D-CNN models indicated 4.37% and 23.77% relative improvement in root mean squared error values, respectively. Based on a sensitivity analysis, the important wavebands for predicting soil Pox were associated with iron (Fe) oxide, organic matter (OM), and water absorption, which were previously known wavelength regions for estimating P in soil. These results suggest that 1D-CNN corresponding spectral signatures can be expected to significantly improve the predictive ability for estimating soil available P (Pox) from Vis-NIR spectral data. Rapid and accurate estimation of available P content in soils using our results can be expected to contribute to effective fertilizer management in agriculture and the sustainable management of ecosystems. However, the 1D-CNN model will require a large dataset to extend its applicability to other regions of Madagascar. Thus, further updates should be tested in future studies using larger datasets from a wide range of ecosystems in the tropics. © 2021 by the authors.

If third ratoon could be predicted, selections would improve. Machine learning (ML) techniques utilize yield variables to create predictors. Yield variables from 11 locations, 24 genotypes, and 20 cycles were used in a model to predict third ratoon-cane yield cross validated by cycle using ML and statistical techniques including Linear Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient, Neural Network, Support Vector Machines, and k-nearest neighbors algorithm. Prediction error was measured as the difference between predicted and measured third ratoon cane yield. A model that partitioned overall prediction error into sources of variances indicated that location within cycle (52%) followed by genotype by location within cycle (10%) were the largest sources of error for predicting ratooning ability. Ratoon stalk number, sucrose and cane yield ranked highly toward predictions. The Adaboost (AB) ML predictors of third ratoon cane yield had lower experimental error, when compared to second ratoon as a third ratoon predictor. However, prediction by cycle was not consistently lower than second ratoon as a predictor. If unique locations were removed, then AB predictions had less error and better predictors of third ratoon than second ratoon in 75% of the cycles tested, thus demonstrating the potential and limitations of utilizing harvest and location data for ML predictions. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Machine learning; Prediction; Ratooning; Sugarcane",,Article,Scopus

To assess the impacts of soil water simulation approaches on various model outputs, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool was modified to accommodate an alternative soil water percolation method and tested at two geographically and climatically distinct, instrumented watersheds in the United States. Soil water was evaluated at the site scale via measured observations, and hydrologic and biophysical outputs were analysed at the watershed scale. Results demonstrated an improved Kling–Gupta Efficiency of up to 0.3 and a reduction in percent bias from 5 to 25% at the site scale, when soil water percolation was changed from a threshold, bucket-based approach to an alternative approach based on variable hydraulic conductivity. The primary difference between the approaches was attributed to the ability to simulate soil water content above field capacity for successive days; however, regardless of the approach, a lack of site-specific characterization of soil properties by the soils database at the site scale was found to severely limit the analysis. Differences in approach led to a regime shift in percolation from a few, high magnitude events to frequent, low magnitude events. At the watershed scale, the variable hydraulic conductivity-based approach reduced average annual percolation by 20–50 mm, directly impacting the water balance and subsequently biophysical predictions. For instance, annual denitrification increased by 14–24 kg/ha for the new approach.

This work aimed therefore at closing this gap by evaluating the performance of machine learning modelling of in-season sorghum biomass yields based on Sentinel-2-derived fAPAR and simpler high-throughput optical handheld meters-derived NDVI and CI calculated from sorghum plants reflectance. Bayesian ridge regression showed good cross-validated performance, and high reliability (R2 = 35%) and low bias (mean absolute prediction error, MAPE = 0.4%) during the validation step. Hand-held optical meter-derived CI and Sentinel-2- derived fAPAR showed comparable effects on machine learning performance, but CI outperformed NDVI and was therefore considered as a good alternative to Sentinel-2's fAPAR.

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) LiDAR systems can quickly and precisely acquire vegetation structure information at a low cost. UAV LiDAR data are increasingly used in vegetation parameters estimation. In this study, we estimated maize and soybean heights using two methods, i.e., based on LiDAR-derived CHM and based on LiDAR variables. The results show that UAV LiDAR data can successfully estimate maize and soybean heights. We found that the method based on LiDAR variables can produce more accurate estimates than CHM-based method. The estimation model of combined maize and soybean had a better prediction performance than those of the specific maize and soybean. Moreover, the soybean height estimation models derived from both methods yielded the lowest prediction precision. We studied the influence of LiDAR point density on crop height estimates through reduced point density (0.25–420 points/m2). When LiDAR point density was less than 1 point/m2, the estimation precision for the specific maize and soybean dropped rapidly with the decrease of point density. However, the point density had no significant influence on crop height estimation precision while LiDAR point density was greater than or equal to 1 point/m2. Moreover, the original point density did not generate the highest estimation precision in our study. Therefore, high LiDAR point density may be not required for estimating vegetation parameters, and a good balance between the point density and data acquisition cost should be found. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Crop height; LiDAR; LiDAR point density; Maize; Soybean; UAV","Antennas; Crops; Data acquisition; Forecasting; Optical radar; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Biomass estimation; Estimation models; Estimation precision; Prediction performance; Prediction precision; Vegetation parameters; Vegetation structure; Yield forecasting; Parameter estimation; aerial survey; data acquisition; estimation method; height; lidar; maize; satellite data; soybean; unmanned vehicle; vegetation structure; Glycine max",Article,Scopus

This study explored a novel application of anomaly detection techniques to derive models for forecasting risk of crop disease from data composed of outbreaks only. This was done in two steps. In the training phase, the algorithms were used to learn the envelope of weather conditions most associated with historic crop disease outbreaks. In the testing phase, the algorithms were used for hindcasting of historic outbreak events. Five different anomaly detection algorithms were compared according to their accuracy in forecasting outbreaks: robust covariance, one-class k-means, Gaussian mixture model, kernel density estimation, and one-class support vector machine. A case study of potato late blight survey data from across Great Britain was used for proof of concept. The results showed that Gaussian mixture model had the highest forecast accuracy at 97.0%, followed by one-class k-means at 96.9%. There was added value in combining the algorithms in an ensemble to provide a more accurate and robust forecasting tool that can be tailored to produce region-specific alerts.

For the farming system, LCI information, as shown in the data are averaged from the respective CRDs. LCI data for the post-harvest stages are based on available information from the relevant processing plants and the engineering estimates.

Future scenarios integrate the impact of climate change on the future productivity and evaluate the effect of adaptation measures and technological advancement on the crop yield. The provided data are important to understand the characteristics of the food supply chain, and their relationships with the life cycle environmental impacts.

It has a significant impact on photosynthesis and plant reproduction. Physicochemical characteristics of plants such as leaf N content can be estimated spatially and temporally because of the latest developments in multispectral sensing technology and machine learning (ML) methods. The objective of this study was to use spectral data for leaf N estimation in corn to compare different ML models and find the best-fitted model. Moreover, the performance of vegetation indices (VIs) and spectral wavelengths were compared individually and collectively to determine if combinations of VIs substantially improved the results as compared to the original spectral data. This study was conducted at a Mississippi State University corn field that was divided into 16 plots with four different N treatments (0, 90, 180, and 270 kg ha-1). The bare soil pixels were removed from the multispectral images, and 26 VIs were calculated based on five spectral bands: blue, green, red, red-edge, and near-infrared (NIR). The 26 VIs and five spectral bands obtained from a red-edge multispectral sensor mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were analyzed to develop ML models for leaf %N estimation of corn. The input variables used in these models had the most impact on chlorophyll and N content and high correlation with leaf N content. Eight ML algorithms (random forest, gradient boosting, support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron, ridge regression, lasso regression, and elastic net) were applied to three different categories of variables. The results show that gradient boosting and random forest were the best-fitted models to estimate leaf %N, with about an 80% coefficient of determination for the different categories of variables. Moreover, adding VIs to the spectral bands improved the results. The combination of SCCCI, NDRE, and red-edge had the largest coefficient of determination (R2) in comparison to the other categories of variables used to predict leaf %N content in corn. © 2021 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers","Corn; Gradient boosting; Machine learning; Multispectral imagery; Nitrogen estimation; Random forest; UAV; Vegetation index","Adaptive boosting; Antennas; Decision trees; Infrared devices; Random forests; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Corn; Gradient boosting; Machine learning methods; Multispectral imagery; N content; Nitrogen estimation; Random forests; Red edge; Spectral band; Vegetation index; Nitrogen; bare soil; comparative study; machine learning; maize; multispectral image; NDVI; photosynthesis; soil nitrogen; unmanned vehicle; Mississippi; United States",Article,Scopus

Future climate change can alter long-term hydroclimatic conditions of national forests and grasslands and lead to negative consequences. This study characterizes shifts in hydroclimatology and basin characteristics of US National Forests (NFs) and National Grasslands (NGs) in response to climate change over the 21st century under the DRY, MIDDLE, and WET climate models with the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 emission scenario. Climatic projections for three climate models ranging from the driest to wettest conditions were obtained from the Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) dataset. Then, the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model was used to model hydrological responses of the selected future climates. Changes in regional hydroclimatic conditions of NFs and NGs were assessed by the magnitude and direction of movements in the Budyko space. The Fu’s equation was applied to estimate changes in basin characteristics. The results indicate that NFs and NGs are likely to experience larger changes in basin characteristics compared to the average of the United States. In general, across the conterminous US, the NFs in mountainous regions are likely to have larger changes in hydroclimatic variables than NFs with lower elevation and NGs. Comparing Forest Service regions, Pacific Northwest, Intermountain, and Northern regions may have a less arid climate with lower freshwater availability. The Southwestern, Northern, Intermountain, and Rocky Mountain regions are likely to experience higher shifts in their basin characteristics.

Such a case is the Pinios River delta plain located in central Greece, which also constitutes a significant ecosystem. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and SEAWAT models were combined in order to simulate the impact of current water resources management practices in main groundwater budget components and groundwater salinization of the shallow aquifer developed in the area. Moreover, potential climate change impact was investigated using climate data from Regional Climate Model for two projected periods (2021–2050 and 2071–2100) and two sea level rise scenarios (increase by 0.5 and 1 m). Modeling results are providing significant insight: although the contribution of the river to groundwater inflows is significant, direct groundwater recharge from precipitation was found to be higher, while capillary rise constitutes a major part of groundwater outflows from the aquifer. Moreover, during the simulation period, groundwater flow from the aquifer to the sea were found to be higher than the inflows of seawater to the aquifer. Regarding climate change impact assessment, the results indicate that the variability in groundwater recharge posed by the high variability of precipitation during the projected periods is increasing the aquifer’s deterioration potential of both its quantity and quality status, the latter expressed by the increased groundwater Cl− concentration. This evidence becomes more significant because of the limited groundwater storage capacity of the aquifer. Concerning sea level rise, it was found to be less significant in terms of groundwater salinization impact compared to the decrease in groundwater recharge and increase in crop water needs. © 2021 by the authors.

Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid, as one of the main causes of charcoal rot disease, suppresses the plant productivity significantly. Charcoal rot disease is one of the most severe threats to soybean productivity. Prediction of this disease in soybeans is very tedious and non-practical using traditional approaches. Machine learning (ML) techniques have recently gained substantial traction across numerous domains. ML methods can be applied to detect plant diseases, prior to the full appearance of symptoms. In this paper, several ML techniques were developed and examined for prediction of charcoal rot disease in soybean for a cohort of 2,000 healthy and infected plants. A hybrid set of physiological and morphological features were suggested as inputs to the ML models. All developed ML models were performed better than 90% in terms of accuracy. Gradient Tree Boosting (GBT) was the best performing classifier which obtained 96.25% and 97.33% in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Our findings supported the applicability of ML especially GBT for charcoal rot disease prediction in a real environment.

Thus, in the context of precision agriculture, information on the phenological stage of cultivation can be decisive in accurately estimating agronomic variables through the use of aerial images obtained by RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft System) platforms. Therefore, the aim of this study was: i) to investigate the potential of using RPAS embedded with multispectral sensors in order to obtain data on a soybean irrigated field with a central pivot system ii) to identify the best stage of development of irrigated soybean in order to obtain multispectral images aiming to the yield prediction; iii) to test different vegetation indices (VIs) for estimating the yield of soybean crop using artificial neural networks. The treatments were established using different metric water potentials in the soil and the analysis was comprised by 30 sample units. Multispectral images were acquired through a Sequoia® camera aboard the Phantom 4® Pro platform, during seven phenological crop stages. In addition to the spectral bands, nine VIs were taken as predictors based on the response variables derived from the site survey. The selection of the best growth stage was based on the highest level of association, represented by the Spearman correlation coefficient between predictors and each response variable. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm was used to adjust the predictive model, whose performance was assessed in terms of training and testing. To have independent measurements of the performance of the proposed algorithm was used by k-fold cross-validation. The results obtained from the correlation between the image-derived data and the soybean yield indicate that the ideal monitoring window for irrigated soybean can be found at the end of the vegetative stage (V6). The selection of the phenological crop stage had a positive impact on the predictions. The MLP models showed a good adjustment and good generalization capability. In turn, grain yield was the most complex agronomic parameter for modeling, with correlations of 0.70 and 0.92 for training/testing, and excellent results in other statistical tests, reinforce the great combining capacity between remote sensing via RPAS and machine learning (ML) in applications aimed at precision agriculture. This approach offers a useful tool for evaluating grain yield in center-pivot-irrigated soybean crops and emphasizes the need of observation regarding the phenological crop stage as a factor of analysis in the prediction of grain yield via remote sensing. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Crop yield; Precision agriculture; Predictive modeling; UAV",,Article,Scopus

The study was carried out in commercial maize areas irrigated by central pivots in the western part of the state of Bahia, Brazil. The MOD09GQ product was used to generate input data for the training models and to understand the phenology variations in the crops. The prediction of the dependent variables was tested using six regression algorithms, and the best algorithm was selected based on five statistical metrics. Among the regression models tested, the three that best fit the ETa and SWC data were RF (random forest), cubist (cubist regression), and GBM (gradient boosting machine), with slight superiority of cubist for the ETa and RF for the SWC. The fitted models for ETa and SWC showed the potential of VIs in providing information for irrigated agriculture and reinforcing the ability of regression algorithms in modelling the SWC and ETa variables.

Using LiDAR and imaging sensors mounted on multirotor UAVs, we can observe fine-scale crop variations that can help improve fertilizer management and maximize yields. In this study we used UAV mounted LiDAR and multispectral imaging sensors to monitor two sugarcane field trials with variable nitrogen (N) fertilization inputs in the Wet Tropics region of Australia. From six surveys performed at 42-day intervals, we monitored crop growth in terms of height, density and vegetation indices. In each survey period, we estimated a set of models to predict at-harvest biomass at fine scale (2m×2m plots). We compared the predictive performance of models based on multispectral predictors only, LiDAR predictors only, a fusion of multispectral and LiDAR predictors, and a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) benchmark. We found that predictive performance peaked early in the season, at 100–142 days after the previous harvest (DAH), and declined closer to the harvest date. At peak performance (i.e. 142 DAH), the multispectral model performed slightly better (R¯2=0.57) than the LiDAR model (R¯2=0.52), with both outperforming NDVI benchmark (R¯2=0.34). This, however, flipped later in the season, with LiDAR performing slightly better than the multispectral imaging and NDVI benchmark. Interestingly, the fusion model did not perform significantly better than the multispectral model at 100–142 DAH, nor better than LiDAR in subsequent periods. We also estimated a model to predict contemporaneous leaf N content (%) using multispectral imagery, which demonstrated an R¯2 of 0.57. Our results are of particular interest to nutrient management programs aiming to deliver N fertilizer guidelines for sustainable sugarcane production, as both fine-scale biomass and leaf N content predictions are feasible when management interventions are still possible (i.e. as early as at 100 DAH). © 2020 The Authors","Biomass; Drone; Fertilizer; Fusion; LiDAR; Multispectral; NDVI; Nitrogen; PCA; Sugarcane; UAV; Yield","biomass; crop yield; fertilizer; leaf; lidar; multispectral image; NDVI; nitrogen; prediction; principal component analysis; sugar cane; unmanned vehicle; Australia; Varanidae",Article,Scopus

Data-driven methods are widely used for remote sensing of leaf EWT and LMA because of their simplicity, satisfactory accuracy, and computation efficiency, such as the vegetation indices (VI)-based and machine learning (ML)-based methods. However, most of the data-driven methods are utilized at the canopy level, comparison of the performances of the data-driven methods at the leaf level has not been well documented. Moreover, the ML-based data-driven methods generally adopt leaf optical properties directly as their inputs, which may subsequently decrease their ability in remote sensing of leaf biochemical constituents. Performances of the ML-based methods cooperating with VI are rarely evaluated. Using the independent LOPEX and ANGERS datasets, we compared the performances of three data-driven methods: VI-based, ML-reflectance-based, and ML-VI-based methods, for the estimation of leaf EWT and LMA. Three sampling strategies were also utilized for evaluation of the generalization of these data-driven methods. Our results evidenced that ML-VI-based methods were the most accurate among these data-driven methods. Compared to the ML-reflectance-based and VI-based methods, the ML-VI-based model with support vector regression overall reduced errors by 5.7% (41.5%) and 1.8% (12.4%) for the estimation of leaf EWT (LMA), respectively. The ML-VI-based model inherits advantages of vegetation indices and ML techniques, which made it sensitive to changes of leaf biochemical constituents and capable of solving nonlinear tasks. It is thus recommended for the estimation of EWT and LMA at the leaf level. Moreover, its performance can further be enhanced by improving its generalization ability, such as adopting techniques on the selection of better wavelengths and definition of new vegetation indices. These results thus provided a prior knowledge of the data-driven methods and can be helpful for future studies on the remote sensing of leaf biochemical constituents. © 2020 by the authors.

This research project evaluated the performance of the combination of three Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) approaches in the forecasting of the monthly rainfall anomalies for Southwestern Colombia. For this purpose, we applied the Non-linear Principal Component Analysis (NLPCA) approach to get the main modes, a Neural Network Autoregressive Moving Average with eXogenous variables (NNARMAX) as a model, and an Inverse NLPCA approach for reconstructing the monthly rainfall anomalies forecasting in the Andean Region (AR) and the Pacific Region (PR) of Southwestern Colombia, respectively. For the model, we used monthly rainfall lagged values of the eight large-scale climate indices linked to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon as exogenous variables. They were cross-correlated with the main modes of the rainfall variability of AR and PR obtained using NLPCA. Subsequently, both NNARMAX models were trained from 1983 to 2014 and tested for two years (2015–2016). Finally, the reconstructed outputs from the NNARMAX models were used as inputs for the Inverse NLPCA approach. The performance of the ANN approaches was measured using three different performance metrics: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Pearson’s correlation (r). The results showed suitable forecasting performance for AR and PR, and the combination of these ANN approaches demonstrated the possibility of rainfall forecasting in these sub-regions five months in advance and provided useful information for the decision-makers in Southwestern Colombia. © 2020 by the authors.

Our study quantifies the impact of climate change on food security by combining climate modelling (16 models from CMIP5), crop yield (simulated by agronomic model, SARRA-O) and demographic evolution (provided by UN projection) under two future climatic scenarios. We simulate yield for the main crops in five countries inWest Africa and estimate the population pressure on crop production to assess the number of available cereal production per capita. We found that, although uncertain, the African monsoon evolution leads to an increase of rainfall in Eastern Sahel and a decrease inWestern Sahel under the RCP8.5 (Representative Concentration Pathway) scenario from IPCC, leading to the higher temperature increase by the end of the 21st century.

Datasets used for model calibration or independent evaluation were from diverse conditions in Australia (5 sites) and Brazil (13 sites), and at several of these sites there were treatments for fertilizer, irrigation or genotype. For the calibration and evaluation datasets, model performance was very good for above-ground biomass (Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency, NSE = 0.96 and 0.84 respectively). Notwithstanding this general performance, and as an example, local calibration improved performance in one of the independent test datasets, suggesting that applications of the model for specific sites or clones may benefit from parameterization to local conditions.

The implication for growers of input costs for the different management combinations was evaluated in terms of the extent that costs were recovered (ratio of gross margins to variable costs) and magnitude of variable input costs for gross margins. A regression-tree data-mining approach was used to identify the most profitable and highest yielding combinations of management practices. Environmental conditions (defined here by combinations of date of sowing and ‘perfect knowledge’ of growing season rainfall) had greatest impact on gross margins and few profitable management practices could be identified unless environmental conditions were first accounted for. When crop management practices were tailored to rainfall and sowing date to maximize gross margins, yields were up to 2 Mg ha−1 greater than the average yield achieved by industry. Yield generally increased in response to increasing variable costs but gross margins tended to plateau; after this point higher variable input costs were matched but not exceeded by revenue from increased yield. Gross margins changed in response to individual management factors: for sowing date, gross margins decreased with progressively later sowings from mid-March. For N fertiliser rate in all sowing dates, it was more profitable to use higher N fertiliser rates for higher rainfall deciles, and to use lower N rates as sowing was delayed. Cultivars with slow to medium rates of development were most profitable for early sowings up to the end of April, except where rainfall was low (in low rainfall deciles or for locations in low rainfall zones). Hybrid and conventional open-pollinated cultivars had similar gross margins, which were greater than for the Triazine-tolerant open pollinated cultivar due to its lower yield potential. Selection of most profitable practices was enhanced with knowledge of seasonal rainfall, but time of sowing matched with rate of development and a non-TT-OP cultivar could be selected to maximise gross margins without knowledge of rainfall. Nevertheless, high costs of production may hinder the most profitable selection of management practices. © 2020","APSIM; Gross margins; Rain decile; Regression tree; Sowing date","canola; crop plant; crop production; crop yield; cultivar; environmental conditions; fertilizer; fertilizer application; growing season; management practice; rainfall; sowing date; Brassica napus; Brassica napus var. napus",Article,Scopus

The current study developed models to predict the level of P. truncatus infestation and associated damage of maize grain in smallholder farmer stores. Data were gathered from grain storage trials conducted in Hwedza and Mbire districts of Zimbabwe and correlated with weather data for each site. Insect counts of P. truncatus and other common stored grain insect pests had a strong correlation with time of year with highest recorded numbers from January to May. Correlation analysis showed insect-generated grain dust from boring and feeding activity to be the best indicator of P. truncatus presence in stores (r = 0.70), while a moderate correlation (r = 0.48) was found between P. truncatus numbers and storage insect parasitic wasps, and grain damage levels significantly correlated with the presence of Tribolium castaneum (r = 0.60). Models were developed for predicting P. truncatus infestation and grain damage using parameter selection algorithms and decision-tree machine learning algorithms with 10-fold cross-validation. The P. truncatus population size prediction model performance was weak (r = 0.43) due to the complicated sampling and detection of the pest and eight-week long period between sampling events. The grain damage prediction model had a stronger correlation coefficient (r = 0.93) and is a good estimator for in situ stored grain insect damage. The models were developed for use under southern African climatic conditions and can be improved with more input data to create more precise models for building decision-support tools for smallholder maize-based production systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Decision tree; Decision-support tools; Insect grain damage prediction; Prediction model",,Article,Scopus

However, agricultural applications, such as yield prediction and sowing timing, require seasonal forecast data at high temporal (daily) and spatial (field-scale) resolutions. In this study, a hybrid model was proposed that coupled a global climate model (GloSea5GC2) with a regularized extreme learning machine (RELM) to perform seasonal forecasting (up to 90 days) of daily mean air temperatures at the field scale. Twenty candidate frameworks for the hybrid model were developed by employing different combinations of the transformation scheme, numbers of climate model ensemble members, and learning algorithms. The output blending method was also evaluated. Results showed that the hybrid models demonstrated a good capacity for long-range prediction at the field scale. In particular, the hybrid model (root mean square error, RMSE, 1.02–3.35) demonstrated better predictive skill compared to the climatology model (RMSE 1.61–3.37) at all lead times. When the hybrid model frameworks were compared, the framework which combined centered data with hindcast data, ensemble learning, and the member mean method was the most appropriate. Adopting the centering scheme with hindcast data as RELM input data had the largest influence on hybrid model predictive skill, improving model performance by 3–20% based on RMSE. The output blending method was found to be a suitable alternative when hindcast data were unavailable. The results of this study provide insight into the development of seasonal forecast hybrid models for agro-climatic variables such as minimum and maximum air temperature, relative humidity, and specific humidity at the field scale. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Daily mean air temperature prediction; Downscaling; GloSea5GC2; Long-term prediction; Machine learning","agricultural management; air temperature; climate modeling; decision making; downscaling; global climate; machine learning; prediction; seasonal variation",Article,Scopus

Reflectance in the red-edge bands is sensitive to vegetation status, and its information is thought to be useful in agricultural applications. Based on three red-edge band observations (represented as RE1, RE2, and RE3 for bands 5-7) from the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) onboard the Sentinel-2 satellite, this article aims to investigate the feasibility and performance of using red-edge bands for LAI estimates with the VI method and ground-measured LAI data sets. Sensitivity analysis from PROSAIL simulations revealed that RE1 is mainly affected by the influence of the leaf chlorophyll content, and this uncertainty should not be ignored during LAI estimation. For the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), modified simple ratio (MSR), chlorophyll index (CI), and wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI), the optimal combination of Sentinel-2 bands for LAI estimation was RE2 and RE3, with a minimum root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.75. Four 3-band red-edge VIs were proposed to exploit the full content of the red-edge bands of Sentinel-2, and their performance in LAI estimation improved slightly. However, both 2-band red-edge VIs and 3-band red-edge VIs remained slightly saturated at high LAI levels; therefore, a segmental estimation with a threshold was suggested for large LAIs. The results indicate that the optimal 2-band red-edge VIs and proposed 3-band red-edge VIs are effective tools for crop LAI estimation in multiple-growth stages with Sentinel-2 MSI images. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Leaf area index (LAI); precision agriculture; red-edge; Sentinel-2; vegetation index","Agriculture; Chlorophyll; Mean square error; Precision agriculture; Sensitivity analysis; Superconducting materials; Uncertainty analysis; Leaf Area Index; Leaf chlorophyll content; Multispectral instruments; Normalized difference vegetation index; Red edge; Root mean square errors; Sentinel-2; Vegetation index; Vegetation; chlorophyll; error analysis; estimation method; feasibility study; ground-based measurement; leaf area index; NDVI; performance assessment; precision agriculture; satellite imagery; segmentation; Sentinel",Article,Scopus

Here, we compare four different surface runoff and infiltration partition methods within a Richards-equation-based SWAT model (RSWAT) to understand their effects on watershed modeling. Four surface runoff and infiltration partition methods include a Daily Curve Number method (DCN-RSWAT), a Hourly Curve Number method (HCN-RSWAT), a Green-Ampt method (GA-RSWAT), and an Effective Infiltration Capacity method (EIC-RSWAT). These four versions of RSWAT and a Daily Curve Number based original SWAT (DCN-SWAT) were applied to simulate daily stream flow and baseflow (from 2001 to 2015) at the Tuckahoe Creek Watershed (TCW) and Greensboro Watershed (GW) in Maryland, US. The global sensitivity analysis algorithms within SWAT-CUP was used to identify sensitive parameters, and the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting algorithm version 2 (SUFI-2) was used to analyze uncertainty for different models in both calibration and validation periods. Comparison of the results from different models highlight the sensitivity of watershed modeling to the differences between surface runoff and infiltration partition methods. In general, DCN-RSWAT outperformed other versions of RSWAT and the standard SWAT model with reduced daily flow rate perdition uncertainty and improved simulation of daily baseflow in both test watersheds.

Methods: Based on China's official statistics for the period 2007–2016, this article paper quantifies the health economic loss (i.e., health loss, for short) caused by new cases of CWP using the stepwise model and human capital method. The Bootstrap Information Diffusion Comprehensive Model was utilized to analyze the mean probability, exceeding probability, confidence interval, and expectation level of health loss at different risk levels. Results: (1) The health loss caused by new cases of CWP in China from 2007 to 2016 amounts to approximately 0.579–4.46 billion yuan per year, while the estimated average annual economic loss is about 3 billion yuan, and the average proportion of GDP is around 0.045‰. (2) Both the health loss and the proportion of GDP show a rising volatile trend. Further research examining the risk of health loss revealed that there is a 51.7% probability that the health loss caused by new cases of CWP in China will exceed 3 billion in the future, and that there is approximately an 18.36% probability that health losses will exceed 5 billion. (3) The health losses resulting from new cases of CWP in China will increase further over the next five years. It is conservatively estimated that the health loss arising from new cases of CWP in 2022 will reach 6.762 billion yuan. Conclusion: The warning mechanism should also be established to manage the continuous increase in health losses. © 2019","Bootstrap information diffusion comprehensive model; Coal worker's pneumoconiosis; Health economic loss; Risk assessment","Coal; Health; Losses; Occupational risks; Risk assessment; Comprehensive model; Confidence interval; Economic loss; Health economics; Human capitals; Information diffusion; Official Statistics; Warning mechanisms; Health risks; Article; China; coal worker; confidence interval; health economics; health hazard; hospitalization; human; occupational health; occupational safety; pneumoconiosis; priority journal; probability; productivity; risk assessment",Article,Scopus

This is critical as population, food demand, and background tropospheric ozone are projected to increase over the next several decades. Visual scores of common ozone damage have been used to identify ozone-stress in bio-indicator plants. This paper evaluates the use of a visual scoring metric of ozone damage applied to soybeans. The scoring of the leaves is then combinedwith hyperspectral data to identify spectral indices specific to ozone damage. Two genotypes of soybean, Dwight and Pana, that have shown different sensitivities to ozone, were grown and visually scored for ozone-specific damage on multiple dates throughout the growing season. Leaf reflectance, foliar biophysical properties, and yield data were collected. Additionally, ozone bio-indicator plants, snap beans, and common milkweed, were investigated with visual scores and hyperspectral leaf data for comparison. The normalized difference spectral index (NDSI) was used to identify the significant bands in the visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR) that best correlated with visual damage score when used in the index. Results were then compared to multiple well-established indices. Indices were also evaluated for correlation with seed and pod weight. The ozone damage scoring metric for soybeans evaluated in August had a coefficient of determination of 0.60 with end-of-season pod weight and a Pearson correlation coefficient greater than 0.6 for photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration. NDSI [R558, R563] correlated best with visual scores of ozone damage in soybeans when evaluating data from all observation dates. These wavelengths were similar to those identified as most sensitive to visual damage in August when used in NDSI (560 nm, 563 nm). NDSI [R560, R563] in August had the highest coefficient of determination for individual pod weight (R2 = 0.64) and seed weight (R2 = 0.54) when compared against 21 well-established indices used for identification of pigment or photosynthetic stress in plants. When evaluating use of spectral bands in NDSI, longer wavelengths in SWIR were identified as more sensitive to ozone visual damage. Trends in the bands and biophysical properties of the soybeans combined with evaluation of ozone data indicate likely timing of significant ozone damage as after late-July for this season. This work has implications for better spectral detection of ozone stress in crops and could help with efforts to identify ozone tolerant varieties to increase future yield. © 2019 by the authors.","Ambient ozone; Hyperspectral data; Soybean; Visual damage scoring","Correlation methods; Crops; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Plants (botany); Seed; Ambient ozones; Biophysical properties; Coefficient of determination; Hyperspectral Data; Normalized differences; Pearson correlation coefficients; Soybean; Visual damage scoring; Ozone",Article,Scopus

The objective of this study was to generate the wheat suitability index (WSI) by using hybrid system that is including qualitative and quantitative reasons such as expert and sciencific knowledge weighted with analytic hierarchy process (AHP). This aproach was integrated into the GIS based on Linear Combination Teqnique in the study. For this purpose, the study was conducted in the field of wheat cultivation in Soğulca Basin with an area of 68.04 km2 located on Central Anatolia Region of Turkey. We have selected 10 criteria as physical, chemical and topographical that affects wheat cultivation in the basin which has been divided into 47 land units according to thematic soil map. With the WSI model, 32.05% of the study area was classified as highly and moderately suitable whereas, 67.95% of the total study area has marginally and not suitable properties for wheat cultivation. According to results, the most effective factors on the last score values for WSI were found soil depth, texture and slope indicators. The score values of the WSI were compared with 5 years (2013–2017) yields and NDVI values for testing of the model and it has been determined that land classification for wheat has been done with high accuracy for yield r2 = 0.83% and for NDVI r2 = 0.78%. The results of the study showed that the WSI was found as convenient model in semi-arid climate condition. However, we suggest that the WSI model should also be tested in similar climatic conditions and in different soil types in order to be available as a general - pass index.

The harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) algorithm is a widely used technique to reconstruct missing NDVI time series. However, due to restriction of HANTS to act within temporal dimension, its direct application is bound to endure practical problems in spatiotemporal reconstruction due to large data gaps. This study proposes Moving Offset Method (MOM), a novel prefilling method applied on NDVI time series prior to application of HANTS. MOM restores the missing NDVI time series by assuming that it tends to follow a reference pattern of land surface phenology (NDVIref). The NDVIref is prepared by using a recursive search and fill algorithm (SFA) for data availability without null values. It restores null values in NDVIref at a pixel by using coefficients of linear regression with NDVIref at another pixel having identical conditions. Finally, the prefilling is prior to application of HANTS. The proposed approach is demonstrated by using MODIS 16-daily time series data for Northeast India and Bhutan region which is covered with frequent seasonal clouds. Besides direct application of HANTS, it is also compared with similar approaches which includes prefilling by inverse distance weighted (IDW) and cubic spline, prior to application of HANTS. The fitting indicators, overall reconstruction error (ORE) and normalized noise related error (NNRE) are found to be best for proposed approach in spatiotemporal comparison. Also, restoration of seasonality trait the NDVI time series better in the proposed approach. This approach is concluded to be an enhancement for HANTS that could be helpful in improving quality of NDVI reconstruction for regions with frequent seasonal obstructions around the globe. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","HANTS; land surface phenology; NDVI; time series reconstruction","algorithm; harmonic analysis; MODIS; NDVI; phenology; satellite data; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis; time series analysis",Article,Scopus

Then the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the new BMP cost tool were integrated to explore efficiencies and cost-effectiveness of BMPs in an agricultural catchment of the Maumee River watershed with various scenarios.

Designed system explores integrated application of remote sensing (RS) sciences and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology. Terra MODIS 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maximum value composite (MVC) image product MOD13A1 of 500 m spatial resolution covering Bangladesh have been utilized for a period 2011–2017. Hence the district-wise sum of NDVI on pixel-by-pixel has been calculated from Jan–April during 2011–2017. Regression analysis between district-based pixel-wise summation of MODIS-NDVI and district-wise BBS (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics) estimated Boro production revealed strong correlation (R2 = 0.57–0.85) where in March most of the regression coefficient shows significant correlation due to maximize photosynthetic activities. Therefore, the highest regression coefficient value from derived set of coefficient value (BCP-Boro Crop Production Model 2) has been utilized to obtain year-wise rice productions for all the years (2011–2017). Global Positioning System (GPS)-based field verification, accuracy assessment and validation operation have been carried out at randomly selected geographical positions over the country using various statistical tools. The results demonstrate good agreement between estimated and predicted yearly Boro rice production during 2011–2017 time period with Mean Bias Error (MBE) = −29,881 to 19,431 M.Ton; Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 5238 to 11,852 M.Ton; Model Efficiency (ME) = (0.86–0.94); Correlation Coefficients = 0.65 to 0.87.

In this study, we used remote sensing data to calibrate a regional crop model (MCWLA-Rice) for yield simulation in a double-rice crop rotation system in counties of Hunan province dominated by three landforms (plain, hill, and mountain). The calibration scheme with coarse remote sensing data (Global LAnd Surface Satellite, GLASS) greatly improved model accuracy for the double-rice system and is a promising method for yield estimation in large areas. The average improvement in relative root mean square error (RRMSE) was at most 48.00% for early rice and 41.25% for late rice. The average improvement in coefficient of determination (R2) value was at most 0.54 for early rice and 0.19 for late rice. Estimation of yield in counties dominated by different landform types indicated that: (1) MCWLA-Rice tended to be unstable in areas of complex topography and resulted in unbalanced proportions of overestimations and underestimations. (2) Differences in yield simulation between early rice and late rice varied among counties; yield estimates were highest in predominantly hilly counties, followed by counties dominated by plains, and lowest in predominantly mountainous counties. The results indicated that the topography might harm the accuracy of crop model simulations. Integration of topographic factors into crop models may enable yield estimation with enhanced accuracy to promote social development. © 2019 by the authors.","Crop model; Double rice; Landform; MCWLA; Remote sensing; Topography","Chemical contamination; Crops; Food supply; Landforms; Mean square error; Topography; Calibration schemes; Coefficient of determination; Complex topographies; Crop model; Double rice; Global land surface; MCWLA; Root mean square errors; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

Electrical conductivity (EC) is expected to correlate with the pertinent factors that regulate the crop yield (i.e., soil texture, cation exchange, drainage conditions, organic matter level, salinity, and the subsoil characteristics), which in turn, can also acts to control the overall health of the crop. Utilizing a fast and efficient artificial intelligence approach, this study designs a hybrid predictive model integrating multilayer perceptron with the Firefly Algorithm (MLP-FFA), and then evaluates its performance in respect to the standalone MLP and the ordinary kriging (OK) model applied in agricultural locality of the Soofiyan, plains in Tabriz, northwest of Iran. To develop a spatial modelling framework, 126 distinct measurements of EC were obtained through a grid sampled at 1000 m × 1000 m spacing, partitioned in training (88) and testing (38) sets. Applying a ratio of nugget to sill to determine the spatial dependence, a spatial modelling strategy was utilized where the spherical, exponential, Gaussian and linear semi-variograms depicting the autocorrelation of the sampled points (latitude × longitude) over the study area were analyzed in ArcGIS to deduce the optimal data characteristics and the respective statistical model. Spherical semi-variogram was the optimal representor for EC, relative to its latitude and longitude, in agreement with the lowest Residual Sums of Squares (RSS) and the highest coefficient of determination (R2). Hybrid MLP-FFA and standalone MLP models were thus developed with latitude, longitude and measured electrical conductivity in the training set and evaluated in respect to the OK method by means of statistical scores: root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) including the normalized metrics represented by Willmott's Index (WI), Nash Sutcliffe's coefficient (ENS) and Legates &amp; McCabe's Index (ELM). Verified by diagnostic plots and grid-averaged metrics, the results revealed that the hybrid MLP-FFA model performed significantly better than both comparative models, with WI = 0.780 relative to 0.637 (MLP) and 0.714 (OK) models and ENS = 0.725 (vs. 0.511 &amp; 0.589) and ELM = 0.552 (vs. 0.402 &amp; 0.413), respectively. Expanded uncertainty, t-statistic and global performance indicators combining the R2, RMSE and mean bias error and a Taylor plot also confirmed the efficacy of the hybrid MLP-FFA over the standalone MLP and OK model. There was no significant difference between the results of standalone MLP and OK when evaluated through spatial trend maps, while the hybrid MLP-FFA model exhibited a better ability to establishing nonlinear relationships with electrical conductivity data, resulting in a better representation of the spatially modelled EC. Our results ascertain the prodigious performance of a hybrid MLP-FFA over a standalone MLP and ordinary kriging approaches, attributable to a better utility of the Firefly algorithm in improved spatial estimation of electrical conductivity. This study concludes that the hybrid MLP-FFA model should be explored to solve practical problems in soil physics, particularly in designing decision-support systems to attain agricultural precision. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Electrical conductivity; Firefly algorithm; Spatial estimation","Artificial intelligence; Bioluminescence; Crops; Decision support systems; Electric conductivity; Errors; Expert systems; Interpolation; Mean square error; Optimization; Soil mechanics; Coefficient of determination; Electrical conductivity; Firefly algorithms; Non-linear relationships; Proximal soil sensing; Root mean square errors; Soil electrical conductivity; Spatial estimation; Soils; ArcGIS; artificial intelligence; autocorrelation; bulk density; crop yield; electrical conductivity; kriging; soil analysis; soil chemistry; soil organic matter; spatial analysis; East Azerbaijan; Iran; Tabriz",Article,Scopus

In addition to the important annual costs to control this pest nationwide, effort, cost and time are spent surveying and spotting O. lybicus infestations. Several studies have indicated the possibility of using remote sensing technology to identify plants stressed by pest infestation. The aim of the present study is to detect O. lybicus infestations by quantifying reflectance changes of different infestation levels and calculating different vegetation indices (VIs) using high-resolution multispectral (MS) images. An image of an area with different sub-locations that had varying levels of infestation was acquired in March 2017 using the WorldView-3 satellite. The reflectance of 8 bands, 32 spectral VIs and maximum likelihood classification (MLC) were derived from the image, and then the correlation was tested using ground-infestation data. The results revealed that the reflectance decreased in the red edge and near-infrared (NIR) bands as the infestation level increased. High levels of infestation showed a significant difference in three bands, red edge, NIR1 and NIR2, compared to no, low and medium levels of infestation. Nineteen out of 32 VIs showed a significant relation with the infestation levels. The relation ranged between r = −0.12, p < 0.05 using the Normalized Difference Mud Index (NDMI) and r = −0.39, p < 0.000 using the Transformed Difference Vegetation Index (TDVI)) and Tasselled Cap – Non - Such Index (TC-NSI). The location affected the relation between the infestation and VIs, where the correlation coefficients increased. The maximum correlation found was r = 0.64 using the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI) in Al'Ayn Village.

However, as soil is characterized by substantial spatial variability and temporal dynamics, its contribution to the spectral reflectance of crops will also vary. The aim of the research was to determine the impact of soil background on spectral reflectance of crop canopy in visible and near-infrared parts of the spectrum at different stages of crop development and how the soil type factor and the dynamics of soil surface affect vegetation indices calculated for crop assessment. The study was conducted on three test plots with winter wheat located in the Tula region of Russia and occupied by three contrasting types of soil. During field trips, information was collected on the spectral reflectance of winter wheat crop canopy, winter wheat leaves, weeds and open soil surface for three phenological phases (tillering, shooting stage, milky ripeness). The assessment of the soil contribution to the spectral reflectance of winter wheat crop canopy was based on a linear spectral mixture model constructed from field data. This showed that the soil background effect is most pronounced in the regions of 350-500 nm and 620-690 nm. In the shooting stage, the contribution of the soil prevails in the 620-690 nm range of the spectrum and the phase of milky ripeness in the region of 350-500 nm. The minimum contribution at all stages of winter wheat development was observed at wavelengths longer than 750 nm. The degree of soil influence varies with soil type. Analysis of variance showed that normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was least affected by soil type factor, the influence of which was about 30%-50%, depending on the stage of winter wheat development. The influence of soil type on soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) was approximately equal and varied from 60% (shooting phase) to 80% (tillering phase). According to the discriminant analysis, the ability of vegetation indices calculated for winter wheat crop canopy to distinguish between winter wheat crops growing on different soil types changed from the classification accuracy of 94.1% (EVI2) in the tillering stage to 75% (EVI2 and SAVI) in the shooting stage to 82.6% in the milky ripeness stage (EVI2, SAVI, NDVI). The range of the sensitivity of the vegetation indices to the soil background depended on soil type. The indices showed the greatest sensitivity on gray forest soil when the wheat was in the phase of milky ripeness, and on leached chernozem when the wheat was in the tillering phase. The observed patterns can be used to develop vegetation indices, invariant to second-type soil variations caused by soil type factor, which can be applied for the remote assessment of the state of winter wheat crops. © 2019 by the authors.","Arable soils; EVI2; NDVI; SAVI; Spectral reflectance; Triticum aestivum; Winter wheat","Crops; Discriminant analysis; Infrared devices; Mixtures; Reflection; Vegetation; Arable soils; EVI2; NDVI; SAVI; Spectral reflectances; Triticum aestivum; Winter wheat; Soils",Article,Scopus

Irrigated stream-aquifer systems present a unique challenge in this effort, due to complex groundwater-surface water interactions and the high level of human intervention in managing irrigation practices. This paper has two objectives: first, to detail a method for constructing and applying a coupled SWAT-MODFLOW to irrigated stream-aquifer systems; and second, to use the model to quantify the effects of decreasing irrigation on hydrological responses and crop yield. The method is applied to a 734 km2 study region in the Lower Arkansas River Valley, an alluvial valley in Colorado, USA, which has been intensively irrigated for over 100 years and is threatened by shallow water tables. Therefore, a reduction in applied irrigation amounts has the double benefit of conserving water and decreasing waterlogging, given that crop yield can be maintained for food production. The results indicate that an approximate 10% decrease in total applied irrigation water results in decreases of 6% in surface runoff, 8% in evapotranspiration, and 4% in recharge water. It also results in an increase of 4% in groundwater return flow to the Arkansas River, and an actual increase in groundwater levels due to the decrease in groundwater pumping, pointing to the need for targeted irrigation reduction strategies to decrease waterlogging occurrence. The irrigation reduction yields an average 9% decrease in corn and alfalfa yield. This modeling approach is in general transferable to other similar irrigated river valleys. © 2019 by the authors.","Crop yield; Groundwater-surface water interactions; Hydrological response; Intensively irrigation; Modeling; SWAT-MODFLOW","Aquifers; Crops; Groundwater resources; Irrigation; Landforms; Models; Water management; Water supply; Crop yield; Ground water-surface water interactions; Hydrological response; Irrigation practices; Lower arkansas river valleys; Shallow water tables; Swat-modflow; Water management strategies; Rivers; alfalfa; aquifer; crop yield; groundwater resource; groundwater-surface water interaction; irrigation system; maize; pumping; river water; shallow water; soil and water assessment tool; water use efficiency; waterlogging; Arkansas Valley; Colorado; United States; Medicago sativa; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Therefore, optimum rates and timing of resource applications, such as nutrients and irrigation water, may vary as well. It remains a challenge to quantify the spatial variability of a field and to identify effective ways to manage fields in a site-specific manner. The objective of this study was to delineate management zones within a farmer’s field based on relatively easily obtainable information that is statistically integrated. Moreover, soil water temporal dynamics should be evaluated regarding their spatial differences in different zones. The set of direct and indirect observations included clay and silt content, apparent electrical conductivity, soil chemical properties (pH; organic matter; and total N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Zn), satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and lidar-based topographic variables in a western Kentucky field. Several key variables and their capability to describe spatial crop yield variability were identified by using principal component analysis: soil clay content, slope, soil organic matter content, topographic wetness index, and NDVI. Two types of cluster analysis were applied to delineate management zones. The cluster analyses revealed that two to three zones was the optimal number of classes based on different criteria. Delineated zones were evaluated and revealed significant differences in corn (Zea mays L.) yield and temporally different soil moisture dynamics.

This study aimed to provide an effective, fast, and non-destructive monitoring method of soil plant analysis development (SPAD) values, which can represent leaf chlorophyll contents, for late-sown winter wheat variety screening. This study acquired multispectral images using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) at the overwintering stage of winter wheat growth, and further processed these images to extract reflectance of five single spectral bands and calculated 26 spectral vegetation indices. Based on these 31 variables, this study combined three variable selection methods (i.e., recursive feature elimination (RFE), random forest (RF), and Pearson correlation coefficient (r)) with four machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forest regression (RFR), linear kernel-based support vector regression (SVR), radial basis function (RBF) kernel-based SVR, and sigmoid kernel-based SVR), resulted in seven SVR models (i.e., RFE-SVR_linear, RF-SVR_linear, RF-SVR_RBF, RF-SVR_sigmoid, r-SVR_linear, r-SVR_RBF, and r-SVR_sigmoid) and three RFR models (i.e., RFE-RFR, RF-RFR, and r-RFR). The performances of the 10 machine learning models were evaluated and compared with each other according to the achieved coefficient of determination (R2), residual prediction deviation (RPD), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative RMSE (RRMSE) in SPAD estimation. Of the 10 models, the best one was the RF-SVR_sigmoid model, which was the combination of the RF variable selection method and the sigmoid kernel-based SVR algorithm.

In this study, we improved the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to explicitly consider the thermal processes influencing the temperature of various terrestrial water components (i.e., surface runoff, lateral flow, and base flow) and the heat balance of water in streams. The improved SWAT model with an explicit heat balance description on both terrestrial and aquatic thermal processes (SWAT-HB) was compared with previous versions of the SWAT model that employ only empirical relationships between air temperature and stream temperature (SWAT-ER) or combine empirical terrestrial water temperature estimates with the heat balance of stream water (SWAT-EH) for the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) and Greensboro Watershed (GW) in the United States. The results show that, even though the SWAT-HB better simulates terrestrial thermal processes, all three models produce comparable simulations of long-term stream temperatures, indicating that stream temperature is mainly influenced by air temperature as water travels along large rivers. Nevertheless, the SWAT-HB and SWAT-EH models achieved better performance than the SWAT-ER model in the winter and spring but exhibited mixed performance in the summer and fall. The better model performance of the SWAT-HB model than the SWAT-EH model can be attributed to the improved estimation of terrestrial water temperature components. Although, empirical methods (e.g., SWAT-ER) are suitable for providing estimation of stream temperature, the coupled terrestrial and aquatic heat balance-based methods (e.g., SWAT-HB) allow for the consideration of land and water management practices (e.g. crop irrigation, land use change, and water use for thermoelectric cooling) effects on stream temperature. © 2021","Heat balance; Stream temperature; Upper Mississippi River; Watershed modeling","Aquatic ecosystems; Atmospheric temperature; Indicators (chemical); Rivers; Runoff; Specific heat; Water management; Water quality; Watersheds; Heat balance; Mississippi river; Soil and Water assessment tools; Stream temperatures; Thermal process; Tool models; Upper Mississippi; Upper mississippi river; Water temperatures; Watershed modelling; Land use; aquatic ecosystem; mountain stream; soil and water assessment tool; stream; streamwater; terrestrial ecosystem; water quality; watershed; Indicator indicator",Article,Scopus

Producing these maps at detailed scales requires exhaustive field surveys that can be laborious, time-consuming, and expensive to replicate. With a growing archive of remote sensing data, there are enormous opportunities to exploit dense satellite image time series (SITS), temporal sequences of images over the same area. Generally, crop type mapping relies on single-sensor inputs and is solved with the help of traditional learning algorithms such as random forests or support vector machines. Nowadays, deep learning techniques have brought significant improvements by leveraging information in both spatial and temporal dimensions, which are relevant in crop studies. The concurrent availability of Sentinel-1 (synthetic aperture radar) and Sentinel-2 (optical) data offers a great opportunity to utilize them jointly; however, optimizing their synergy has been understudied with deep learning techniques. In this work, we analyze and compare three fusion strategies (input, layer, and decision levels) to identify the best strategy that optimizes optical-radar classification performance. They are applied to a recent architecture, notably, the pixel-set encoder–temporal attention encoder (PSE-TAE) developed specifically for object-based classification of SITS and based on self-attention mechanisms. Experiments are carried out in Brittany, in the northwest of France, with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series. Input and layer-level fusion competitively achieved the best overall F-score surpassing decision-level fusion by 2%. On a per-class basis, decision-level fusion increased the accuracy of dominant classes, whereas layer-level fusion improves up to 13% for minority classes. Against single-sensor baseline, multi-sensor fusion strategies identified crop types more accurately: for example, input-level outperformed Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 by 3% and 9% in F-score, respectively.

The underpinnings are long-established probability surveys reliant on farmers’ feedback in parallel with biophysical measurements. Over the last decade though, satellite imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has been used to corroborate the survey information. This is facilitated through the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies/Global Agricultural Monitoring system, which provides open access to pertinent real-time normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Hence, two relatively straightforward MODIS-based modeling methods are employed operationally. The first model constitutes mid-season timing based on the maximum peak NDVI value, while the second is reflective of late-season timing by integrating accumulated NDVI over a threshold value. Corn model results nationally show the peak NDVI method provides a R2 of 0.88 and a coefficient of variation (CV) of 3.5%. The accumulated method, using an optimally derived 0.58 NDVI threshold, improves the performance to 0.93 and 2.7%, respectively. Both these models outperform simple trend analysis, which is 0.48 and 7.4%, correspondingly. For soybeans the R2 results of the peak NDVI model are 0.62, and 0.73 for the accumulated using a 0.56 threshold. CVs are 6.8% and 5.7%, respectively. Spring wheat’s R2 performance with the accumulated NDVI model is 0.60 but just 0.40 with peak NDVI. The soybean and spring wheat models perform similarly to trend analysis. Winter wheat and upland cotton show poor model performance, regardless of method.

This study aims to model the Water Footprint (WF) by using the four kernels of Gaussian processes models (Polynomial, Normalized Poly, Radial Basis Function RBF, and Pearson Universal Function PUK) and select the best kernel with best climate scenario. This study investigates the predicting WF of maize based on meteorological variables including maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), mean temperature (Tmean), solar radiation (SR), wind speed (WS), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), Extraterrestrial radiation (Ra) relative humidity (RH) and crop coefficient (Kc) by applying ten scenarios of climate variables in the Egyptian Nile Delta, Ad Daqahliyah Governorate for predicting blue WF of maize during 2000–2019. The main findings are following as, firstly; based on developing four kernels, the performance of the PUK kernel in predicting blue WF is far better than the other three kernels followed by the Poly kernel. Secondly; for PUK kernel, model 7 (Tmax, Tmin, Tmean, WS, Sunshine Hours (SH), VPD and SR) has good performance which is close to models 8 (model 7 + Ra), model 9 (model 7 + Ra and RH) and model 10 (all inputs). Thirdly; in all four kernels, the error rate in small blue WF values is higher than the other values, moreover, the error value decreases at the medium blue WF values, while, it increases again at large WF values. Therefore, the developed models in this study can help and promote the decision makers to manage and secure the water resources management under the extreme climate events. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Blue water footprint; CROPWAT; Gaussian processes; Machine learning; Maize; PUK kernel","Climate models; Decision making; Food supply; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Learning systems; Radial basis function networks; Water resources; Wind; Blue water; Blue water footprint; CROPWAT; Gaussian Processes; Machine-learning; Maize; Performance; PUK kernel; Vapor pressure deficit; Water footprint; Gaussian noise (electronic); climate change; Gaussian method; mitigation; regression analysis; risk assessment; vapor pressure; water footprint; water use efficiency; Daqahliya; Egypt; Nile Delta",Article,Scopus

Consequently, it substantially affects Land Surface Temperature (LST) by unbalancing the surface energy budget. Higher LST in city areas decreases human thermal comfort for the city dwellers and affects the urban environment and ecosystem. Therefore, a comprehensive investigation is needed to evaluate the impact of land use change on the LST. Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques were used for the detailed investigation. RS data for the years 1993, 2007 and 2020 during summer (March–May) in Dhaka city were used to prepare land cover maps, analyze LST, generate hazard maps and relate the land cover change with LST by using GIS. The results show that the built-up area in Dhaka city increased by 67% from 1993 to 2020 by replacing lowland mainly, followed by vegetation, bare soil and water bodies. LSTs found in the study area were ranged from 23.26 to 39.94 °C, 23.69 to 43.35 °C and 24.44 to 44.58 °C for the years 1993, 2007 and 2020, respectively. The increases of spatially distributed maximum and mean LST were found 4.62 °C and 6.43 °C, respectively, for the study period of 27 years while the change in minimum LST was not substantial. LST increased by around 0.24 °C per year and human thermal discomfort shifted from moderate to strong heat stress for the total study period due to the increase of built-up and bare lands. This study also shows that normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) were negatively correlated with LST while normalized difference built-up Index (NDBI) and normalized difference built-up Index (NDBAI) were positively correlated with LST.

Rice farmers, policymakers and other stakeholders thus need to understand and manage the risks associated with climate variability, including those related to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) – the most important source of variability affecting Colombian climates. The objectives of this study were to (1) assess the ENSO influence on the spatio-temporal variability of agro-climatic conditions (crop water requirements, dry and wet spells, and heatwaves) and rice yield across the central producing region of Colombia; and (2) identify the main agro-climatic factors driving crop yield variability. Results showed that rice irrigation water requirements under positive ENSO phases (El Niño) increased by up to 14% compared to the long-term average. These increases were associated with less total precipitation, more dry days and longer dry spells, together with a greater number of day-and-night heatwave episodes. During negative phases (La Niña), on the other hand, irrigation requirements decreased by 16% with respect to the long-term average due to longer and more frequent wet spells, and more total precipitation. Analyses of simulated yields indicated that El Niño years reduce crop yield in about 86% of the study region, while La Niña affects 62% of the region positively. The number of heat nights (i.e. nights with minimum temperature > 23°C) during the growing season was the most important agro-climatic factor causing yield losses during ENSO events. Our results represent an important step towards understanding the interaction between climate variability and rice production in Colombia, which is useful for improving climate risk management at local levels. © 2021","Agro-climatic indices; Climate risk; Colombia; El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO); La Niña; Simulated rice yield","crop production; crop yield; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; environmental factor; heat wave; policy making; rice; spatiotemporal analysis; stakeholder; Colombia",Article,Scopus

The soil's inherent nutrients or physiochemical properties help the researchers better understand the soil ecosystem dynamics and play a crucial role in guiding farmland decision-makers in their routine decisions. Therefore, the accurate forecasting of soil leads to improved and better soil health management (SHM). The recent advances in sensing and computational technologies have led to the expanding accessibility of farmland data either obtained distantly or proximally. The increasing availability of massive data and unreservedly accessible open-source algorithms have prompted a quickened use of machine learning (ML) procedures to investigate soil conditions. Therefore, to understand the usage of ML techniques in exploring soil properties and related applications, this paper concentrates on reviewing and analyzing ML techniques precisely to predict and assess soil properties for improved decisions on agricultural SHM. The article also explores various other vital factors like algorithms, implementation tools, and performance metrics employed in numerous soil assessment application domains and different challenges and future research directions for SHM using ML techniques. The detailed assessment concludes that the response for ML in the prediction and evaluation of soil properties for SHM is very promising for the sustainable growth of agriculture. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural robots; Agronomy; Decision making; Farms; Forecasting; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Agriculture productions; Complex natural resources; Computational technology; Future research directions; Machine learning methods; Physio-chemical properties; Prediction and assessments; Quantitative evaluation; Soils",Conference Paper,Scopus

This study provides a comprehensive step by step modelling approach for a small agricultural watershed using the SWAT model. The watershed is situated in Petzenkirchen in the western part of Lower Austria and has total area of 66 hectares. At present, 87% of the catchment area is arable land, 5% is used as pasture, 6% is forested and 2% is paved. The calibration approach involves a sequential calibration of the model starting from surface runoff, and groundwater flow, followed by crop yields and then soil moisture, and finally total streamflow and sediment yields. Calibration and validation are carried out using the r-package SWATplusR. The impact of each calibration step on sediment yields and total streamflow is evaluated. The results of this approach are compared with those of the conventional model calibration approach, where all the parameters governing various hydrological processes are calibrated simultaneously. Results showed that the model was capable of successfully predicting surface runoff, groundwater flow, soil profile water content, total streamflow and sediment yields with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of greater than 0.75. Crop yields were also well simulated with a percent bias (PBIAS) ranging from −17% to 14%. Surface runoff calibration had the highest impact on streamflow output, improving NSE from 0.39 to 0.77. The step-wise calibration approach performed better for streamflow prediction than the simultaneous calibration approach. The results of this study show that the step-wise calibration approach is more accurate, and provides a better representation of different hydrological components and processes than the simultaneous calibration approach. © 2021 by the authors.

However, it is quite challenging to map crops accurately by high-resolution remote sensing images because of the ecological gradient and ecological convergence between crops and non-crops. The purpose of this study is to explore the combining application of high-resolution multi-temporal Sentinel-1 (S1) radar backscatter and Sentinel-2 (S2) optical reflectance images for maize mapping in highly complex and heterogeneous landscapes in the middle reaches of Heihe River, northwest China. We proposed a new two-step method of vegetation extraction and followed by maize extraction, that is, extract the vegetation-covered areas first to reduce the inter-class variance by using a Random Forest (RF) classifier based on S2 data, and then extract the maize distribution in the vegetation area by using another RF classifier based on S1 and/or S2 data. The results demonstrate that the vegetation extraction classifier successfully identified vegetation-covered regions with an overall accuracy above 96% in the study area, and the accuracy of the maize extraction classifier constructed by the combined multi-temporal S1 and S2 images is significantly improved compared with that S1 (alone) or S2 (alone), with an overall accuracy of 87.63%, F1_Score of 0.86, and Kappa coefficient of 0.75.

Several studies have demonstrated the excellent capability of radar and optical imagery for crop mapping and biophysical parameter estimation. This paper aims at modeling the crop biophysical parameters, e.g., Leaf Area Index (LAI) and biomass, using a combination of radar and optical Earth observations. We extracted several radar features from polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and Vegetation Indices (VIs) from optical images to model crops’ LAI and dry biomass. Then, the mutual correlations between these features and Random Forest feature importance were calculated. We considered two scenarios to estimate crop parameters. First, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, e.g., Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), were utilized to estimate two crop biophysical parameters. To this end, crops’ dry biomass and LAI were estimated using three input data; (1) SAR polarimetric features; (2) spectral VIs; (3) integrating both SAR and optical features. Second, a deep artificial neural network was created. These input data were fed to the mentioned algorithms and evaluated using the in-situ measurements. These observations of three cash crops, including soybean, corn, and canola, have been collected over Manitoba, Canada, during the Soil Moisture Active Validation Experimental 2012 (SMAPVEX-12) campaign. The results showed that GB and XGB have great potential in parameter estimation and remarkably improved accuracy. Our results also demonstrated a significant improvement in the dry biomass and LAI estimation compared to the previous studies. For LAI, the validation Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was reported as 0.557 m2 /m2 for canola using GB, and 0.298 m2 /m2 for corn using GB, 0.233 m2 /m2 for soybean using XGB. RMSE was reported for dry biomass as 26.29 g/m2 for canola utilizing SVR, 57.97 g/m2 for corn using RF, and 5.00 g/m2 for soybean using GB. The results revealed that the deep artificial neural network had a better potential to estimate crop parameters than the ML algorithms. © 2021 by the authors.

This study investigated the use of remotely sensed phenology, climate data and machine learning for estimating yield at a resolution suitable for optimising crop management in fields. We used spatially weighted growth curve estimation to identify the timing of phenological events from sequences of Landsat NDVI and derive phenological and seasonal climate metrics. Using data from a 17,000 ha study area, we investigated the relationships between the metrics and yield over 17 years from 2003 to 2019. We compared six statistical and machine learning models for estimating yield: multiple linear regression, mixed effects models, generalised additive models, random forests, support vector regression using radial basis functions and deep learning neural networks. We used a 50-50 train-test split on pad-dock-years where 50% of paddock-year combinations were randomly selected and used to train each model and the remaining 50% of paddock-years were used to assess the model accuracy. Using only phenological metrics, accuracy was highest using a linear mixed model with a random effect that allowed the relationship between integrated NDVI and yield to vary by year (R = 0.67, MAE = 0.25 t ha−1, RMSE = 0.33 t ha−1, NRMSE = 0.25). We quantified the improvements in accuracy when seasonal climate metrics were also used as predictors. We identified two optimal models using the combined phenological and seasonal climate metrics: support vector regression and deep learning models (R = 0.68, MAE = 0.25 t ha−1, RMSE = 0.32 t ha−1, NRMSE = 0.25). While the linear mixed model using only phenological metrics performed similarly to the nonlinear models that are also seasonal climate metrics, the nonlinear models can be more easily generalised to estimate yield in years for which training data are unavailable. We conclude that long-term hindcasts of wheat yield in fields, at 30 m spatial resolution, can be produced using remotely sensed phenology from Landsat NDVI, climate data and machine learning. © 2021 by the authors.

SIF-based primary productivity metrics have demonstrated higher fidelity to large-scale patterns of crop productivity than reflectance-based vegetation indices when averaged across the growing season. In-season crop yield forecasting typically relies upon reflectance-based vegetation indices, raising the question of whether in-season monitoring could be improved by utilizing SIF. Here, we analyze patterns of US agricultural productivity from USDA surveys and their in-season relationships with coarse-resolution GOME-2 SIF, high-resolution downscaled SIF, SIF-based primary productivity metrics, MODIS NDVI, and MODIS GPP. We find that coarse-resolution SIF-based metrics and NDVI exhibit similar out-of-sample in-season (April–July and April–August) predictive ability, even when spatially filtering higher-resolution NDVI data to cropland areas. The downscaled SIF product performed more poorly than the coarse-resolution SIF, and MODIS GPP performed more poorly than MODIS NDVI. All forecasts are improved by incorporating county fixed effects to control for cross-sectional differences between counties. NDVI-based metrics allow for significantly better yield predictions during drought conditions than SIF-based metrics, suggesting limited added value of SIF for early warning of drought impacts. The benefits of SIF for crop monitoring should be continually evaluated as the frequency and quality of SIF measurements continue to improve. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Crop forecasting; Crop productivity; GOME-2; NDVI; SIF; Solar-induced fluorescence","Chlorophyll; Crops; Drought; Forecasting; Forestry; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Quality control; Radiometers; Reflection; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Coarser resolution; Crop forecasting; Crop productivity; GOME-2; NDVI; Primary productivity; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Solar-induced fluorescences; Vegetation index; Fluorescence; chlorophenol; chlorophyll; crop production; crop yield; fluorescence; forecasting method; MODIS; NDVI; United States",Article,Scopus

Population growth and the increasing demand of resources will exacerbate these impacts. Focusing on rainfed maize production, we evaluate the socio-ecological risk that municipalities currently face and how climate change could modify it. Municipalities were classified based on their biophysical and socioeconomic traits like temperature, precipitation, population, gross domestic product, marginalization, and agricultural subsidies. The study identifies municipalities that would face higher risk under climate change conditions, and it evaluates whether increases in agricultural subsidies could be effective for reducing the farmers' future risk. Our results show that during the 2010's, 36.8% of the municipalities and 15% of the population were at very high and high risk, respectively. By 2070, under a high-warming scenario these figures increase to 56.5 and 18.5%. We find that a generalized augment in agricultural subsidies is not enough to compensate for the effects of climate change on the socio-ecological risk of rainfed maize producers. We suggest that transformative adaptation is required for managing the agricultural risk that socio-ecological systems experience under climate change conditions. Such adaptation strategies should include poverty alleviation, promotion of resistant and native varieties of crops, capacity building to improve management and water use, sustainable technification, and soil restoration.

The results of this study are applicable to other arid areas. Study focus: This study aims to improve the prediction of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) to enhance the efficacy of drainage system design in data-poor areas. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were developed to estimate Ksat and compared with empirical regression-type Pedotransfer Function (PTF) equations. Subsequently, the ANNs and PTFs estimated Ksat values were used in EnDrain software to design subsurface drainage systems which were evaluated against designs using measured Ksat values. New hydrological insights: Results showed that ANNs more accurately predicted Ksat than PTFs. Drainage design based on PTFs predictions (1) result in a deeper water-level and (2) higher drainage density, increasing costs. Drainage designs based on ANNs predictions gave drain spacing and water table depth equivalent to those predicted using measured data. The results of this study indicate that ANNs can be developed using existing and under-utilised data sets and applied successfully to data-poor areas. As Ksat is time-consuming to measure, basing drainage designs on ANN predictions generated from alternative datasets will reduce the overall cost of drainage designs making them more accessible to farmers, planners, and decision-makers in least developed countries. © 2021 The Authors","Agricultural drainage design; Arid areas; Artificial neural networks; Pedotransfer functions; Saturated hydraulic conductivity; Sub-surface drainage",,Article,Scopus

In this study, a 22 ha field cultivated with corn for more than ten years using different prescription maps of nitrogen application rates was investigated. Prescription maps were developed based on archived yield maps, soil analysis and recently integrated with Sentinel 2 satellite images. In addition, farmer experience and availability of variable rate application (VRA) requirements had an influence on the development of the homogeneous management zones. The initial approach with VRA was quite simple, based on a simple partitioning of the field into three rectangular zones (defined mainly based on previous yield maps and farmer experience). The partitioning changed with time and knowledge, evolving to the final five irregularly shaped zones (defined based on Farm works decision support software). Furthermore, since 2010 the farmer began using soil moisture sensor for irrigation decisions. Results of the present study highlight an improvement in corn yield and a reduction in total applied nitrogen. Corn yield improved on average by 31% on a ten years basis to reach more than 14 ton/ha dm. in 2018. At the beginning of VRA, yield maps showed a high spatial variation between field zones compared to reduced variation in the following seasons. In addition, the nitrogen applied reduced by around 23% while the total yield was improving. These results showed an increase in the partial factor productivity from less than 54 to around 87 kg of corn grain per kg of nitrogen applied. This promising result shows that farmer management decisions can improve every season by continuous monitoring of crop performance, understanding field variability and taking advantage of recently developed decision support software tools. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Digital agriculture; GNDVI; Site-specific nitrogen; Soil electrical conductivity; Soil moisture sensors; Yield maps","Agriculture; Computer software; Decision making; Decision support systems; Moisture control; Moisture meters; Soil moisture; Corn yields; Digital agriculture; GNDVI; Management decisions; Prescription map; Site-specific nitrogen; Soil electrical conductivity; Soil moisture sensors; Variable-rate applications; Yield maps; Nitrogen; agricultural performance; crop yield; factor productivity; irrigation system; nitrogen; satellite imagery; software; soil analysis; soil moisture; yield response; Italy",Article,Scopus

Although rice is an important food crop worldwide, yield gaps remain less investigated in Latin American rice systems. In this study, we evaluated field-level factors for closing yield gaps (based on attainable farm yield, defined as the mean of top 10 % of farmers) for rice production in Uruguay using crop management and yield records from 2012 to 2017, covering approximately 70,000 ha per year (40 % of total rice area). The mean annual attainable yield gap ranged from 16 % to 22 % in fields with non-hybrid cultivars (90 % of planted area) and from 14 % to 22 % in fields with hybrid rice (10 % of planted area). Early seeding was identified as the most influential factor for reducing yield gaps in both systems, followed by N rate. Stand establishment was also important for closing yield gap in non-hybrid fields, while rotation with improved pasture was important in hybrid fields. When variables were categorized as input-related, manageable, or non-manageable, on average manageable factors (e.g. early planting and stand establishment) were more important than input-related factors (e.g. seed or fertilizer rate).

However, firms´ from catching-up Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries have already shown in the past that their innovation models differ from those applied, for example, in Western Europe. This study therefore introduces a novel two-staged model combining artificial neural networks and random forests to reveal the importance of internal and external factors influencing firms´ innovation performance in the case of 3,361 firms from six catching-up CEE countries (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), by using the World Banks´ Enterprise Survey data from 2019. We confirm the hypothesis that innovators in the catching-up CEE countries depend more on internal knowledge sources and, moreover, that participation in the firms groups represents an important factor of firms´ innovation. Surprisingly, we reject the hypothesis that foreign technologies are a crucial source of external knowledge. This study contributes to the theories of open innovation and absorptive capacity in the context of selected CEE countries and provides several practical implications for firms. © 2021 Prokop et al.

By comparing the predictive accuracy between multiple regression and machine learning models before and after the use of random forest recursive feature elimination, all multiple regression, and machine learning models showed improved accuracy while the most accurate model was the elastic net regression with 65.2% explained variance. The results show only neutral (4.11 on a 7-point Likert scale) regarding the overall satisfaction score on ERL. Even majority of students are competent in technology and have no obvious issue in accessing learning devices or Wi-Fi, face-to-face learning is more preferable compared to ERL and this is found to be the most important predictor. Besides, the level of efforts made by instructors, the agreement on the appropriateness of the adjusted assessment methods, and the perception of online learning being well delivered are shown to be highly important in determining the satisfaction scores.

Big Data and Machine Learning (ML) have emerged as high-performance computing technologies to create new opportunities to unravel, quantify and understand agricultural processes through data. However, there are many challenges to achieve the integration of these technologies. It implies making some adaptations to ML for using it with Big Data. These adaptations must consider the increasing volume of data, its variety and the transmission speed issues. This paper provides information on the use of Big Data and ML for ag-riculture, identifying challenges, adaptations and the design of architectures for these systems.

This review may be of interest to computer or data scientists and electronic or software engineers.

The model satisfactorily predicted subsurface drainage discharge, with a monthly Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.59 and index of agreement (IOA) of 0.89. Lack of annual water budget closure was reported and was likely caused by uncertainty in measured surface runoff and/or modeling approaches representing macropore flow. More than 80% of predicted surface and subsurface P losses were in the particulate form. Surface runoff was the major pathway for P loss, contributing 78% of predicted total P (TP) load. On average, predicted macropore flow represented about 15% of drainage discharge and contributed 21% of DRP loss via subsurface drains. The performance of DRAINMOD-P in predicting monthly dissolved reactive P and TP losses through subsurface drains can be rated as poor (NSE = 0.33 and IOA = 0.60) and very good (NSE = 0.81 and IOA = 0.95), respectively.

The RDPG model outperforms the standalone counterparts by demonstrating 2.485 W/m2, 20.591 W/m2, 18.316 W/m2, and 23.176 W/m2 reductions in RMSE compared to the LSTM, XGB, GPR, and SVR models.

SWAT-FT projected fewer frozen days than the original SWAT model due to its better representation of snow cover insulation effects. Both models derived declining trends in annual streamflow and terrestrial water yield in the late 21st century due to increased ET under warmer climate. However, these two models exhibited contrasting mechanisms underlying the streamflow decline. For original SWAT model, the decrease in surface runoff was the major driver, while for SWAT-FT, reduced subsurface runoff was the main cause. In general, the original SWAT model predicted more surface runoff and less subsurface runoff than SWAT-FT. Further geospatial inspection shows large discrepancies between these two models, particularly in the northern colder parts of the UMRB, where the maximum differences in annual surface and subsurface runoff reached 130 mm yr−1 and 140 mm yr−1, respectively.

This study focused on simulating future water footprint (WF) of two agronomically important crops (i.e., wheat and maize) using deep neural networks (DNN) method in Nile delta. DNN model was calibrated and validated by using 2006–2014 and 2015–2017 datasets. Moreover, future data (2022–2040) were obtained from three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5, and incorporated into DNN prediction set. The findings showed that determination-coefficient between historical-predicted crop evapotranspiration (ETc) varied from 0.92 to 0.97 for two crops. The yield prediction values of wheat-maize deviated within the ranges of −3.21% to 3.47% and −4.93% to 5.88%, respectively. Based on the ensemble of RCP, precipitation was forecasted to decease by 667.40% and 261.73% in winter and summer in western as compared to eastern, respectively, which will ultimately be dropped to 105.02% and 60.87%, respectively parallel to historical. Therefore, the substantial fluctuations in precipitation caused an obvious decrease in green WF of wheat (i.e., 24.96% and 37.44%) in western and eastern, respectively. Additionally, for maize, it induced a 103.93% decrease in western and an 8.96% increase in eastern. Furthermore, increasing ETc by 8.46% and 12.45% gave rise to substantially increasing (i.e., 8.96% and 17.21%) in western for wheat-maize compared to the east, respectively. Likewise, grey wheat-maize WF findings reveals that there was an increase of 3.07% and 5.02% in western as compared to −14.51% and 12.37% in eastern. Hence, our results highly recommend the optimal use of the eastern delta to save blue-water by 16.58% and 40.25% of total requirements for wheat-maize in contrast to others.

However, although gas exchange between croplands and the atmosphere is measurable in the field, it is difficult to quantify at the plot scale over relatively large areas because of the heterogeneous character of landscapes and differences in crop management. However, assessing accurate carbon and water budgets over croplands is essential to promote sustainable agronomic practices and reduce the water demand and the climatic impacts of croplands while maintaining sufficient yields. From this perspective, we developed a crop model, SAFYE-CO2, that assimilates high spatial- and temporal-resolution (HSTR) remote sensing products to estimate daily crop biomass, water and CO2 fluxes, annual yields, and carbon budgets at the parcel level over large areas. This modeling approach was evaluated for sunflower against two in situ datasets. First, the model's output was compared to data acquired during two cropping seasons at the Auradé integrated carbon observation system (ICOS) instrumented site in southwestern France. The model accurately simulated the daily net CO2 flux (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.97 gC·m-2·d-1 and determination coefficient (R2) = 0.83) and water flux (RMSE = 0.68 mm·d-1 and R2 = 0.79). The model's performance was then evaluated against biomass and yield data collected from 80 plots located in southwestern France. The model was able to satisfactorily estimate biomass dynamics and yield (RMSE = 66 and 54 g·m-2, respectively). To investigate the potential application of the proposed approach at a large scale, given that soil properties are important factors affecting the model, a sensitivity analysis of two existing soil products (GlobalSoilMap and SoilGrids) was carried out. Our results show that these products are not sufficiently accurate for inclusion as inputs to the model, which requires more accurate information on soil water retention capacity to assess water fluxes. Additionally, we argue that no water stress should be considered in the crop growth computation since this stress is already present because of remote sensing information in the proposed approach. This study should be considered a first step to fulfill the existing gap in quantifying carbon budgets at the plot scale over large areas and to accurately estimate the effects of management practices, such as the use of cover crops or specific crop rotations on cropland C and water budgets. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon budget; Crop modeling; Remote sensing; Soil properties; Water budget","Biogeochemistry; Biomass; Budget control; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Crops; Ecology; Mean square error; Plants (botany); Sensitivity analysis; Soil moisture; Determination coefficients; High resolution remote sensing; Management practices; Remote sensing information; Root mean square errors; Soil water retention; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Water budget components; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

The performance of each vegetation index to a certain condition is different and needs to be interpreted, correspondingly. This study aimed to assess the most suitable vegetation index to identify the crop response against elevated air temperatures, heat stress, and herbicide damage. The spectral reflectance, yield components, and growth parameters such as plant height, leaf area index (LAI), and above-ground dry matter of paddy rice, which was cultivated in a temperature gradient field chamber to simulate global warming conditions, were observed from 2016 to 2018. The relationships between the vegetation indices and the crop parameters were assessed considering stress conditions. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) represented the changes in plant height (R-square = 0.93) and the LAI (R-square = 0.901) before the heading stage. Furthermore, the NDVI and the cumulative growing degree days had a Sigmoid curve and an R-square value of 0.937 under the normal growth case, but it decreased significantly in the herbicide damage case. This characteristic was useful for detecting the damaged crop growth condition. Additionally, to estimate the grain yield of paddy rice, the medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS) terrestrial chlorophyll index was better: R-square = 0.912; root mean square error = 95.69 g/m2.

In recent years, an abundance of spatial data providing information on soils, topography, and vegetation condition have become available from both proximal and remote sensing platforms. Given the wide range of data costs (between USD $0−50/ha), it is important to understand where often limited financial resources should be directed to optimize field production. Two key questions arise. First, will these data actually aid in better fine-resolution yield prediction to help optimize crop management and farm economics? Second, what level of priority should stakeholders commit to in order to obtain these data? Before fully addressing these questions a remaining challenge is the complex nature of spatiotemporal yield variation. Here, a methodological framework is presented to separate the spatial and temporal components of crop yield variation at the subfield level. The framework can also be used to quantify the benefits of different data types on the predicted crop yield as well to better understand the connection of that data to underlying mechanisms controlling yield. Here, fine-resolution (10 m) datasets were assembled for eight 64 ha field sites, spanning a range of climatic, topographic, and soil conditions across Nebraska. Using Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis, we found the first axis of variation contained 60–85 % of the explained variance from any particular field, thus greatly reducing the dimensionality of the problem. Using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Random Forest (RF) approaches, we quantified that location within the field had the largest relative importance for modeling crop yield patterns. Secondary factors included a combination of vegetation condition, soil water content, and topography. With respect to predicting spatiotemporal crop yield patterns, we found the RF approach (prediction RMSE of 0.2−0.4 Mg/ha for maize) was superior to MLR (0.3−0.8 Mg/ha). While not directly comparable to MLR and RF the EOF approach had relatively low error (0.5–1.7 Mg/ha) and is intriguing as it requires few calibration parameters (2–6 used here) and utilizes the climate-based aridity index, allowing for pragmatic long-term predictions of subfield crop yield. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Maize and soybean; Remote sensing; Spatiotemporal; Statistics; Yield","aridity; calibration; crop yield; financial provision; optimization; remote sensing; soil water; spatial data; stakeholder; topography; Nebraska; United States; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Analyses were performed for the Delaware Watershed at Perry Lake in eastern Kansas. Precipitation indices for DAYMET and PRISM precipitation closely matched GHCN-D, whereas NLDAS and GLDAS showed weaker correlations. We also used these precipitation data as input to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model that confirmed similar trends in streamflow simulation. For stations with complete data, GHCN-D based SWAT-simulated streamflow variability better than gridded precipitation data. During low flow periods we found PRISM performed better, whereas both DAYMET and NLDAS performed better in high flow years.

Up to now, this technology has been limited to the control of weeds and pests, whereas the second generation of GM crops is expected to assist farmers in abiotic stress tolerance or improved nutritional features. Aiming to analyze this subject holistically, in this presentation we address an advanced technology for drought-tolerant GM crops, upscaling from molecular details obtained in the laboratory to an extensive network of field trials as well as the impact of the introduction of this innovation into the market. Sunflower has divergent transcription factors, which could be key actors in the drought response orchestrating several signal transduction pathways, generating an improved performance to deal with water deficit. One of such factors, HaHB4, belongs to the homeodomain-leucine zipper family and was first introduced in Arabidopsis. Transformed plants had improved tolerance to water deficits, through the inhibition of ethylene sensitivity and not by stomata closure. Wheat and soybean plants expressing the HaHB4 gene were obtained and cropped across a wide range of growing conditions exhibiting enhanced adaptation to drought-prone environments, the most important constraint affecting crop yield worldwide. The performance of wheat and soybean, however, differed slightly across mentioned environments; whereas the improved behavior of GM wheat respect to controls was less dependent on the temperature regime (cool or warm), differences between GM and wild-type soybeans were remarkably larger in warmer compared to cooler conditions. In both species, these GM crops are good candidates to become market products in the near future. In anticipation of consumers’ and other stakeholders’ interest, spectral analyses of field crops have been conducted to differentiate these GM crops from wild type and commercial cultivars. In this paper, the potential impact of the release of such market products is discussed, considering the perspectives of different stakeholders. © Copyright © 2020 González, Rigalli, Miranda, Romagnoli, Ribichich, Trucco, Portapila, Otegui and Chan.","drought tolerance; grain yield determination; HaHB4; sunflower transcription factor; transgenic soybean; transgenic wheat",,Article,Scopus

Agriculture 4.0, as the fourth evolution in the farming technology, puts forward four essential requirements: increasing productivity, allocating resources reasonably, adapting to climate change, and avoiding food waste. As advanced information systems and Internet technologies are adopted in Agriculture 4.0, enormous farming data, such as meteorological information, soil conditions, marketing demands, and land uses, can be collected, analyzed, and processed for assisting farmers in making appropriate decisions and obtaining higher profits. Therefore, agricultural decision support systems for Agriculture 4.0 has become a very attractive topic for the research community. The objective of this paper aims at exploring the upcoming challenges of employing agricultural decision support systems in Agriculture 4.0. Future researchers may improve the decision support systems by overcoming these detected challenges. In this paper, the systematic literature review technique is used to survey thirteen representative decision support systems, including their applications for agricultural mission planning, water resources management, climate change adaptation, and food waste control.

Next, the SVD (singular value decomposition) algorithm is applied to decompose all selected inputs, thus capturing the most relevant oscillatory features more clearly; then, the monthly lagged data are incorporated into a random forest model to generate future precipitation anomalies.

Satellite measurements can complement the restrictive coverage afforded by in-situ measurements and have the potential to facilitate the monitoring of cropland photosynthesis over a large spatial scale in a cost-effective manner. Traditionally, space-based monitoring of cropland photosynthetic activity, especially Light-use efficiency (LUE), has relied on empirical relationships between satellite spectral reflectance and ground climate and vegetation conditions. Space-borne retrievals of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), an independent measurement, has shown to provide a more direct estimation of photosynthetic activity than traditional methods, and may further allow the inference of LUE. This study has empirically explored the possibility of remotely monitoring large-scale LUE by calculating the ratio of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) normalized SIF to the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). We applied this calculation to demonstrate the spatial patterns and seasonal dynamics of LUE and its related measurements in response to land surface temperature (LST) across Australian rainfed croplands from 2007 to 2016. LST was used to provide an integrated measure of vegetation water and heat stress at the canopy level. Our results showed that LUE tends to be higher in the geographical middle zones than in either the warmer northern or the cooler southern regions. Temporally, we found that there was a seasonal asymmetry of LUE and its related measurements in response to LST change throughout the winter crop-growing season. Statistical tests revealed that the optimum LST range for satellite-based LUE was 16.6–17.6 °C during August. The more LST exceeded this optimum, the more sensitive LUE was found to be. Pixels in August with optimum LST across the ten-year sampling period (Augusts of 2007–2016) were distributed in the southern-middle to middle zones of the Australian rainfed croplands. Our results provide new opportunities for large-scale cropland heat and drought stress detection under a future warmer and drier climate and can also support remote analyses of crop photosynthetic activity over large spatial scales. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural remote sensing; Australian rainfed croplands; Enhanced vegetation index; Light-use efficiency; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence","Chlorophyll; Cost effectiveness; Cultivation; Efficiency; Fluorescence; Geographical regions; Land surface temperature; Photosynthesis; Remote sensing; Satellites; Thermal stress; Vegetation; Agricultural remote sensing; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Enhanced vegetation index; Light use efficiency; Rainfed; Crops; agricultural land; drought stress; fluorescence; growing season; light use efficiency; NDVI; photosynthetically active radiation; rainfed agriculture; remote sensing; satellite data; seasonal variation; spatial analysis; spectral reflectance; Australia",Article,Scopus

Theoretically, it has advantages over global climate models in terms of realisation of future climate projections. However, there are few studies that have used dynamical downscaling results to assess climate change impacts on Australian cropping systems. In this study, we used post-processing bias-corrected climate data from the NSW/ACT Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) project to drive the Agricultural Production Systems SIMulator (APSIM) for modelling and evaluating the response of three major crops (wheat, canola and lupin) to projected climate conditions under various farm management practices in south-eastern Australia. Our results showed that historical crop yields from APSIM simulations forced by RCM output tended to underestimate yields from simulations forced by observations due to large biases in the NARCliM simulations. Therefore, bias correction was used to correct the APSIM outputs before conducting future impact analysis. The bias-corrected results showed that ensemble-mean yields based on 12 RCMs were projected to increase over the study area under the A2 emission scenario. However, the magnitude of yield increase depended on the time periods, crop type and location. Multiple linear regression models showed that the changes of radiation, rainfall and temperature and elevated CO2 concentration could explain 60–78% of crop yield changes. It is interesting to note that residue incorporation and nitrogen application had a large effect on percentage yield increases for wheat due to future climate change, but had limited effects on the response of lupin and canola yields. Our study suggests that sufficient bias-correction method is needed when using NARCliM outputs in crop models. Although uncertainties (e.g. the choice of emission scenarios and RCMs) still exist in our study, the results are of central importance in the development of high-yield adaptive strategies for local farmers and policy makers in south-eastern Australia. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; climate modeling; crop production; management practice; regional climate; Australia; Brassica napus var. napus; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

This work aimed to interpret the feasibility of several machine learning approaches to assess the spatial distribution of solar radiation on Earth based on the Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) Meteorological Imager (MI) geostationary satellite. Four data-driven models were selected (artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and DNN), to compare their accuracy and spatial estimating performance. Moreover, we used a physical model to probe the ability of data-driven methods, implementing hold-out and k-fold cross-validation approaches based on pyranometers located in South Korea. The results of analysis showed the RF had the highest accuracy in predicting performance, although the difference between RF and the second-best technique (DNN) was insignificant. Temporal variations in root mean square error (RMSE) were dependent on the number of data samples, while the physical model showed relatively less sensitivity. Nevertheless, DNN and RF showed less variability in RMSE than the others. To examine spatial estimation performance, we mapped solar radiation over South Korea for each model. The data-driven models accurately simulated the observed cloud pattern spatially, whereas the physical model failed to do because of cloud mask errors. These exhibited different spatial retrieval performances according to their own training approaches. Overall analysis showed that deeper layers of networks approaches (RF and DNN), could best simulate the challenging spatial pattern of thin clouds when using satellite multispectral data. © 2019 by the authors.","Artificial neural network; COMS MI; Deep neural network; Random forest; Solar radiation; Support vector machine","Decision trees; Geostationary satellites; Machine learning; Mean square error; Network layers; Neural networks; Sensitivity analysis; Solar radiation; Support vector machines; K fold cross validations; Machine learning approaches; Random forests; Retrieval performance; Root mean square errors; Satellite multispectral data; Spatial characteristics; Support vector regression (SVR); Deep neural networks",Article,Scopus

In a previous article it was argued that there is little merit to the Syria-climate conflict thesis, including no clear evidence that drought-related migration contributed to civil war onset. Building on this earlier work, the present article investigates an issue which was not fully analysed in the previous one: the nature and causes of the pre-civil war agrarian crisis in Syria's northeast Jazira region, and especially in the governorate of Hasakah. This crisis is usually represented as rooted essentially in a severe multi-year drought which, it is claimed, led to multiple crop failures and in turn large-scale migration. Here it is argued, by contrast, that the central causes of Hasakah's agrarian crisis were long-term and structural, involving three main factors: extreme water resource degradation; deepening rural poverty; and underpinning these, specific features of Syria's and Hasakah's politics and political economy. The article contends, most notably, that the exceptional severity of Hasakah's crisis was a function of the nationwide collapse of Syria's agrarian and rentier model of state-building and development, combined with Hasakah's distinctive political geography as an ethnically contested borderland and frontier zone. I thus conclude that rather than supporting narratives of environmental scarcity-induced conflict, the Syrian case actually confirms the opposite: namely, political ecologists’ insistence on the centrality of the political, and of conflict, in causing environmental scarcities and insecurities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Drought; Frontiers; Oil; Political ecology; Syrian civil war","civil war; climate change; drought; political conflict; political economy; poverty; resource scarcity; water resource; Hasakah; Syrian Arab Republic",Article,Scopus

The core element of the framework is the derivation of a composite agricultural performance index which is composed of different subindicators taking into account cropping intensity, crop diversity, crop rotations, fallow land frequency, land utilization, water use efficiency, and water availability. We derive these subindicators from net primary productivity and evapotranspiration data obtained from the MODIS sensor on board the Terra satellite during the observation period from 2000 to 2016, as well as from cropland maps created through multiannual classification of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We classified pixel-based NDVI time series covering more than 8 × 106 ha of irrigated cropland based on a hierarchical approach concatenating unsupervised and supervised classification techniques to automatically generate and refine training labels, which are then used to train a decision fusion classifier, achieving an average overall accuracy of 78%. The results give unprecedented insights into spatial patterns of agricultural performance in the ASB. The proposed method is transferable and applicable for global-scale mapping, and the results of this remote sensing-aided assessment can provide important information for regional agricultural planning purposes. © The Authors.

This study aims to investigate the potential use of suspended sediment concentration (SSC), water quality and remote sensing data to calibrate and validate a large-scale sediment model. Observed data from across 108 stations located in the Doce River basin was used for the period between 1997-2010. Ten calibration and validation experiments using the MOCOM-UA optimization algorithm coupled with the MGB-SED model were carried out, which, over the same period of time, resulted in 37 calibration and 111 validation tests. The experiments were performed by modifying metrics, spatial discretization, observed data and parameters of the MOCOM-UA algorithm. Results generally demonstrated that the values of correlation presented slight variations and were superior in the calibration step. Additionally, increasing spatial discretization or establishing a background concentration for the model allowed for improved results. In a station with high quantity of SSC data, calibration improved the ENS coefficient from-0.44 to 0.44. The experiments showed that the spectral surface reflectance, total suspended solids and turbidity data have the potential to enhance the performance of sediment models. © 2019, Brazilian Journal of Water Resources.

Estimates of precipitation and vegetation greenness are the two dominant satellite datasets. However, ignoring additional moisture- and energy-related processes that influence the response of vegetation to rainfall leads to an incomplete representation of the hydrologic cycle. This study evaluates the added value of considering multiple independent satellite-based variables to design, calibrate, and validate weather insurance indices on the African continent. The satellite data include two rainfall datasets, soil moisture, the evaporative stress index (ESI), and vegetation greenness. We limit artificial advantages by resampling all datasets to the same spatial (0.258) and temporal (monthly) resolution, although datasets with a higher spatial resolution might have an added value, if considered as the single source of information for localized applications. A higher correlation coefficient between the moisture-focused variables and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), an indicator for vegetation vigor, provides evidence for the datasets’ capability to capture agricultural drought conditions on the ground. The Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) rainfall dataset, soil moisture, and ESI show higher correlations with the (lagged) NDVI in large parts of Africa, for different land covers and various climate zones, than the African Rainfall Climatology, version 2 (ARC2), rainfall dataset, which is often used in WII.

Environmental data collected at the field level, such as soil and climatic information, can be relevant to improve predictive ability in genomic prediction models by describing more precisely genotype-by-environment interactions, which represent a key component of the phenotypic response for complex crop agronomic traits. Modern predictive modeling approaches can efficiently handle various data types and are able to capture complex nonlinear relationships in large datasets. In particular, machine learning techniques have gained substantial interest in recent years. Here we examined the predictive ability of machine learning-based models for two phenotypic traits in maize using data collected by the Maize Genomes to Fields (G2F) Initiative. The data we analyzed consisted of multi-environment trials (METs) dispersed across the United States and Canada from 2014 to 2017. An assortment of soil- and weather-related variables was derived and used in prediction models alongside genotypic data. Linear random effects models were compared to a linear regularized regression method (elastic net) and to two nonlinear gradient boosting methods based on decision tree algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM). These models were evaluated under four prediction problems: (1) tested and new genotypes in a new year; (2) only unobserved genotypes in a new year; (3) tested and new genotypes in a new site; (4) only unobserved genotypes in a new site. Accuracy in forecasting grain yield performance of new genotypes in a new year was improved by up to 20% over the baseline model by including environmental predictors with gradient boosting methods. For plant height, an enhancement of predictive ability could neither be observed by using machine learning-based methods nor by using detailed environmental information. An investigation of key environmental factors using gradient boosting frameworks also revealed that temperature at flowering stage, frequency and amount of water received during the vegetative and grain filling stage, and soil organic matter content appeared as important predictors for grain yield in our panel of environments.

We then explore the potential afforded by ML to fill gaps in our current methodological toolbox. We discuss use cases like the need for flexible functional forms, the use of unstructured data, and large numbers of explanatory variables in both prediction and causal analysis. We also highlight the challenges of complex simulation models including calibration, validation and computational demands and identify places where machine learning can help.

Hyperspectral remote sensing (RS) provides feasible solutions for obtaining crop leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) by the advantages of its repeated and high throughput observations. However, the data redundancy and the poor robustness of the inversion models are still major obstacles that prevent the widespread application of hyperspectral RS for crop LCC evaluation. For winter wheat LCC inversion from hyperspectral observations, this study described a novel hybrid method, which is based on the combination of amplitude- and shape- enhanced 2D correlation spectrum (2DCOS) and transfer learning. The innovative feature selection method, amplitude- and shape- enhanced 2DCOS, which originated from 2DCOS, additionally considered the relationships between external perturbations and hyperspectral amplitude and shape characteristics to enhance the dynamic spectrum response. To extract the representative LCC featured wavelengths, the amplitude- and shape- enhanced 2DCOS was conducted on the leaf optical PROperties SPECTra (PROSPECT) + Scattering from Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (SAIL) (PROSAIL) simulated dataset, which covered most possible winter wheat canopy spectra. Nine wavelengths (i.e., 455, 545, 571, 615, 641, 662, 706, 728, and 756 nm) were then extracted as the sensitive wavelengths of LCC with the amplitude- and shape- enhanced 2DCOS. These wavelengths had specificity to LCC and showed good correlation with LCC from the aspect of photosynthesis mechanism, molecular structure, and optical properties. The transfer learning techniques based on the deep neural network was then introduced to transfer the knowledge learned from the PROSAIL simulated dataset to the inversion tasks of field measured LCC. Parts of the labeled samples in field observations were used to finetune the model pre-trained by the simulated dataset to improve the inversion accuracy of the winter wheat LCC in different field scenes, aiming to reduce the need for the field measured and labeled sample size. To further ascertain the universality, transferability and predictive ability of the proposed hybrid method, field samples collected from different locations at different phenological phases, including the jointing and heading stages in 2013, 2014, and 2018, were utilized as target tasks to validate the proposed hybrid method. Moreover, the LCC of winter wheat estimated with the proposed method was evaluated with the ground-based platform and the UAV-based platform to verify the model versatility for different monitoring platforms. Various validations demonstrated that the hybrid inversion method combining the amplitude- and shape- enhanced 2DCOS and the fine-tuned transfer learning model could effectively estimate winter wheat LCC with good accuracy and robustness, and can be extended to the detection and inversion of other key variables of crops. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Chlorophyll; Ground-based measurement; Hyperspectral; PROSAIL; Transfer learning; UAV experiment","Chlorophyll; Deep neural networks; Optical properties; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); 2D correlation spectrum; Ground based measurement; Hybrid method; HyperSpectral; Leaf chlorophyll content; PROSAIL; Transfer learning; UAV experiment; Wheat leaves; Winter wheat; Crops; autocorrelation; correlation; crop plant; data set; detection method; growth; leaf area; remote sensing; seasonal variation; winter",Article,Scopus

This paper presents an end-to-end Machine Learning framework for predicting the potential profit from olive farms. The objective is to estimate the optimal economic gain while preserving water resources on irrigation by considering various related factors such as climatic conditions, crop management practices, soil characteristics, and crop yield. The case study focuses on olive tree farms located on the Hellenic Island of Crete. Real data from the farms and the weather in the area will be used. The target is to build a framework that will preprocess input data, compare the results among a group of Machine Learning algorithms and propose the best-predicted value of economic profit. Various aspects during this process will be thoroughly examined such as the bias-variance tradeoff and the problem of overfitting, data transforms, feature engineering and selection, ensemble methods as well as pursuing optimal resampling towards better model accuracy.

The past several decades have witnessed the emergence of conservation tillage practices to combat soil erosion and degradation. However, the effects of conservation tillage on crop water productivity (CWP) remain uncertain, especially from a regional-scale perspective. Here, we used an improved process-based agroecosystem model (DLEM-Ag) to quantify the long-term effects of conservation tillage (e.g., no-tillage, NT; reduced tillage, RT) on CWP (defined as the ratio of crop productivity to evapotranspiration) of corn and soybean across the Ohio River Basin during 1979–2018. Our results revealed an average increase of 2.8% and 8.4% in CWP for corn and soybean, respectively, under the NT adoption scenario. Compared to the conventional tillage scenario, NT and RT would enhance CWP, primarily due to reductions in evapotranspiration, particularly evaporation. Further analysis suggested that, although NT and RT may decrease surface runoff, these practices could also increase subsurface drainage and nutrient loss from corn and soybean farmland via leaching. These results indicate that conservation tillage should be complemented with additional water and nutrient management practices to enhance soil water retention and optimize nutrient use in the region's cropland. Our findings also provide unique insights into optimizing management practices for other areas where conservation tillage is widely applied. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation tillage; Crop water productivity (CWP); No-tillage; Ohio River Basin (ORB); Process-based agroecosystem model","Crops; Cultivation; Ecosystems; Evapotranspiration; Food supply; Groundwater flow; Nutrients; Rivers; Soil conservation; Soil moisture; Watersheds; Conservation tillage; Crop water productivity; Management practises; No tillage; Ohio River; Ohio river basin; Process-based agroecosystem model; River basins; Water productivity; Productivity; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural land; agricultural management; conservation tillage; crop production; food security; maize; nutrient loss; nutrient use efficiency; soybean; Ohio Basin; United States; Glycine max",Article,Scopus

These properties are used to populate an earth model vector, and the spatial variation of properties across this vector sheds light on the underlying earth structure or physical phenomenon of interest, from groundwater aquifers to plate tectonics. However, to infer these properties the spatial characteristics of these properties need to be known in advance. Typically, assumptions are made about the length scales of earth properties, which are encoded a priori in a Bayesian probabilistic setting. In an optimization setting, appeals are made to promote model simplicity together with constraints which keep models close to a preferred model. All of these approaches are valid, though they can lead to unintended features in the resulting inferred geophysical models owing to inappropriate prior assumptions, constraints or even the nature of the solution basis functions. In this work it will be shown that in order to make accurate inferences about earth properties, inferences can first be made about the underlying length scales of these properties in a very general solution basis. From a mathematical point of view, these spatial characteristics of earth properties can be conveniently thought of as 'properties' of the earth properties. Thus, the same machinery used to infer earth properties can be used to infer their length scales. This can be thought of as an 'infer to infer' paradigm analogous to the 'learning to learn' paradigm which is now commonplace in the machine learning literature. However, it must be noted that (geophysical) inference is not the same as (machine) learning, though there are many common elements which allow for cross-pollination of useful ideas from one field to the other, as is shown here. A non-stationary trans-dimensional Gaussian Process (TDGP) is used to parametrize earth properties, and a multichannel stationary TDGP is used to parametrize the length scales associated with the earth property in question. Using non-stationary kernels, that is kernels with spatially variable length scales, models with sharp discontinuities can be represented within this framework. As GPs are multidimensional interpolators, the same theory and computer code can be used to solve geophysical problems in 1-D, 2-D and 3-D. This is demonstrated through a combination of 1-D and 2-D non-linear regression examples and a controlled source electromagnetic field example. The key difference between this and previous work using TDGP is generalized nested inference and the marginalization of prior length scales for better posterior subsurface property characterization. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

It is necessary for obtain baseline datasets such as surface areas and boundaries of water bodies with high accuracy, effectively, economically, and practically by using satellite images in terms of management and planning of lakes. Extracting surface areas of water bodies using image classification algorithms and high-resolution RGB satellite images and evaluating the effectiveness of different image classification algorithms have become an important research domain. In this experimental study, eight different machine learning-based classification approaches, namely, k-nearest neighborhood (kNN), subspaced kNN, support vector machines (SVMs), random forest (RF), bagged tree (BT), Naive Bayes (NB), and linear discriminant (LD), have been utilized to extract the surface areas of lakes. Lastly, autoencoder (AE) classification algorithm was applied, and the effectiveness of all those algorithms was compared. Experimental studies were carried out on three different lakes (Hazar Lake, Salda Lake, Manyas Lake) using high-resolution Turkish RASAT RGB satellite images. The results indicated that AE algorithm obtained the highest accuracy values in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Another important aspect of this study is that Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Universal Image Quality Index (UIQI) metrics that can evaluate close to human perception are used for comparison. With this application, it has been shown that overall accuracy calculated from test data may be inadequate in some cases by using SSIM, UIQI, mean squared error (MSE), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), and Cohen’s KAPPA metrics. In the last application, the robustness of AE was examined with boxplots. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Autoencoder; Environmental monitoring; Image classification; Lake management; Machine learning; RASAT; Remote sensing; Water body extraction","algorithm; environmental factor; experimental study; image classification; lake; lake ecosystem; land use; satellite imagery; Burdur [Turkey]; Elazig [Turkey]; Hazar Lake; Salda Lake; Turkey; algorithm; Bayes theorem; environmental monitoring; human; lake; tree; Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Lakes; Trees",Article,Scopus

Although trees compete with crops for soil resources in agroforestry,they can also improve crops' growing conditions, especially, by providing shade under drought. They can promote higher crop yields and higher harvest quality in the drylands. However, the beneficial effect of tree shade may depend on the seasonal pattern of rainfall, which determines the compensation between yield components. In this study, we evaluated two annual crops (durum wheat and faba bean) in olive agroforestry in northern Morocco. We manipulated water supply in a field experiment to span the high inter-annual rainfall variability at the site and tested whether olive trees reduce or improve crop yields. We assessed the effect of water addition on crop growth, yield components, and final yields and estimated the land equivalent ratio of olive agroforestry. Agroforestry limited crop growth and yield whatever the water regime. The magnitude of grain yield reduction was around 50 % for both crops in 2018, probably due to shade. The number of grains per unit area was the most impacted yield component in both 2018 and 2019. In contrast, water addition only had limited effects on faba bean yield, although it enhanced wheat grain yield by 11 % and the number of wheat spikes by 13 %. Agroforestry improved individual grain weight by 39 % for wheat and 17 % for faba bean, and enhanced the protein content of wheat grains and straw by 4 % and 9 %. However, improvements in grain weight and in protein content were not sufficient to compensate for yield loss due to shade. Despite lower crop yields, we show that agroforestry systems are still more land productive than sole crops and trees, even under arid conditions. We show how changing water supply may impact the performance of olive agroforestry in a drier future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Faba bean; Land equivalent ratio; Morocco; Stress-gradient hypothesis; Tree-Crop interactions; Wheat; Yield components","agroforestry; arid environment; compensation; crop yield; legume; performance assessment; protein; water availability; water supply; wheat; Morocco; Elliptio dilatata; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum; Vicia faba",Article,Scopus

(1) Background: Tree-ring width chronologies have been successfully applied for crops yield reconstruction models. We propose application of separated earlywood and latewood width chronologies as possible pre-dictors improving the fitness of reconstruction models. (2) Methods: The generalized yield series of main crops (spring wheat, spring barley, oats) were investigated in rain-fed and irrigated areas in semiarid steppes of South Siberia. Chronologies of earlywood, latewood, and total ring width of Siberian larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.) growing in forest-steppe in the middle of the study area were tested as predictors of yield reconstruction models. (3) Results: In the rain-fed territory, separation of earlywood and latewood allowed increasing variation of yield explained by reconstruction model from 17.4 to 20.5%, whereas total climatic-driven component of variation was 41.5%. However, both tree-ring based models explained only 7.7% of yield variation in the irrigated territory (climate inclusion increased it to 34.8%). Low temperature sensitivity of larch growth was the main limitation of the model. A 240-year (1780–2019) history of crop failures and yield variation dynamics were estimated from the actual data and the best reconstruction model. (4) Conclusions: Presently in the study region, breeding of the environment-resistant crops varieties compensates the increase of temperature in the yield dynamics, preventing severe harvest losses. Tree-ring based reconstructions may help to understand and forecast response of the crops to the climatic variability, and also the probability of crop failures, particularly in the rain-fed territories. © 2021 by the authors.

In commercial agricultural systems, combine harvesters with onboard yield monitors collect real-time yield data during harvest with high spatial resolution, generating a large ground dataset. Here, we leveraged a yield monitor dataset of over one million maize field observations across the United States Corn Belt from 2008 to 2018 to evaluate the Scalable Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM). SCYM uses region-specific crop model simulations and climate data to interpret vegetation indices from satellite observations, thus enabling efficient sub-field yield estimation across large regions and multiple years without reliance on ground data calibration. We used the ground dataset to compare alternative SCYM model implementations, define minimum required satellite observation criteria, and evaluate the sensitivity of satellite-based yield estimates to on-the-ground variation in management, soil, and annual weather. We found that smoothing annual time series data with harmonic regression increased 30 m pixel-level accuracy from r2 = 0.31 to 0.40 and reduced dependency on specific satellite observation timing, enabling robust yield estimation on 97% of annual maize area using only Landsat data. Agreement improved as the assessment was aggregated to field-level (r2 = 0.45) and county-level (r2 = 0.69) scales, demonstrating the need for fine-resolution ground truth data to better assess sub-field level accuracy in high resolution products. We found that SCYM and ground data showed a similar yield response to management and environmental variation, particularly capturing linear and nonlinear responses to sowing density, soil water holding capacity, and growing season precipitation. However, sensitivity to factors like soil quality and planting date was muted for SCYM estimates compared to ground-based yields. Random forest models were able to match SCYM performance when trained on at least 1000 ground observations, but performed poorly when tested on years and locations not represented in the training data. Our results demonstrate that satellite yield maps can provide much-needed information on multidecadal yield trends and inform yield gap analyses. © 2020 The Authors","Agricultural monitoring; Crop yields; Landsat; US Corn Belt","Agricultural robots; Climate models; Crops; Decision trees; Forestry; Large dataset; Real time systems; Sensitivity analysis; Soil moisture; Environmental variations; Ground observations; Harmonic regression; High spatial resolution; Model implementation; Non-linear response; Satellite observations; Soil water holdings; Satellites; accuracy assessment; calibration; crop yield; data set; growing season; maize; mapping method; performance assessment; satellite altimetry; satellite data; time series analysis; Corn Belt; United States; Miletinae; Varanidae",Article,Scopus

However, existing models are very complex and require hundreds of variables to perform accurately. Due to these shortcomings, large-scale applications of crop models are limited. In order to address these limitations, reliable crop models were developed using a deep neural network (DNN) – a new approach for predicting crop yields. In addition, the number of required input variables was reduced using three common variable selection techniques: namely Bayesian variable selection, Spearman's rank correlation, and Principal Component Analysis Feature Extraction. The reduced-variable DNN models were capable of estimating future crop yields for 10,000,000 different weather and irrigation scenarios while maintaining comparable accuracy levels to the original model that used all input variables. To establish clear superiority of the methodology, the results were also compared with a very recent feature selection algorithm called min-redundancy max-relevance (mRMR). The results of this study showed that the Bayesian variable selection was the best method for achieving the aforementioned goals. Specifically, the final Bayesian-based DNN model with a structure of 10 neurons in 5 layers performed very similarly (78.6% accuracy) to the original DNN crop model with 400 neurons in 10 layers, even though the size of the neural network was reduced by 80-fold.

For large-scale applications, FCC is usually estimated from remotely sensed data by inverting radiative transfer models (RTMs) or using data-driven regressions. In this article, we proposed a hybrid model, which combines a 3-D RTM and transfer learning-based convolutional neural network (T-CNN), to estimate FCC from very high-resolution satellite images (e.g., Chinese GaoFen-2, 1 m resolution with 4 bands). Unlike common hybrid models that are purely trained with simulation data, T-CNN combines simulation data-based pre-training and actual data-based transfer learning, which is a widely used technique in artificial intelligence for fine-tuning models. The performance of T-CNN was compared with a random forest (RF) model and two general CNN models, including CNN trained with actual dataset only (data-CNN) and CNN trained with RTM simulation data only (RTM-CNN). Results on the independent validation dataset (not used in training stage) showed that T-CNN had higher accuracy (RMSE = 0.121, R2 = 0.83), compared with RF (RMSE = 0.26, R2 = 0.61), Data-CNN (RMSE = 0.142, R2 = 0.81), and RTM-CNN (RMSE = 0.144, R2 = 0.73), which indicates that T-CNN has a strong transferability. Tests on different training sizes showed that T-CNN (0.084 < RMSE < 0.108) provided constantly better performances than RF (0.116 < RMSE < 0.122) and data-CNN (0.103 < RMSE < 0.128), which demonstrates the potential of T-CNN as an alternative to RTM-based inversion and data-driven regressions to estimate FCC, especially when training data is imbalanced and inadequate. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","convolutional neural network (CNN); forest canopy cover (FCC); Three-dimensional (3-D) radiative transfer model; transfer learning","Biological systems; Convolution; Decision trees; Forestry; Neural networks; Radiative transfer; Three dimensional computer graphics; Timber; 3d radiative transfer model; Biological system modeling; Canopy cover; Convolutional neural network; Forest canopies; Forest canopy cover; Radiative transfer modelling; Solid modelling; Three-dimensional display; Transfer learning; Three dimensional displays; accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; data set; forest canopy; forest cover; model validation; radiative transfer; regression analysis; satellite imagery; three-dimensional modeling",Article,Scopus

However, little is known about interconnections between EMF and taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities of rare and abundant bacteria. Using MiSeq sequencing and multiple statistical analyses, we evaluated the maintenance of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities of rare and abundant bacteria and their contributions to EMF in salinized agricultural soils (0.09 to 19.91 dS/m). Rare bacteria exhibited closer phylogenetic clustering and broader environmental breadths than abundant ones, while abundant bacteria showed higher functional redundancies and stronger phylogenetic signals of ecological preferences than rare ones. Variable selection (86.7%) dominated rare bacterial community assembly, and dispersal limitation (54.7%) and variable selection (24.5%) determined abundant bacterial community assembly. Salinity played a decisive role in mediating the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes and showed significant effects on functions and diversities of both rare and abundant bacteria. Rare bacterial taxonomic a-diversity and abundant bacterial phylogenetic a-diversity contributed significantly to EMF, while abundant bacterial taxonomic a-diversity and rare bacterial phylogenetic a-diversity did not. Additionally, abundant rather than rare bacterial community function had a significant effect on soil EMF. These findings extend our knowledge of environmental adaptation of rare and abundant bacteria and highlight different contributions of taxonomic and phylogenetic a-diversities of rare and abundant bacteria to soil EMF. IMPORTANCE Soil salinization is a worldwide environmental problem and threatens plant productivity and microbial diversity. Understanding the generation and maintenance of microbial diversity is essential to estimate soil tillage potential via investigating ecosystem multifunctionality. Our sequence-based data showed differences in environmental adaptations of rare and abundant bacteria at taxonomic and phylogenetic levels, which led to different contributions of taxonomic and phylogenetic a-diversities of rare and abundant bacteria to soil EMF. Studying the diversity of rare and abundant bacteria and their contributions to EMF in salinized soils is critical for guiding soil restoration.

However, banana productivity generally achieves less than optimal yield potential (<30%) in most regions, including Uganda. Numerous studies have been undertaken to identify the key challenges that smallholder banana growers face at different stages of the banana value chain, with one of the main constraints being a lack of policy-relevant agricultural data. The World Bank (WB) initiated a methodological survey design aimed at identifying the distribution of banana varieties across a number of key Ugandan growing regions, at the individual household scale. To achieve this outcome a number of approaches including ground-based surveys, DNA tissue collection of selected banana plants and remote sensing were evaluated. For the remote sensing component, the set objectives were to develop statistical models from the hyperspectral reflectance properties of individual leaves that could differentiate typical ECA banana varieties, as well as their parentage (usage). The study also explored the potential of extrapolating the ground-based hyperspectral measures to high-resolution WorldView-3 (WV3) satellite imagery, therefore creating the potential of mapping the distribution of banana varieties at a regional scale. The DNA testing of 43 banana varieties propagated at the National Banana Research Program site at National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) research station in Kampala, Uganda, identified 12 genetically different varieties. A canonical powered partial least square (CPPLS) model developed from hyperspectral reflectance properties of the sampled banana leaves successfully differentiated BLU, BOG, GON, GRO and KAY genotypes. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm was also evaluated to determine if spectral bands coinciding with those provided by WV3 data could segregate banana varieties. The results suggested that this was achievable and as such presents an opportunity to extrapolate the hyperspectral classifications to broader areas of land. The ability to spectrally differentiate these five genotypes has merit as they are not typical east African varieties. As such, identifying the distribution and density of these varieties across Uganda provides vital information to the banana breeders of NARO of where their new varieties are being disseminated too, data that has been previously difficult to obtain. Although the results from this pilot study indicated that not all banana varieties could be spectrally differentiated, the methodology developed and the positive results that were achieved do present remote sensing as a complimentary technology to the ongoing surveying of banana and other crop types grown within Ugandan household farming systems. © 2020 The Authors","Agriculture productivity; Banana; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Prediction modelling; Survey design","Agricultural robots; Decision trees; Extrapolation; Plants (botany); Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Software testing; Surveys; Agricultural research; Hyper-spectral classification; Hyperspectral reflectance; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Partial least square (PLS); Research programs; Research stations; Smallholder farmers; Fruits; crop plant; crop yield; cultivar; farming system; genotype; ground-based measurement; in situ measurement; remote sensing; satellite imagery; WorldView; Central Africa; Kampala; Uganda",Article,Scopus

The aim of this study was to assess the performance of two remote sensing data for describing the variations of biometric and physiological parameters of durum wheat grown under different water regimes (rainfed, 50% and 100% of irrigation requirements). The experimentation was carried out in Policoro (Southern Italy) for two growing seasons. The Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images and radiometric ground-based data were acquired regularly during the growing season with plant biometric (leaf area index and dry aboveground biomass) and physiological (stomatal conductance, net assimilation, and transpiration rate) parameters. Water deficit index was closely related to plant water status and crop physiological parameters. The enhanced vegetation index showed slightly better performance than the normalized difference vegetation index when plotted against the leaf area index with R2 = 0.73. The overall results indicated that the ground-based vegetation indices were in good agreement with the satellite-based indices. The main constraint for effective application of satellite-based indices remains the presence of clouds during the acquisition time, which is particularly relevant for winter-spring crops. Therefore, the integration of remote sensing and field data might be needed to optimize plant response under specific growing conditions and to enhance agricultural production. © 2020 by the authors.","Enhanced vegetation index; Irrigation; Vegetation indices; Water deficit index","Agricultural robots; Biometrics; Crops; Data acquisition; Parameter estimation; Physiological models; Physiology; Satellites; Vegetation; Above ground biomass; Agricultural productions; Enhanced vegetation index; Irrigation requirements; Normalized difference vegetation index; Physiological parameters; Remote sensing technology; Satellite remote sensing; Remote sensing; data acquisition; growing season; irrigation system; Landsat; leaf area index; NDVI; optimization; physiological response; remote sensing; transpiration; Italy; Triticum aestivum; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum",Article,Scopus

To date, very few radiation products provide estimates of Rdif, and systematic validation and evaluation are even more scare. In this study, Rdif estimates from Reanalysis Fifth Generation (ERA5) of European Center for Medium-RangeWeather Forecasts and satellite-based retrieval (called JiEA) are evaluated over East Asia using ground measurements at 39 stations fromWorld Radiation Data Center (WRDC) and China Meteorological Administration (CMA). The results show that JiEA agrees well with measurements, while ERA5 underestimates Rdif significantly. Both datasets perform better at monthly mean scale than at daily mean and hourly scale. The mean bias error and root-mean-square error of daily mean estimates are-1.21 W/m2 and 20.06 W/m2 for JiEA and-17.18 W/m2 and 32.42 W/m2 for ERA5, respectively. Regardless of over-or underestimation, correlations of estimated time series of ERA5 and JiEA show high similarity. JiEA reveals a slight decreasing trend at regional scale, but ERA5 shows no significant trend, and neither of them reproduces temporal variability of ground measurements. Data accuracy of ERA5 is more robust than JiEA in time but less in space. Latitudinal dependency is noted for ERA5 while not for JiEA. In addition, spatial distributions of Rdif from ERA5 and JiEA show pronounced discrepancy. Neglect of adjacency effects caused by horizontal photon transport is the main cause for Rdif underestimation of ERA5. Spatial analysis calls for improvements to the representation of clouds, aerosols and water vapor for reproducing fine spatial distribution and seasonal variations of Rdif. © 2020 by the authors.","Atmospheric factor; Spatial pattern; Surface diffuse solar radiation; Temporal trend","Energy utilization; Mean square error; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Adjacency effect; Diffuse solar radiations; Ground measurements; Mean bias errors; Plant productivity; Root mean square errors; Seasonal variation; Temporal variability; Spatial distribution",Article,Scopus

In this paper, we developed a semi-empirical model (Crop-SI) to estimate the yield of the three major crops in the dryland Australian wheatbelt by combining a radiation use efficiency approach with meteorology driven Stress Indices (SI) at critical crop growth stages (e.g., anthesis and grain filling). These crop-specific SI (e.g., drought, heat and cold stress) help explain the impact of high spatial agro-environmental heterogeneity, which lead to substantial improvement in grain yield prediction. Crop-SI explains 87%, 69% and 83% of the observed field-scale grain yield variability with root mean square error of ~0.4, 0.4 and 0.5 t/ha for canola, wheat, and barley, respectively. At the pixel-level, Crop-SI reduces the relative error in grain yield estimation to 34%, 25%, and 20% for canola, wheat, barley, respectively, compared to two benchmark models. By incorporating water- and temperature-driven stresses, Crop-SI's predictive skill in highly variable environments is enhanced. As such, it paves the way for the next generation of agricultural systems models, knowledge products and decision support tools that need to operate at various scales. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Barley; Canola; Crop yield estimation; NDVI; Radiation use efficiency; Remote sensing; Stress index; Wheat","agrometeorology; canola; crop yield; cropping practice; estimation method; light use efficiency; NDVI; photosynthesis; remote sensing; wheat; Brassica napus var. napus; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

These approaches have found broad acceptance but lack real-time and physiological feedback for near-daily management purposes. This is true for broad-acre crops, such as snap bean, which is valued at hundreds of millions of dollars in the annual agricultural market. We aim to investigate the relationships between snap bean yield and plant spectral and biophysical information, collected using a hyperspectral spectroradiometer (400 to 2500 nm). The experiment focused on 48 single snap bean plants (cv. Huntington) in a controlled greenhouse environment during the growth period (69 days). We used applicable accuracy and precision metrics from partial least squares regression and cross-validation methods to evaluate the predictive ability of two harvest stages, namely an early-harvest and late-harvest stage, against our yield indicator (bean pod weight). Four different spectral data sets were used to investigate whether such oversampled, hyperspectral data sets could accurately and precisely model observed variability in yield, in terms of the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE). The objective of our approach hinges on the philosophy that selected spectral bands from this study, i.e., those that best explain yield variability, can be downsampled from a hyperspectral system for use in a more cost-effective, operational multispectral sensor. Our results suggested the optimal period for spectral evaluation of snap bean yield is 20 to 25 or 32 days prior to harvest for the early- and late-harvest stages, respectively, with the best model performing at a low RMSE (3.02 g plant - 1) and a high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.72). An unmanned aerial systems-mounted, affordable, and wavelength-programmable multispectral imager, with bands corresponding to those identified, could provide a near real-time and reliable yield estimate prior to harvest. © The Authors.

These WSNs allow real time monitoring, enabling intelligent decision-making to maximize yields and minimize cost. Designing and deploying a WSN is a challenging and multivariate task, dependent on the considered environment. For example, a need for network synchronization arises in such networks to correlate acquired measurements. This work focuses on the design and installation of a WSN that is capable of facilitating the sensing aspects of smart and precision agriculture applications. A system is designed and implemented to address specific design requirements that are brought about by the considered environment. A simple synchronization scheme is described to provide time-correlated measurements using the sink node’s clock as reference. The proposed system was installed on an olive grove to assess its effectiveness in providing a low-cost system, capable of acquiring synchronized measurements. The obtained results indicate the system’s overall effectiveness, revealing a small but expected difference in the acquired measurements’ time correlation, caused mostly by serial transmission delays, while yielding a plethora of relevant environmental conditions. © 2020 by the authors.

This is the first approach to evaluate macro-and micronutrient content with both machine learning and reflectance/first-derivative data. For this, citrus-leaves collected at a Valencia-orange orchard were used. Their spectral data was measured with a Fieldspec ASD FieldSpec® HandHeld 2 spectroradiometer and the surface reflectance and first-derivative spectra from the spectral range of 380 to 1020 nm (640 spectral bands) was evaluated. A total of 320 spectral signatures were collected, and the leaf-nutrient content (N, P, K, Mg, S, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn) was associated with them. For this, 204,800 (320 x 640) combinations were used. The following machine learning algorithms were used in this framework: k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF). The training methods were assessed based on Cross-Validation and Leave-One-Out. The Relief-F metric of the algorithms' prediction was used to determine the most contributive wavelength or spectral region associated with each nutrient. This approach was able to return, with high predictions (R2), nutrients like N (0.912), Mg (0.832), Cu (0.861), Mn (0.898), and Zn (0.855), and, to a lesser extent, P (0.771), K (0.763), and S (0.727). These accuracies were obtained with different algorithms, but RF was the most suitable to model most of them. The results indicate that, for the Valencia-orange leaves, surface reflectance data is more suitable to predict macronutrients, while first-derivative spectra is better linked to micronutrients.

Crop management, poor soil conditions, and weather uncertainty affect rice production in this region. The objective of this study was to determine the potential impact of climate change on rice yield in the Artibonite Valley of Haiti for future periods (near-term: 2010-2039 and mid-century: 2040-2069) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5) defined by the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The Crop Estimation Resource and Environment Synthesis (CERES)-Rice model of the Decision Support for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) cropping system model was used to perform the simulations using local soil characteristics, meteorological data, and crop management following model calibration with local experimental data. Temperature (maximum and minimum) was predicted to increase during all three rice-growing seasons (spring-summer, summer-autumn, and winter-spring). Under both RCPs (4.5 and 8.5), the simulation results indicated that the ensemble-mean rice yield decreased during the spring-summer and summer-autumn seasons (by 5.1% to 6.6% and by 5.4% to 8.3%, respectively) and increased during the winter-spring season (by 2.3% to 3.6%). Although yield increased during the winter-spring season, the average annual yield was predicted to decrease by 3.6% to 7.1% and by 4.2% to 9.6% for the near-term and mid-century climate periods, respectively.

Statistical or process-based crop models can be used to quantify how yields will respond to these events and future climate change. However, the accuracy of weather-yield relationships derived from crop models, whether statistical or process-based, is dependent on the quality of the underlying input data used to run these models. In this context, a major challenge in many developing countries is the lack of accessible and reliable meteorological datasets. Gridded weather datasets, derived from combinations of in situ gauges, remote sensing, and climate models, provide a solution to fill this gap, and have been widely used to evaluate climate impacts on agriculture in data-scarce regions worldwide. However, these reference datasets are also known to contain important biases and uncertainties. To date, there has been little research to assess how the choice of reference datasets influences projected sensitivity of crop yields to weather. We compare multiple freely available gridded datasets that provide daily weather data over the Indian sub-continent over the period 1983-2005, and explore their implications for estimates of yield responses to weather variability for key crops grown in the region (wheat and rice). Our results show that individual gridded weather datasets vary in their representation of historic spatial and temporal temperature and precipitation patterns across India. We show that these differences create large uncertainties in estimated crop yield responses and exposure to variability in growing season weather, which in turn, highlights the need for improved consideration of input data uncertainty in statistical studies that explore impacts of climate variability and change on agriculture. © 2019 The Author(s).

Measuring evapotranspiration (ET) and its parameters (stomatal conductance (gs), leaf area index (LAI), canopy temperature (Tc), and soil moisture (SM)) across cropping systems is costly and time-consuming. However, interpretation of remotely-sensed data can facilitate the effective assessment of relative ET demands among competing forest landuses. This study develops and tests geospatial models informed by a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), vegetation vigor index (VVI), and other spectral information to estimate ET and its parameters, which are measured on experimental watersheds with young pines and natural understory (YP), switchgrass only (SG), and young pine intercropped with switchgrass (IC). The treatment watersheds were replicated on three sites located across the Southeastern U.S. in Carteret, NC; Calhoun, MS; and Greene, AL. Despite the growth inconsistency for the SG only treatment, remote modeling estimation of ET parameters yielded an acceptable R2 &gt; 0.70, and the ET model yielded R2 of 0.50 and a standard error of prediction of 0.94. However, ET and ET parameter model estimation for the IC performed somewhat less satisfactorily, with an R2 of 0.47, 0.59, 0.56, 0.81, and 0.57 for ET, LAI, gs, Tc, and SM, respectively, potentially due to inconsistencies in Landsat image pixel size and landuse homogeneity. Moreover, ET parameter models for the YP site performed rather poorly, with R2 = 0.28, 0.63, and 0.76 for LAI, gs, and Tc, respectively. Additionally, image analysis automation was created with Python scripting and geospatial models. The findings from this study suggest that inclusion of more spatial variability, sound data mining, ultra-high resolution imagery and advanced image processing approaches to account for potential modeling uncertainties can enhance the predictive capability of models to remotely estimate environmental parameters including ET. Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) based models provided promising results for estimating ET and ET parameters using remotely-sensed digital information when they are prepared with advanced data mining, but it is likely that laypersons may find these models difficult to use. However, forest managers with access to neural network software can use our devised RBFN training models for estimating those forest hydrologic parameters with better accuracy. © 2019","ArcGIS ModelBuilder; Canopy temperature; Data mining; Evapotranspiration; Landsat; Orthoimagery; Python script; RBFN; Software development; Soil moisture; SPOT; Stomatal conductance; Visual basics studios","Budget control; Computer software; Data mining; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; High level languages; Image enhancement; Personnel training; Radial basis function networks; Remote sensing; Software design; Software engineering; Soil moisture; Uncertainty analysis; Vegetation; Watersheds; ArcGIS ModelBuilder; Canopy temperature; LANDSAT; Orthoimagery; Python script; RBFN; SPOT; Stomatal conductance; Parameter estimation; ArcGIS; automation; coniferous tree; cropping practice; data mining; evapotranspiration; grass; image analysis; image processing; intercropping; Landsat; remote sensing; software; soil moisture; stomatal conductance; Panicum virgatum",Article,Scopus

However, compared to drought impact, the impact of excessive rainfall on crop yield remains unresolved. Here, we present observational evidence from crop yield and insurance data that excessive rainfall can reduce maize yield up to −34% (−17 ± 3% on average) in the United States relative to the expected yield from the long-term trend, comparable to the up to −37% loss by extreme drought (−32 ± 2% on average) from 1981 to 2016. Drought consistently decreases maize yield due to water deficiency and concurrent heat, with greater yield loss for rainfed maize in wetter areas. Excessive rainfall can have either negative or positive impact on crop yield, and its sign varies regionally. Excessive rainfall decreases maize yield significantly in cooler areas in conjunction with poorly drained soils, and such yield loss gets exacerbated under the condition of high preseason soil water storage.

Hebei Province is the major production area of corn in China, and faces serious groundwater overexploitation due to irrigation. Corn was mapped using multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. A total of 1712 scenes of Sentinel-2 data and 206 scenes of Sentinel-1 data acquired from June to October 2017 were processed to composite image metrics as input to a random forest (RF) classifier. To avoid speckle noise in the classification results, the pixel-based classification result was integrated with the object segmentation boundary completed in eCognition software to generate an object-based corn map according to crop intensity. The results indicated that the approach using multitemporal SAR and optical images in the GEE cloud platform is reliable for corn mapping. The corn map had a high F1-Score of 90.08% and overall accuracy of 89.89% according to the test dataset, which was not involved in model training. The corn area estimated from optical and SAR images was well correlated with the census data, with an R2 = 0.91 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 470.90 km2.

Low tropics lands cattle, face the challenge to adapt the production systems to the climate change consequences, wich has generated longer dry seasons and more food shortage for the animals during these periods. Objective. The objective of this literature review was to collect and analyze research results on shrubs forage species Tithonia diverfisolia, Gliricidia sepium, Cratylia argentea, and Crescentia cujete as a strategy to improve the nutritional offer in livestock in the low tropics. Development. In Colombia, beef cattle production is mainly located in the low tropics, and usually have feeding problems due to poor grasses quality and low availability in drought period. Silvopastoral systems (SSP) contribute to improve the productive and reproductive performance of cattle, since they integrate trees and/or shrubs, and grasses, combining diverse forage strata, with a greater nutritional and forage offer than conventional systems. The shrubs T. diverfisolia, G. sepium, C. argentea, y C. cujete due to their multipurpose characteristics, biomass production, and adaptation to diverse climatic and edaphic conditions, have been used in grazing, fodder banks, live fences and forage conservation, e.g. silage. Conclusion. Due to their characteristics, uses, biomass production, and nutritional profile, it would be pertinent to evaluate the behavior of these species in feeding strategies in cattle farms under tropics conditions. © 2019 Universidad de Costa Rica.

Therefore, this study proposed an approach estimating paddy rice yield based on global and local regression models. In our study area, the overall per-field data might not available because it took lots of time and manpower as well as resources. Therefore, we gathered and accumulated 26 to 63 ground survey sample fields, accounting for about 0.05% of the total cultivated areas, as the training samples for our regression models. To demonstrate whether the spatial autocorrelation or spatial heterogeneity exists and dominates the estimation, global models including the ordinary least squares (OLS), support vector regression (SVR), and the local model geographically weighted regression (GWR) were used to build the yield estimation models. We obtained the representative independent variables, including 4 original bands, 11 vegetation indices, and 32 texture indices, from SPOT-7 multispectral satellite imagery. To determine the optimal variable combination, feature selection based on the Pearson correlation was used for all of the regression models. The case study in Central Taiwan rendered that the error rate was between 0.06% and 13.22%. Through feature selection, the GWR model's performance was more relatively stable than the OLS model and nonlinear SVR model for yield estimation. Where the GWR model considers the spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity of the relationships between the yield and the independent variables, the OLS and nonlinear SVR models lack this feature; this led to the rice yield estimation of GWR in this study be more stable than those of the other two models. © 2019 by the authors.","Geographically weighted regression; Grey-level co-occurrence matrix; Support vector regression; Vegetation indices; Yield estimation","Autocorrelation; Feature extraction; Food supply; Satellite imagery; Textures; Vegetation; Geographically weighted regression; Grey level co-occurrence matrixes; Support vector regression (SVR); Vegetation index; Yield estimation; Regression analysis",Article,Scopus

Field-scale models have increased our understanding of rice yield and its estimation under theoretical environmental conditions. However, they offer little information on spatial variability effects on farm-scale yield. Remote Sensing (RS) is a useful tool to upscale yield estimates from farm scales to regional levels. Much research used RS with rice models for reliable yield estimation. As several countries start to operationalize rice monitoring systems, it is needed to synthesize current literature to identify knowledge gaps, to improve estimation accuracies, and to optimize processing. This paper critically reviewed significant developments in using geospatial methods, imagery, and quantitative models to estimate rice yield. First, essential characteristics of rice were discussed as detected by optical and radar sensors, band selection, sensor configuration, spatial resolution, mapping methods, and biophysical variables of rice derivable from RS data. Second, various empirical, process-based, and semi-empirical models that used RS data for spatial estimation of yield were critically assessed–discussing how major types of models, RS platforms, data assimilation algorithms, canopy state variables, and RS variables can be integrated for yield estimation. Lastly, to overcome current constraints and to improve accuracies, several possibilities were suggested–adding new modeling modules, using alternative canopy variables, and adopting novel modeling approaches. As rice yields are expected to decrease due to global warming, geospatial rice yield estimation techniques are indispensable tools for climate change assessments. Future studies should focus on resolving the current limitations of estimation by precise delineation of rice cultivars, by incorporating dynamic harvesting indices based on climatic drivers, using innovative modeling approaches with machine learning. © 2021 Wuhan University.

The traditional methods of yield assessment are costly, inefficient, and considered a bottleneck in modern precision agriculture. Recent advances in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and development of sensors have opened a new avenue for data acquisition cost-effectively and rapidly. We evaluated UAV-based multispectral and thermal images for in-season GY prediction using 30 winter wheat genotypes under 3 water treatments. For this, multispectral vegetation indices (VIs) and normalized relative canopy temperature (NRCT) were calculated and selected by the gray relational analysis (GRA) at each growth stage, i.e., jointing, booting, heading, flowering, grain filling, and maturity to reduce the data dimension. The elastic net regression (ENR) was developed by using selected features as input variables for yield prediction, whereas the entropy weight fusion (EWF) method was used to combine the predicted GY values from multiple growth stages. In our results, the fusion of dual-sensor data showed high yield prediction accuracy [coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.527–0.667] compared to using a single multispectral sensor (R2 = 0.130–0.461). Results showed that the grain filling stage was the optimal stage to predict GY with R2 = 0.667, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.881 t ha–1, relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) = 15.2%, and mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.721 t ha–1. The EWF model outperformed at all the individual growth stages with R2 varying from 0.677 to 0.729. The best prediction result (R2 = 0.729, RMSE = 0.831 t ha–1, RRMSE = 14.3%, and MAE = 0.684 t ha–1) was achieved through combining the predicted values of all growth stages. This study suggests that the fusion of UAV-based multispectral and thermal IR data within an ENR-EWF framework can provide a precise and robust prediction of wheat yield.

We used machine learning to link daily climatic data with annual winter wheat yields from 1985 to 2018. We differentiated the impacts of long-term climatic conditions (e.g., temperature) and weather extremes (e.g., heat waves) on yields during the distinct developmental stages of winter wheat. Our results suggest that climatic and weather variables alone explained 54% of the wheat yield variability at the country level. Heat waves, tropical night waves, frost, and drought conditions, particularly during the reproductive and grain filling phase, constitute key factors that compromised wheat yields in Ukraine. Assessing the impacts of weather extremes on crop yields is urgent to inform strategies that help cushion farmers against growing production risks because these extremes will likely become more frequent and intense with climate change. © 2021, The Author(s).","Agriculture; Climatic change; Extreme events; Random forests; Ukraine; Yield variability","Climate change; Decision trees; Machine learning; Risk assessment; Climatic changes; Crop yield; Developmental stage; Extreme events; Heatwaves; Ukraine; Weather extremes; Wheat yield; Winter wheat yields; Yield variability; Crops; climate change; crop yield; drought; machine learning; weather forecasting; wheat; Ukraine",Article,Scopus

However, the adaptability of existing hybrids to a changing climate has not been systematically investigated. Therefore, little is known about the appropriate timing of hybrid adaptation. Here, using a novel hybrid model which coupled CERES-Maize with machine learning, we critically investigated the impacts of climate change on maize productivity with an ensemble of hybrid-specific estimations in China. We determined when and where current hybrids would become unviable and hybrid adaptation need be implemented, as well as which hybrid traits would be desirable. Climate change would have mostly negative impacts on maize productivity, and the magnitudes of yield reductions would highly depend on the growth cycle of the hybrids. Hybrid replacement could partially, but not completely, offset the yield loss caused by projected climate change. Without adaptation, approximately 53% of the cultivation areas would require hybrid renewal before 2050 under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios. The medium-maturing hybrids with a long grain-filling duration and a high light use efficiency would be promising, although the ideotypic traits could be different for a specific environment. The findings highlight the necessity and urgency of breeding climate resilient hybrids, providing policy-makers and crop breeders with the early signals of when, where and what hybrids will be required, which stimulate proactive investment to facilitate breeding. The proposed crop modelling approach is scalable, largely data-driven and can be used to tackle the longstanding problem of predicting hybrids' future performance to accelerate development of new crop hybrids. © 2021 The Author(s).

Despite the fact that deep neural network (DNN) models are increasingly applied across a wide range of fields, there are very few attempts to predict leaf photosynthetic capacity (indicated by maximum carboxylation rate, Vcmax, and maximum electron transport rate, Jmax) from reflected information. In this study, we have built a DNN model that uses leaf reflected spectra, alone or together with other leaf traits, for the reliable estimation of photosynthetic capacity, accounting for leaf types and growing periods in cool–temperate deciduous forests. Our results demonstrate that even though DNN models using only the reflectance spectra are capable of estimating both Vcmax and Jmax acceptably, their performance could nevertheless be improved by including information about other leaf biophysical/biochemical traits. The results highlight the fact that leaf spectra and leaf biophysical/biochemical traits are closely linked with leaf photosynthetic capacity, providing a practical and feasible approach to tracing functional traits. However, the DNN models developed in this study should undergo more extensive validation and training before being applied in other regions, and further refinements in future studies using larger datasets from a wide range of ecosystems are also necessary. © 2021 by the authors.

The effective monitoring of EWT in wheat under different nitrogen and water treatments is important for irrigation management in precision agriculture. This study aimed to investigate the performances of machine learning (ML) algorithms in retrieving wheat EWT. For this purpose, a rain shelter experiment (Exp. 1) with four irrigation quantities (0, 120, 240, 360 mm) and two nitrogen levels (75 and 255 kg N/ha), and field experiments (Exps. 2–3) with the same irrigation and rainfall water levels (360 mm) but different nitrogen levels (varying from 75 to 255 kg N/ha) were conducted in the North China Plain. The canopy reflectance was measured for all plots at 30 m using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted multispectral camera.

A feature selection (FS) algorithm named the decision tree (DT) was used as the automatic relevance determination method to obtain the relative relevance of 5 out of 67 vegetation indices (Vis), which were used for estimating EWT. The selected VIs were used to estimate EWT using multiple linear regression (MLR), deep neural network multilayer perceptron (DNN-MLP), artificial neural networks multilayer perceptron (ANN-MLP), boosted tree regression (BRT), and support vector machines (SVMs). The results show that the DNN-MLP with R2 = 0.934, NSE = 0.933, RMSE = 0.028 g/cm2, and MAE of 0.017 g/cm2 outperformed other ML algorithms (ANN-MPL, BRT, and SVM-Polynomial) owing to its high capacity for estimating EWT as compared to other ML methods. Our findings support the conclusion that ML can potentially be applied in combination with VIs for retrieving EWT.

The CALCINEURIN B-LIKE PROTEIN (CBL) is a vital family of plant calcium sensor proteins that can transmit Ca2+ signals triggered by environmental stimuli including salt stress. Therefore, assessing the potential of NtCBL for genetic improvement of salt stress is valuable. In our studies on NtCBL members, constitutive overexpression of NtCBL5A was found to cause salt supersensitivity with necrotic lesions on leaves. NtCBL5A-overexpressing (OE) leaves tended to curl and accumulated high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under salt stress. The supersensitivity of NtCBL5A-OE leaves was specifically induced by Na+, but not by Cl−, osmotic stress, or drought stress. Ion content measurements indicated that NtCBL5A-OE leaves showed sensitivity to the Na+ accumulation levels that wild-type leaves could tolerate. Furthermore, transcriptome profiling showed that many immune response-related genes are significantly upregulated and photosynthetic machinery-related genes are significantly downregulated in salt-stressed NtCBL5A-OE leaves. In addition, the expression of several cation homeostasis-related genes was also affected in salt-stressed NtCBL5A-OE leaves. In conclusion, the constitutive overexpression of NtCBL5A interferes with the normal salt stress response of tobacco plants and leads to Na+-dependent leaf necrosis by enhancing the sensitivity of transgenic leaves to Na+. This Na+ sensitivity of NtCBL5A-OE leaves might result from the abnormal Na+ compartmentalization, plant photosynthesis, and plant immune response triggered by the constitutive overexpression of NtCBL5A. Identifying genes and pathways involved in this unusual salt stress response can provide new insights into the salt stress response of tobacco plants. © Copyright © 2021 Mao, Yuan, Mo, An, Shi, Visser, Bai, Sun, Liu, Liu, Wang and van der Linden.","CBL PROTEIN; immune response; Na+; necrotic lesions; photosystem; reactive oxygen species; salt stress; tobacco",,Article,Scopus

The evaluation of the opportunity for integrating aquaponics into Romania, at a large scale, is evaluated using forecast analysis comparison between Romania and the European Union (EU), by applying six methods (exponential smoothing, Holt, Holt exponential, Holt damped, ARIMA, LSTM). Thus, comparative forecast analysis between Romania and the EU average values were developed considering four dimensions, as follows: aquaculture production, agriculture plant production for main species suitable to be cultivated in aquaponics conditions, organic agriculture surface and the amount of pesticides and insecticides used. Romania's aquaculture production forecast indicates a superior upward trend compared with the EU average. Also, the agriculture production of the main plant species suitable for cultivation in aquaponics conditions records an inconsistent decreasing trend in Romania, compared with the upward trend recorded by analyzing the EU average value. The forecast of organic agriculture surface in Romania emphasizes a higher increasing trend compared to the EU average, situation which reveals a sustainable development direction, confirmed also by the decreasing forecasted trend of the amount of pesticides and insecticides used in agriculture.

Yet the productivity of the major cereals - rice, wheat, and maize - in the region are far lower than their potential. Nutrient management plays a crucial role in improving cereal yields and economic return, and continued improvement in nutrient management practices and their on-farm implementation is required to develop locally relevant solutions that are site-specific, easy-to-develop and geared towards system resilience. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to conduct the comparative assessment of three nutrient management strategies for the three major cereals considering productivity, profitability and nutrient use efficiencies (NUE); estimate their potential yields and yield gaps; and explain the causes of yield variability across farmer-participatory on-farm trials in the EIGP of Nepal. METHODS: We compared three nutrient management strategies (farmer's fertilizer practice- FP, government recommendation -GR, and Nutrient Expert®- NE-based recommendation), in 600 on-farm trials. We used the NE DSS tool, APSIM – a cropping system simulation model, and machine learning (ML) approaches (Linear Mixed Effect model -LME; and Random Forest model - RF) for the three cereals using data from those trials. The NE and APSIM were chosen due to simplicity in use and their wider evaluation and application in fertilizer recommendation yield prediction; RF was chosen due to its robustness in predictive ability and identifying and ranking factors determining yield or other variables of interest. RESULTS: The NE-based fertilizer recommendations for maize, wheat and rice increased yield by about 3.5, 1.4, and 1.3 t ha−1 respectively, increased profits, and improved NUE over FP or GR. The risk analysis showed that at a given probability level, NE always resulted in higher yields of all cereals than GR or FP. APSIM identified 25th June as optimum transplanting date for rice and 10th December as optimum sowing date for maize and wheat and simulated long-term average potential yield of 7–7.5, 5–5.5 and 13–13.3 t ha−1 respectively for rice, wheat and maize. There were larger yield gaps between PY and FP (2.6–8.5 t ha−1) than PY and NE (2.0–3.7 t ha−1) across crops and villages. The LME model showed highly significant treatment and location effects for grain yield of all cereals. The point estimate of the difference for grain yield as estimated by Tukey's HSD test was highest for NE-FP and lowest for GR-FP for all crops. The RF model identified grain N uptake for rice and grain P and K uptakes for wheat and maize as most influential factors contributing to their grain yield under each nutrient management strategy. CONCLUSIONS: The NE-based nutrient management had significant effects over FP and GR leading to positive changes on yield and economic performance under varied growing environments. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings based on novel tools and approaches have important policy implications for increasing food security and profits from the major cereals by refining or improving the GR or FP and increasing their NUE in Nepal. Studies with larger sample size across varied agro-climatic zones in the EIGP and much of South Asia would help policy makers consider DSS tools and ML approaches suitable for upscaling and large-scale adoption by smallholder farmers. © 2021","APSIM; Partial factor productivity; Partial nutrient balance; Random Forest; Return on investment; Yield gap","agricultural management; cereal; crop production; cropping practice; demand analysis; livelihood; machine learning; nutrient dynamics; nutrient use efficiency; profitability; smallholder; Gangetic Plain; Nepal",Article,Scopus

The spread of fire in enclosed compartments is a highly uncertain and nonlinear process. Hence, in safety-critical cases, any false negatives pose a serious threat to the safety of individuals such as firefighters that are engaged in rescue activities. This work aims to model the nonlinear fire spread behaviour as a temporal, deep learning-based regressive methodology. The objective is to efficiently identify abrupt and extreme temperature changes that often result in increases of 300+ °C. A major challenge in such time-series models is that of learning from historic time-series samples which are known to suffer from high noise levels, outliers and data imbalance. This work contributes on the development of a convolutional neural network (CNN)-long short-term memory (LSTM) methodology to handle temperature data originating from body-mounted and fixed sensors and develop a temperature increase warning mechanism. The main contribution exploits the contextualisation ability of CNN-LSTM to predict temperature changes in windows of 5–120 s. The model identifies the spatial temperature change patterns via a CNN encoder, which are then fed into an LSTM network. This regression mechanism is trained and validated against a set of unique fire spread conditions and involved live tests ranging from containers to residential and industrial units. The model’s performance was evaluated with MAPE sensitivity analysis against data originating from body-mounted sensors and third-party NIST datasets. The outcome showed an error ranging from 0.89 to 2.05% to 5.46% and 6.23%, respectively. The model efficacy was also evaluated against a range of input–output temperature ranges from 5, 30 to 120-s windows and showed a FN rate of 2.15% for pre-alarm-to-normal and 3.11% for alarm-to-pre-alarm cases in body-mounted sensors and a higher FN rate of 5.14% reported for pre-alarm-to-normal case for the raised platfor sensor tests. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Artificial neural network; Convolutional neural network; Long short-term memory; Recurrent neural network","Accident prevention; Alarm systems; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Fires; Forecasting; Housing; Learning systems; Sensitivity analysis; Time series; Wearable sensors; Body mounted sensors; Extreme temperatures; Modelling and predictions; Personnel safety systems; Temperature changes; Temperature increase; Time series models; Warning mechanisms; Long short-term memory",Article,Scopus

The effect of distance to trees in alley cropping AFS on yield‐related crop parameters has predominantly been studied using point data from transects. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a novel possibility to map plant traits with high spatial resolution and coverage. In the present study, UAV‐borne red, green, blue (RGB) and multispectral imagery was utilized for the prediction of whole crop dry biomass yield (DM) and leaf area index (LAI) of barley at three different conventionally managed silvoarable alley cropping agroforestry sites located in Germany. DM and LAI were modelled using random forest regression models with good accuracies (DM: R² 0.62, nRMSEp 14.9%, LAI: R² 0.92, nRMSEp 7.1%). Important variables for prediction included normalized reflectance, vegetation indices, texture and plant height. Maps were produced from model predictions for spatial analysis, showing significant effects of distance to trees on DM and LAI. Spatial patterns differed greatly between the sampled sites and suggested management and soil effects overriding tree effects across large portions of 96 m wide crop alleys, thus questioning alleged impacts of AFS tree rows on yield distribution in in-tensively managed barley populations. Models based on UAV‐borne imagery proved to be a valu-able novel tool for prediction of DM and LAI at high accuracies, revealing spatial variability in AFS with high spatial resolution and coverage. © 2021 by the authors.

The detection and monitoring of drought are very important to maintain the balance of the grassland ecosystem. The potential of Sun-induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) for drought detection and monitoring were explored in this study. Based on significant negative anomalies of self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index (scPDSI), precipitation (PPT), soil moisture (SM)，surface water storage (SWS), and a significant positive anomaly of land surface temperature (LST), a severe drought event was accurately detected from June to August in 2016 over Hulun Buir Grassland. The far-red SIF was decomposed into its mechanical parts such as SIF, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), normalized by APAR (SIFyield), physiological SIF emission yield (SIFpey), and total emitted SIF (SIFte), which were more sensitive to drought than the vegetation indices (VIs), including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI2), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV). SIF and NIRV represented the SIF indicators and the VIs, respectively, which were most affected by drought, with a decrease of −2.67% and 4.19% in June, 50.93% and 31.76% in July, and 55.58% and 39.44% in August. The correlations between anomalies of SIF indicators, VIs, and anomalies of LST, wind speed (WS) were a strong negative correlation, indicating that their reduction was caused by the anomalies of LST and WS. Moreover, the SIF indicators had a shorter lag time in response to meteorological drought than VIs. Besides, the correlations between SIF-based drought indices such as drought fluorescence monitoring index (DFMI), SIF health index (SHI), and SM were − 0.709 and − 0.783 (P &lt; 0.01), respectively, higher than the conventional drought indices. Moreover, DFMI and SHI could reflect the changes of SM in advance, while the conventional drought indices mostly lagged behind the changes of SM. This study shows that SIF can enhance drought detection, and the SIF-based drought index can be well suitable for drought monitoring. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Decomposing the far-red Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Redundancy analysis; SIF-based drought index; Vegetation index; Wavelet coherence","Chlorophyll; Ecosystems; Fluorescence; Forestry; Infrared devices; Land surface temperature; Soil moisture; Surface waters; Vegetation; Wind; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Enhanced vegetation index; Grassland ecosystems; Meteorological drought; Near infra-red reflectances; Normalized difference vegetation index; Photosynthetically active radiation; Self-calibrating Palmer drought severity indices; Drought; chlorophyll; surface water; chlorophyll; drought; environmental monitoring; fluorescence; grassland; terrestrial ecosystem; vegetation index; wavelet analysis; analytic method; Article; calibration; China; controlled study; decomposing the far red sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence; drought; drought fluorescence monitoring index; enhanced vegetation index; environmental monitoring; environmental parameters; fluorescence; grassland; measurement accuracy; medical parameters; meteorology; modified soil adjusted vegetation index; normalized difference vegetation index; photosynthesis; physiological process; precipitation; priority journal; SIF based drought index; SIF health index; soil moisture; soil temperature; sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence based drought index; time factor; vegetation; vegetation near infrared reflectance; water supply; China",Article,Scopus

The assessed bone age indicates the actual level of growth, whereby a large discrepancy between the assessed and chronological age might point to a growth disorder. Hence, skeletal bone age assessment is used to screen the possibility of growth abnormalities, genetic problems, and endocrine disorders. Usually, the manual screening is assessed through X-ray images of the non-dominant hand using the Greulich–Pyle (GP) or Tanner– Whitehouse (TW) approach. The GP uses a standard hand atlas, which will be the reference point to predict the bone age of a patient, while the TW uses a scoring mechanism to assess the bone age using several regions of interest information. However, both approaches are heavily dependent on individual domain knowledge and expertise, which is prone to high bias in inter and intra-observer results. Hence, an automated bone age assessment system, which is referred to as Attention-Xception Network (AXNet) is proposed to automatically predict the bone age accurately. The proposed AXNet consists of two parts, which are image normalization and bone age regression modules. The image normalization module will transform each X-ray image into a standardized form so that the regressor network can be trained using better input images. This module will first extract the hand region from the background, which is then rotated to an upright position using the angle calculated from the four key-points of interest. Then, the masked and rotated hand image will be aligned such that it will be positioned in the middle of the image. Both of the masked and rotated images will be obtained through existing state-of-the-art deep learning methods. The last module will then predict the bone age through the Attention-Xception network that incorporates multiple layers of spatialattention mechanism to emphasize the important features for more accurate bone age prediction. From the experimental results, the proposed AXNet achieves the lowest mean absolute error and mean squared error of 7.699 months and 108.869 months2, respectively. Therefore, the proposed AXNet has demonstrated its potential for practical clinical use with an error of less than one year to assist the experts or radiologists in evaluating the bone age objectively. © 2021 by the authors.

In winter, grape root is prone to freezing damage owing to natural phenomenon such as early and late frost, and methods to assess disaster risk at the grape parcel level is one of the current research hotspots. However, there are two problems at present; first is the lack of grape parcel maps and second is that scale of disaster risk assessment is limited to the level of administrative divisions and grid systems. Therefore, according to the perennial characteristics of the grapes and clear texture of the open-air grape parcels based on public data sets (Sentinel-2A/B) and high-quality winery address information, combined with Google Earth engine (GEE) platform, Google Earth, and Ovitalmap, this study designs a collection scheme of open-air grape parcel samples and non-grape parcel samples, analyzes the environmental characteristics of the distribution of high-quality wineries, constructs a classification feature database in three aspects (time, terrain, and vegetation), uses the random forest classification method to classify open-air grape parcels in the eastern Helan Mountains in 2019, and conducts a late frost disaster risk assessment of the open-air grape parcel. The results show that: (1) The high-quality wineries are mainly distributed in the elevation of 1106–1240 m, with the average slope of 0.82°, the organic matter content of 10.79–14.27 g/kg, the P content of 24.87–37.58 mg/kg, the K content of 116–166 mg/kg, the pH 8.38–8.55, N content of 0.65–0.98 g/kg, annual average active accumulated temperature ≥10 °C of 3490–3590 °C, annual average rainfall of 189–201 mm, the annual average sunshine duration of 7.3–7.6 h, annual average air temperature of 8.8–9.4 °C, annual average temperature difference of 12.7–13.2 °C, annual average frost-free period at 263–270 d and annual average relative air Humidity of 50–54%. (2) The overall classification accuracy of open-air grape parcels reached 98.96% and the verification accuracy of ground truth parcel samples reached 87.89%. The open-air grape parcels in the eastern Helan Mountains are mainly distributed in Helan County, Xixia District, Yongning County, and Qingtongxia City. (3) The highest risk of late frost was found in Xixia District and the lowest risk in Yongning County. Helan County was higher than Qingtongxia City in the medium risk of late frost. The typical small area high risk includes Liangtian Town, the experimental field of Ningxia Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences in Zhenbeibao Town, Yuhuang Winery in Ganchengzi Village, and the State-run Warm Spring Farm in Helan County. Thus, the sample collection and augmentation scheme are feasible, the open-air grape classification accuracy is high and its result is consistent with field investigation, which can provide accurate parcel-level disaster risk assessment and provide decision support for agricultural departments and farmers. © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

While improved estimates of cover crop N benefits could help promote their adoption, little information is currently available at the broad scale. We conducted a multi-site study to determine whether use of satellite images and site factors could fill this gap. Six spectral indices were extracted from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and used with modeling covariates to estimate cover crop properties and biomass N credits (biomass × N contents). The partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were calibrated and validated with samples from 42 cover crop fields located in the midwestern and northeastern United States collected in 2017–2018. Remote sensing (RS)-derived spectral indices strongly correlated (r &gt;.7) with red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) but not with rye (Secale cereale L.) biomass. Growing degree days (GDDs), cover height, ground cover percentage, and temperature often had high importance (variable importance in projection &gt;1) in PLSR models. Model predictive power was limited for estimates of biomass N credits when data from all validation sites and cover types were used (adjusted [adj] R2 =.52). However, models for both biomass (adj R2 =.81) and biomass N credits (adj R2 =.89) were successful for red clover fields. This suggests N benefits could be more effectively modeled for specific cover crop types. We also found RS-based estimation of C/N ratios performed moderately well when applied to the complete dataset (adj R2 =.54), suggesting a way to differentiate grass and legume cover crops that can potentially inform biogeochemical models. © 2020 The Authors.

However, due to its long-term nature and heterogeneity across farms and landscapes, it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate its contribution in building the resilience of farming systems to climate change over large areas. In this study, we developed an approach to simulate and emulate the shading, micro-climate regulation and biomass effects of multi-purpose trees agroforestry system on maize yields using APSIM, taking Ethiopia as a case study. Applying the model to simulate climate change impacts showed that at national level, maize yield will increase by 7.5 and 3.1 % by 2050 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively. This projected increase in national-level maize yield is driven by maize yield increases in six administrative zones whereas yield losses are expected in other five zones (mean of −6.8% for RCP2.6 and −11.7% for RCP8.5), with yields in the other four zones remaining stable overtime. Applying the emulated agroforestry leads to increase in maize yield under current and future climatic conditions compared to maize monocultures, particularly in regions for which yield losses under climate change are expected. A 10% agroforestry shade will reduce maize yield losses by 6.9% (RCP2.6) and 4.2 % (RCP8.5) while 20% shade will reduce maize yield losses by 11.5% (RCP2.6) and 11% (RCP8.5) for projected loss zones. Overall, our results show quantitatively that agroforestry buffers yield losses for areas projected to have yield losses under climate change in Ethiopia, and therefore should be part of building climate-resilient agricultural systems.

Nitrogen (N) deficiency frequently contributes to the gap, but it is difficult to predict an appropriate rate of N to apply because of uncertainty about the forthcoming season and hence water limited potential yield and crop N requirements. We investigated closing the water limited yield gap attributable to N supply by maintaining a “bank” of soil mineral N that is nonlimiting for wheat yields in most seasons. The yield, loss of NO3−-N in leaching and denitrification, and gross margins of wheat crops were simulated at four Australian locations with contrasting soil types and potential yields, in response to N inputs calculated by reference to N banks ranging from 50 to 400 kg N ha-1, the Yield Prophet® decision support tool and the national average N rate. The N bank providing best yields at each location was close in amount to the long-term average rate calculated with Yield Prophet®. Compared to the national average rate of N fertiliser application (45 kg N ha-1), the highest-yielding N bank treatment on average increased the amount of N applied by 3–234 kg N ha-1, the fraction of water limited potential yield by 0.0 to 0.61, and gross margins by AUD 0–1,026 ha-1. Combined losses of N to the environment in NO3−leaching and through denitrification in these strategies also increased but by a disproportionately small amount compared to the increase in the amount applied (-3 to 8.5 kg N ha-1). These losses were relatively insensitive to the amount of N applied at three of the four locations; at the fourth location large episodic losses could occur from sandy soil despite low rainfall when the N bank exceeded water limited potential yield. The N bank approach to determining fertiliser rate has potential to sustainably reduce the yield gap where the target amount is matched to average site-specific yield potential. © 2020","APSIM; Denitrification; Gross margins; Nitrate leaching; Yield prophet","denitrification; leaching; precipitation intensity; sandy soil; soil nitrogen; water use efficiency; wheat; yield response",Article,Scopus

In fact, this approach may lead to inefficient N use by the crop, resulting in both economic losses and environmental issues. To overcome these drawbacks, several optical-oriented, site-specific management systems have been developed to consider the effect of the aforementioned sources of variability and modulate N applications to the actual crop nutrient status and requirements. In this study, a novel approach that integrates proximal sensing, seasonal weather forecasts and crop modelling to manage site-specific N fertilization in durum wheat is proposed. This approach is based on four successive steps: (1) optimal N supply is estimated by means of a crop model fed with a mix of observed and forecast weather data; (2) actual crop N uptake is estimated using proximal sensing; (3) N prescription maps are created merging crop model and proximal sensing information; (4) N-Variable Rate Application (N-VRA). The aforementioned approach was implemented in a 13.6-ha field characterized by large soil variability in texture and organic matter content. Results indicated that the system was able to capture spatial variability in crop N uptake and manage N distribution through N-VRA leading to a substantial reduction of the spatial variability in yield and protein content while reducing the total amount of N supplied compared to uniform treatments. However, further advances are necessary to improve model performances. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Durum wheat; Fertilization; Nitrogen; Proximal Sensing; Variable rate","agricultural modeling; crop yield; environmental issue; fertilizer application; forecasting method; nitrogen; nutrient dynamics; optimization; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; wheat; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum",Article,Scopus

Each one focuses on a different story about which model is more appropriate. Therefore, finding a suitable model remains a difficult task due to the remotely sensed data issues and the complexity of the vegetation cover change process. Despite the unicity of vegetation indices time series, the forecasting assessment relies basically on the commonly used forecast error measurements (e.g. Mean Square Error (MSE), Root MSE (RMSE), and the symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE), etc.) which may not reflect the real potential of the fitted forecasting model. Herein, the experimentation of forecasting vegetation indices employing two univariate time series models and new accuracy metrics is discussed. Box Jenkins models (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model) and neural network model (nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) model) are applied individually and coupled (NAR-NAR and NAR-ARIMA) based on a multi-resolution analysis-wavelet transform. These models’ forecasting ability is evaluated using 16-days Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data of two different vegetation cover types of northwestern area in Tunisia. The major finding highlights firstly the importance of integration of the decomposition step to show off the hidden components of vegetation indices. The commonly used accuracy measures show that the coupled neural networks model outperforms other models. Then, interesting conclusions were drawn when phenological metrics are used as performance measures. Herein, Box Jenkins forecasting model generates a better NDVI curve shape than hybrid models despite their low RMSE measures. This is mainly due to good estimation of some phenological events, namely, the amplitude, the peak and the season’s length. Generally, Box Jenkin model excels at handling quick variations. By contrast, combined models show better phenological metrics’ estimation when the observations are complex or describe long time periods. Based on these findings, we suggest that the choice of the evaluation metric must be related to the future forecaster interest. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Autoregressive moving average model; Complex networks; Errors; Forestry; Mean square error; Neural networks; Radiometers; Time series; Vegetation; Wavelet transforms; Coupled neural networks; Mean absolute percentage error; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Neural network model; Normalized difference vegetation index time series; Remotely sensed data; Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving averages (ARIMA); Univariate time series models; Forecasting; accuracy assessment; cereal; forecasting method; forest cover; MODIS; NDVI; phenology; vegetation index; Tunisia",Article,Scopus

Commodity flows are a key data needed to compute virtual water but are typically available every 5 years in the United States (US). The lack of continuous, annual commodity flow data severely limits our ability to study and understand the drivers, evolution, and alterations of virtual water in the US. We build and evaluate a machine learning model using Random Forest (RF) to predict annual commodity and virtual water flow networks. The model is used to perform several modeling experiments and illustrate the prediction of annual virtual water flows in the US during 2013–2018. We show that the RF predictions consistently outperform those from a gravity model. The overall performance of the RF algorithm improves as commodities or regions are aggregated into coarser groups. Likewise, the inclusion of past commodity flows as an additional explanatory variable enhances the RF performance. The combination of RF classification and regression allows predicting both network connections and flows without comprising performance. Based on our RF predictions for 2013–2018, we find that temporal variations in virtual water flows can be large for some regions in the US, underscoring the need addressed by this study of reconstructing domestic virtual water changes over time. By capturing inter-regional water consumption interactions in space and time, such reconstructed data could be beneficial in the future for anticipating and managing local and regional water scarcity. © 2020","Complex network; Gravity model; Random forest; Spatial network; Trade; Water footprint","Decision trees; E-learning; Forecasting; Hydraulics; Machine learning; Random forests; Turing machines; Explanatory variables; Indispensable tools; Machine learning models; Network connection; Temporal variation; Virtual water-flow; Water requirements; Water sustainability; Flow of water; algorithm; classification; machine learning; regression analysis; spatial data; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; temporal variation; trade; water flow; water footprint; water management; United States",Article,Scopus

The Rio Loco watershed (RLW) in southwest Puerto Rico has been extensively modified, currently comprised of small mountainous rivers connected by reservoirs and irrigation canals to the Lajas Valley Agricultural Reserve (LVAR). The RLW has regularly supplied sediment to Guánica Bay; however, the total annual yield and subbasins most responsible have remained unknown. We estimated sediment yield for the lower RLW using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in separate scenarios to assess a range of conditions; a dry season scenario that modeled flow through the irrigation system and a wet season scenario that modeled flow through the natural river channel. Precipitation was similarly correlated with sediment yield in both seasons, with 1.5× more sediment per month predicted during the wet than dry season. The distribution of sediment yield among subbasins was the same in both seasons. The foothills north of the cement lined irrigation canal and subbasin north of Lago Loco were the largest source of sediment, both combined to produce nearly 40% of the total sediment reaching Guánica Bay. The next largest source was from subbasins that comprised a combination of agricultural and suburban land uses. Relative basin-scale model outputs for both the irrigation system and natural channel agree with empirical measurements from 2015. The SWAT model output provided some guidance and justification for sediment management strategies in the foothills, upstream of Lago Loco, and within the LVAR. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coral reef ecosystems; Puerto Rico; Seasonal precipitation; Sediment yield; SWAT; Watershed model","dry season; flow modeling; irrigation system; river channel; sediment yield; soil and water assessment tool; spatial distribution; watershed; wet season; Puerto Rico; Anthozoa; Nica",Article,Scopus

As a rapid and nondestructive approach, the analysis of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based imagery may be of assistance to estimate N and height. The main objective of this study is to present an approach to predict leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC, g kg−1) and PH (m) with machine learning techniques and UAV-based multispectral imagery in maize plants. An experiment with 11 maize cultivars under two rates of N fertilization was carried during the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 crop seasons. The spectral vegetation indices (VI) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference red-edge index (NDRE), green normalized difference vegetation (GNDVI), and the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) were extracted from the images and, in a computational system, used alongside the spectral bands as input parameters for different machine learning models. A randomized 10-fold cross-validation strategy, with a total of 100 replicates, was used to evaluate the performance of 9 supervised machine learning (ML) models using the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of regression (R2), and root mean square error (RMSE) metrics. The results indicated that the random forest (RF) algorithm performed better, with r and RMSE, respectively, of 0.91 and 1.9 g.kg−1 for LNC, and 0.86 and 0.17 m for PH. It was also demonstrated that VIs contributed more to the algorithm’s performances than individual spectral bands. This study concludes that the RF model is appropriate to predict both agronomic variables in maize and may help farmers to monitor their plants based upon their LNC and PH diagnosis and use this knowledge to improve their production rates in the subsequent seasons. © 2020 by the authors.

Flash floods triggered by thunderstorms are frequent in the high mountainous area of Hindukush Himalaya in the north of Pakistan. The current study employed two widely used approaches for flash flood risk modeling, i.e., morphometric ranking approaches (MRAs) and El-Shamy’s approach to analyzing their effectiveness for flash flood susceptibility modeling in Swat river watershed, district Swat, Pakistan. The digital elevation model was utilized to delineate the watershed and drainage network using the ArcHydro tool of ArcGIS. A total of 15 morphometric parameters have been used for flash flood modeling. The analysis suggests that the Swat river watershed consists of 17 sub-basins. The MRA-based flash flood risk assessment suggests that sub-basins B1 and B2 (12% of total sub-basins) are highly susceptible to flash flooding. While sub-basins B4, B6, B11, B13, and B17 (59% of the total sub-basin) are moderately susceptible to flash flood risk. El-Shamy-based modeling suggests that sub-basins B12, B14, and B16 (18% of total sub-basins) have high flood susceptibility while sub-basin B5 has the lowest. The field observation and 2010 flood reports by WHO and NDMA suggest that the flash flood susceptibility modeling results by the MRA are more accurate as compared with El-Shamy’s approach.

In this paper, a long-term observation was conducted for the yield prediction of maize using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and estimations of chlorophyll contents using SPAD-502. A new vegetation index termed as modified red blue VI (MRBVI) was developed to monitor the growth and to predict the yields of maize by establishing relationships between MRBVIand SPAD-502-based chlorophyll contents. The coefficients of determination (R2s) were 0.462 and 0.570 in chlorophyll contents’ estimations and yield predictions using MRBVI, and the results were relatively better than the results from the seven other commonly used VI approaches. All VIs during the different growth stages of maize were calculated and compared with the measured values of chlorophyll contents directly, and the relative error (RE) of MRBVI is the lowest at 0.355. Further, machine learning (ML) methods such as the backpropagation neural network model (BP), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme learning machine (ELM) were adopted for predicting the yields of maize. All VIs calculated for each image captured during important phenological stages of maize were set as independent variables and the corresponding yields of each plot were defined as dependent variables. The ML models used the leave one out method (LOO), where the root mean square errors (RMSEs) were 2.157, 1.099, 1.146, and 1.698 (g/hundred grain weight) for BP, SVM, RF, and ELM. The mean absolute errors (MAEs) were 1.739, 0.886, 0.925, and 1.356 (g/hundred grain weight) for BP, SVM, RF, and ELM, respectively. Thus, the SVM method performed better in predicting the yields of maize than the other ML methods. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that the MRBVI calculated from images acquired at different growth stages integrated with advanced ML methods should be used for agricultural-and ecological-related chlorophyll estimation and yield predictions. © 2020 by the authors.

For efficient management and adaptation measures, it is important to understand the relative effect of climate variability and anthropogenic influences. The Nagavalli River Basin (NRB), located in India, has experienced significant changes in hydroclimatic variables and land use in the last decade and therefore serves an ideal basin for investigating the attribution of rainfall variability and land-use changes. In this study, the characteristics of precipitation, temperature, and streamflow were analyzed for the period 1970-2012. It was observed that there is a significant increasing trend in precipitation and streamflow. Further, there have been substantial land-use change in terms of scrubland conversion. Investigations on rainfall-runoff coherency using wavelet coherence showed that there were noteworthy changes during the periods of 1991-2001 and 2002-2012. The contributions of land-use and rainfall variability to the changes in the streamflow were quantified using a semidistributed hydrological model (Soil Water Assessment Tool). The results showed that for the whole NRB, the variations of mean annual streamflow in 2002-2012 were primarily affected by rainfall variability with reference to 1990s, whereas human activities played a complementary role. The quantitative assessment revealed that rainfall variability resulted in an increase in runoff by 103 mm in 2002-2012 for the whole catchment, accounting for 41.52% of runoff changes relative to the 1990s. However, land-use changes are responsible for a decrease in runoff by 59 mm during the period of 2002-2012, which accounts for -23.54% of runoff changes. Overall, it was observed that the agricultural intensification in terms of scrubland conversion counteracted the effect of rainfall variability, resulting in the reduction in the margin of increase in streamflow. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Agricultural intensification; Attribution of land-use and rainfall variability; Increased streamflow; Nagavalli River Basin","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Catchments; Rain; Runoff; Soil moisture; Stream flow; Tropics; Watersheds; Agricultural intensification; Anthropogenic influence; Efficient managements; Hydroclimatic variables; Hydrological modeling; Quantitative assessments; Rainfall variability; Soil water assessment tool; Land use; agricultural intensification; anthropogenic effect; climate variation; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; land use change; rainfall; river basin; runoff; streamflow; India",Article,Scopus

The sensitivities of Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model were tested for changes in horizontal resolution (convection permitting versus parameterized) on the replication of West African monsoon for the year 2014. Sensitivity test was also performed for response of rainfall to changes in microphysics (MP) and planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes. Generally, the result shows that WRF is able to replicates rainfall distribution with an adequate representation of the dynamical features of West African monsoon system. The high-resolution (wrf-4km) shows dry bias along the coast of the Gulf of Guinea but generally outperforms wrf-24km run especially in replication of the extreme rainfall distribution. The dry bias along the coastal area is suggested to not to be only related to convection but mostly to microphysics and PBL parameterisation schemes. Differences were noticed between the dynamics of WRF and ERA-interim outputs despite the use of spectral nudging in the experiment which then suggest strong interactions between scales. These differences were observed to be restricted mainly to the low-layer monsoon flow in JJA. Both runs at 24 and 4 km hardly simulate the typical diurnal distribution of rainfall. The sensitivity of WRF to MP (only sophisticated MP were tested) and PBL reveals a stronger impact of PBL than MP on rainfall distribution and the most significant added value over the Guinean coast and surroundings area was provided by the configurations using non-local PBL scheme (as ACM2). The changes in MP and PBL schemes in general seem to have less effect on the explicit runs (wrf-4km) in the replication of the rainfall over the Gulf of Guinea and the surroundings seaboard. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Convection permitting; High resolution; Parameterization; Rainfall; West Africa monsoon; WRF","atmospheric convection; climate modeling; climate variation; computer simulation; extreme event; monsoon; rainfall; regional climate; spatial distribution; Atlantic Ocean; Guinea; Gulf of Guinea",Article,Scopus

As opposed to waiting until the harvest season, multispectral imagery using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are capable of measuring the canopy metrics and vegetation indices (VIs) traits at different time points of the growth cycle. This resourceful time series aerial image processing with appropriate analytical framework is very important for the automatic extraction of phenotypic features from the image data. Many studies have demonstrated the usefulness of advanced remote sensing technologies coupled with machine learning (ML) approaches for accurate prediction of valuable crop traits. Until now, Cassava has received little to no attention in aerial image-based phenotyping and ML model testing. Results: To accelerate image processing, an automated image-analysis framework called CIAT Pheno-i was developed to extract plot level vegetation indices/canopy metrics. Multiple linear regression models were constructed at different key growth stages of cassava, using ground-truth data and vegetation indices obtained from a multispectral sensor. Henceforth, the spectral indices/features were combined to develop models and predict cassava root yield using different Machine learning techniques. Our results showed that (1) Developed CIAT pheno-i image analysis framework was found to be easier and more rapid than manual methods. (2) The correlation analysis of four phenological stages of cassava revealed that elongation (EL) and late bulking (LBK) were the most useful stages to estimate above-ground biomass (AGB), below-ground biomass (BGB) and canopy height (CH). (3) The multi-temporal analysis revealed that cumulative image feature information of EL + early bulky (EBK) stages showed a higher significant correlation (r = 0.77) for Green Normalized Difference Vegetation indices (GNDVI) with BGB than individual time points. Canopy height measured on the ground correlated well with UAV (CHuav)-based measurements (r = 0.92) at late bulking (LBK) stage. Among different image features, normalized difference red edge index (NDRE) data were found to be consistently highly correlated (r = 0.65 to 0.84) with AGB at LBK stage. (4) Among the four ML algorithms used in this study, k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) showed the best performance for root yield prediction with the highest accuracy of R2 = 0.67, 0.66 and 0.64, respectively. Conclusion: UAV platforms, time series image acquisition, automated image analytical framework (CIAT Pheno-i), and key vegetation indices (VIs) to estimate phenotyping traits and root yield described in this work have great potential for use as a selection tool in the modern cassava breeding programs around the world to accelerate germplasm and varietal selection. The image analysis software (CIAT Pheno-i) developed from this study can be widely applicable to any other crop to extract phenotypic information rapidly. © 2020 The Author(s).","Above-ground biomass; Automated aerial image processing; Cassava; Machine learning; Multispectral UAV imagery; Root yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

Irrigation plays an essential role in sustaining crop production in water-limited regions, as irrigation water not only benefits crops through fulfilling crops' water demand but also creates an evaporative cooling that mitigates crop heat stress. Here we use satellite remote sensing and maize yield data in the state of Nebraska, USA, combined with statistical models, to quantify the contribution of cooling and water supply to the yield benefits due to irrigation. Results show that irrigation leads to a considerable cooling on daytime land surface temperature (−1.63°C in July), an increase in enhanced vegetation index (+0.10 in July), and 81% higher maize yields compared to rainfed maize. These irrigation effects vary along the spatial and temporal gradients of precipitation and temperature, with a greater effect in dry and hot conditions, and decline toward wet and cool conditions. We find that 16% of irrigation yield increase is due to irrigation cooling, while the rest (84%) is due to water supply and other factors. The irrigation cooling effect is also observed on air temperature (−0.38 to −0.53°C) from paired flux sites in Nebraska. This study highlights the non-negligible contribution of irrigation cooling to the yield benefits of irrigation, and such an effect may become more important in the future with continued warming and more frequent droughts. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","cooling; irrigation; LST; maize yield; water","climate change; crop production; crop yield; global climate; irrigation; maize; remote sensing; vegetation index; water demand; water supply; Midwest; Nebraska; United States; Zea mays; climate change; crop; drought; irrigation (agriculture); maize; temperature; Agricultural Irrigation; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Droughts; Temperature; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Although the potential effects of each of these factors have been discussed in a number of separate studies, no recent synthesis has been published to provide quantitative estimates of climate change impacts on crop yields, with or without adaptation strategies. In this paper, we synthetize a broad range of experimental or modeling studies to estimate, at the global scale, crop yield changes resulting from the marginal and combined effects of temperature, CO2 concentration and precipitation, with and without adaptation strategies. Crop yield sensitivities are estimated by distinguishing between C3 and C4 crops. For C3 crops, our results show that the positive effects of adaptation (+7.25 %) and CO2 (+9% for +100 ppm) are high enough to offset the negative effects of temperature increase (-2.4 % for +1 °C), even at +4 °C. On the other hand, for maize (i.e., the only C4 plant species in our database) the somewhat low positive effect from increased CO2 concentration and the absence of a significant effect of adaptation lead to higher yield losses, in the order of -10 % for +4 °C. The minimum level of CO2 concentration increase requested to achieve a yield gain under increased temperature conditions is much higher for maize than for C3 crops, in particular for wheat. The estimated effects of adaptation are uncertain, especially for soybean and rice, but also for maize, where the absence of a significant adaptation effect is probably at least partly due to limited data availability. Our results demonstrate that CO2 effects on crop yields should not be overlooked in foresight studies on the impacts of climate change. Our analysis also highlights the importance of improving our knowledge of how effective adapation strategies are in mitigating the impact of climate change. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; CO2; Ensemble modelling; Meta-analysis; Yield","adaptive management; agricultural modeling; C4 plant; carbon dioxide; climate change; crop plant; crop yield; global perspective; meta-analysis; rainfall; strategic approach; temperature effect; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The identification of hotspots of the yield gap, where the potential for improvement is the greatest, is a necessary step towards this goal. While crop growth models are well suited to quantify potential yields, they lack the ability to provide accurate large-scale estimates of actual yields, owing to the sheer quantity of data they require for parameterisation. In this context, we sought to provide accurate estimates of actual wheat yields across the Australian wheat belt based on machine-learning regression methods, climate records and satellite image time series. Out of nine base learners and two ensembles, support vector regression with radial basis function emerged as the single best learner (root mean square error of 0.55 t ha−1 and R2 of 0.77 at the pixel level). At national scale, this model explained 73% of the yield variability observed across statistical units. Benchmark approaches based on peak Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and on a harvest index were largely outperformed by the machine-learning regression models (R2 &lt; 0.46). Climate variables such as maximum temperatures and accumulated rainfall provided additional information to the 16-day NDVI time series as they significantly improved yield predictions. Variables observed up to and around the flowering period had a particularly high predictive power with additional information gained from data during grain filling. We further showed that, while all models were sensitive to a reduction of the training set size, a large majority had not reached saturation with a data set of 125 fields (2000 pixels). This indicates that additional training data are likely to further improve the skill of the models. We estimated that observations from 75 fields (1200 pixels) are required for the best single model to reach an R2 of 0.7. We contend that machine-learning regression methods applied to climate and satellite image time series can achieve reliable crop yield monitoring across years at both the pixel and the country scale. The resulting yield estimates meet the accuracy requirements for mapping the yield gap and identifying yield gap hotspots which could be targeted for further work by agricultural researchers and advisers. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

However, the key genetic components responsible for the reduction in cotton yield in saline-Alkali soils are still unclear. Results: Here, we evaluated three main components of lint yield, single boll weight (SBW), lint percentage (LP) and boll number per plant (BNPP), across 316 G. hirsutum accessions under four salt conditions over two years. Phenotypic analysis indicated that LP was unchanged under different salt conditions, however BNPP decreased significantly and SBW increased slightly under high salt conditions. Based on 57,413 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis, a total of 42, 91 and 25 stable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified for SBW, LP and BNPP, respectively. Phenotypic and QTL analysis suggested that there was little correlation among the three traits. For LP, 8 stable QTLs were detected simultaneously in four different salt conditions, while fewer repeated QTLs for SBW or BNPP were identified. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated that their regulatory mechanisms were also quite different. Via transcriptome profile data, we detected that 10 genes from the 8 stable LP QTLs were predominantly expressed during fiber development. Further, haplotype analyses found that a MYB gene (GhMYB103), with the two SNP variations in cis-regulatory and coding regions, was significantly correlated with lint percentage, implying a crucial role in lint yield. We also identified that 40 candidate genes from BNPP QTLs were salt-inducible. Genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and cell structure maintenance were rich in plants grown in high salt conditions, while genes related to ion transport were active in plants grown in low salt conditions, implying different regulatory mechanisms for BNPP at high and low salt conditions. Conclusions: This study provides a foundation for elucidating cotton salt tolerance mechanisms and contributes gene resources for developing upland cotton varieties with high yields and salt stress tolerance. © 2020 The Author(s).","Boll number per plant; Boll weight per plant; Genome-wide association study; Gossypium hirsutum; Lint percentage; Salt stress; Transcriptome analysis","analysis; anatomy and histology; chemistry; cotton; genetic variation; genetics; genome-wide association study; Gossypium; salinity; soil; Cotton Fiber; Genetic Variation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Gossypium; Salinity; Soil",Article,Scopus

Advancing accurate prediction models is of utmost importance to take proper actions.

As an alternative to the susceptible-infected-resistant (SIR)-based models, this study proposes a hybrid machine learning approach to predict the COVID-19, and we exemplify its potential using data from Hungary. The hybrid machine learning methods of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multi-layered perceptron-imperialist competitive algorithm (MLP-ICA) are proposed to predict time series of infected individuals and mortality rate. The models predict that by late May, the outbreak and the total morality will drop substantially. The validation is performed for 9 days with promising results, which confirms the model accuracy. It is expected that the model maintains its accuracy as long as no significant interruption occurs.

Nondestructive crop growth monitoring based on remote sensing technologies can accurately assess crop N status, which may be used to guide the in-season site-specific N recommendations. The fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing is a low-cost, easy-to-operate technology for collecting spectral reflectance imagery, an important data source for precision N management. The relationships between many vegetation indices (VIs) derived from spectral reflectance data and crop parameters are known to be nonlinear. As a result, nonlinear machine learning methods have the potential to improve the estimation accuracy. The objective of this study was to evaluate five different approaches for estimating rice (Oryza sativa L.) aboveground biomass (AGB), plant N uptake (PNU), and N nutrition index (NNI) at stem elongation (SE) and heading (HD) stages in Northeast China: (1) single VI (SVI); (2) stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR); (3) random forest (RF); (4) support vector machine (SVM); and (5) artificial neural networks (ANN) regression. The results indicated that machine learning methods improved the NNI estimation compared to VI-SLR and SMLR methods. The RF algorithm performed the best for estimating NNI (R2 = 0.94 (SE) and 0.96 (HD) for calibration and 0.61 (SE) and 0.79 (HD) for validation). The root mean square errors (RMSEs) were 0.09, and the relative errors were &lt;10% in all the models. It is concluded that the RF machine learning regression can significantly improve the estimation of rice N status using UAV remote sensing. The application machine learning methods offers a new opportunity to better use remote sensing data for monitoring crop growth conditions and guiding precision crop management. More studies are needed to further improve these machine learning-based models by combining both remote sensing data and other related soil, weather, and management information for applications in precision N and crop management. © 2020 by the authors.","Fixed-wing UAV remote sensing; Machine learning; Nitrogen status diagnosis; Precision nitrogen management; Random forest","Antennas; Crops; Decision trees; Fixed wings; Food supply; Linear regression; Mean square error; Neural networks; Nitrogen; Nutrition; Random forests; Reflection; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Machine learning methods; Nitrogen management; Nitrogen status; Remote sensing technology; Root mean square errors; Stepwise multiple linear regression; Sustainable agricultural development; UAV remote sensing; Learning systems",Article,Scopus

High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) is a non-destructive and rapid approach of monitoring and measuring multiple phenotypic traits related to the growth, yield, and adaptation to biotic or abiotic stress. Researchers have conducted extensive experiments on HTP and developed techniques including spectral, fluorescence, thermal, and three-dimensional imaging to measure the morphological, physiological, and pathological resistance traits of cotton. In addition, ground-based and aerial-based platforms were also developed to aid in the implementation of these HTP systems. This review paper highlights the techniques and recent developments for HTP in cotton, reviews the potential applications according to morphological and physiological traits of cotton, and compares the advantages and limitations of these HTP systems when used in cotton cropping systems. Overall, the use of HTP has generated many opportunities to accurately and efficiently measure and analyze diverse traits of cotton. However, because of its relative novelty, HTP has some limitations that constrains the ability to take full advantage of what it can offer. These challenges need to be addressed to increase the accuracy and utility of HTP, which can be done by integrating analytical techniques for big data and continuous advances in imaging. © 2019, The Author(s).","Aerial-based; Cotton; Fluorescence; Ground-based; High-throughput phenotyping; Platforms; Remote sensing; Sensors; Spectral; Thermal",,Review,Scopus

Random forest (RF), artificial neural networks (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machines (SVM) were used to develop models. Training and validation of these models were conducted using in-situ observations from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) from 2001 to 2016. The rule of the traditional Köppen-Geiger (K-G) climate classification was used to classify climate regions. The input variables were land surface temperature (LST) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), monthly precipitation data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 product, and the Digital Elevation Map (DEM) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The overall accuracy (OA) based on validation data from 2001 to 2016 for all models was high over 95%. DEM and minimum winter temperature were two distinct variables over the study area with particularly high relative importance. ANN produced more realistic spatial distribution of the classified climates despite having a slightly lower OA than the others. The accuracy of the models using high altitudinal in-situ data of the Mountain Meteorology Observation System (MMOS) was also assessed. Although the data length of the MMOS data was relatively short (2013 to 2017), it proved that the snowy, dry and cold winter and cool summer class (Dwc) is widely located in the eastern coastal region of South Korea. Temporal shifting of climate was examined through a comparison of climate maps produced by period: from 1950 to 2000, from 1983 to 2000, and from 2001 to 2013. A shrinking trend of snow classes (D) over the Korean Peninsula was clearly observed from the ANN-based climate classification results. Shifting trends of climate with the decrease/increase of snow (D)/temperate (C) classes were clearly shown in the maps produced using the proposed approaches, consistent with the results from the reanalysis data of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC). © 2019 Park et al.

Understanding local vegetation changes is crucial for projecting ecosystem dynamics. In this paper, we make a case for Himalayan mountain areas to explore vegetation dynamics and their influencing factors. Firstly, the interannual trends of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were extracted by the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) algorithm and linear regression method. Moreover, the influence of environmental factors on interannual NDVI trends was assessed using the Random Forests algorithm and partial dependence plots. Subsequently, the time-lag effects of seasonal NDVI on different climatic factors were discussed and the effects of these factors on seasonal NDVI changes were determined by partial correlation analysis. The results show that (1) an overall weak upward trend was observed in NDVI variations from 1982 to 2015, and 1989 is considered to be the breakpoint of the NDVI time series; (2) interannual temperature trends and the shortest distance to large lakes were the most important factors in explaining interannual NDVI trends. Temperature trends were positively correlated with NDVI trends. The relationship between the shortest distance to large lakes and the NDVI trend is an inverted U-shaped; (3) the time-lags of NDVI responses to four climatic factors were shorter in Autumn than that in Summer. The NDVI responds quickly to precipitation and downward long-wave radiation; (4) downward long-wave radiation was the main climate factor that influenced NDVI changes in Autumn and the growing season because of the warming effect at night.

Best management practices implemented to improve water quality have met with limited success. Such lack of success is increasingly attributed to legacy nutrient stores in the subsurface that may act as sources after reduction of external inputs. However, current water-quality models lack a framework to capture these legacy effects. Here we have modified the SWAT (Soil Water Assessment Tool) model to capture the effects of nitrogen (N) legacies on water quality under multiple land-management scenarios. Our new SWAT-LAG model includes (1) a modified carbon-nitrogen cycling module to capture the dynamics of soil N accumulation, and (2) a groundwater travel time distribution module to capture a range of subsurface travel times. Using a 502-km2 Iowa watershed as a case study, we found that between 1950 and 2016, 25% of the total watershed N surplus (N Deposition + Fertilizer + Manure + N Fixation − Crop N uptake) had accumulated within the root zone, 14% had accumulated in groundwater, while 27% was lost as riverine output, and 34% was denitrified. In future scenarios, a 100% reduction in fertilizer application led to a 79% reduction in stream N load, but the SWAT-LAG results suggest that it would take 84 years to achieve this reduction, in contrast to the 2 years predicted in the original SWAT model. The framework proposed here constitutes a first step toward modifying a widely used modeling approach to assess the effects of legacy N on the time required to achieve water-quality goals. ©2019.

This function is defined as the capacity of a soil to supply nutrients and water and to produce plant biomass for human use, providing food, feed, fiber, and fuel. For farmers, the productivity function delivers an economic basis and is a prerequisite for agricultural sustainability. Our study was designed to develop an agricultural primary productivity decision support model. To obtain a highly accurate decision support model that helps farmers and advisors to assess and manage the provision of the primary productivity soil function on their agricultural fields, we addressed the following specific objectives: (i) to construct a qualitative decision support model to assess the primary productivity soil function at the agricultural field level; (ii) to carry out verification, calibration, and sensitivity analysis of this model; and (iii) to validate the model based on empirical data. The result is a hierarchical qualitative model consisting of 25 input attributes describing soil properties, environmental conditions, cropping specifications, and management practices on each respective field. An extensive dataset from France containing data from 399 sites was used to calibrate and validate the model. The large amount of data enabled data mining to support model calibration. The accuracy of the decision support model prior to calibration supported by data mining was ~40%. The data mining approach improved the accuracy to 77%. The proposed methodology of combining decision modeling and data mining proved to be an important step forward. This iterative approach yielded an accurate, reliable, and useful decision support model for the assessment of the primary productivity soil function at the field level. This can assist farmers and advisors in selecting the most appropriate crop management practices. Embedding this decision support model in a set of complementary models for four adjacent soil functions, as endeavored in the H2020 LANDMARK project, will help take the integrated sustainability of arable cropping systems to a new level. © 2019 Sandén, Trajanov, Spiegel, Kuzmanovski, Saby, Picaud, Henriksen and Debeljak.","Agricultural decision-making; Data mining; Decision support model; Expert knowledge; Soil functions; Yield",,Article,Scopus

Their effective applicability to a targeted problem is nevertheless conditional on a detailed evaluation of their ability to simulate the near-term climate evolution under specific conditions. Here we explore the performance of the IPSL-CM5A-LR DCP system in predicting air temperature over Europe, by proposing a systematic assessessment of the prediction skill for different time windows (periods of the calendar time, forecast years and months/seasons). In this framework, we also compare raw and de-biased hindcasts, in which the temperature outputs have been corrected using a quantile matching method. The systematic analysis allows to discern certain conditions conferring larger predictability, which we find to be intermittent in time. The predictions appear more skilful around the 1960s and after the 1980s, in coincidence with large shifts of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability, which are well reproduced in the hindcasts. Averages on longer forecast periods also generally imply better prediction skill, while the best predicted months appear to be mainly those between late spring and early autumn. Moreover, we find an overall added value due to initialisation, while de-biased predictions significantly outperform raw predictions only for a few specific time windows. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of the proposed systematic exploration of skill opportunities in DCPs for integrated applications in climate sensitive sectors. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Atlantic multidecadal variability; Climate service; Climate variability; De-biasing; Decadal climate predictions","air temperature; Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation; climate prediction; climate variation; decadal variation; hindcasting; Europe",Article,Scopus

In this study, we first sought to determine the influencing factors of crop yields and the process of drought impacts on crop yields. We then systematically reviewed the effects of droughts on major global crop yields from four aspects: field control experiments, statistical models, crop growth models, and remote sensing inversion models. Recent progress in crop yield impact assessment reveals that the current research has changed from single-hazard to multi-hazard, from single target to multiple targets, and from statistical models to a comprehensive model. A bibliometric analysis shows that the volume of research on drought impacts on crop yields has increased exponentially, and the related research theme has undergone a transformation from traditional research on crop water stress to comprehensive research on crop drought impacts and adaptation, reflecting the continuous deepening and integration of research perspectives. Agriculture, plant sciences, and environmental sciences are the three main disciplines in research on drought impacts on crop yields. We need to strengthen the application of geographical thinking, that is, systematic thinking concerning multiple factors and multiple scales to study the coupling of crop yields and water resources in the future. Finally, we suggest the following four priority areas for future research in consideration of the problems and challenges of the existing research: establishing a multi-source database of drought impact on crop yield, revealing the key process and mechanism of drought impacts on crop yields, developing a coupled macro and micro process crop growth model, and establishing a comprehensive monitoring platform system for crop yields and food security.

Moreover, agriculture is a major source of livelihood by engaging two-third (~ 66%) of the nation’s population in various activities such as food supply, the raw material to the industries, internal and external trade. Therefore, the continuous monitoring and mapping of agricultural land are crucial for the sustainable life and development of the country. Most of the agriculture monitoring solutions are based on field observations or conventional strategies which are time-consuming and costlier. However, remote sensing delivers a cost-effective solution of acquiring information regarding the healthy or unhealthy vegetation in agricultural land with the help of a diverse range of advanced geospatial techniques such as classification, change detection, and pan-sharpening. In the present paper, we have performed a systematic survey with respect to recent advancements made in the classification algorithm, especially for agricultural land. These emerging methods incorporated in classifiers are machine learning and deep learning to enhance and detect the various features of vegetation parameters. It is expected that such studies will provide effective guidance to the researchers in better understanding the features, limitations, and specific importance of emerging classifiers in the Agriculture domain. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Agriculture land; Artificial neural network; Deep learning; Machine learning; Remote sensing data",,Review,Scopus

These inter-relationships necessitate an integrated management approach for surface water, groundwater, and crop yield as a holistic system. This study quantifies the future availability of surface water and groundwater and associated crop production in a large semi-arid agro-urban river basin in which agricultural irrigation is a leader consumer of water. The region of study is the South Platte River Basin (72,000 km2), Colorado, USA. The coupled SWAT-MODFLOW modeling code is used as the hydrologic simulator and forced with five different CMIP5 climate models downscaled by Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA), each for two climate scenarios, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, for 1980–2100. The hydrologic model accounts for surface runoff, soil lateral flow, groundwater flow, groundwater-surface water interactions, irrigation from surface water and groundwater, and crop yield on a per-field basis. In all climate models and emission scenarios, an increase of 3 to 5 °C in annual average temperature is projected. Whereas, variation in the projected precipitation depends on topography and distances from mountains. Based on the results of this study, the worst-case climate model in the basin is IPSL-CM5A-MR-8.5. Under this climate scenario, for a 1 °C increase in temperature and the 1.3% reduction in annual precipitation, the basin will experience an 8.5% decrease in stream discharge, 2–5% decline in groundwater storage, and 11% reduction in crop yield. These results indicate the significant effect of climate change on water and food resources of a large river basin, pointing to the need for immediate implementation of conservation practices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural productivity; Climate change; Coupled SWAT-MODFLOW; Hydrological modeling; Large scale watershed; Water availability","Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Groundwater resources; Irrigation; Productivity; Rivers; Surface water resources; Topography; Watersheds; Agricultural productivity; Coupled SWAT-MODFLOW; Crop yield; Hydrological models; Large-scale watersheds; River basins; Surface water and groundwaters; Urban river; Water availability; Waters resources; Climate change; ground water; surface water; agricultural development; agricultural production; climate change; climate effect; crop production; future prospect; water availability; water resource; Article; climate change; climate warming; crop production; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; evapotranspiration; harvest; hydrology; precipitation; river basin; urban area; water availability; water supply; South Platte River; United States",Article,Scopus

Remotely sensed SIF integrates environmental, physiological and structural changes that alter photosynthesis at leaf, plant and canopy scales. Radiative transfer models are ideally suited to investigate the complex sources of variability in the SIF signal to guide the interpretation of SIF retrievals from airborne and space-borne platforms. Here, we coupled the Fluspect-Cx model of leaf optical properties and chlorophyll-a fluorescence with the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model to upscale SIF from individual leaves to three-dimensional (3D) structurally explicit canopies. For one-dimensional homogeneous (turbid-like) canopies, DART-SIF was nearly identical to SIF simulated in two existing models, SCOPE and mSCOPE (RMSE &lt;0.221 W.m−2.μm−1.sr−1). DART simulations in geometrically explicit 3D canopies offered four important insights regarding the influence of vegetation structure on the multi-angular top-of-canopy SIF signal. First, changes in the 3D canopy architecture of maize crops, represented by leaf density (leaf area index), and plant clumping (canopy closure) had a larger impact on SIF than the modelled photosynthetic efficiency distinction between sun-adapted and shade-adapted foliage. Second, clumping of leaves at the crop and stand levels was identified as one of the key driving factors of multi-angular anisotropy of red and far-red SIF (686 and 740 nm) for both maize and eucalyptus canopies. Third, non-photosynthetic woody material had a significant impact on top-of-canopy SIF in modelled 3D forest stands. Wood shadowing decreased the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by green leaves, and consequently the SIF emissions, by 10% in sparse and 17% in dense eucalyptus stands. The wood obstruction (blocking) effect, quantified as a relative difference of SIF escape probabilities from canopies with and without wood in the nadir viewing direction, decreased far-red SIF by 4–6% but it had a smaller and sometimes positive influence (by less than 2%) on red SIF. Fourth, DART 3D radiative budget profiles revealed that the majority of the SIF signal from a dense eucalyptus stand originated from the top 25% of the simulated canopy. Interestingly, the introduction of bark-covered woody elements did not alter the simulated balance and omnidirectional escape factor of red SIF in this upper canopy part but did raise significantly both of them in case of far-red SIF. These results demonstrate the importance of 3D radiative transfer and radiative budget simulations for investigating SIF interactions in structurally complex plant canopies and for a better understanding of spatiotemporal and multi-angular remote sensing SIF observations. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Clumping; DART; Fluspect; LAI; SCOPE; SIF; Sun-/shade-adapted leaves; Wood","Chlorophyll; Crops; Fluorescence; Optical properties; Photosynthesis; Physiological models; Radiative transfer; Vegetation; Wood; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Clumping; Discrete anisotropic radiative transfer; Fluorescence signals; Fluspect; LAI; Radiative transfer modelling; SCOPE; Solar-induced fluorescences; Sun-/shade-adapted leaf; Anisotropy; anisotropy; canopy architecture; chlorophyll; fluorescence; geometry; induced response; numerical model; radiative transfer; remote sensing; solar radiation; vegetation structure; Eucalyptus",Article,Scopus

However, a current knowledge gap lies in the integration of AutoML technology and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) within image-based data classification tasks. Therefore, we employed a state-of-the-art (SOTA) and completely open-source AutoML framework, Auto-sklearn, which was constructed based on one of the most widely used ML systems: Scikit-learn. It was combined with two novel AutoML visualization tools to focus particularly on the recognition and adoption of UAS-derived multispectral vegetation indices (VI) data across a diverse range of agricultural management practices (AMP). These include soil tillage methods (STM), cultivation methods (CM), and manure application (MA), and are under the four-crop combination fields (i.e., red clover-grass mixture, spring wheat, pea-oat mixture, and spring barley). Furthermore, they have currently not been efficiently examined and accessible parameters in UAS applications are absent for them. We conducted the comparison of AutoML performance using three other common machine learning classifiers, namely Random Forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). The results showed AutoML achieved the highest overall classification accuracy numbers after 1200 s of calculation. RF yielded the second-best classification accuracy, and SVM and ANN were revealed to be less capable among some of the given datasets. Regarding the classification of AMPs, the best recognized period for data capture occurred in the crop vegetative growth stage (in May). The results demonstrated that CM yielded the best performance in terms of classification, followed by MA and STM. Our framework presents new insights into plant–environment interactions with capable classification capabilities.

One question relates to the contribution of downscaling of climate change scenarios on the uncertainties in results obtained using impact models for agriculture. In particular, for large area or regional agricultural impact assessments, the question of bias correction is of high relevance. Relatively few studies exist looking at the quantification of the impacts of BC methods in general circulation model (GCM) and regional climate model (RCM) data on results of such impact studies. Here, we quantify the impact of different BC methods on temperature (T) and precipitation (P) from different CORDEX GCM-RCM combinations, and how the debiased T&P signal may propagate through agricultural impact models. Specifically, we estimate the impact of BC on (i) an empirical P- and fuzzy rule-based algorithm to estimate the crop planting date, and (ii) a mechanistic T&P-based approach to quantify the crop suitability index (CSI) for the main staple crops in West Africa (i.e. groundnut, maize, pearl millet, sorghum). Both approaches serve as a proxy for more complex process-based ecophysiological crop models. Depending on the choice of the BC method, the uncertainties in the assessment of the CSI can be more than twice as high compared to the uncertainties from the GCM-RCM model selection. Comparing the estimated CSI values with observed harvest area, it is found that BC generally improves the performance for models with low hit rates (<30–35%), but decreases the performance for models with relatively high hit rates (>35%). Such consequences can also be expected for process-based crop models, which are developed to operate on field-scale but are driven by coarser scale RCMs. It is concluded that such agriculturally oriented climate impact models as investigated here should be interpreted with great caution if applied without BC or relying on a single BC approach only. Rather, we suggest to include different BC approaches in the generation of climate projections for CCIS and quantify their uncertainties following a super-ensemble probabilistic assessment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bias correction; Climate change impact studies; CORDEX simulations; Crop planting date; Crop suitability; West Africa","assessment method; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; correction; downscaling; ecophysiology; empirical analysis; fuzzy mathematics; general circulation model; precipitation (climatology); sampling bias; West Africa; Pennisetum glaucum",Article,Scopus

Over-fertilization can have negative influences on the field and the regional level (e.g., agro-ecosys-tems). Remote sensing of the plant N of field crops presents a valuable tool for the monitoring of N flows in agro-ecosystems. Available data for validation of satellite-based remote sensing of N is scarce. Therefore, in this study, field spectrometer measurements were used to simulate data of the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites developed for vegetation monitoring by the ESA. The prediction performance of normalized ratio indices (NRIs), random forest regression (RFR) and Gaussian processes regression (GPR) for plant-N-related traits was assessed on a diverse real-world dataset including multiple crops, field sites and years. The plant N traits included the mass-based N measure, N concentration in the biomass (Nconc), and an area-based N measure approximating the plant N uptake (NUP). Spectral indices such as normalized ratio indices (NRIs) performed well, but the RFR and GPR methods outperformed the NRIs. Key spectral bands for each trait were identified using the RFR variable importance measure and the Gaussian processes regression band analysis tool (GPR-BAT), highlighting the importance of the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region for estimation of plant Nconc—and to a lesser extent the NUP. The red edge (RE) region was also important. The GPR-BAT showed that five bands were sufficient for plant N trait and leaf area index (LAI) estimation and that a surplus of bands effectively reduced prediction performance. A global sensitivity analysis (GSA) was performed on all traits simultaneously, showing the dominance of the LAI in the mixed remote sensing signal.

Evapotranspiration (ET), which consists of crop water use through transpiration and water loss through direct soil evaporation, is a good indicator of soil moisture availability and vegetation health. ET therefore has been an integral part of many yield estimation efforts. The Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) is an ET-based crop stress indicator that describes temporal anomalies in a normalized evapotranspiration metric as derived from satellite remote sensing. ESI has demonstrated the capacity to explain regional yield variability in water-limited regions. However, its performance in some regions where the vegetation cycle is intensively managed appears to be degraded due to interannual phenological variability. This investigation selected three study sites across the U.S. Corn Belt – Mead, NE, Ames, IA and Champaign, IL – to investigate the potential operational value of 30-m resolution, phenologically corrected ESI datasets for yield prediction. The analysis was conducted over an 8-year period from 2010 to 2017, which included both drought and pluvial conditions as well as a broad range in yield values. Detrended yield anomalies for corn and soybean were correlated with ESI computed using annual ET curves temporally aligned based on (1) calendar date, (2) crop emergence date, and (3) a growing degree day (GDD) scaled time axis. Results showed that ESI has good correlations with yield anomalies at the county scale and that phenological corrections to the annual temporal alignment of the ET timeseries improve the correlation, especially when the time axis is defined by GDD rather than the calendar date. Peak correlations occur in the silking stage for corn and the reproductive stage for soybean – phases when these crops are particularly sensitive to soil moisture deficiencies. Regression equations derived at the time of peak correlation were used to estimate yields at county scale using a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. The ESI-based yield estimates agree well with the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) county-level crop yield data, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.79 to 0.93 and percent root-mean-square errors of 5–8%. These results demonstrate that remotely sensed ET at high spatiotemporal resolution can convey valuable water stress information for forecasting crop yields across the Corn Belt if interannual phenological variability is considered. © 2021 The Author(s)","Corn Belt; evaporative stress index (ESI); Evapotranspiration (ET); Phenology; Yield","Agricultural robots; Crops; Forecasting; Mean square error; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Transpiration; Vegetation; Water supply; Agricultural productions; Leave-one-out cross validations; National agricultural statistics services; Phenological corrections; Satellite remote sensing; Soil moisture availability; Soil-moisture deficiency; Spatio-temporal resolution; Evapotranspiration; annual variation; phenology; remote sensing; soil moisture; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal analysis; water stress; Corn Belt; United States; Glycine max; Indicator indicator",Article,Scopus

However, SIF observations are subject to directional effects which can lead to considerable uncertainties in various applications. Practical approaches for normalizing directional SIF observations to nadir viewing, to minimize the directional effects, have not been well studied. Here we developed two practical and physically-solid approaches for removing the directional effects of anisotropic SIF observations: one is based on near-infrared or red reflectance of vegetation (NIRv and Redv), and the other is based on the kernel-driven model with multi-angular SIF measurements. The first approach uses surface reflectance while the second approach directly leverages multi-angular SIF measurements. The performance of the two approaches was evaluated using a dataset of multi-angular measurements of SIF and reflectance collected with a high-resolution field spectrometer over different plant canopies. Results show that the relative mean absolute errors between the normalized nadir SIF and the observed SIF at nadir decrease by 3–6% (far-red) and 6–8% (red) for the first approach, and by 7–13% and 6–11% for the second approach, compared to the original data, respectively.

Agriculture is strongly affected by climate change due to increasing temperatures, water shortage, heavy rainfall and variations in the frequency and intensity of excessive climatic events such as floods and droughts. Farmers need to adapt to climate change by developing advanced and sophisticated farming systems instead of simply farming at lower intensity and occupying more land. Integrated agricultural systems constitute a promising solution, as they can lower reliance on external inputs, enhance nutrient cycling and increase natural resource use efficiency. In this context, the concept of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) emerged as a promising solution to secure the resources for the growing world population under climate change conditions. This work proposes a CSA architecture for fostering and supporting integrated agricultural systems, such as Mixed Farming Systems (MFS), by facilitating the design, the deployment and the management of crop–livestock-=forestry combinations towards sustainable, efficient and climate resilient agricultural systems. Propelled by cutting-edge technology solutions in data collection and processing, along with fully autonomous monitoring systems, e.g., smart sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the proposed architecture called MiFarm-CSA, aims to foster core interactions among animals, forests and crops, while mitigating the high complexity of these interactions, through a novel conceptual framework. © 2021 by the authors.","climate smart agriculture; internet of things; mixed farming systems; participatory learning; socio-economic modelling; unmanned aerial vehicles",,Article,Scopus

Remote sensing is a viable tool to estimate the plant’s nutritional status to determine the appropriate amounts of fertilizer inputs. The aim of the study was to use remote sensing to characterize the foliar nutrient status of mango through the development of spectral indices, multivariate analysis, chemometrics, and machine learning modeling of the spectral data. A spectral database within the 350–1050 nm wavelength range of the leaf samples and leaf nutrients were analyzed for the development of spectral indices and multivariate model development. The normalized difference and ratio spectral indices and multivariate models–partial least square regression (PLSR), principal component regression, and support vector regression (SVR) were ineffective in predicting any of the leaf nutrients. An approach of using PLSR‐combined machine learning models was found to be the best to predict most of the nutrients. Based on the independent validation performance and summed ranks, the best performing models were cubist (R2 ≥ 0.91, the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) ≥ 3.3, and the ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) ≥ 3.71) for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and zinc, SVR (R2 ≥ 0.88, RPD ≥ 2.73, RPIQ ≥ 3.31) for calcium, iron, copper, boron, and elastic net (R2 ≥ 0.95, RPD ≥ 4.47, RPIQ ≥ 6.11) for magnesium and sulfur.

Estrogenic activity in surface waters may lead to adverse effects in aquatic species at both individual and population levels, often observed through the presence of intersex and vitellogenin induction in male fish. In the Chesapeake Bay Watershed, located on the mid-Atlantic coast of the USA, intersex has been observed in several sub-watersheds where previous studies have identified specific landscape sources of EDCs in tandem with observed fish health effects. Previous work in the Potomac River Watershed (PRW), the largest basin within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed, was leveraged to build random forest regression models to predict estrogenic activity at unsampled reaches in both the Potomac River and larger Chesapeake Bay Watersheds (CBW). Model outputs including important variables, partial dependence plots, and predicted values of estrogenic activity at unsampled reaches provide insight into drivers of estrogenic activity at different seasons and scales. Using the US Environmental Protection Agency effects-based threshold of 1.0 ng/L 17 β-estradiol equivalents, catchments predicted to exceed this value were categorized as at risk for adverse effects from exposure to estrogenic compounds and evaluated relative to healthy watersheds and recreation access locations throughout the PRW. Results show immediate catchment scale models are more reliable than upstream models, and the best predictive variables differ by season and scale. A small percentage of healthy watersheds (< 13%) and public access sites were classified as at risk using the “Total” (annual) model in the CBW.

Screening for end-use quality traits is usually secondary to grain yield due to high labor needs, cost of testing, and large seed requirements for phenotyping. Genomic selection provides an alternative to predict performance using genome-wide markers under forward and acros location predictions, where a previous year’s dataset can be used to build the models. Due to large datasets in breeding programs, we explored the potential of the machine and deep learning models to predict fourteen end-use quality traits in a winter wheat breeding program. The population used consisted of 666 wheat genotypes screened for five years (2015-19) at two locations (Pullman and Lind, WA, USA). Nine different models, including two machine learning (random forest and support vector machine) and two deep learning models (convolutional neural network and multilayer perceptron) were explored for cross-validation, forward, and across locations predictions. The prediction accuracies for different traits varied from 0.45-0.81, 0.29-0.55, and 0.27-0.50 under cross-validation, forward, and across location predictions. In general, forward prediction accuracies kept increasing over time due to increments in training data size and was more evident for machine and deep learning models. Deep learning models were superior over the traditional ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction (RRBLUP) and Bayesian models under all prediction scenarios. The high accuracy observed for end-use quality traits in this study support predicting them in early generations, leading to the advancement of superior genotypes to more extensive grain yield trails. Furthermore, the superior performance of machine and deep learning models strengthens the idea to include them in large scale breeding programs for predicting complex traits. © 2021 by the authors.

The R2 and NSE values for calibration (0.72 and 0.84, respectively) and validation periods (0.7 and 0.56, respectively) indicated a significant correlation between observed and simulated streamflow. Then the model was run for historical and future scenarios (early, mid, and end of the 21st century) for four RCMs. Variables such as rainfall, surface runoff, water yield, evapotranspiration, and intensity of rainfall showed an increasing trend under future scenarios, while crop yields (corn, cotton and rice) showed a decreasing trend. The models predicted an increase in the extremity of rainfall events, especially in the months of July and August, for the mid and end of the 21st century.

In the study, a hybrid inversion method, which combined a physical model with a statistical method, was proposed to estimate the crop LAI. The simulated compact high-resolution imaging spectrometer (CHRIS) canopy spectral crop reflectance datasets were generated using the PROSAIL model (the coupling of PROSPECT leaf optical properties model and Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves model) and the CHRIS band response function. Partial least squares (PLS) was then used to reduce the dimension of the simulated spectral data. Using the principal components (PCs) of PLS as the model inputs, the hybrid inversion models were built using various modeling algorithms, including the backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR), and random forest regression (RFR). Finally, remote sensing mapping of the CHRIS data was achieved with the hybrid model to test the inversion accuracy of LAI estimates. The validation result yielded an accuracy of R2 = 0.939 and normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) = 6.474% for the PLS_RFR model, which indicated that the crops LAI could be estimated accurately by using spectral feature extraction and a hybrid inversion strategy. The results showed that the model based on principal components extracted by PLS had a good estimation accuracy and noise immunity and was the preferred method for LAI estimation. Furthermore, the comparative analysis results of various datasets showed that prior knowledge could improve the precision of the retrieved LAI, and using this information to constrain parameters (e.g., chlorophyll content or LAI), which make important contributions to the spectra, is the key to this improvement.

In this study, the potential of exploiting three categories of ML regression models, including classical regression, shallow learning and deep learning for predicting soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from an agricultural field was explored. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, as well as various environmental, agronomic and soil data were measured at the site over a five-year period in Quebec, Canada. The rigorous analysis, which included statistical comparison and cross-validation for the prediction of CO2 and N2O fluxes, confirmed that the LSTM model performed the best among the considered ML models with the highest R coefficient and the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) values (R = 0.87 and RMSE = 30.3 mg·m−2·hr−1 for CO2 flux prediction and R = 0.86 and RMSE = 0.19 mg·m−2·hr−1 for N2O flux prediction). The predictive performances of LSTM were more accurate than those simulated in a previous study conducted by a biophysical-based Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2). The classical regression models (namely RF, SVM and LASSO) satisfactorily simulated cyclical and seasonal variations of CO2 fluxes (R = 0.75, 0.71 and 0.68, respectively); however, they failed to reasonably predict the peak values of N2O fluxes (R &lt; 0.25). Shallow ML was found to be less effective in predicting GHG fluxes than other considered ML models (R &lt; 0.7 for CO2 flux and R &lt; 0.3 for estimating N2O fluxes) and was the most sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. Based on this comprehensive comparison study, it was elicited that the LSTM model can be employed successfully in simulating GHG emissions from agricultural soils, providing a new perspective on the application of machine learning modeling for predicting GHG emissions to the environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural soil; Classical regression; Deep learning; Greenhouse gas emissions; Machine learning; Shallow learning","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Deep learning; Forecasting; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Mean square error; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Water quality; Agricultural fields; Comprehensive comparisons; Environmental phenomena; Machine learning models; Predictive performance; Root mean squared errors; Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2); Statistical comparisons; Long short-term memory; carbon dioxide; nitrous oxide; agricultural soil; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; greenhouse gas; machine learning; nitrous oxide; prediction; regression analysis; soil emission; agricultural soil; Article; biophysics; Canada; carbon footprint; controlled study; deep learning; greenhouse gas; machine learning; measurement accuracy; priority journal; process optimization; random forest; seasonal variation; simulation training; soil; Canada; Quebec [Canada]",Article,Scopus

In the past, empirical algorithms have been widely employed to retrieve information on this biochemical plant component from canopy reflectance. However, these approaches do not seek for a cause-effect relationship based on physical laws. Moreover, most studies solely relied on the correlation of chlorophyll content with nitrogen, and thus neglected the fact that most N is bound in proteins. Our study presents a hybrid retrieval method using a physically-based approach combined with machine learning regression to estimate crop N content. Within the workflow, the leaf optical properties model PROSPECT-PRO including the newly calibrated specific absorption coefficients (SAC) of proteins, was coupled with the canopy reflectance model 4SAIL to PROSAIL-PRO. The latter was then employed to generate a training database to be used for advanced probabilistic machine learning methods: a standard homoscedastic Gaussian process (GP) and a heteroscedastic GP regression that accounts for signal-to-noise relations. Both GP models have the property of providing confidence intervals for the estimates, which sets them apart from other machine learners. Moreover, a GP-based sequential backward band removal algorithm was employed to analyze the band-specific information content of PROSAIL-PRO simulated spectra for the estimation of aboveground N. Data from multiple hyperspectral field campaigns, carried out in the framework of the future satellite mission Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP), were exploited for validation. In these campaigns, corn and winter wheat spectra were acquired to simulate spectral EnMAP data. Moreover, destructive N measurements from leaves, stalks and fruits were collected separately to enable plant-organ-specific validation. The results showed that both GP models can provide accurate aboveground N simulations, with slightly better results of the heteroscedastic GP in terms of model testing and against in situ N measurements from leaves plus stalks, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.1 g/m². However, the inclusion of fruit N content for validation deteriorated the results, which can be explained by the inability of the radiation to penetrate the thick tissues of stalks, corn cobs and wheat ears. GP-based band analysis identified optimal spectral settings with ten bands mainly situated in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral region. Use of well-known protein absorption bands from the literature showed comparative results. Finally, the heteroscedastic GP model was successfully applied on airborne hyperspectral data for N mapping. We conclude that GP algorithms, and in particular the heteroscedastic GP, should be implemented for global agricultural monitoring of aboveground N from future imaging spectroscopy data. © 2020 The Authors","Agricultural monitoring; EnMAP; Gaussian processes; Imaging spectroscopy; Inversion; Radiative transfer modeling","data inversion; Gaussian method; imaging method; machine learning; monitoring; nitrogen; radiative transfer; regression analysis",Article,Scopus

Uncertainty in historical, current and future effectiveness of actions hampers decisions about how to mitigate changes to prevent biodiversity loss and species extinctions. Research in resource management, agriculture and health indicates that forecasts predicting the effects of near-term or seasonal environmental conditions on management greatly improve outcomes. Such forecasts help resolve uncertainties about when and how to operationalize management. We reviewed the scientific literature on environmental management to investigate whether near-term forecasts are developed to inform biodiversity decisions in Australia, a nation with one of the highest recent extinction rates across the globe. We found that forecasts focused on economic objectives (e.g. fisheries management) predict on significantly shorter timelines and answer a broader range of management questions than forecasts focused on biodiversity conservation. We then evaluated scientific literature on the effectiveness of 484 actions to manage seven major terrestrial threats in Australia, to identify opportunities for near-term forecasts to inform operational conservation decisions. Depending on the action, between 30% and 80% threat management operations experienced near-term weather impacts on outcomes before, during or after management. Disease control, species translocation/reintroduction and habitat restoration actions were most frequently impacted, and negative impacts such as increased species mortality and reduced recruitment were more likely than positive impacts. Drought or dry conditions, and rainfall, were the most frequently reported weather impacts, indicating that near-term forecasts predicting the effects of low or excessive rainfall on management outcomes are likely to have the greatest benefits. Across the world, many regions are, like Australia, becoming warmer and drier, or experiencing more extreme rainfall events. Informing conservation decisions with near-term and seasonal ecological forecasting will be critical to harness uncertainties and lower the risk of threat management failure under global change. © 2020 The Authors.

However, to perform robust and efficient fruit detection and localization in orchard is a challenging task under variable illumination, low-resolutions and heavy occlusion by neighboring fruits, foliage, or branches. Therefore, researches of fruit detection and localization by getting more information of objects are essential. RGB-D (Red, Green, Blue -Depth) cameras are promising sensors and widely used in fruit detection and localization given that they provide depth information and infrared information in addition to RGB information. After presenting a discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of RGB-D cameras with different depth measurement principles and application fields, this paper reviews various types of RGB-D sensor systems and image processing methods used for fruit detection and localization in the field.

Thus, assessing agricultural suitability and yield reduction under climate change is crucial for sustainable agricultural production. In this study, we used two sub-models of the agro-ecological decision support system MicroLEIS (Terraza and Cervatana) to evaluate the impacts of climate change on land capability and yield reduction or wheat and sunflower as major rainfed crops in different Mediterranean soil types (in Andalucia, Southern Spain). The Terraza sub-model provides an experimental prediction for the bioclimate deficiency and yield reduction, while the Cervatana sub-model predicts the general land use suitability for specific agricultural uses. Sixty-two districts in Southern Spain were modeled and mapped using soil data and the A1B climate scenario (balanced scenario) for three 30-year periods ending in 2040, 2070 and 2100, respectively. Our results showed that the majority of agricultural soils were suitable for wheat production, and less for sunflowers, especially under projected climate change scenarios. Extreme impacts of climate change were observed in the soil types Typic Xerofluvents and Calcic Haploxerepts, where the land capability was reduced from Good and Moderate classes to the Marginal class. This was especially observed in sunflower crops by 2100. Yield reduction of sunflower was much higher than the reduction for wheat, especially under the projected climate periods, where the results for 2100 showed the severest effect on crop yields with about 95% of the sunflower area showing yield reductions. This high variability of the evaluation results demonstrates the importance of using soil factors, climate and crop information in conjunction in decision-making regarding the formulation of site-specific soil use and management strategies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Crop yield; Decision support systems; GIS; Global warming; Land suitability","Agricultural robots; Artificial intelligence; Climate models; Crops; Decision making; Decision support systems; Economics; Land use; Reduction; Soils; Agricultural soils; Climate change impact; Climate change scenarios; Land use suitability; Management strategies; Mediterranean region; Mediterranean soils; Sustainable agricultural; Climate change; agricultural development; agrometeorology; alternative agriculture; climate change; crop performance; decision support system; land use planning; Mediterranean soil; yield response; Andalucia; Spain; Andalucia; Helianthus; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

Here, we added a sediment diagenesis and sediment carbon (C) resuspension module into the SWAT-C model and tested it for simulating both particulate organic C (POC) and dissolved organic C (DOC) fluxes using 4 years of monthly observations (2014-2017) in the Tuckahoe watershed (TW) in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region. Results: Sensitivity analyses show that parameters that regulate POC deposition in river networks are more sensitive than those that determine C resuspension from sediments. Further analyses indicate that allochthonous contributions to POC and DOC are about 36.6 and 46 kgC ha-1 year-1, respectively, while autochthonous contributions are less than 0.72 kgC ha-1 year-1 for both POC and DOC (less than 2% of allochthonous sources). The net deposition of POC on the riverbed (i.e., 11.4 kgC ha-1 year-1) retained ca. 31% of terrestrial inputs of POC. In addition, average annual buried C was 0.34 kgC ha-1 year-1, accounting for only 1% of terrestrial POC inputs or 3% of net POC deposition. The results indicate that about 79% of deposited organic C was converted to inorganic C (CH4 and CO2) in the sediment and eventually released into the overlying water column. Conclusion: This study serves as an exploratory study on estimation of C fluxes from terrestrial to aquatic environments at the watershed scale. We demonstrated capabilities of the SWAT-C model to simulate C cycling from uplands to riverine ecosystems and estimated C sinks and sources in aquatic environments. Overall, the results highlight the importance of including carbon cycle dynamics within the riverbed in order to accurately estimate aquatic carbon fluxes and stocks. The new capabilities of SWAT-C are expected to serve as a useful tool to account for those processes in watershed C balance assessment. © 2020 The Author(s).","DOC; POC; Resuspension; Sediment diagenesis","aquatic environment; carbon cycle; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; diagenesis; dissolved organic carbon; particulate organic carbon; resuspension; river bed; terrestrial environment; watershed; Maryland; Mid-Atlantic States; Tuckahoe River; United States; Peltandra virginica",Article,Scopus

Smart farming technologies (SFTs) are expected to assist in reverting this situation. In this work, 1064 SFTs were derived from scientific papers, research projects, and industrial products. They were classified by technology readiness level (TRL), typology, and field operation, and they were assessed for their economic, environmental, and labor impact, as well as their adoption readiness from end‐users. It was shown that scientific articles dealt with SFTs of lower TRL than research projects. In scientific articles, researchers investigated mostly recording technologies, while, in research projects, they focused primarily on farm management information systems and robotic/automation systems. Scouting technologies were the main SFT type in scientific papers and research projects, but variable rate application technologies were mostly located in commercial products. In scientific papers, there was limited analysis of economic, environmental, and labor impact of the SFTs under investigation, while, in research projects, these impacts were studied thoroughly. Further, in commercial SFTs, the focus was on economic impact and less on labor and environmental issues. With respect to adoption readiness, it was found that all of the factors to facilitate SFT adoption became more positive moving from SFTs in scientific papers to fully functional commercial SFTs, indicating that SFTs reach the market when most of these factors are addressed for the benefit of the farmers. This SFT analysis is expected to inform researchers on adapting their research, as well as help policy‐makers adjust their strategy toward digitized agriculture adoption and farmers with the current situation and future trends of SFTs. © 2020 by the authors.

A popular implementation involves the deployment of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), which embed low energy consumption sensory nodes to capture the critical environmental parameters prevailing on the farms. However, to manage the ever-increasing volumes of raw data successfully, new approaches must be explored. Under this scope, current work reports on the design and development of an IoT system, having in mind the case of olive groves, which are considered the dominant sector for agricultural activity in the Mediterranean Basin. The system incorporates the cloud/fog computing paradigm to equip the olive growers with a low-cost solution for accurate, reliable, and almost real-time monitoring of their crops. Its core is based on a three-layered network architecture, capable of dynamically balancing the generated load, by pushing cloud-elastic resources to the underlying fog network. As such, the premise of the approach lies in the conforming character of the system that allows for targeted alterations to its operational functionality to meet stringent latency and traffic load environmental monitoring constraints. To evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture, a demo prototype is developed and deployed in the facilities of the Ionian University. Experimental results illustrate the efficiency, flexibility, and scalability of the approach in terms of latency, achieving response time reduction across all platforms, a subject of the utmost importance when it comes to precision agriculture of the future. Moreover, it is shown that the system is capable of dynamic functionality adaptation, to meet network traffic load constraints, achieving high throughput (on average 95%) and addressing potential environmental dangers to olive oil production. © 2020 by the authors.

Ease of its propagation, coupled with high capacity for ailment and death makes it a potential candidate for biological weapon. Objective: Work related to the pathogen’s classification and factors affecting its prolonged existence in soil is limited to statistical measures. Machine learning other than conventional analysis methods may be applied to better predict epidemiological modeling for this soil-borne pathogen. Methods: Feature-ranking algorithms namely; relief, correlation and oneR are used for soil attribute ranking. Moreover, classification algorithms; SVM, random forest, naive bayes, logistic regression and MLP are used for classification of the soil attribute dataset for Francisella tularensis positive and negative soils. Results: Feature-ranking methods concluded that clay, nitrogen, organic matter, soluble salts, zinc, silt and nickel are the most significant attributes while potassium, phosphorous, iron, calcium, copper, chromium and sand are the least contributing risk factors for the persistence of the pathogen. However, clay is the most significant and potassium is the least contributing attribute. Data analysis suggests that feature-ranking using relief produced classification accuracy of 84.35% for multilayer perceptron; 82.99% for linear regression; 80.27% for SVM and random forest; and 78.23% for naive bayes, which is better than other ranking methods. MLP outperforms other classifiers by generating an accuracy of 84.35%, 82.99% and 81.63% for feature-ranking using relief, correlation and oneR algorithms, respectively. Conclusion: These models can significantly improve accuracy and can minimize the risk of incorrect classification.

However, the genetic basis of many domesticated characteristics remains to be explored. Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is the most important tetraploid cotton species, accounting for about 90% of world cotton commerce. Here, we reveal the effects of domestication on fiber and stress traits through comprehensive analyses of semi-domesticated races and cultivated cotton accessions. A total of 416 cotton accessions were genotyped, and a decrease in genetic diversity from races to landraces and modern cultivars was detected. Furthermore, 71 domestication selective sweeps (DSS) and 14 improvement selective sweeps (ISS) were identified, with the Dt sub-genome experiencing stronger selection than the At sub-genome during the both selection types. The more expressed genes and a delay in the expression peak of genes related to secondary cell wall (SCW) development in modern cultivars compared to semi-domesticated cotton races, may have contributed to long fibers in these plants. However, down-regulation of genes related to stress response was responsible for decreasing stress tolerance in modern cultivars. We further experimentally confirmed that silencing of PR1 and WRKY20, genes that showed higher expression in the semi-domesticated races, drastically compromised cotton resistance to V. dahliae. Our results reveal fiber improvement and decreased stress tolerance as a result of the domestication of modern upland cotton cultivars. © Copyright © 2019 Zhu, Li, Wang, Li, Si, Cai and Guo.","artificial selection; domestication; expression profile; fiber development; single nucleotide polymorphism array; stress tolerance; upland cotton",,Article,Scopus

In central North America it has consisted of cropland expansion in the early 1900s, yield intensification starting in the 1930s, and the development of large irrigated areas beginning in the 1950s. The area of this study encompasses the Midwest and Great Plains of the United States not only because significant agricultural change has occurred here but also because of the significant cooling (warming hole) there in the midcentury. This study investigates the relative contribution of agricultural development and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on the observed patterns of regional changes in summer temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration using a long-term twentieth-century reanalysis dataset (CERA-20C) as boundary conditions for simulations with the MIT Regional Climate Model (MRCM). Temperatures in the Great Plains (338–438N, 958–1098W) and the Midwest (388–488N, 828–1098W) would have been significantly higher in the second half of the twentieth century without the influence of agricultural development, largely due to an increase in evaporative cooling. The simulations of precipitation changes reflect a significant influence of global SST teleconnections at decadal time scales. Numerical simulations also demonstrate the competing effects of cropland expansion and yield intensification on shaping the observed pattern of increases in precipitation. Ultimately, a combination of agricultural development and decadal variability of global sea surface temperatures (SST) explains most of the observed variability of summer temperature and precipitation during the twentieth century over central North America. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.",,"Agriculture; Climate models; Evaporative cooling systems; Evapotranspiration; Expansion; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Landforms; Oceanography; Surface waters; Agricultural development; Decadal variability; Evaporative cooling; Precipitation change; Regional climate modeling; Relative contribution; Sea surface temperature (SST); Summer temperature; Climate change; agricultural development; boundary condition; climate change; climate modeling; data set; greenhouse gas; summer; twentieth century; warming; Great Plains; Midwest; United States",Article,Scopus

One approach to estimate crop yield with remote sensing is data assimilation, which integrates sequential observations of canopy development from remote sensing into model simulations of crop growth processes. However, it remains challenging to efficiently scale this approach to large areas while maintaining reliable prediction at field scales. In this paper, we explored the factors limiting the generalization of the data assimilation approach and found that the accuracy of crop model prediction and the systematic model errors can significantly affect the performance of data assimilation and the yield estimation. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical data assimilation framework, which enables maize yield estimation at field levels across large areas for the Midwestern US with no a priori knowledge about the management of individual fields. This approach applies data assimilation algorithms at two spatial scales. At the county scale, we adopted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to recalibrate uncertain and sensitive model parameters based on aggregated Leaf Area Index (LAI) time series derived from Landsat images and county-level yield statistics. Using the county-specific models, we assimilated LAI time series into crop model simulations using Ensemble Kalman Filter for individual fields or pixels. This method was validated by multiple field-level maize yield datasets across major production states in the US Midwest. The Root Mean Squared Error ranges from 1.4 to 2.3 ton/ha, and the percentage error is between 9% and 21%.

Abstract: The breeder’s equation is the foundational application of quantitative genetics to crop improvement. Guided by the variables that describe response to selection, emerging breeding technologies can make a powerful step change in the effectiveness of public breeding programs. The most promising innovations for increasing the rate of genetic gain without greatly increasing program size appear to be related to reducing breeding cycle time, which is likely to require the implementation of parent selection on non-inbred progeny, rapid generation advance, and genomic selection. These are complex processes and will require breeding organizations to adopt a culture of continuous optimization and improvement. To enable this, research managers will need to consider and proactively manage the, accountability, strategy, and resource allocations of breeding teams. This must be combined with thoughtful management of elite genetic variation and a clear separation between the parental selection process and product development and advancement process. With an abundance of new technologies available, breeding teams need to evaluate carefully the impact of any new technology on selection intensity, selection accuracy, and breeding cycle length relative to its cost of deployment. Finally breeding data management systems need to be well designed to support selection decisions and novel approaches to accelerate breeding cycles need to be routinely evaluated and deployed. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"Agriculture; Genes; Human resource management; Optimization; Productivity; Agricultural productivity; Breeding technology; Continuous optimization; Data management system; Plant breeding programs; Response to selection; Selection decisions; Selection intensity; Information management; genetic marker; genetic selection; genetics; inheritance; plant; plant breeding; procedures; public sector; single nucleotide polymorphism; Genetic Markers; Inheritance Patterns; Plant Breeding; Plants; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Public Sector; Selection, Genetic",Review,Scopus

Hence, deeply understanding and monitoring crop growth for an optimized N management is advisable. In this context, remote sensing facilitates the capturing of crop traits. While several studies on estimating biomass from spectral and structural data can be found, N is so far only estimated from spectral features. It is well known that N is negatively related to dry biomass, which, in turn, can be estimated from crop height. Based on this indirect link, the present study aims at estimating N concentration at field scale in a two-step model: first, using crop height to estimate biomass, and second, using the modeled biomass to estimate N concentration. For comparison, N concentration was estimated from spectral data. The data was captured on a spring barley field experiment in two growing seasons. Crop surface height was measured with a terrestrial laser scanner, seven vegetation indices were calculated from field spectrometer measurements, and dry biomass and N concentration were destructively sampled. In the validation, better results were obtained with the models based on structural data (R2 &lt; 0.85) than on spectral data (R2 &lt; 0.70). A brief look at the N concentration of different plant organs showed stronger dependencies on structural data (R2: 0.40-0.81) than on spectral data (R2: 0.18-0.68). Overall, this first study shows the potential of crop-specific across-season two-step models based on structural data for estimating crop N concentration at field scale. The validity of the models for in-season estimations requires further research. © 2019 by the authors.","Biomass; Nitrogen concentration; Plant height; Precision agriculture; Spectrometer; Terrestrial laser scanning; Vegetation indices","Biomass; Ecology; Laser applications; Nitrogen; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Spectrometers; Vegetation; Field experiment; Field spectrometer measurements; Nitrogen concentrations; Plant height; Spectral vegetation indices; Terrestrial laser scanners; Terrestrial laser scanning; Vegetation index; Crops",Article,Scopus

In this study, we built machine learning (random forest, gradient boosting, and stacking) and traditional linear models to identify the relation between the runoff coefficient and its influencing factors, including topography, climate, land cover, and soil. The cross-validation results show that the machine learning models greatly outperform the traditional linear model in predicting runoff coefficient. High-resolution (0.1°) runoff coefficient and runoff maps for the China's transboundary river basins riparian countries were produced and compared with other estimates at the country level. The best water resources estimates achieved from the machine learning model are consistent with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations AQUASTAT database (root-mean-square error = 76.97 km 3 /year, normalized root-mean-square error = 12%) at the country level. This outperformed two currently available runoff products: the UNH/GRDC Global Composite Runoff Fields and the Global Streamflow Characteristics Dataset. The study also demonstrated that accurate precipitation data can improve runoff and water resources estimation accuracy and that climate and topographic factors have a controlling role in prediction, whereas the influences of land cover and soils are weak.

Whilst extreme weather conditions may cause extreme impacts, crop failure commonly is induced by the occurrence of multiple and combined anomalous meteorological drivers. For these cases, the explanation of conditions leading to crop failure is complex, as the links connecting weather and crop yield can be multiple and non-linear. Furthermore, climate change is likely to perturb the meteorological conditions, possibly altering the occurrences of crop failures or leading to unprecedented drivers of extreme impacts. The goal of this study is to identify important meteorological drivers that cause crop failures and to explore changes in crop failures due to global warming. For that, we focus on a historical failure event, the extreme low soybean production during the 2012 season in the midwestern US. We first train a random forest model to identify the most relevant meteorological drivers of historical crop failures and to predict crop failure probabilities. Second, we explore the influence of global warming on crop failures and on the structure of compound drivers. We use large ensembles from the EC-Earth global climate model, corresponding to present-day, pre-industrial +2 and 3° C warming, respectively, to isolate the global warming component. Finally, we explore the meteorological conditions inductive for the 2012 crop failure and construct analogues of these failure conditions in future climate settings. We find that crop failures in the midwestern US are linked to low precipitation levels, and high temperature and diurnal temperature range (DTR) levels during July and August. Results suggest soybean failures are likely to increase with climate change. With more frequent warm years due to global warming, the joint hot-dry conditions leading to crop failures become mostly dependent on precipitation levels, reducing the importance of the relative compound contribution. While event analogues of the 2012 season are rare and not expected to increase, impact analogues show a significant increase in occurrence frequency under global warming, but for different combinations of the meteorological drivers than experienced in 2012. This has implications for assessment of the drivers of extreme impact events. © Copyright:",,"Climate models; Crops; Decision trees; Earth (planet); Condition; Crop failures; Crop yield; Extreme weather conditions; Failure events; Meteorological condition; Non linear; Precipitation level; Soybean production; Storylines; Global warming; climate change; climate effect; crop production; extreme event; forest dynamics; global warming; United States",Article,Scopus

However, it is currently difficult for farmers to analyze, assess, and optimize N flows in their farms using the existing software. To improve digital N management, this study identified, evaluated, and systematized the requirements of stakeholders. Furthermore, digital farm N management tools with varying objectives in terms of system boundaries, data requirements, used methods and algorithms, performance, and practicality were appraised and categorized. According to the identified needs, the concept of a farm N management system (FNMS) software is presented which includes the following modules: (1) management of site and farm data, (2) determination of fertilizer requirements, (3) N balancing and cycles, (4) N turnover and losses, and (5) decision support. The aim of FNMS is to support farmers in their farming practices for increasing N efficiency and reducing environmentally harmful N surpluses. In this study, the conceptual requirements from the agricultural and computer science perspectives were determined as a basis for developing a consistent, scientifically sound, and user-friendly FNMS, especially applicable in European countries. This FNMS enables farmers and their advisors to make knowledge-based decisions based on comprehensive and integrated data. © 2021 by the authors.","Data fusion; Decision support system; Digital agriculture; Farm management system; Nitrogen balance; Nutrient management; Software architecture",,Article,Scopus

In recent years, deep learning (DL) methods have been considered in the context of genomic prediction. The DL methods are nonparametric models providing flexibility to adapt to complicated associations between data and output with the ability to adapt to very complex patterns. Main body: We review the applications of deep learning (DL) methods in genomic selection (GS) to obtain a meta-picture of GS performance and highlight how these tools can help solve challenging plant breeding problems. We also provide general guidance for the effective use of DL methods including the fundamentals of DL and the requirements for its appropriate use. We discuss the pros and cons of this technique compared to traditional genomic prediction approaches as well as the current trends in DL applications. Conclusions: The main requirement for using DL is the quality and sufficiently large training data. Although, based on current literature GS in plant and animal breeding we did not find clear superiority of DL in terms of prediction power compared to conventional genome based prediction models. Nevertheless, there are clear evidences that DL algorithms capture nonlinear patterns more efficiently than conventional genome based. Deep learning algorithms are able to integrate data from different sources as is usually needed in GS assisted breeding and it shows the ability for improving prediction accuracy for large plant breeding data. It is important to apply DL to large training-testing data sets. © 2021, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Genomic selection; Genomic trends; Plant breeding","algorithm; deep learning; plant breeding; prediction; review; animal; Bayes theorem; biological model; genetic selection; genome; genomics; phenotype; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Deep Learning; Genome; Genomics; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Selection, Genetic",Review,Scopus

This study used a satellite-based vegetation production model (i.e., eddy covariance light use efficiency, EC-LUE) to estimate national winter wheat gross primary production, and then combined this model with the harvest index (ratio of aboveground biomass to yield) to convert the estimated winter wheat production to yield. Specifically, considering the spatial differences of the harvest index, we used a cross-validation method to invert the harvest index of winter wheat among counties, municipalities and provinces. Using the field-surveyed and statistical yield data, we evaluated the model performance, and found the model could explain more than 50% of the spatial variations of the yield both in field-surveyed regions and most administrative units. Overall, the mean absolute percentage errors of the yield are less than 20% in most counties, municipalities and provinces, and the mean absolute percentage errors for the production of winter wheat at the national scale is 4.06%.

LAI estimation models use multi-source data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), but using multimodal data to estimate maize LAI, and the effect of tassels and soil background, remain understudied. Our research aims to (1) determine how multimodal data contribute to LAI and propose a framework for estimating LAI based on remote-sensing data, (2) evaluate the robustness and adaptability of an LAI estimation model that uses multimodal data fusion and deep neural networks (DNNs) in single- and whole growth stages, and (3) explore how soil background and maize tasseling affect LAI estimation. To construct multimodal datasets, our UAV collected red–green–blue, multispectral, and thermal infrared images. We then developed partial least square regression (PLSR), support vector regression, and random forest regression models to estimate LAI. We also developed a deep learning model with three hidden layers. This multimodal data structure accurately estimated maize LAI. The DNN model provided the best estimate (coefficient of determination [R2] ¼ 0.89, relative root mean square error [rRMSE] ¼ 12.92%) for a single growth period, and the PLSR model provided the best estimate (R2 ¼ 0.70, rRMSE ¼ 12.78%) for a whole growth period. Tassels reduced the accuracy of LAI estimation, but the soil background provided additional image feature information, improving accuracy. These results indicate that multimodal data fusion using low-cost UAVs and DNNs can accurately and reliably estimate LAI for crops, which is valuable for high-throughput phenotyping and high-spatial precision farmland management. © American Society of Plant Biologists 2021.

Based on a variety of gridded SIF, NDVI, and SSM datasets obtained from satellite sensors, we presented the detailed relationships of SSM with SIF and NDVI in different phenological stages. Results showed that SIF and NDVI were significantly correlated with SSM in different phenological stages, especially during the maturity and senescence stages. For different vegetation types, SIF was more sensitive than NDVI to SSM anomalies in grasslands and forests during the maturity stage and rainfed croplands during the senescence stage. These relationships were regulated by precipitation and mean temperature, and decreased precipitation had the most significant impact when accompanied by increased temperature during the maturity stage or decreased temperature during the senescence stage.

This paper investigates the potential of applying FS and multivariate flood scaling properties [multiple linear regression (MLR)] as constraints in model calibration. Based on the assumption that the scaling property of flood exists in four study catchments in northern China, eight calibration scenarios are designed with adopting different combinations of traditional indicators and FS or MLR as objective functions. The performance of the proposed method is verified by employing a distributed hydrological model, namely, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The results indicate that reasonable performance could be obtained in FS with fewer requirements of observed streamflow data, exhibiting better simulation of flood peaks than the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient calibration scenario. The observed streamflow data or regional flood information are required in the MLR calibration scenario to identify the dominant catchment descriptors, and MLR achieves better performance on catchment interior points, especially for the events with uneven distribution of rainfall. On account of the improved performance on hydrographs and flood frequency curve at the watershed outlet, adopting the statistical indicators and flood scaling property simultaneously as model constraints is suggested. The proposed methodology enhances the physical connection of flood peak among subbasins and considers watershed actual conditions and climatic characteristics for each flood event, facilitating a new calibration approach for both gauged catchments and data-scarce catchments. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.","Flood events; Hydrologic models; Hydrology; Satellite observations; Streamflow; Watersheds","calibration; flooding; hydrological modeling; hydrology; regression analysis; satellite imagery; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; watershed",Article,Scopus

Moreover, the larger mini-batch size (100%) had a significantly higher predictive ability for wood-related traits than the smaller mini-batch size (10%). On the other hand, in the BRNN method, the architectures of one and two layers that used only the pureline function showed better results of prediction, with values ranging from 0.21 (pilodyn penetration) to 0.71 (flowering traits). A significant increase in the prediction ability was observed for DL in comparison with other methods of genomic prediction (Bayesian alphabet models, GBLUP, RKHS, and BRNN).

A classification of carbon models was developed; global (carbon-nitrogen and multi-element) and ecosystem models were singled out. The latter ones fall into carbon cycle models (agroecosystem, phytocenosis, and greenhouse gases (CO2and CH4) emissions) and carbon-nitrogen cycle models (various ecosystems, forest, and microbiological). The following difficulties arising when mathematical methods are used for description of the carbon cycle were discussed: multiple methods of calculation; high requirements to input data; limited availability of input information; necessity to consider climate change; errors in description of the functional dependence of CO2emission on temperature. The challenges of quantitative evaluation of components of the carbon biogeochemical cycle were analyzed, i.e., the dual role of soil both as a carbon stock and a source of car-bon compounds, which are greenhouse gases, as well as the interaction of carbon and nitrogen cycles, separation of the pool of soil organic carbon into fractions, and the ratio of microbial and root respirations. Further development of the obtained models will help to better assess greenhouse gases fluxes, to properly determine the effect of climatic and anthropogenic factors on them, and to create a strategy for reducing their emissions. © 2020 Kazan Federal University.

The ability to accurately grasp soil nutrient information is a prerequisite for scientific fertilization within the field of precision agriculture. Information pertaining to soil macronutrients, such as N, may be obtained quickly through hyperspectral imaging techniques. Objective of this research is to explore the use of a deep learning (DL) network to estimate the abundance of urea fertilizer mixed soils for spectroradiometer data. The proposed approach was tested for silt clay and loamy types of soils. Spectral regions of 1899.2 nm for urea and 2195.1 nm for soils were identified as optimum spectral absorption features. The accuracy evaluation was performed using a linear regression model between actual and estimated abundances. At 1899.2 nm, the coefficient of determination (R2) for mixed samples of urea and silt clay soil was found to be 0.945, while R2 for urea mixed loamy soil were 0.954. Similarly, at 2195.1 nm, R2 obtained 0.953 for urea mixed silt clay soil and 0.944 for urea mixed loamy soil. The results show that the estimated abundances obtained through the derivative analysis for spectral unmixing (DASU)-based DL network facilitated a greater accuracy in comparison to the sole use of DASU. These results were then verified through conventional chemical analysis methods. The outcome of this article determines the abundance of urea mixed soils. Therefore, it is inferred that the hyperspectral imaging technique may be utilized in-situ to assess the agricultural land's soil fertility status. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Deep learning (DL) network; hyperspectral remote sensing; precision agriculture; soil macronutrients; spectral unmixing","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Chemical analysis; Clay; Hyperspectral imaging; Learning systems; Metabolism; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Regression analysis; Silt; Spectroscopy; Urea; Urea fertilizers; Accuracy evaluation; Coefficient of determination; Derivative analysis; Learning-based approach; Linear regression models; Soil nitrogen content; Spectral absorption features; Spectro-radiometers; Deep learning; machine learning; multispectral image; precision agriculture; remote sensing; soil fertility; soil nitrogen; soil nutrient; spectral analysis; urea",Article,Scopus

Hyperspectral regression is defined as the estimation of continuous parameters like chlorophyll a, soil moisture, or soil texture based on hyperspectral input data. The main challenges in hyperspectral regression are the high dimensionality and strong correlation of the input data combined with small ground truth datasets as well as dataset shift. The presented workflow is divided into three levels. (1) At the data level, the data is pre-processed, dataset shift is addressed, and the dataset is split reasonably. (2) The feature level considers unsupervised dimensionality reduction, unsupervised clustering as well as manual feature engineering and feature selection. These unsupervised approaches include autoencoder (AE), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) as well as uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). (3) At the model level, the most commonly used supervised and semi-supervised machine learning models are presented. These models include random forests (RF), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and supervised self-organizing maps (SOM). We address the process of model selection, hyperparameter optimization, and model evaluation. Finally, we give an overview of upcoming trends in hyperspectral regression.

The Nile delta provides two thirds of Egypt's agriculture land, but is threatened by urban sprawl. The paper aims to quantify urban expansion over a 45 year period using 6 time points from 1972 to 2017, and its impacts on agricultural potential, soil organic carbon stocks, and implications for water use. The study used multi-temporal satellite data and remote sensing techniques (Maximum Likelihood supervised classification, and NDVI), soil sampling and analysis, data on water irrigation, and agroecological system and ecosystem services model (MicroLEIS, InVEST) to assess the effects of land use change. Urban area increased by a factor of 5, from 452 km2 in 1972 to 2644 km2 in 2017. The greatest losses occurred to the fertile Vertic Torrifluvent soils on the older delta, which lost 1734 km2. Soil organic carbon (0–75 cm depth) lost as a result of soil sealing from urbanisation rose from 25,000 to 141,000 Mg C over the 45 years. As a result of increased pressure on delta land, agriculture expanded into the higher desert areas outside the delta, on marginal land sustained by intensive fertiliser use and irrigation, which in turn puts pressure on water use. Therefore, rapid urban expansion has resulted in a loss of soil carbon and a shift in agriculture from fertile soils to marginal soils, requiring more capital inputs, which is ultimately less sustainable. Modelling suggested that soil management improvement could make better use of fertile soils within the Delta currently affected by high salinity and poor drainage. Future planning should encourage urban expansion on the less fertile soils outside of the delta, while improving suitability of existing agricultural land and minimising land degradation within the delta. © 2019","InVEST ecosystem services model; NDVI; Soil organic carbon; Urban sprawl; Water use","organic carbon; water; carbon; agricultural land; agroecology; fertilizer application; irrigation system; land degradation; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil fertility; urban sprawl; urbanization; water use; agricultural land; Article; controlled study; cultivated land; ecosystem; environmental impact; environmental parameters; fluid intake; normalized difference vegetation index; remote sensing; rural area; salinity; soil depth; soil fertility; soil management; soil quality; spatiotemporal analysis; stock assessment; urban area; urbanization; agriculture; Egypt; soil; Egypt; Nile Delta; Agriculture; Carbon; Ecosystem; Egypt; Soil; Urbanization",Article,Scopus

At present, large farms in developed countries are the main adopters of precision farming. But its potential environmental benefits can justify greater public and private sector incentives to encourage adoption, including in small-scale farming systems in developing countries.

In agriculture, more efficient use of natural resources is at the heart of sustainable intensification. However, technical improvements do not directly translate into resource savings because producers and consumers adapt their behaviour to such improvements, often resulting in a rebound effect, where part or all of the potential resource savings are offset. In extreme cases, increases in efficiency may even result in higher, instead of lower, resource consumption (the Jevons paradox). Rebound effects are particularly complex in agricultural land and soil management, where multiple resources are used simultaneously and efficiency gains aim to lower the need for farmland, water, energy, nutrients, pesticides, and greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, quantification of rebound effects is a prerequisite for generating realistic scenarios of global food provision and for advancing the debate on land sparing versus land sharing. However, studies that provide an overview of rebound effects related to the resources used in agriculture or guidelines for assessing potential rebound effects from future innovations are lacking. This paper contributes to closing this gap by reviewing the current state of knowledge and developing a framework for a structured appraisal of rebound effects. As a test case, the proposed framework is applied to emerging technologies and practices in agricultural soil management in Germany. The literature review revealed substantial evidence of rebound effects or even Jevons’ paradox with regard to efficiency increases in land productivity and irrigation water use. By contrast, there were few studies addressing rebound effects from efficiency increases in fertilizer use, pesticide application, agricultural energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions. While rebound effects are by definition caused by behavioural adaptations of humans, in agriculture also natural adaptations occur, such as resistance of pests to certain pesticides. Future studies should consider extending the definition of rebound effects to such natural adaptations. The test case revealed the potential for direct and indirect economic rebound effects of a number of emerging technologies and practices, such as improved irrigation technologies, which increase water productivity and may thereby contribute to increases in irrigated areas and total water use. The results of this study indicated that rebound effects must be assessed to achieve realistic estimates of resource savings from efficiency improvements and to enable informed policy choices. The framework developed in this paper is the first to facilitate such assessments. © 2019 The Authors","Agriculture; Efficiency; Impact assessment; Irrigation; Jevons paradox; Land sparing","Agriculture; Agronomy; Behavioral research; Economic analysis; Efficiency; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Pesticide effects; Productivity; Soils; Water management; Water supply; Efficiency improvement; Emerging technologies; Impact assessments; Irrigation water use; Jevons paradox; Pesticide applications; Resource consumption; Technical improvement; Economic and social effects",Review,Scopus

Agroforestry systems promise a number of benefits to enhance nature’s contributions to people. There are a wide range of agroforestry systems implemented representing different levels of establishment across the globe. This range and the long time periods for the establishment of these systems make empirical assessments of impacts on ecosystem functions difficult. In this study we investigate how simulation models can help to assess and predict the role of agroforestry in nature’s contributions. The review of existing models to simulate agroforestry systems reveals that most models predict mainly biomass production and yield. Regulating ecosystem services are mostly considered as a means for the assessment of yield only. Generic agroecosystem models with agroforestry extensions provide a broader scope, but the interaction between trees and crops is often addressed in a simplistic way. The application of existing models for agroforestry systems is particularly hindered by issues related to code structure, licences or availability. Therefore, we call for a community effort to connect existing agroforestry models with ecosystem effect models towards an open‐source, multi-effect agroforestry modelling framework. © 2021 by the authors.

These pollutants have detrimental effects on human health and ecological systems; thus, it is important to manage and monitor their presence in the environment. The modeling approach could be an effective way to understand and manage these pollutants. This study predicts the concentrations of micro-pollutants (MPs) using deep learning (DL) models, and the results are then compared with simulation results obtained from the soil water assessment tool (SWAT) model. The SWAT model showed an unacceptable performance owing to the resulting negative Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values for the simulations. This may be caused by the limitations of SWAT, which pertains to adopting simplified equations to simulate micro-pollutants. In addition, the ambiguous plan of pesticide application increased the model uncertainty, thereby deteriorating the model result. Here, we developed two different DL models: long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN). LSTM exhibited the highest model performance, with NSE values of 0.99 and 0.75 for the training and validation steps, respectively. In the multi-target MP model, the error decreased as the number of simulated pollutants increased. The simulation of the four pollutants had the highest error, while the six-target simulation had the lowest error.

Long-term LAI maps are typically generated with satellite images at moderate spatial resolution (0.25 to 1 km), such as those from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). While useful for regional-scale land surface modeling, these moderate resolution products often cannot resolve spatial heterogeneity important for many agricultural and hydrological applications. This paper proposes an approach to map LAI at 30-m resolution based on Landsat images for the Contiguous US (CONUS) consistent with the MODIS product, aimed at multi-scale modeling applications. The algorithm was driven by 1.6 million spatially homogeneous samples derived from MODIS LAI and Landsat surface reflectance products from 2006 to 2018. Based on these samples, we trained separate random forest models to estimate LAI from Landsat surface reflectance for eight biomes of the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). A balanced sample design regarding the saturation status of MODIS LAI and a machine-learning-based noise detection technique were introduced to mitigate the trade-off in estimation accuracy between medium LAI (e.g., 3 to 4, unsaturated) and high LAI (e.g., 4–6, saturated). This approach was evaluated using ground measurements from 19 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites and eight independent sites from other sources. These sites comprise a representative sample of forests, grasslands, shrublands, and croplands across the US. For NEON sites, the LAI estimates show an overall Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.8 with r2 of 0.88. For the eight independent sites, the Landsat LAI algorithm achieves RMSE between 0.52 and 0.91. The uncertainty in Landsat estimated LAI varies across biomes and locations.

We used a novel integrated framework to separate the impacts of natural factors (e.g. drought, precipitation and temperature) from those of anthropogenic factors (e.g. human activity) on vegetation cover change at the watershed scale. We also integrated several datasets including satellite remote sensing and in-situ measurements for a twenty-year time period (2000–2019). Our results show that despite no significant trend being observed in temperature and precipitation, vegetation indices expressed an increasing trend at both the control and treated watersheds. The vegetation cover was not significantly affected by the natural factors whereas the watershed management practice (as a human activity) had significant impacts on vegetation change in the long-term. Further, the vegetation cover long-term response to watershed management practice was mainly linear. We also found that the vegetation indices values in the 2011–2019 period (as the treated period in treated watershed) were significantly higher than those in the 2000–2010 period. In the short-term, however, the drought condition and decreased precipitation (as natural factors) explained the majority of the change in vegetation cover. For example, the majority of the breakpoints occurred in 2008, and it was related to a widespread extreme drought in the area. The watershed management practice as a human activity along with extreme climatic events could explain a large part of the vegetation changes observed in the treated and control watersheds. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","DBEST; Iran; PolyTrend; RESTREND; Vegetation change; Watershed management","anthropogenic aspects and related phenomena; anthropogenic effect; environmental factor; human activity; in situ measurement; management practice; remote sensing; vegetation cover; watershed; article; controlled study; drought; human; Iran; precipitation; remote sensing; vegetation; watershed management; drought; ecosystem; human activities; temperature; Droughts; Ecosystem; Human Activities; Humans; Temperature",Article,Scopus

Accurate assessment of water stress will enhance agricultural productivity through optimization of plant water usage, maximizing plant breeding strategies, and preventing forest wildfire for better ecosystem management. Recent advancements in sensor technologies have enabled high-throughput, non-contact, and cost-efficient plant water stress assessment through intelligence system modeling. The advanced deep learning sensor fusion technique has been reported to improve the performance of the machine learning application for processing the collected sensory data. This paper extensively reviews the state-of-the-art methods for plant water stress assessment that utilized the deep learning sensor fusion approach in their application, together with future prospects and challenges of the application domain. Notably, 37 deep learning solutions fell under six main areas, namely soil moisture estimation, soil water modelling, evapotranspiration estimation, evapotranspiration forecasting, plant water status estimation and plant water stress identification. Basically, there are eight deep learning solutions compiled for the 3D-dimensional data and plant varieties challenge, including unbalanced data that occurred due to isohydric plants, and the effect of variations that occur within the same species but cultivated from different locations. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, it is necessary to study the mode of agricultural production without labor force participation. With the rapid development of the Internet of Things, Big Data, artificial intelligence, robotics and fifth-generation (5G) communication technology, robots can replace humans in agricultural operations, thus enabling the establishment of unmanned farms in the near future. In this review, we have defined unmanned farms, introduced the framework of unmanned farms, analyzed the current state of the technology and how these technologies can be used in unmanned farms, and finally discuss all the technical challenges.

The recent pandemic exposes the shortcomings of traditional healthcare system, i.e., hospitals and clinics alone are not capable to cope with this situation. One of the major technology that aids contemporary healthcare solutions is the smart and connected wearables. The advancement in Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled these wearables to collect data on an unprecedented scale. These wearables gather context-oriented information related to our physical, behavioural and psychological health. The big data generated by wearables and other healthcare devices of IoT is a challenging task to manage that can negatively affect the inference process at the decision centres. Applying big data analytics for mining information, extracting knowledge and making predictions/inferences has recently attracted significant attention. Machine learning is another area of research that has successfully been applied to solve various networking problems such as routing, traffic engineering, resource allocation, and security. Recently, we have seen a surge in the application of ML-based techniques for the improvement of various IoT applications. Although, big data analytics and machine learning are extensively researched, there is a lack of study that exclusively focus on the evolution of ML-based techniques for big data analysis in the IoT healthcare sector. In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive review on the application of machine learning techniques for big data analysis in the healthcare sector.

The UMRB is an important ecosystem located in the north central U.S. that is experiencing a range of ecological stresses. Specifically, testing of SWAT was performed for: (1) Hargreaves (HG) and Penman-Monteith (PM) PET methods, and (2) Livneh, National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) and Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) climate datasets. The Livneh-PM combination resulted in the highest average annual water yield of 380.6 mm versus the lowest estimated water yield of 193.9 mm for the Livneh-HG combination, in response to 23-year uncalibrated simulations. Higher annual ET and PET values were predicted with HG method versus the PM method for all three weather datasets in response to the uncalibrated simulations, due primarily to higher HG-based estimates during the growing season. Based on these results, it was found that the HG method is the preferred PET option for the UMRB. Initial calibration of SWAT was performed using the Livneh data and HG method for three Mississippi River main stem gauge sites, which was followed by spatial validation at 10 other gauge sites located within the UMRB stream network. Overall satisfactory results were found for the calibration and validation gauge sites, with the majority of R2 values ranging between 0.61 and 0.82, Nash-Sutcliffe modeling efficiency (NSE) values ranging between 0.50 and 0.79, and Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) values ranging between 0.61 and 0.84. The results of an additional experimental suite of six scenarios, which represented different combinations of climate data sets and calibrated parameters, revealed that suggested statistical criteria were again satisfied by the different scenario combinations.

Modeling and predicting the biomass and yield of individual plants at the farm scale represents a major challenge in precision agriculture, particularly when salinity and other abiotic stresses may play a role. Here, we evaluate a diversity panel of the wild tomato species (Solanum pimpinellifolium) through both field and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based phenotyping of 600 control and 600 salt-treated plants. The study objective was to predict fresh shoot mass, tomato fruit numbers, and yield mass at harvest based on a range of variables derived from the UAV imagery. UAV-based red–green–blue (RGB) imageries collected 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 weeks before harvest were also used to determine if prediction accuracies varied between control and salt-treated plants. Multispectral UAV-based imagery was also collected 1 and 2 weeks prior to harvest to further explore predictive insights. In order to estimate the end of season biomass and yield, a random forest machine learning approach was implemented using UAV-imagery-derived predictors as input variables. Shape features derived from the UAV, such as plant area, border length, width, and length, were found to have the highest importance in the predictions, followed by vegetation indices and the entropy texture measure. The multispectral UAV imagery collected 2 weeks prior to harvest produced the highest explained variances for fresh shoot mass (87.95%), fruit numbers (63.88%), and yield mass per plant (66.51%). The RGB UAV imagery produced very similar results to those of the multispectral UAV dataset, with the explained variance reducing as a function of increasing time to harvest. The results showed that predicting the yield of salt-stressed plants produced higher accuracies when the models excluded control plants, whereas predicting the yield of control plants was not affected by the inclusion of salt-stressed plants within the models. This research demonstrates that it is possible to predict the average biomass and yield up to 8 weeks prior to harvest within 4.23% of field-based measurements and up to 4 weeks prior to harvest at the individual plant level. Results from this work may be useful in providing guidance for yield forecasting of healthy and salt-stressed tomato plants, which in turn may inform growing practices, logistical planning, and sales operations. © Copyright © 2020 Johansen, Morton, Malbeteau, Aragon, Al-Mashharawi, Ziliani, Angel, Fiene, Negrão, Mousa, Tester and McCabe.","biomass; multi-spectral; random forest; RGB; salinity; tomato plants; UAV; yield",,Article,Scopus

However, these are complex, highly coupled long-term processes that are difficult to observe or explore through empirical science alone. Models are required that capture the main anthropogenic disturbances, whilst operating across regions and long timescales, simulating both natural and agricultural environments, and shifts among these. Many biogeochemical models neglect agriculture or interactions between carbon and nutrient cycles, which is surprising given the scale of intervention in nitrogen and phosphorus cycles introduced by agriculture. This gap is addressed here, using a plant-soil model that simulates integrated soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus (CNP) cycling across natural, semi-natural and agricultural environments. The model is rigorously tested both spatially and temporally using data from long-term agricultural experiments across temperate environments. The model proved capable of reproducing the magnitude of and trends in soil nutrient stocks, and yield responses to nutrient addition. The model has potential to simulate anthropogenic effects on biogeochemical cycles across northern Europe, for long timescales (centuries) without site-specific calibration, using easily accessible input data. The results demonstrate that weatherable P from parent material has a considerable effect on modern pools of soil C and N, despite significant perturbation of nutrient cycling from agricultural practices, highlighting the need to integrate both geological and agricultural processes to understand effects of land-use change on food security, C storage and nutrient sustainability. The results suggest that an important process or source of P is currently missing in our understanding of agricultural biogeochemical cycles. The model could not explain how yields were sustained in plots with low P fertiliser addition. We suggest that plant access to organic P is a key uncertainty warranting further research, particularly given sustainability concerns surrounding rock sources of P fertiliser. © 2020 The Authors","Agriculture; Land-use change; Modelling; Plant-soil biogeochemistry; Sustainability","Agriculture; Carbon; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Fertilizers; Food storage; Food supply; Forestry; Land use; Models; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Plants (botany); Soils; Sustainable development; Agricultural environments; Agricultural practices; Anthropogenic disturbance; Biogeochemical cycling; Land-use change; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Site specific calibration; Soil biogeochemistry; Biogeochemistry; carbon; nitrogen; phosphorus; agricultural practice; biogeochemical cycle; biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; land use change; nitrogen cycle; phosphorus cycle; source apportionment; sustainability; agriculture; Article; biogeochemical cycling; carbon cycling; environmental parameters; environmental sustainability; food security; geographic distribution; land use; mathematical model; nitrogen cycling; nitrogen deposition; nutrient cycle; phosphorus cycling; priority journal; soil fertilization; Europe",Article,Scopus

In terms of the extraction of ecological factors, vegetation extraction is relatively advanced in contrast to the extraction of animal and microbial data. For the monitoring of environmental conditions of mining areas, sophisticated methods are available to identify pollution levels of vegetation and to accurately monitor soil quality. However, the methods for water and air pollution monitoring in mining areas still need to be improved.

The applied methodology consists of elaborating a custom‐developed analytical framework based on a dataset containing 22 relevant indicators, considering four main dimensions that describe the intricacies of the EU agricultural and rural environment, in the CAP context: rural, emissions, macroeconomic, and financial. The results highlight that an increase of the agricultural research and development funding, as well as the agriculture employment rate, negatively influence the degree of rural pov-erty. The rural GDP per capita is influenced by the size of the employment rate in agriculture. It seems that environmental sustainability, identified by both fertilizers used and emissions from agriculture parameters, significantly influences the GDP per capita. In predicting emissions in agriculture, the direct payment, degree of rural poverty, fertilizer use, employment in agriculture, and agriculture labor productivity are the main independent parameters with the highest future importance. It was found that when predicting direct payments, the rural employment rate, employment in agriculture, and gross value added must be considered the most. The agricultural, entrepreneurial income prediction is mainly influenced by the total factor productivity, while agricultural research and development investments depend on gross value added, direct pay-ments, and gross value added in the agricultural sector. Future research, related to prediction models based on CAP indicators, should also consider the marketing dimension. It is recommended for direct payments to be used to invest in upgrading the fertilizers technologies, since environmental sustainability will influence economic growth. © 2021 by the authors.

As nondestructive remote sensing equipment with high precision, high flexibility, and low-cost, unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have been widely used to monitor crop biomass. In this review, UAS platforms and sensors, biomass indices, and data analysis methods are presented. The improvements of UAS in monitoring crop biomass in recent years are introduced, and multisensor fusion, multi-index fusion, the consideration of features not directly related to monitoring biomass, the adoption of advanced algorithms and the use of low-cost sensors are reviewed to highlight the potential for monitoring crop biomass with UAS.

Past work in various fields has produced multiple prediction methods to contribute to different plant breeding objectives. Our proposed framework focuses on the integration of these methods into decision-support tools that quantify the effects on multiple objectives of decisions made throughout the plant breeding pipeline. We discuss the complementarities among these methods with an emphasis on integration into tools that utilize operations research and systems approaches to help plant breeders rapidly and optimally design new cultivars under extant time, cost, and environmental constraints. In illustrating this potential, we demonstrate the interconnectedness and probabilistic nature of plant breeding objectives and highlight research opportunities to refine and combine knowledge across multiple disciplines. Such a framework can help plant breeders more efficiently breed for future environments, including so-called minor crops, leading to an overall increase in the resiliency of global food production systems. © 2021 The AuthorsGlobal climate change threatens the sufficiency and stability of the global food supply.

In contrast to classical approaches that emphasize the need for resource-intensive phenotyping at all stages of artificial selection, genomic selection dramatically reduces the need for phenotyping. Genomic selection relies on advances in machine learning and the availability of genotyping data to predict agronomically relevant phenotypic traits. Here we provide a systematic review of machine learning approaches applied for genomic selection of single and multiple traits in major crops in the past decade. We emphasize the need to gather data on intermediate phenotypes, e.g. metabolite, protein, and gene expression levels, along with developments of modeling techniques that can lead to further improvements of genomic selection. In addition, we provide a critical view of factors that affect genomic selection, with attention to transferability of models between different environments.

Understanding the driving factors and developing predictive algorithms for Y0 will enhance the optimization of N fertilization in maize. Using a random forest algorithm, we analyzed data from 679 maize N fertilization studies (1031 Y0 observations) conducted between 1999–2019 in the United States and Canada. Predictability of Y0 was assessed while identifying determinant factors such as soil, crop management, and weather. The inclusion of weather variables as predictors improved the model efficiency (ME) from 51 up to 64 %, and reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) from 2.5 to 2.0 Mg ha−1, 34 to 27 % in relative terms (RRMSE). The most relevant predictors of Y0 were previous crop, irrigation, and soil organic matter (SOM), while the most influential weather data was linked to the radiation per unit of thermal time (Q quotient) around flowering and spring precipitations. The crop rotation effect resulted in Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) as the previous crop with the highest Y0 level (IQR = 11.5–15.0 Mg ha−1) as compared to annual legumes (IQR = 5.6–10.0 Mg ha−1) and other previous crops (IQR = 3.6–7.8 Mg ha−1). The Q quotient around flowering positively affected Y0, while spring precipitations and extreme temperature events during grain filling showed a negative association to Y0. Overall, these results reinforce the concept that yields are controlled not only by soil N supply but also by factors modifying plant demand and ability to capture N. Lastly, we foresee a promising future for the use of machine learning to address both prediction and interpretation of maize yield to obtain more reliable N guidelines. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Maize; Soil nitrogen supply; Yield forecast","assessment method; crop plant; crop rotation; crop yield; fertilizer application; maize; soil nitrogen; soil organic matter; temperature effect; uncertainty analysis; Canada; United States; Fabaceae; Medicago sativa; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Our study area is the Tocantins-Araguaia River Basin (TAW), focusing on the Tucuruí Hydropower Plant (THP), downstream of the TAW. In this study, we evaluated four scenarios of change in land use and cover for the TAW in which forest areas were replaced by pasture, then by agriculture, then by reforestation vegetation and, finally, by regenerated forest to investigate the impacts on the hydrological components of the basin and the hydropower potential of the THP according to these scenarios. For this evaluation, the SWAT model was used to simulate the streamflow of each scenario, so it was possible to predict the hydropower potential in the TAW under different environmental perspectives. Nonparametric statistics were used to identify the efficiency of turbines in converting the streamflow into energy at the 5% significance level. A reduction was observed in the annual evapotranspiration rate and increments were observed in the surface runoff and streamflow, but despite the increase in flow, there was no increase in the energy produced at the THP due to the inability of the turbines to convert excess water into energy, with losses in the energy production of up to 30% per month and 65% in the annual balance.

Farmers can adapt their management, traders or insurers their pricing schemes, suppliers their stocks, logistic companies their routes, national authorities their food balance sheets to guide import or export and, finally, international aid organizations can mobilize reliefs. Evidence has grown in the literature that such forecasts with a meaningful lead time are possible on various geographic scales and for a broad range of crops. Here, we present a systematic review of the methods applied in end-of-season yield forecasting and three frequently used data sources: weather data, satellite data and crop masks. Our literature database comprises 362 studies (2004–2019) which were evaluated regarding methods, crops, regions, data sources, lead time and performance. Moreover, we present 24 sources of real-time and predictive weather data, 21 sources of remote sensing data and 16 crop masks. Yield forecasting in our literature sample has been performed for 44 crops in 71 countries, also including many non-staple crops, but with an apparent bias in regions and crops. Forecasting performance depends on various factors, including crop, region, method, lead time to harvest and input diversity. Our systematic review supports a broader application of locally successful approaches at larger scales by providing a comprehensive, accessible compendium of necessary information for yield forecasting. We discuss improvement potentials with respect to methodological approaches and available data sources. We additionally suggest standardization procedures for future forecasting studies and encourage studying additional crops and geographic regions.

Salinity limits the growth and productivity of crops worldwide. Na+/H+ antiporters play a key role during the plant development and in its tolerance to salt stress. The aim of the present study was a genome-wide characterization and expression pattern analysis under the salinity stress of the sodium-proton antiporter (NHX) of Gossypium barbadense in comparison with Gossypium hirsutum. In G. barbadense, 25 NHX genes were identified on the basis of the Na+_H+ exchanger domain. All except one of the G. barbadense NHX transporters have an Amiloride motif that is a known inhibitor of Na+ ions in plants. A phylogenetic analysis inferred three classes of GbNHX genes—viz., Vac (GbNHX1, 2 and 4), Endo (GbNHX6), and PM (GbNHX7). A high number of the stress-related cis-acting elements observed in promoters show their role in tolerance against abiotic stresses. The Ka/Ks values show that the majority of GbNHX genes are subjected to strong purifying selection under the course of evolution. To study the functional divergence of G. barbadense NHX transporters, the real-time gene expression was analyzed under salt stress in the root, stem, and leaf tissues. In G. barbadense, the expression was higher in the stem, while in G. hirsutum the leaf and root showed a high expression. Moreover, our results revealed that NHX2 homologues in both species have a high expression under salinity stress at higher time intervals, followed by NHX7. The protein-protein prediction study revealed that GbNHX7 is involved in the CBL-CIPK protein interaction pathway. Our study also provided valuable information explaining the molecular mechanism of Na+ transport for the further functional study of Gossypium NHX genes. © 2020 by the authors.

Machine vision is one of the most popular parts of machine learning and has been widely used where advanced automation and control have been required. The trend has shifted from classical image processing and machine learning techniques to modern artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) methods. Based on large training datasets and pre-trained models, DL-based methods have proven to be more accurate than previous traditional techniques. Machine vision has wide applications in agriculture, including the detection of weeds and pests in crops. Variation in lighting conditions, failures to transfer learning, and object occlusion constitute key challenges in this domain. Recently, DL has gained much attention due to its advantages in object detection, classification, and feature extraction. DL algorithms can automatically extract information from large amounts of data used to model complex problems and is, therefore, suitable for detecting and classifying weeds and crops. We present a systematic review of AI-based systems to detect weeds, emphasizing recent trends in DL. Various DL methods are discussed to clarify their overall potential, usefulness, and performance.

The rapid growth in food production through specialized operations such as monoculture cropping systems has aligned to satisfy increases in demand for food and fiber. However, its adverse impacts on natural resources pose huge challenges for the sustainability of food production. The situation is direr for developing countries or rural regions of the world due to the limited resources available to farming communities in these regions. To avoid production agriculture being at the proverbial crossroads we suggest an alternate approach. One that involves the sustainable use of natural resources without adverse environmental impacts by relying less on production inputs whether it be agrochemicals or machineries. We examined the extent to which regenerative agriculture, permaculture, and smart technology have evolved in response to sustainable agricultural production, agricultural decision support system, and overall global food security. Collectively, regenerative agriculture and permaculture are semi-closed holistic systems approach designed to reduce or eliminate dependence on external inputs (e.g., chemicals) which restores and maintains natural systems (e.g., soil quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem services). We suggest that fully embracing modern regenerative agriculture as well as integrated permaculture will improve soil health, ecosystem biodiversity, land and resource conservation, agricultural sustainability, and food security.

These and other digitalization-enabling technologies are generating a massive amount of data with enormous potential to manage supply chains more efficiently and sustainably. Nevertheless, the intricate patterns and complexity embedded in large volumes of data present a challenge for systematic human expert analysis. In such a datadriven context, Computational Intelligence (CI) has achieved significant momentum to analyze, mine, and extract the underlying data information, or solve complex optimization problems, striking a balance between productive efficiency and sustainability of food supply systems. Although some recent studies have sorted the CI literature in this field, they are mainly oriented towards a single family of CI methods (a group of methods that share common characteristics) and review their application in specific FSC stages. As such, there is a gap in identifying and classifying FSC problems from a broader perspective, encompassing the various families of CI methods that can be applied in different stages (from production to retailing) and identifying the problems that arise in these stages from a CI perspective. This paper presents a new and comprehensive taxonomy of FSC problems (associated with agriculture, fish farming, and livestock) from a CI approach; that is, it defines FSC problems (from production to retail) and categorizes them based on how they can be modeled from a CI point of view. Furthermore, we review the CI approaches that are more commonly used in each stage of the FSC and in their corresponding categories of problems. We also introduce a set of guidelines to help FSC researchers and practitioners to decide on suitable families of methods when addressing any particular problems they might encounter. Finally, based on the proposed taxonomy, we identify and discuss challenges and research opportunities that the community should explore to enhance the contributions that CI can bring to the digitization of the FSC. © 2021 by the authors.

Disease control has been a research object in many scientific and technologic domains. Technological advances in sensors, data storage, computing resources and artificial intelligence have shown enormous potential to control diseases effectively. A growing body of literature recognizes the importance of using data from different types of sensors and machine learning approaches to build models for detection, prediction, analysis, assessment, etc. However, the increasing number and diversity of research studies requires a literature review for further developments and contributions in this area. This paper reviews state-of-the-art machine learning methods that use different data sources, applied to plant disease detection. It lists traditional and deep learning methods associated with the main data acquisition modalities, namely IoT, ground imaging, unmanned aerial vehicle imaging and satellite imaging. In addition, this study examines the role of data fusion for ongoing research in the context of disease detection. It highlights the advantage of intelligent data fusion techniques, from heterogeneous data sources, to improve plant health status prediction and presents the main challenges facing this field.

Although PM concentrations have been assessed using air quality monitoring stations or modelling, few studies have measured indoor PM in large-scale birth cohorts. The Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS) measured indoor and outdoor air quality in approximately 5000 households when the participating children were aged 1.5 and 3 years. PM was collected using portable pumps for 7 days (total of 24 h), inside and outside each home. Prediction models for indoor PM concentrations were built using data collected at age 1.5 years and post-validated against data collected at age 3 years. Median indoor/outdoor PM2.5 and PM10–2.5 concentrations at age 1.5 years [3 years] were 12.9/12.7 [12.5/11.3] μg/m3 and 5.0/6.3 [5.1/6.1] μg/m3, respectively. Random forest regression analysis found that the major predictors of indoor PM2.5 were indoor PM10–2.5, outdoor PM2.5, indoor smoking, observable smoke and indoor/outdoor temperature. Indoor PM2.5, outdoor PM10–2.5, indoor humidity and opening room windows were important predictors of indoor PM10–2.5 concentrations. Indoor benzene, acetaldehyde, ozone and nitrogen dioxide concentrations were also found to predict indoor PM2.5 and PM10–2.5 concentrations, possibly due to the formation of secondary organic aerosols. These findings demonstrate the importance of reducing outdoor PM concentrations, avoiding indoor smoking, using air cleaner in applicable and diminishing sources of VOCs that could form secondary organic aerosols, and the resulting models can be used to predict indoor PM concentrations for the rest of the JECS cohort. © 2021 The Author(s)","Birth cohort; Household characteristics; Indoor air; Particulate matter; Volatile organic compounds","acetaldehyde; benzene; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air quality; concentration (composition); indoor air; morbidity; mortality; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; risk factor; smoke; spatiotemporal analysis; air quality; ambient air; Article; household; humidity; Japan; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; prediction; priority journal; random forest; secondary organic aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; child; environmental monitoring; human; indoor air pollution; infant; Japan; particle size; particulate matter; preschool child; Japan; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; Child; Child, Preschool; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Infant; Japan; Particle Size; Particulate Matter",Article,Scopus

Especially, growing status observation and smart oil palm plantation management enabled by such accurate detections would improve plantation planning, oil palm yield, and reduce manpower and consumption of fertilizer. Although existing studies have already reached a high accuracy in oil palm tree detection, rare attention has been paid to automated observation of each single oil palm tree's growing status. Nowadays, with its high spatial resolution and low cost, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has become a promising tool for monitoring the growing status of individual oil palms. However, the accuracy is still a challenging issue because of the extreme imbalance and high similarity between different classes. In this paper, we propose a Multi-class Oil PAlm Detection approach (MOPAD) to reap both accurate detection of oil palm trees and accurate monitoring of their growing status. Based on Faster RCNN, MOPAD combines a Refined Pyramid Feature (RPF) module and a hybrid class-balanced loss module to achieve satisfying observation of the growing status for individual oil palms. The former takes advantage of multi-level features to distinguish similar classes and detect small oil palms, and the latter effectively resolves the problem of extremely imbalanced samples. Moreover, we elaborately analyze the distribution of different kinds of oil palms, and propose a practical workflow for detecting oil palm vacancy. We evaluate MOPAD using three large-scale UAV images photographed in two sites in Indonesia (denoted by Site 1 and Site 2), containing 363,877 oil palms of five categories: healthy palms, dead palms, mismanaged palms, smallish palms and yellowish palms. Our proposed MOPAD achieves an F1-score of 87.91% (Site 1) and 99.04% (Site 2) for overall oil palm tree detection, and outperforms other state-of-the-art object detection methods by a remarkable margin of 10.37–17.09% and 8.14%-21.32% with respect to the average F1-score for multi-class oil palm detection in Site 1 and Site 2, respectively.

The human factor has a significant impact on the efficiency of document search. An average user is not aware of the advanced option of a query language and uses typical queries. Development of a specialized software toolkit intended for information systems and electronic document management systems can be an effective solution of the tasks listed above. Such toolkits should be based on the means and methods of automatic keyword extraction and text classification. The categorization (or classification) of texts into predefined categories has witnessed a booming interest in the last 10 years due to the increased availability of documents in digital form and the ensuing need to organize them. Thus, research on keyword extraction, advancements in the field, and possible future solutions is of great importance in current times. Developing a Keyword Extractor and Document Classifier: Emerging Research and Opportunities presents an information extraction mechanism that can process many kinds of inputs, realize the type of text, and understand the percentage of the keywords that has to be stored. This mechanism then supports information extraction and information categorization mechanisms. This module is used to support a text summarization mechanism, which leads-with the help of the keyword extraction module-to text categorization. It employs lexical and information retrieval techniques to extract phrases from the document text that are likely to characterize it and determines the category of the retrieved text to present a summary to the users.

The quality of data collected from sensors greatly influences the performance of the modelling processes using ML algorithms. These three elements (e.g., BD, ML and IoT) have been used tremendously to improve all areas of rice production processes in agriculture, which transform traditional rice farming practices into a new era of rice smart farming or rice precision agriculture.

Canopy structure-and chlorophyll-sensitive VIs derived from Sentinel-2 images were used to estimate the start and end of the growing season (SOS and EOS, respectively) during the period 2016-2018, for an SRC poplar (Populus spp.) plantation in Lochristi (Belgium). Three different filtering methods (Savitzky-Golay (SavGol), polynomial (Polyfit) and Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS) and five SOS-and EOS threshold methods (first derivative function, 10% and 20% percentages and 10% and 20% percentiles) were applied to identify the optimal methods for the determination of phenophases. Our results showed that the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) had the best fit with GPP phenology, as derived from eddy covariance measurements, in identifying SOSand EOS-dates. For SOS, the performance was only slightly better than for several other indices, whereas for EOS, MTCI performed markedly better. The relationship between SOS/EOS derived from GPP and VIs varied interannually. MTCI described best the seasonal pattern of the SRC plantation's GPP (R2 = 0.52 when combining all three years). However, during the extreme dry year 2018, the Chlorophyll Red Edge Index performed slightly better in reproducing growing season GPP variability than MTCI (R2 = 0.59; R2 = 0.49, respectively). Regarding smoothing functions, Polyfit and HANTS methods showed the best (and very similar) performances. We further found that defining SOS as the date at which the 10% or 20% percentile occurred, yielded the best agreement between the VIs and the GPP; while for EOS the dates of the 10% percentile threshold came out as the best. © 2020 by the authors.

The increasing availability of soil data that can be efficiently acquired remotely and proximally, and freely available open-source algorithms, have led to an accelerated adoption of ML techniques to analyse soil data. Given the large number of publications, it is an impossible task to manually review all papers on the application of ML in soil science without narrowing down a narrative of ML application in a specific research question. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the application of ML techniques in soil science aided by a ML algorithm (latent Dirichlet allocation) to find patterns in a large collection of text corpora. The objective is to gain insight into publications of ML applications in soil science and to discuss the research gaps in this topic. We found that (a) there is an increasing usage of ML methods in soil sciences, mostly concentrated in developed countries, (b) the reviewed publications can be grouped into 12 topics, namely remote sensing, soil organic carbon, water, contamination, methods (ensembles), erosion and parent material, methods (NN, neural networks, SVM, support vector machines), spectroscopy, modelling (classes), crops, physical, and modelling (continuous), and (c) advanced ML methods usually perform better than simpler approaches thanks to their capability to capture non-linear relationships. From these findings, we found research gaps, in particular, about the precautions that should be taken (parsimony) to avoid overfitting, and that the interpretability of the ML models is an important aspect to consider when applying advanced ML methods in order to improve our knowledge and understanding of soil. We foresee that a large number of studies will focus on the latter topic. © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

Therefore, phenotyping to enhance resilience to these abiotic stresses is critical for sustaining genetic gains in crop improvement programs. However, traditional methods for screening traits related to these stresses are slow, laborious, and often expensive. Remote sensing provides opportunities to introduce low-cost, less biased, high-Throughput phenotyping methods to capture large genetic diversity to facilitate enhancement of stress resilience in crops. This review focuses on four key physiological traits and processes that are critical in understanding crop responses to drought and heat stress during reproductive and grain-filling periods. Specifically, these traits include: (i) time of day of flowering, to escape these stresses during flowering; (ii) optimizing photosynthetic efficiency; (iii) storage and translocation of water-soluble carbohydrates; and (iv) yield and yield components to provide in-season yield estimates. Moreover, we provide an overview of current advances in remote sensing in capturing these traits, and discuss the limitations with existing technology as well as future direction of research to develop high-Throughput phenotyping approaches. In the future, phenotyping these complex traits will require sensor advancement, high-quality imagery combined with machine learning methods, and efforts in transdisciplinary science to foster integration across disciplines. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.","Drought stress; Field-based high-Throughput phenotyping; Heat stress; Photosynthetic efficiency; Remote sensing; Time of day of flowering; Water-soluble carbohydrates; Yield estimation",,Review,Scopus

Our findings demonstrate a pervasive pattern of encroachment into areas that are increasingly marginal for production, but highly significant for wildlife, and suggest that such tradeoffs may be further amplified by future cropland expansion. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"agricultural land; agricultural production; butterfly; crop yield; land use change; nesting; waterfowl; article; breeding; butterfly; cropland; habitat; harvest; nesting; nonhuman; prairie; summer; United States; waterfowl; wildlife; animal; biodiversity; cost; crop; crop production; economics; environmental protection; plant dispersal; spatiotemporal analysis; United States; wild animal; Prairie Pothole Region; Anatidae; Asclepias; Danaus plexippus; Animals; Animals, Wild; Biodiversity; Butterflies; Conservation of Natural Resources; Costs and Cost Analysis; Crop Production; Crops, Agricultural; Plant Dispersal; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; United States",Article,Scopus

Since eddy covariance flux towers have a relatively small footprint and are distributed unevenly across the world, upscaling the observations is necessary to obtain global-scale estimates of biosphere-atmosphere exchange. Based on cross-consistency checks with atmospheric inversions, sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) and dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), here we provide a systematic assessment of the latest upscaling efforts for gross primary production (GPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the FLUXCOM initiative, where different machine learning methods, forcing data sets and sets of predictor variables were employed.</p> Spatial patterns of mean GPP are consistent across FLUXCOM and DGVM ensembles ( at 1 spatial resolution) while the majority of DGVMs show, for 70 of the land surface, values outside the FLUXCOM range. Global mean GPP magnitudes for 2008-2010 from FLUXCOM members vary within 106 and 130 PgC class with the largest uncertainty in the tropics. Seasonal variations in independent SIF estimates agree better with FLUXCOM GPP (mean global pixel-wise) than with GPP from DGVMs (mean global pixel-wise). Seasonal variations in FLUXCOM NEE show good consistency with atmospheric inversion-based net land carbon fluxes, particularly for temperate and boreal regions. Interannual variability of global NEE in FLUXCOM is underestimated compared to inversions and DGVMs. The FLUXCOM version which also uses meteorological inputs shows a strong co-variation in interannual patterns with inversions (for 2001-2010). Mean regional NEE from FLUXCOM shows larger uptake than inversion and DGVM-based estimates, particularly in the tropics with discrepancies of up to several hundred grammes of carbon per square metre per year. These discrepancies can only partly be reconciled by carbon loss pathways that are implicit in inversions but not captured by the flux tower measurements such as carbon emissions from fires and water bodies. We hypothesize that a combination of systematic biases in the underlying eddy covariance data, in particular in tall tropical forests, and a lack of site history effects on NEE in FLUXCOM are likely responsible for the too strong tropical carbon sink estimated by FLUXCOM. Furthermore, as FLUXCOM does not account for fertilization effects, carbon flux trends are not realistic. Overall, current FLUXCOM estimates of mean annual and seasonal cycles of GPP as well as seasonal NEE variations provide useful constraints of global carbon cycling, while interannual variability patterns from FLUXCOM are valuable but require cautious interpretation. Exploring the diversity of Earth observation data and of machine learning concepts along with improved quality and quantity of flux tower measurements will facilitate further improvements of the FLUXCOM approach overall. © 2020.

Each of these three domains requires dedicated sensor technology currently in place for ground and airborne applications and either have satellite concepts under development (e.g., HySPIRI/SBG (Surface Biology and Geology), Sentinel-8, HiTeSEM in the TIR) or are subject to satellite missions recently launched or scheduled within the next years (i.e., EnMAP and PRISMA (PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa, launched on March 2019) in the VNIR/SWIR, Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) in the SIF). Identification of plant water stress or drought is of utmost importance to guarantee global water and food supply. Therefore, knowledge of crop water status over large farmland areas bears large potential for optimizing agricultural water use. As plant responses to water stress are numerous and complex, their physiological consequences affect the electromagnetic signal in different spectral domains. This review paper summarizes the importance of water stress-related applications and the plant responses to water stress, followed by a concise review of water-stress detection through remote sensing, focusing on TIR without neglecting the comparison to other spectral domains (i.e., VNIR/SWIR and SIF) and multi-sensor approaches. Current and planned sensors at ground, airborne, and satellite level for the TIR as well as a selection of commonly used indices and approaches for water-stress detection using the main multi-/hyperspectral remote sensing imaging techniques are reviewed. Several important challenges are discussed that occur when using spectral emissivity, temperature-based indices, and physically-based approaches for water-stress detection in the TIR spectral domain. Furthermore, challenges with data processing and the perspectives for future satellite missions in the TIR are critically examined. In conclusion, information from multi-/hyperspectral TIR together with those from VNIR/SWIR and SIF sensors within a multi-sensor approach can provide profound insights to actual plant (water) status and the rationale of physiological and biochemical changes. Synergistic sensor use will open new avenues for scientists to study plant functioning and the response to environmental stress in a wide range of ecosystems. © 2019 by the authors.","Crop stress; Drought; Emissivity; Evapotranspiration (ET) modeling; Remote sensing; Temperature; Thermal infrared (TIR); Water stress; Water use","Crops; Data handling; Drought; Fluorescence; Food supply; Forestry; Imaging techniques; Infrared radiation; Physiological models; Physiology; Plants (botany); Satellites; Stresses; Temperature; Water supply; Emissivity; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Shortwave Infrared Reflectance; State-of-the-art techniques; Thermal infrared; Thermal infrared remote sensing; Water stress; Water use; Remote sensing",Review,Scopus

Although significant progress achieved and surveyed in addressing ANN application to PR challenges, nevertheless, some problems are yet to be resolved like whimsical orientation (the unknown path that cannot be accurately calculated due to its directional position). Other problem includes; object classification, location, scaling, neurons behavior analysis in hidden layers, rule, and template matching. Also, the lack of extant literature on the issues associated with ANN application to PR seems to slow down research focus and progress in the field. Hence, there is a need for state-of-the-art in neural networks application to PR to urgently address the above-highlights problems for more successes. The study furnishes readers with a clearer understanding of the current, and new trend in ANN models that effectively addresses PR challenges to enable research focus and topics. Similarly, the comprehensive review reveals the diverse areas of the success of ANN models and their application to PR. In evaluating the performance of ANN models, some statistical indicators for measuring the performance of the ANN model in many studies were adopted. Such as the use of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and variance of absolute percentage error (VAPE). The result shows that the current ANN models such as GAN, SAE, DBN, RBM, RNN, RBFN, PNN, CNN, SLP, MLP, MLNN, Reservoir computing, and Transformer models are performing excellently in their application to PR tasks.

Although, current biology is challenged by high data dimensionality in general, this is particularly true for plant biology. Plants as sessile organisms have to cope with environmental fluctuations. This typically results in strong dynamics of metabolite and protein concentrations which are often challenging to quantify.

A U-Shape convolutional neural network (U-Net), based on a deep residual learning framework, was developed for the semantic segmentation of date palm trees. A comprehensive set of labeled data was established to enable the training and evaluation of the proposed segmentation model and increase its generalization capability.

Experimental results showed that the proposed model outperformed other FCNs in the validation and testing datasets. The generalizability evaluation of the proposed approach on a comprehensive and complex testing dataset exhibited higher classification accuracy and showed that date palm trees could be automatically mapped from VHSR UAV images with an F-score, mean intersection over union, precision, and recall of 91%, 85%, 0.91, and 0.92, respectively.

Field observations and remote sensing both show that tundra “greening” has been widespread, but heterogeneity in regional and landscape-scale trends suggest that additional controls are mediating the response of tundra vegetation to warming. In this study, we examined the relationship between changes in vegetation productivity in the western Canadian Arctic and biophysical variables by analyzing trends in the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) obtained from nonparametric regression of annual Landsat surface reflectance composites. We used Random Forests classification and regression tree modelling to predict the trajectory and magnitude of greening from 1984 to 2016 and identify biophysical controls. More than two-thirds of our study area showed statistically significant increases in vegetation productivity, but observed changes were heterogeneous, occurring most rapidly within areas of the Southern Arctic that were: (1) dominated by dwarf and upright shrub cover types, (2) moderately sloping, and (3) located at lower elevation. These findings suggest that the response of tundra vegetation to warming is mediated by regional- and landscape-scale variation in microclimate, topography and soil moisture, and physiological differences among plant functional groups.

Concretely, technologies like Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), Image Processing, Machine Learning, Big Data, Cloud Computing, and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), are expected to bring significant changes in this area. Expected benefits are the increase in production, the decrease in cost by reducing the inputs needed such as fuel, fertilizer and pesticides, the reduction in labor efforts, and finally improvement in the quality of the final products. Such innovative methods are crucial in recent days, due to the exponential increase of the global population, the importance of producing healthier products grown with as much fewer pesticides, where public opinion of European citizens is sensitized. Moreover, due to the globalization of the world economy, European countries face the low cost of production of other low-income countries.

Rapid and accurate acquisition of information about large plant populations is critical for monitoring plant health and dissecting the underlying genetic traits. In recent years, high‐throughput phenotyping technology has benefitted immensely from both remote sensing and machine learning. Simultaneous use of multiple sensors (e.g., high‐resolution RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, chlorophyll fluorescence, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR)) allows a range of spatial and spectral resolutions depending on the trait in question. Meanwhile, computer vision and machine learning methodology have emerged as powerful tools for extracting useful biological information from image data. Together, these tools allow the evaluation of various morphological, structural, biophysical, and biochemical traits. In this review, we focus on the recent development of phenomics approaches in strawberry farming, particularly those utilizing remote sensing and machine learning, with an eye toward future prospects for strawberries in precision agriculture.

Together these stresses suppress global crop production by as much as 50% and their impacts are predicted to be exacerbated by climate change. Infrastructure and management practices can mitigate these detrimental impacts, but are costly. Crop breeding for improved tolerance has had some success but is progressing slowly and is not keeping pace with climate change. In contrast, Silicon (Si) is known to improve plant tolerance to a range of stresses and could provide a sustainable, rapid and cost-effective mitigation method. The exact mechanisms are still under debate but it appears Si can relieve salt stress via accumulation in the root apoplast where it reduces “bypass flow of ions to the shoot. Si-dependent drought relief has been linked to lowered root hydraulic conductance and reduction of water loss through transpiration. However, many alternative mechanisms may play a role such as altered gene expression and increased accumulation of compatible solutes. Oxidative damage that occurs under stress conditions can be reduced by Si through increased antioxidative enzymes while Si-improved photosynthesis has also been reported. Si fertilizer can be produced relatively cheaply and to assess its economic viability to improve crop stress tolerance we present a cost-benefit analysis. It suggests that Si fertilization may be beneficial in many agronomic settings but may be beyond the means of smallholder farmers in developing countries. Si application may also have disadvantages, such as increased soil pH, less efficient conversion of crops into biofuel and reduced digestibility of animal fodder. These issues may hamper uptake of Si fertilization as a routine agronomic practice. Here, we critically evaluate recent literature, quantifying the most significant physiological changes associated with Si in plants under drought and salinity stress. Analyses show that metrics associated with photosynthesis, water balance and oxidative stress all improve when Si is present during plant exposure to salinity and drought. We further conclude that most of these changes can be explained by apoplastic roles of Si while there is as yet little evidence to support biochemical roles of this element. © Copyright © 2020 Thorne, Hartley and Maathuis.","agronomy; drought; osmotic stress; oxidative stress; photosynthesis; review; salinity; silicon fertilization",,Article,Scopus

No quantitative evidence exists of how their exclusion may lead to potentially inaccurate model projections and understanding of hydrologic dynamics across the world's major river basins. To fill this knowledge gap, we developed the first-ever major river basin-scale modeling approach integrating surface depressions and focusing on the 450,000-km2 Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) in the United States. We applied a novel topography-based algorithm to estimate areas and volumes of ~455,000 surface depressions (&gt;1 ha) across the UMRB (in addition to lakes and reservoirs) and subsequently aggregated their effects per subbasin. Compared to a “no depression” conventional model, our depression-integrated model (a) improved streamflow simulation accuracy with increasing upstream abundance of depression storage, (b) significantly altered the spatial patterns and magnitudes of water yields across 315,000 km2 (70%) of the basin area, and (c) provided realistic spatial distributions of rootzone wetness conditions corresponding to satellite-based data. Results further suggest that storage capacity (i.e., volume) alone does not fully explain depressions' cumulative effects on landscape hydrologic responses. Local (i.e., subbasin level) climatic and geophysical drivers and downstream flowpath-regulating structures (e.g., reservoirs and dams) influence the extent to which depression storage volume in a subbasin causes hydrologic effects. With these new insights, our study supports the integration of surface depression storage and thereby catalyzes a reassessment of current hydrological modeling and management practices for basin-scale studies. ©2020.

The information about current and future yield, termed a yield assessment in this paper, is an essential decision-making element for the grape and wine industry. Crop management, wine-making, commercial, accounting and strategic operations are all adapted to and all impact on the expected yield of the current vintage. Numerous yield assessment approaches have been proposed in the scientific literature. However, only a few of them have considered their adaptation to the operational context under the constraints, needs and strategies of commercial vineyards and wineries. The few studies that have worked on the operational implementation of yield assessment methods have only partially addressed this issue, concentrating their improvement efforts on a single step in the yield assessment process. This paper first proposes to review the characteristics of yield development in an operational context that must be taken into account by yield assessment methodsThese characteristics are consolidated into three main challenges for yield assessment methods: (i) addressing the complex temporality of yield development, (ii) ensuring a local monitoring of yield development and (iii) fitting to the operational needs and constraints to allow for relevant decision support systems in the field. The approaches of yield estimation, prediction and forecast are discussed in the context of these challenges. In a second step, the paper proposes a generic framework for the yield assessment process, including a review of the variables that are used to explain grapevine yield. Issues and proposals from the literature associated respectively with measurement, sampling and yield modelling are reviewed and the need for improved modelling of relationships between explanatory variables and the desired, reported yield variable is discussed. The yield assessment methods found in the literature are categorised and compared according to measurement, estimation and modelling approaches, and then according to the three challenges identified for yield assessment in operational conditions, such that the yield assessment method is adapted to commercial needs and not to research objectives. In conclusion, concrete proposals for new grape yield assessment methods are discussed in order to investigate the as yet unexplored opportunities for the improvement in yield assessment in operational contexts that have been identified in the paper. These considerations could easily be transposed to other perennial crops. © 2021","Climate; Measurement; Operational; Sampling; Uncertainty; Wine; Yield models","agricultural management; assessment method; crop plant; crop yield; decision support system; detection method; forecasting method; vine; viticulture; yield response",Review,Scopus

Nonetheless, the question in these unstopped evolutions is about the interlinkages with sustainability. In this context, the objectives of this study are to highlight the main insights from the available scientific literature about the interrelationships between the new trends in the agriculture and the sustainability.

Plant phenotyping robots have emerged as a high-throughput technology to measure morphological, chemical and physiological properties of large number of plants. Several robotic systems have been developed to fulfill different phenotyping missions. In particular, robotic phenotyping has the potential to enable efficient monitoring of changes in plant traits over time in both controlled environments and in the field. The operation of these robots can be challenging as a result of the dynamic nature of plants and the agricultural environments. Here we discuss developments in phenotyping robots, and the challenges which have been overcome and others which remain outstanding. In addition, some perspective applications of the phenotyping robots are also presented.

Remote sensing emerged as a key technology revealing both spatial and temporal vegetation patterns. Harnessing the ever growing streams of remote sensing data for the increasing demands on vegetation assessments and monitoring requires efficient, accurate and flexible methods for data analysis. In this respect, the use of deep learning methods is trend-setting, enabling high predictive accuracy, while learning the relevant data features independently in an end-to-end fashion. Very recently, a series of studies have demonstrated that the deep learning method of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is very effective to represent spatial patterns enabling to extract a wide array of vegetation properties from remote sensing imagery. This review introduces the principles of CNN and distils why they are particularly suitable for vegetation remote sensing. The main part synthesizes current trends and developments, including considerations about spectral resolution, spatial grain, different sensors types, modes of reference data generation, sources of existing reference data, as well as CNN approaches and architectures. The literature review showed that CNN can be applied to various problems, including the detection of individual plants or the pixel-wise segmentation of vegetation classes, while numerous studies have evinced that CNN outperform shallow machine learning methods. Several studies suggest that the ability of CNN to exploit spatial patterns particularly facilitates the value of very high spatial resolution data. The modularity in the common deep learning frameworks allows a high flexibility for the adaptation of architectures, whereby especially multi-modal or multi-temporal applications can benefit. An increasing availability of techniques for visualizing features learned by CNNs will not only contribute to interpret but to learn from such models and improve our understanding of remotely sensed signals of vegetation. Although CNN has not been around for long, it seems obvious that they will usher in a new era of vegetation remote sensing. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

It is a key to improve productivity by using the best agricultural practices and optimal usage of resources. Agriculture faces diverse challenges due to soil degradation, climate variation, and increasing costs. To unfold these challenges, PA uses Wireless Sensor Networks(WSNs) and exploits acquisition, communication, and processing of the data as basic enabling technologies to amplify the crop yield. Also, many other multidisciplinary technologies are supporting PA in finding the most novel use cases for PA. The use of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed PA at almost every level. The fog/edge paradigm is mitigating many challenges such as network bandwidth and security by bringing computation closer to the deployed network. At the same time, Software Defined Networks (SDN) brings flexibility, big data assists in handling data, and nanotechnology plays a crucial part in driving the innovation in PA.

Generally, methylation within genes promoter inhibits regulatory protein binding and represses transcription, whereas gene body methylation is associated with actively transcribed genes. However, it remains unclear whether there is interaction between methylation levels across genic regions and which site has the biggest impact on gene regulation. We investigated and used the methylation patterns of the bread wheat cultivar Chinese Spring to uncover differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between roots and leaves, using six machine learning algorithms and a deep neural network. As anticipated, genes with higher expression in leaves were mainly involved in photosynthesis and pigment biosynthesis processes whereas genes that were not differentially expressed between roots and leaves were involved in protein processes and membrane structures. Methylation occurred preponderantly (60%) in the CG context, whereas 35 and 5% of methylation occurred in CHG and CHH contexts, respectively. Methylation levels were highly correlated (r = 0.7 to 0.9) between all genic regions, except within the promoter (r = 0.4 to 0.5). Machine learning models gave a high (0.81) prediction accuracy of DEGs. There was a strong correlation (p-value = 9.20×10−10) between all features and gene expression, suggesting that methylation across all genic regions contribute to gene regulation. However, the methylation of the promoter, the CDS and the exon in CG context was the most impactful.

Recently, DB assessment has become an emerging topic of great importance. However, in view of to the stochastic nature of driving, measuring and modeling, DB continues to be a challenging topic today. As such, this paper argues that to move forward in understanding the individual and organizational mechanisms influencing DB, a conceptual framework is outlined whereby DB is viewed in terms of different dimensions established within the Driver–Vehicle–Environment (DVE) system. Moreover, DB assessment has been approached by various machine learning (ML) models. Still, there has been no attempt to analyze the empirical evidence on ML models in a systematic way, furthermore, ML based DB models often face problems and raise questions that must be resolved. This article presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of the DB investigation concept; In the first phase, a framework for conceptualizing a holistic approach of the different facets in DB analysis is presented, as well as a scheme to guide the future development and implementation of DB assessment strategies. In the second phase, an overview of the literature on ML is designed, revealing a premier and unbiased survey of the existing empirical research of ML techniques that have been applied to DB analysis. The results of this study identify an interpretive framework incorporating multiple dimensions influencing the driver's conduct, in an attempt to achieve a thorough understanding of the DB concept within the DVE system in which the drivers operate. Additionally, 82 primary studies published during the last decade and eight broadly used ML models were identified. The findings of this review prove the performance capability of the ML techniques for assessing DB. The models using the ML techniques outperform other conventional approaches. However, the application of ML models in DB analysis is still limited and more effort is needed to obtain well-formed and generalizable results. To this end, and based on the outcomes obtained in this work, future guidelines have been provided to practitioners and researchers to grasp the major contributions and challenges in the state-of-the-art research. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Conceptual framework; Driving behavior analysis; Machine learning; Systematic literature review","Learning systems; Stochastic systems; Conceptual frameworks; Driving behavior; Machine learning techniques; Organizational mechanisms; Performance capability; Surrounding environment; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Machine learning",Article,Scopus

Five estimation methods developing with RS information for energy crop biomass are summarized in this paper. Firstly, the statistical analysis with vegetation index can be regarded as the commonest method. But it is faulted for the deficiency of sample data and the vulnerability to the influence of many factors such as cloudy days. Secondly, the longer wavelength makes SAR information popular for crop biomass estimation. But many limitations lead to measurement uncertainty and bring about poor classification. Thirdly, NPP can directly reflect accumulated biomass production through photosynthesis and measure the consequences caused by climate change and human activities. But, actual LUE, the results of environmental stresses such as light intensity, temperature, water, and nutrients, is usually considered as a constant. Fourthly, crop height information is vitally important for biomass estimation. Yet the corresponding application is often subject to many factors e.g. crop variety, growth period, and farmland management practices limits. Lastly, the most promising approach lies in the possibility of assimilating state variables from RS data into CGMs. And the advent of latest instruments with better characteristics offer a unique chance to overcome current limitations.

However, selecting an appropriate data integration and analysis method to improve the efficiency of phenome-phenome and phenome-genome association studies is still a bottleneck. This study proposes a hyperspectral wide association study (HypWAS) approach as a phenome-phenome association analysis through a hierarchical data integration strategy to estimate the prediction power of hyperspectral reflectance bands in predicting soybean seed yield. Using HypWAS, five important hyperspectral reflectance bands in visible, red-edge, and near-infrared regions were identified significantly associated with seed yield. The phenome-genome association analysis of each tested hyperspectral reflectance band was performed using two conventional genome-wide association studies (GWAS) methods and a machine learning mediated GWAS based on the support vector regression (SVR) method. Using SVR-mediated GWAS, more relevant QTL with the physiological background of the tested hyperspectral reflectance bands were detected, supported by the functional annotation of candidate gene analyses. The results of this study have indicated the advantages of using hierarchical data integration strategy and advanced mathematical methods coupled with phenome-phenome and phenome-genome association analyses for a better understanding of the biology and genetic backgrounds of hyperspectral reflectance bands affecting soybean yield formation. The identified yield-related hyperspectral reflectance bands using HypWAS can be used as indirect selection criteria for selecting superior genotypes with improved yield genetic gains in large breeding populations.

This could potentially be addressed by technological advancements in the form of precision systems, improvements in production, and through ensuring the sustainability of development. In this context, remote-sensing systems are fully equipped to address the complex and technical assessment of crop production, security, and crop water stress in an easy and efficient way. They provide simple and timely solutions for a diverse set of ecological zones. This critical review highlights novel methods for evaluating crop water stress and its correlation with certain measurable parameters, investigated using remote-sensing systems. Through an examination of previous literature, technologies, and data, we review the application of remote-sensing systems in the analysis of crop water stress. Initially, the study presents the relationship of relative water content (RWC) with equivalent water thickness (EWT) and soil moisture crop water stress. Evapotranspiration and sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence are then analyzed in relation to crop water stress using remote sensing. Finally, the study presents various remote-sensing technologies used to detect crop water stress, including optical sensing systems, thermometric sensing systems, land-surface temperature-sensing systems, multispectral (spaceborne and airborne) sensing systems, hyperspectral sensing systems, and the LiDAR sensing system. The study also presents the future prospects of remote-sensing systems in analyzing crop water stress and how they could be further improved. © 2021 by the authors.

Yet, effectively using satellite data in this context requires blending technical knowledge about their capabilities and limitations with an understanding of their influence on the value of risk-reduction programmes. In this Review, we discuss how approaches to estimate agricultural losses for index insurance have evolved from costly field-sampling-based campaigns towards lower-cost techniques using weather and satellite data. We identify advances in remote sensing and crop modelling for assessing agricultural conditions, but reliably and cheaply assessing production losses remains challenging in complex landscapes. We illustrate how an economic framework can be used to gauge and enhance the value of insurance based on earth-observation data, emphasizing that even as yield-estimation techniques improve, the value of an index insurance contract for the insured depends largely on how well it captures the losses when people suffer most. Strategically improving the collection and accessibility of reliable ground-reference data on crop types and production would facilitate this task.

However, without proper management, this expansion can result in environmental problems of irrigation-induced soil salinization. A recent FAO estimate reported that a large portion of total global soil resources are degraded and this problem is persistently expanding. Many irrigated areas of the world are facing the twin problems of soil salinization and waterlogging and presently over 20% of the total global irrigated area is negatively affected by these problems. And, if left unattended, this problem could expand to over 50% of the total global irrigated areas by 2050. The proper management of the aforementioned soil salinization is imperative for achieving most of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. For example, soil salinization management is vital for achieving the ‘Zero Hunger’ (SDG2) and ‘Life on Land’ (SDG15) among other SDGs. This paper provides a comprehensive review of different measures used for managing the environmental problems of soil salinization. All the possible sources of related and up to date literature have been accessed and over 250 publications were collected and thoroughly analyzed for this review. The centrality of the environmental problems is provided. The background of the problems, managing rising water table to control soil salinization, the role of drainage frameworks, the conjunctive use of diverse water sources, utilization of numerical models, and the use of remote sensing and GIS systems are described. And the application of the aforementioned techniques and methods in various case study regions across the globe are discussed which is followed by discussion and research gaps. Derived from the literature analysis and based on the identified research gaps, some key recommendations for future research have been made which could be useful for the stakeholders. The literature analysis revealed that an all-inclusive approach for dealing with the aforesaid environmental problems has been barely considered in the previous studies. Similarly, the continuing impacts of growing salt-tolerant plants on soil characteristics and the environment in total have not been widely considered in the previous investigations. Likewise, better irrigation practices and improved cropping systems along with the long-term environmental impacts of a particular approach has not been extensively covered in these studies. Also, previous studies have scarcely incorporated economic, social, and environmental aspects of the salinization problem altogether in their analysis. The analysis suggested that an inclusive feedback-supported simulation model for managing soil salinization should be considered in future research as the existing models scarcely considered some vital aspects of the problem. It is also suggested to enhance the sensing methods besides retrieval systems to facilitate direct detection of salinization and waterlogging parameters at large-scales. The existing time-lag between occurrence and recording of various data is also suggested to improve in the future scenario by the usage of information from multiple satellites that lessens the problems of spatial resolution by increasing the system efficiency. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental problems; Irrigated agriculture; Remote sensing and GIS; Soil salinization; Sustainable development goals: (SDGs); United nations: (UN)","drainage; environmental impact; GIS; irrigation system; numerical model; remote sensing; saline soil; stakeholder; sustainable development; waterlogging; adult; article; cropping system; halophyte; human; hunger; information retrieval; nonhuman; remote sensing; simulation; soil; sustainable development; United Nations; water supply; water table; waterlogging; agriculture; environment; water; Agriculture; Environment; Soil; Water",Article,Scopus

Continuous satellite-based monitoring of this key plant trait would help to understand individual crop N use efficiency and thus would enable site-specific N management. Since hyperspectral imaging sensors could provide detailed measurements of spectral signatures corresponding to the optical activity of chemical constituents, they have a theoretical advantage over multi-spectral sensing for the detection of crop N. The current study aims to provide a state-of-the-art overview of crop N retrieval methods from hyperspectral data in the agricultural sector and in the context of future satellite imaging spectroscopy missions. Over 400 studies were reviewed for this purpose, identifying those estimating mass-based N (N concentration, N%) and area-based N (N content, Narea) using hyperspectral remote sensing data. Retrieval methods of the 125 studies selected in this review can be grouped into: (1) parametric regression methods, (2) linear nonparametric regression methods or chemometrics, (3) nonlinear nonparametric regression methods or machine learning regression algorithms, (4) physically-based or radiative transfer models (RTM), (5) use of alternative data sources (sun-induced fluorescence, SIF) and (6) hybrid or combined techniques. Whereas in the last decades methods for estimation of Narea and N% from hyperspectral data have been mainly based on simple parametric regression algorithms, such as narrowband vegetation indices, there is an increasing trend of using machine learning, RTM and hybrid techniques. Within plants, N is invested in proteins and chlorophylls stored in the leaf cells, with the proteins being the major nitrogen-containing biochemical constituent. However, in most studies, the relationship between N and chlorophyll content was used to estimate crop N, focusing on the visible-near infrared (VNIR) spectral domains, and thus neglecting protein-related N and reallocation of nitrogen to non-photosynthetic compartments. Therefore, we recommend exploiting the estimation of nitrogen via the proxy of proteins using hyperspectral data and in particular the short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral domain. We further strongly encourage a standardization of nitrogen terminology, distinguishing between N% and Narea. Moreover, the exploitation of physically-based approaches is highly recommended combined with machine learning regression algorithms, which represents an interesting perspective for future research in view of new spaceborne imaging spectroscopy sensors. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Biochemical traits; Hybrid techniques, machine learning; Hyperspectral; Radiative transfer modelling","Chemical detection; Chlorophyll; Crops; Information retrieval; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Nitrogen; Parameter estimation; Proteins; Radiative transfer; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Transfer learning; Biochemical traits; Hybrid techniques; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral imaging sensors; Hyperspectral remote sensing data; Non-parametric regression; Parametric regression methods; Radiative transfer modelling; Hyperspectral imaging; chlorophyll; machine learning; nitrogen; radiative transfer; regression analysis; remote sensing; satellite data; spectral analysis; standardization",Review,Scopus

Abstract: Quantitative resistance (QR) has long been utilized to manage blackleg in Brassica napus (canola, oilseed rape), even before major resistance genes (R-genes) were extensively explored in breeding programmes. In contrast to R-gene-mediated qualitative resistance, QR reduces blackleg symptoms rather than completely eliminating the disease. As a polygenic trait, QR is controlled by numerous genes with modest effects, which exerts less pressure on the pathogen to evolve; hence, its effectiveness is more durable compared to R-gene-mediated resistance. Furthermore, combining QR with major R-genes has been shown to enhance resistance against diseases in important crops, including oilseed rape. For these reasons, there has been a renewed interest among breeders in utilizing QR in crop improvement. However, the mechanisms governing QR are largely unknown, limiting its deployment. Advances in genomics are facilitating the dissection of the genetic and molecular underpinnings of QR, resulting in the discovery of several loci and genes that can be potentially deployed to enhance blackleg resistance. Here, we summarize the efforts undertaken to identify blackleg QR loci in oilseed rape using linkage and association analysis. We update the knowledge on the possible mechanisms governing QR and the advances in searching for the underlying genes. Lastly, we lay out strategies to accelerate the genetic improvement of blackleg QR in oilseed rape using improved phenotyping approaches and genomic prediction tools. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"Crops; Oilseeds; Association analysis; Breeding programmes; Genetic improvements; Leptosphaeria maculans; Mediated resistances; Oilseed rape (Brassica napus); Possible mechanisms; Quantitative resistance; Genes; chromosomal mapping; disease resistance; genetics; growth, development and aging; immunology; Leptosphaeria; microbiology; phenotype; physiology; plant breeding; plant chromosome; plant disease; plant gene; procedures; quantitative trait locus; rapeseed; Brassica napus; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Plant; Disease Resistance; Genes, Plant; Leptosphaeria; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Plant Diseases; Quantitative Trait Loci",Review,Scopus

Development of the Haber-Bosch industrial process for ammonia synthesis helped to relieve N limitation of agricultural production, fueling the Green Revolution and reducing hunger. However, the massive use of industrial N fertilizer has doubled the N moving through the global N cycle with dramatic environmental consequences that threaten planetary health. Thus, there is an urgent need to reduce losses of reactive N from agriculture, while ensuring sufficient N inputs for food security. Here we review current knowledge related to N use efficiency (NUE) in agriculture and identify research opportunities in the areas of agronomy, plant breeding, biological N fixation (BNF), soil N cycling, and modeling to achieve responsible, sustainable use of N in agriculture. Amongst these opportunities, improved agricultural practices that synchronize crop N demand with soil N availability are low-hanging fruit. Crop breeding that targets root and shoot physiological processes will likely increase N uptake and utilization of soil N, while breeding for BNF effectiveness in legumes will enhance overall system NUE. Likewise, engineering of novel N-fixing symbioses in non-legumes could reduce the need for chemical fertilizers in agroecosystems but is a much longer-term goal. The use of simulation modeling to conceptualize the complex, interwoven processes that affect agroecosystem NUE, along with multi-objective optimization, will also accelerate NUE gains. © Copyright © 2021 Udvardi, Below, Castellano, Eagle, Giller, Ladha, Liu, Maaz, Nova-Franco, Raghuram, Robertson, Roy, Saha, Schmidt, Tegeder, York and Peters.","agronomy; biological nitrogen fixation; breeding; microbiome; nitrogen use efficiency; policy; roots; soil health",,Review,Scopus

In comparison with multispectral imaging, hyperspectral imaging is a more advanced technique that is capable of acquiring a detailed spectral response of target features. Due to limited accessibility outside of the scientific community, hyperspectral images have not been widely used in precision agriculture. In recent years, different mini-sized and low-cost airborne hyperspectral sensors (e.g., Headwall Micro-Hyperspec, Cubert UHD 185-Firefly) have been developed, and advanced spaceborne hyperspectral sensors have also been or will be launched (e.g., PRISMA, DESIS, EnMAP, HyspIRI). Hyperspectral imaging is becoming more widely available to agricultural applications. Meanwhile, the acquisition, processing, and analysis of hyperspectral imagery still remain a challenging research topic (e.g., large data volume, high data dimensionality, and complex information analysis). It is hence beneficial to conduct a thorough and in-depth review of the hyperspectral imaging technology (e.g., different platforms and sensors), methods available for processing and analyzing hyperspectral information, and recent advances of hyperspectral imaging in agricultural applications. Publications over the past 30 years in hyperspectral imaging technology and applications in agriculture were thus reviewed. The imaging platforms and sensors, together with analytic methods used in the literature, were discussed.

As it turns out, the region appears to be underrepresented in the existing compendium of Earth science and hydrology-focused journal papers when it comes to significant discussion on terrestrial hydrology and freshwater science. This prominent gap is largely precipitated by increasing number of constraints that include lack of considerable and robust investments in gauge measurements for meteorological and hydrological applications, poor funding of research institutions and other disincentives, among other factors. In this manuscript, the challenges and problems in large-scale terrestrial hydrology-focused investigation in West Africa are reviewed. Using a dossier of some recent contributions in the field of remote sensing hydrology, this review also highlights some of the progress in terrestrial hydrology and the opportunities that exist for hydro-geodetic research in West Africa that leverage on sustained investments in satellite geodetic missions. It is noted that West Africa is still a pristine environment for hydrology-focused research and can benefit from recent advancements in sophisticated space agency programs such as the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, which undoubtedly has revolutionized terrestrial hydrology research around the world for nearly two decades. Given the poor density of gauge stations and limited ground observations, hydrological research in West Africa is expected to benefit more from independent space observations and multi-resolution data. This is because the lack of sufficient in-situ data for the parameterizations and adequate initialization of outputs from hydrological models and reanalysis data for hydrological applications results in poor representation of the West African land surface and hydrological state variables. To further improve our contemporary understanding of West Africa’s terrestrial hydrology, the continued evaluation/validation of these observations and space-borne measurements is advocated. © 2019, Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences & Polish Academy of Sciences.","Climate variability; Droughts; Rainfall; River discharge; Terrestrial hydrology","Drought; Gages; Geodesy; Rain; Remote sensing; Tropics; Water resources; Climate variability; Gravity recovery and climate experiments; Multiresolution data; Pristine environments; Research institutions; River discharge; Space agency programs; Sustained investment; Hydrology; climate conditions; climate variation; drought; geodesy; hydrological modeling; rainfall; river discharge; water resource; West Africa",Review,Scopus

Furthermore, deep learning (DL) has been successfully applied in agricultural applications such as weed detection, crop pest and disease detection, etc. as an intelligent tool. However, most DL-based methods place high computation, memory and network demands on resources. Cloud computing can increase processing efficiency with high scalability and low cost, but results in high latency and great pressure on the network bandwidth. The emerging of edge intelligence, although still in the early stages, provides a promising solution for artificial intelligence (AI) applications on intelligent edge devices at the edge of the network close to data sources. These devices are with built-in processors enabling onboard analytics or AI (e.g., UAVs and Internet of Things gateways). Therefore, in this paper, a comprehensive survey on the latest developments of precision agriculture with UAV RS and edge intelligence is conducted for the first time. The major insights observed are as follows: (a) in terms of UAV systems, small or light, fixed-wing or industrial rotor-wing UAVs are widely used in precision agriculture; (b) sensors on UAVs can provide multi-source datasets, and there are only a few public UAV dataset for intelligent precision agriculture, mainly from RGB sensors and a few from multispectral and hyperspectral sensors; (c) DL-based UAV RS methods can be categorized into classification, object detection and segmentation tasks, and convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network are the mostly common used network architectures; (d) cloud computing is a common solution to UAV RS data processing, while edge computing brings the computing close to data sources; (e) edge intelligence is the convergence of artificial intelligence and edge computing, in which model compression especially parameter pruning and quantization is the most important and widely used technique at present, and typical edge resources include central processing units, graphics processing units and field programmable gate arrays. © 2021 by the authors.","Deep learning; Edge intelligence; High performance; Mobile devices; Model compression; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Drones; Fixed wings; Graphics processing unit; Network architecture; Object detection; Recurrent neural networks; Remote sensing; Surveys; Cloud-computing; Data-source; Deep learning; Edge computing; Edge intelligence; High performance; Model compression; Performance; Precision Agriculture; Remote-sensing; Edge computing",Article,Scopus

However, large-scale applications of biomass-based energy products are limited due to challenges related to feedstock variability, conversion economics, and supply chain reliability. Artificial intelligence (AI), an emerging concept, has been applied to bioenergy systems in recent decades to address those challenges. This paper reviewed 164 articles published between 2005 and 2019 that applied different AI techniques to bioenergy systems. This review focuses on identifying the unique capabilities of various AI techniques in addressing bioenergy-related research challenges and improving the performance of bioenergy systems. Specifically, we characterized AI studies by their input variables, output variables, AI techniques, dataset size, and performance. We examined AI applications throughout the life cycle of bioenergy systems. We identified four areas in which AI has been mostly applied, including (1) the prediction of biomass properties, (2) the prediction of process performance of biomass conversion, including different conversion pathways and technologies, (3) the prediction of biofuel properties and the performance of bioenergy end-use systems, and (4) supply chain modeling and optimization. Based on the review, AI is particularly useful in generating data that are hard to be measured directly, improving traditional models of biomass conversion and biofuel end-uses, and overcoming the challenges of traditional computing techniques for bioenergy supply chain design and optimization. For future research, efforts are needed to develop standardized and practical procedures for selecting AI techniques and determining training data samples, to enhance data collection, documentation, and sharing across bioenergy-related areas, and to explore the potential of AI in supporting the sustainable development of bioenergy systems from holistic perspectives. © 2021 The Authors.

The introduction of new farming techniques in the past century (e.g., during the Green Revolution) has helped agriculture keep pace with growing demands for food and other agricultural products. However, further increases in food demand, a growing population, and rising income levels are likely to put additional strain on natural resources. With growing recognition of the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment, new techniques and approaches should be able to meet future food demands while maintaining or reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture. Emerging technologies, such as geospatial technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI), could be utilized to make informed management decisions aimed to increase crop production. Precision agriculture (PA) entails the application of a suite of such technologies to optimize agricultural inputs to increase agricultural production and reduce input losses. Use of remote sensing technologies for PA has increased rapidly during the past few decades. The unprecedented availability of high resolution (spatial, spectral and temporal) satellite images has promoted the use of remote sensing in many PA applications, including crop monitoring, irrigation management, nutrient application, disease and pest management, and yield prediction. In this paper, we provide an overview of remote sensing systems, techniques, and vegetation indices along with their recent (2015–2020) applications in PA. Remote-sensing-based PA technologies such as variable fertilizer rate application technology in Green Seeker and Crop Circle have already been incorporated in commercial agriculture. Use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased tremendously during the last decade due to their cost-effectiveness and flexibility in obtaining the high-resolution (cm-scale) images needed for PA applications. At the same time, the availability of a large amount of satellite data has prompted researchers to explore advanced data storage and processing techniques such as cloud computing and machine learning. Given the complexity of image processing and the amount of technical knowledge and expertise needed, it is critical to explore and develop a simple yet reliable workflow for the real-time application of remote sensing in PA. Development of accurate yet easy to use, user-friendly systems is likely to result in broader adoption of remote sensing technologies in commercial and non-commercial PA applications. © 2020 by the authors.

These technical and analytical advances can reveal the topology of transcriptional networks in which hundreds of genes are hierarchically regulated by multiple transcription factors at systems level.

More and more resource studies are emerging providing 1000 and more genotypes and millions of SNPs for one species covering a hitherto inaccessible intraspecific genetic variation. The larger the databases are growing, the better statistical approaches for genomic selection will be available. However, there are clear limitations on the statistical but also on the biological part. Intraspecific genetic variation is able to explain a high proportion of the phenotypes, but a large part of phenotypic plasticity also stems from environmentally driven transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, post-translational, epigenetic and metabolic regulation. Moreover, regulation of the same gene can have different phenotypic outputs in different environments. Consequently, to explain and understand environment-dependent phenotypic plasticity based on the available genotype variation we have to integrate the analysis of further molecular levels reflecting the complete information flow from the gene to metabolism to phenotype. Interestingly, metabolomics platforms are already more cost-effective than NGS platforms and are decisive for the prediction of nutritional value or stress resistance. Here, we propose three fundamental pillars for future breeding strategies in the framework of Green Systems Biology: (i) combining genome selection with environment-dependent PANOMICS analysis and deep learning to improve prediction accuracy for marker-dependent trait performance; (ii) PANOMICS resolution at subtissue, cellular and subcellular level provides information about fundamental functions of selected markers; (iii) combining PANOMICS with genome editing and speed breeding tools to accelerate and enhance large-scale functional validation of trait-specific precision breeding. © 2020 The Authors.

Food security is a matter of concern for stakeholders and policymakers as the global population is predicted to bypass 10 billion in the coming years. Crop improvement via modern breeding techniques along with efficient agronomic practices innovations in microbiome applications, and exploiting the natural variations in underutilized crops is an excellent way forward to fulfill future food requirements. In this review, we describe the next-generation breeding tools that can be used to increase crop production by developing climate-resilient superior genotypes to cope with the future challenges of global food security. Recent innovations in genomic-assisted breeding (GAB) strategies allow the construction of highly annotated crop pan-genomes to give a snapshot of the full landscape of genetic diversity (GD) and recapture the lost gene repertoire of a species. Pan-genomes provide new platforms to exploit these unique genes or genetic variation for optimizing breeding programs. The advent of next-generation clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR/Cas) systems, such as prime editing, base editing, and de nova domestication, has institutionalized the idea that genome editing is revamped for crop improvement. Also, the availability of versatile Cas orthologs, including Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14, improved the editing efficiency. Now, the CRISPR/Cas systems have numerous applications in crop research and successfully edit the major crop to develop resistance against abiotic and biotic stress. By adopting high-throughput phenotyping approaches and big data analytics tools like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), agriculture is heading toward automation or digitalization. The integration of speed breeding with genomic and phenomic tools can allow rapid gene identifications and ultimately accelerate crop improvement programs. In addition, the integration of next-generation multidisciplinary breeding platforms can open exciting avenues to develop climate-ready crops toward global food security. © Copyright © 2021 Razzaq, Kaur, Akhter, Wani and Saleem.","abiotic stress; climate change; CRISPR/Cas; crop improvement; food security; genome editing; genomics; next-generation breeding",,Review,Scopus

Forty years ago, a tree physiological research tradition in aboveground and belowground resource capture was established with questions and methods on climate-tree-soil-crop interactions in space and time that are still relevant for today’s challenges. After summarising early research contributions, we review recent literature to assess current levels of uncertainty in climate adaptation assessments in and through AF. Quantification of microclimate within and around tree canopies showed a gap between standard climate station data (designed to avoid tree influences) and the actual climate in which crop and tree meristems or livestock operates in real-world AF. Where global scenario modelling of ‘macroclimate’ change in mean annual rainfall and temperature extrapolates from climate station conditions in past decades, it ignores microclimate effects of trees. There still is a shortage of long-term phenology records to analyse tree biological responses across a wide range of species to climate variability, especially where flowering and pollination matter. Physiological understanding can complement farmer knowledge and help guide policy decisions that allow AF solutions to emerge and tree germplasm to be adjusted for the growing conditions expected over the lifetime of a tree. © 2021, The Author(s).","Agroecology; Agroforestry models; Climate shift; Multipurpose trees; Resilience; Tree architecture","aboveground biomass; adaptive management; agroforestry; belowground biomass; climate change; flowering; global change; high temperature; management practice; pollination; rainfall; research work; scenario analysis; strategic approach; trend analysis; vegetation cover",Review,Scopus

In addition to their role in mitigating climate change, SCS practices play a role in delivering agroecosystem resilience, climate change adaptability and food security. Environmental heterogeneity and differences in agricultural practices challenge the practical implementation of SCS, and our analysis addresses the associated knowledge gap. Previous assessments have focused on global potentials, but there is a need among policymakers to operationalise SCS. Here, we assess a range of practices already proposed to deliver SCS, and distil these into a subset of specific measures. We provide a multidisciplinary summary of the barriers and potential incentives towards practical implementation of these measures. First, we identify specific practices with potential for both a positive impact on SCS at farm level and an uptake rate compatible with global impact. These focus on: (a) optimising crop primary productivity (e.g. nutrient optimisation, pH management, irrigation); (b) reducing soil disturbance and managing soil physical properties (e.g. improved rotations, minimum till); (c) minimising deliberate removal of C or lateral transport via erosion processes (e.g. support measures, bare fallow reduction); (d) addition of C produced outside the system (e.g. organic manure amendments, biochar addition); (e) provision of additional C inputs within the cropping system (e.g. agroforestry, cover cropping). We then consider economic and non-cost barriers and incentives for land managers implementing these measures, along with the potential externalised impacts of implementation. This offers a framework and reference point for holistic assessment of the impacts of SCS. Finally, we summarise and discuss the ability of extant scientific approaches to quantify the technical potential and externalities of SCS measures, and the barriers and incentives to their implementation in global agricultural systems. © 2019 The Authors.

As with the green revolution in the last century, plant genetics may offer concrete opportunities to increase yield and crop adaptability. However, the rate at which the threat is happening requires powering new strategies in order to meet the global food demand. In this review, we highlight major recent ‘big data’ developments from both empirical and theoretical genomics that may speed up the identification, conservation, and breeding of exotic and elite crop varieties with the potential to feed humans. We first emphasize the major bottlenecks to capture and utilize novel sources of variation in abiotic stress (i.e., heat and drought) tolerance. We argue that adaptation of crop wild relatives to dry environments could be informative on how plant phenotypes may react to a drier climate because natural selection has already tested more options than humans ever will. Because isolated pockets of cryptic diversity may still persist in remote semi-arid regions, we encourage new habitat-based population-guided collections for genebanks. We continue discussing how to systematically study abiotic stress tolerance in these crop collections of wild and landraces using geo-referencing and extensive environmental data. By uncovering the genes that underlie the tolerance adaptive trait, natural variation has the potential to be introgressed into elite cultivars. However, unlocking adaptive genetic variation hidden in related wild species and early landraces remains a major challenge for complex traits that, as abiotic stress tolerance, are polygenic (i.e., regulated by many low-effect genes). Therefore, we finish prospecting modern analytical approaches that will serve to overcome this issue. Concretely, genomic prediction, machine learning, and multi-trait gene editing, all offer innovative alternatives to speed up more accurate preand breeding efforts toward the increase in crop adaptability and yield, while matching future global food demands in the face of increased heat and drought. In order for these ‘big data’ approaches to succeed, we advocate for a trans-disciplinary approach with open-source data and long-term funding.

All these different tipping elements share common characteristics related to their nonlinear nature. They can also interact with each other leading to synergies that can lead to cascading tipping points. Even if the probability of each tipping event is low, they can happen relatively rapidly, involve multiple variables, and have large societal impacts. Therefore, adaptation measures and management in general should extend their focus beyond slow and continuous changes, into abrupt, nonlinear, possibly cascading, high impact phenomena. Remote sensing observations are found to be decisive in the understanding and determination of early warning signals of many tipping elements. Nevertheless, considerable research still remains to properly incorporate these data in the current generation of coupled Earth system models. This is a key prerequisite to correctly develop robust decadal prediction systems that may help to assess the risk of crossing thresholds potentially crucial for society. The prediction of tipping points remains difficult, notably due to stochastic resonance, i.e. the interaction between natural variability and anthropogenic forcing, asking for large ensembles of predictions to correctly assess the risks. Furthermore, evaluating the proximity to crucial thresholds using process-based understanding of each system remains a key aspect to be developed for an improved assessment of such risks. This paper finally proposes a few research avenues concerning the use of remote sensing data and the need for combining different sources of data, and having long and precise-enough time series of the key variables needed to monitor Earth system tipping elements. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","AMOC; Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets; Atlantic; Bifurcation; Climate dynamics; Early warning; Earth observation; Land use; Marine biology; Permafrost; Remote sensing; SPG; Terrestrial resource use; Tipping element; Tipping point","Ecosystems; Forecasting; Magnetic resonance; Remote sensing; Space optics; Stochastic systems; Antarctic ice sheets; Anthropogenic forcing; Decadal predictions; Overturning circulation; Remote sensing data; Social-ecological systems; Stochastic resonances; Terrestrial resources; Risk assessment; bifurcation; climate; early warning system; EOS; gyre; land use; marine environment; meridional circulation; permafrost; remote sensing; resource use; Antarctic Ice Sheet; Antarctica; Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet",Review,Scopus

Today, this role must be satisfied within a context of environmental sustainability and climate change, combined with an unprecedented and still-expanding human population size, while maintaining the viability of agricultural activities to ensure both subsistence and livelihoods. Remote sensing has the capacity to assist the adaptive evolution of agricultural practices in order to face this major challenge, by providing repetitive information on crop status throughout the season at different scales and for different actors. We start this review by making an overview of the current remote sensing techniques relevant for the agricultural context. We present the agronomical variables and plant traits that can be estimated by remote sensing, and we describe the empirical and deterministic approaches to retrieve them. A second part of this review illustrates recent research developments that permit to strengthen applicative capabilities in remote sensing according to specific requirements for different types of stakeholders. Such agricultural applications include crop breeding, agricultural land use monitoring, crop yield forecasting, as well as ecosystem services in relation to soil and water resources or biodiversity loss. Finally, we provide a synthesis of the emerging opportunities that should strengthen the role of remote sensing in providing operational, efficient and long-term services for agricultural applications. © 2019","Agriculture; Assimilation; Crop; Deep learning; Ecosystem services; Inversion; Land cover; Land use; Machine learning; Phenotyping; Precision farming; Radiative transfer model; Remote sensing; Review; Traits; Yield","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Climate change; Crops; Deep learning; Ecosystems; Land use; Learning systems; Population statistics; Radiative transfer; Reviews; Sustainable development; Water resources; Assimilation; Ecosystem services; Inversion; Land cover; Phenotyping; Precision farming; Radiative transfer model; Traits; Yield; Remote sensing; agricultural application; agricultural land; agricultural practice; algorithm; biodiversity; crop plant; crop yield; ecosystem service; land cover; land use; literature review; machine learning; phenotype; precision agriculture; stakeholder; sustainability",Article,Scopus

There is an exponential growth of food production to meet the needs of the growing population. However, the limited land and water resources, climate change, and an increase in extreme events likely to pose a significant threat for achieving the sustainable agriculture goal. Given these challenges, food security is included in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Since the advent of Sputnik, followed by the Explorer missions, satellite remote sensing is assisting us in collecting the data at global scales. In this work, we review how satellite remote sensing information is utilized to assess and manage agriculture, an important component of ecohydrology. Overall, three critical aspects of agriculture are considered: (a) crop growth and yield through empirical models, physics-based models, and data assimilation in crop models, (b) applications pertaining to irrigation, which include mapping irrigation areas and quantification of irrigation, and (c) crop losses due to pests, diseases, crop lodging, and weeds. The emphasis is on satellite sensors in optical, thermal, microwave, and fluorescence frequencies. We conclude the review with an outlook of challenges and recommendations.

Edge intelligence aims at enhancing data processing and protects the privacy and security of the data and users. Although recently emerged, spanning the period from 2011 to now, this field of research has shown explosive growth over the past five years. In this article, we present a thorough and comprehensive survey of the literature surrounding edge intelligence. We first identify four fundamental components of edge intelligence, i.e., edge caching, edge training, edge inference, and edge offloading based on theoretical and practical results pertaining to proposed and deployed systems. We then aim for a systematic classification of the state of the solutions by examining research results and observations for each of the four components and present a taxonomy that includes practical problems, adopted techniques, and application goals. For each category, we elaborate, compare, and analyze the literature from the perspectives of adopted techniques, objectives, performance, advantages and drawbacks, and so on.

This entails diversifying the agricultural system and boosting productivity of major cereal crops through development of climate‐resilient cultivars that can sustainably maintain higher yields under climate change conditions, expanding our focus to crop wild relatives, and better exploitation of underuti-lized crop species. This is facilitated by the recent developments in plant genomics, such as advances in genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation, as well as gene editing technologies, which have increased the availability of high‐quality reference genomes for various model and non‐model plant species. This has necessitated genomics‐assisted breeding of crops, including underutilized species, consequently broadening genetic variation of the available germplasm; improving the discovery of novel alleles controlling important agronomic traits; and enhancing crea-tion of new crop cultivars with improved tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses and superior nu-tritive quality. Here, therefore, we summarize these recent developments in plant genomics and their application, with particular reference to cereal crops (including underutilized species). Par-ticularly, we discuss genome sequencing approaches, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and genome‐wide association (GWAS) studies, directed mutagenesis, plant non‐coding RNAs, precise gene editing technologies such as CRISPR‐Cas9, and complementation of crop genotyping by crop phenotyping. We then conclude by providing an outlook that, as we step into the future, high‐throughput phenotyping, pan‐genomics, transposable elements analysis, and machine learning hold much promise for crop improvements related to climate resilience and nutritional superiority. © 2021 by the authors.
