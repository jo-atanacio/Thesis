Meanwhile, smart farming technology enables the farmers to achieve maximum crop yield by extracting essential parameters of crop growth. This systematic literature review highlights the existing research gaps in a particular area of deep learning methodologies and guides us in analyzing the impact of vegetation indices and environmental factors on crop yield. To achieve the aims of this study, prior studies from 2012 to 2022 from various databases are collected and analyzed. The study focuses on the advantages of using deep learning in crop yield prediction, the suitable remote sensing technology based on the data acquisition requirements, and the various features that influence crop yield prediction. This study finds that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are the most widely used deep learning approaches for crop yield prediction. The commonly used remote sensing technology is satellite remote sensing technology—in particular, the use of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Findings show that vegetation indices are the most used feature for crop yield prediction. However, it is also observed that the most used features in the literature do not always work for all the approaches. The main challenges of using deep learning approaches and remote sensing for crop yield prediction are how to improve the working model for better accuracy, the practical implication of the model for providing accurate information about crop yield to agriculturalists, growers, and policymakers, and the issue with the black box property. © 2022 by the authors.

This paper presents a deep learning framework using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for crop yield prediction based on environmental data and management practices. The proposed CNN-RNN model, along with other popular methods such as random forest (RF), deep fully connected neural networks (DFNN), and LASSO, was used to forecast corn and soybean yield across the entire Corn Belt (including 13 states) in the United States for years 2016, 2017, and 2018 using historical data. The new model achieved a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) 9% and 8% of their respective average yields, substantially outperforming all other methods that were tested. The CNN-RNN has three salient features that make it a potentially useful method for other crop yield prediction studies. (1) The CNN-RNN model was designed to capture the time dependencies of environmental factors and the genetic improvement of seeds over time without having their genotype information. (2) The model demonstrated the capability to generalize the yield prediction to untested environments without significant drop in the prediction accuracy. (3) Coupled with the backpropagation method, the model could reveal the extent to which weather conditions, accuracy of weather predictions, soil conditions, and management practices were able to explain the variation in the crop yields. © Copyright © 2020 Khaki, Wang and Archontoulis.","convolutional neural networks; crop yield prediction; deep learning; feature selection; recurrent neural networks",,Article,Scopus

Recent studies on crop yield production are limited to regional-scale predictions. The regional-scale crop yield predictions usually face challenges in capturing local yield variations based on farm management decisions and the condition of the field. For this research, we identified the need to create a large and reusable farm-scale crop yield production dataset, which could provide precise farm-scale ground-truth prediction targets. Therefore, we utilise multi-temporal data, such as Sentinel-2 satellite images, weather data, farm data, grain delivery data, and cadastre-specific data. We introduce a deep hybrid neural network model to train this multi-temporal data. This model combines the features of convolutional layers and recurrent neural networks to predict farm-scale crop yield production across Norway. The proposed model could efficiently make the target predictions with the mean absolute error of 76 kg per 1000 m2.

Most research has focused on excavating fixed spectral information from remote sensing images. However, the growth of crops is a highly complex trait determined by diverse features. To maximally explore these heterogeneous features, we aim to simultaneously exploit spatial, spectral, and temporal information from multi-spectral and multi-temporal remotely sensed imagery. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel deep learning architecture for crop yield prediction, namely, SSTNN (Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Neural Network), which combines 3D convolutional and recurrent neural networks to exploit their complementarity. Specifically, the SSTNN incorporates a spatial-spectral learning module and a temporal dependency capturing module into a unified convolutional network to recognize the joint spatial-spectral-temporal representation. The novel spatial-spectral feature learning module first exploits sufficient spatial-spectral features from the multi-spectral images. Then, the temporal dependency capturing module is concatenated on top of the spatial-spectral feature learning module to mine the temporal relationship from the long time-series images. Furthermore, we introduce a new loss function that eliminates the influence of an imbalanced distribution of crop yield labels. Finally, the proposed SSTNN is validated on winter wheat and corn yield predictions from China. The results are compared with widely used machine learning methods as well as state-of-art deep learning methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can provide better prediction performance than the competitive methods. © 2021","3D convolutional neural network; Crop yield prediction; Long short-term memory; Multi-temporal images","artificial neural network; crop yield; image processing; imagery; maize; remote sensing; China",Article,Scopus

Deep-learning-based models are broadly used to extract significant crop features for prediction. Though these methods could resolve the yield prediction problem there exist the following inadequacies: Unable to create a direct non-linear or linear mapping between the raw data and crop yield values; and the performance of those models highly relies on the quality of the extracted features. Deep reinforcement learning provides direction and motivation for the aforementioned shortcomings. Combining the intelligence of reinforcement learning and deep learning, deep reinforcement learning builds a complete crop yield prediction framework that can map the raw data to the crop prediction values. The proposed work constructs a Deep Recurrent Q-Network model which is a Recurrent Neural Network deep learning algorithm over the Q-Learning reinforcement learning algorithm to forecast the crop yield. The sequentially stacked layers of Recurrent Neural network is fed by the data parameters. The Q-learning network constructs a crop yield prediction environment based on the input parameters. A linear layer maps the Recurrent Neural Network output values to the Q-values. The reinforcement learning agent incorporates a combination of parametric features with the threshold that assist in predicting crop yield. Finally, the agent receives an aggregate score for the actions performed by minimizing the error and maximizing the forecast accuracy.

The drawback, however, is that a one-fits-all prediction model is often employed over an entire region without considering subregional VCI and TCI’s spatial variability resulting from environmental and climatic factors. Furthermore, when using nonlinear ML, redundant VCI/TCI data present additional challenges that adversely affect the models’ output. This study proposes a framework that (i) employs higher-order spatial independent component analysis (sICA), and (ii), exploits a combination of the principal component analysis (PCA) and ML (i.e., PCA-ML combination) to deal with the two challenges in order to enhance crop yield prediction accuracy. The proposed framework consolidates common VCI/TCI spatial variability into their respective subregions, using Vietnam as an example. Compared to the one-fits-all approach, subregional rice yield forecasting models over Vietnam improved by an average level of 20% up to 60%. PCA-ML combination outper-formed ML-only by an average of 18.5% up to 45%.

One of the main benefits of using reliable forecasting tools is generating more income from grown crops. Information on the amount of crop yielding before harvesting helps to guide the adoption of an appropriate strategy for managing agricultural products. The difficulty in creating forecasting models is related to the appropriate selection of independent variables. Their proper selection requires a perfect knowledge of the research object. The following article presents and discusses the most commonly used independent variables in agricultural crop yield prediction modeling based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). Particular attention is paid to environmental variables, such as climatic data, air temperature, total precipitation, insolation, and soil parameters. The possibility of using plant productivity indices and vegetation indices, which are valuable predictors obtained due to the application of remote sensing techniques, are analyzed in detail. The paper emphasizes that the increasingly common use of remote sensing and photogrammetric tools enables the development of precision agriculture. In addition, some limitations in the application of certain input variables are specified, as well as further possibilities for the development of non-linear modeling, using artificial neural networks as a tool supporting the practical use of and improvement in precision farming techniques. © 2021 by the authors.

Historically, the requirements for satellites to successfully monitor crop growth and yield differed depending on the extent of the area being monitored. Diverging imaging capabilities can be reconciled by blending images from high-temporal-frequency (HTF) and high-spatial-resolution (HSR) sensors to produce images that possess both HTF and HSR characteristics across large areas. We evaluated the relative performance of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat, and blended imagery for crop yield estimates (2009-2015) using a carbon-turnover yield model deployed across the Australian cropping area. Based on the fraction of missing Landsat observations, we further developed a parsimonious framework to inform when and where blending is beneficial for nationwide crop yield prediction at a finer scale (i.e., the 25-m pixel resolution). Landsat provided the best yield predictions when no observations were missing, which occurred in 17% of the cropping area of Australia. Blending was preferred when <42% of Landsat observations were missing, which occurred in 33% of the cropping area of Australia. MODIS produced a lower prediction error when ≥42% of the Landsat images were missing (~50% of the cropping area). By identifying when and where blending outperforms predictions from either Landsat or MODIS, the proposed framework enables more accurate monitoring of biophysical processes and yields, while keeping computational costs low. © 2020 by the authors.","Crop yield prediction; Data blending; Gap-filling; Landsat; MODIS","Crops; Forecasting; Radiometers; Biophysical process; Computational costs; Crop growth and yields; High spatial resolution; High temporal frequency; Imaging capabilities; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Relative performance; Image processing",Article,Scopus

Environmental parameters like rainfall, temperature, humidity, and management practices like fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation are very dynamic in approach and vary from field to field. In the proposed work, the data were collected from paddy fields of 28 districts in wide spectrum of Tamilnadu over a period of 18 years. The Statistical model Multi Linear Regression was used as a benchmark for crop yield prediction, which yielded an accuracy of 82% owing to its wide ranging input data. Therefore, machine learning models are developed to obtain improved accuracy, namely Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Support Vector Machine, and General Regression Neural Networks with the given data set. Results show that GRNN has greater accuracy of 97% (R2= 0.97) with a normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 0.03.

Satellite-based Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) products have revealed hot spots of photosynthesis over global croplands, such as in the U.S. Midwest. However, to what extent these satellite-based SIF products can enhance the performance of crop yield prediction when benchmarking against other existing satellite data remains unclear. Here we assessed the benefits of using three satellite-based SIF products in yield prediction for maize and soybean in the U.S. Midwest: gap-filled SIF from Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2), new SIF retrievals from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and the coarse-resolution SIF retrievals from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). The yield prediction performances of using SIF data were benchmarked with those using satellite-based vegetation indices (VIs), including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and land surface temperature (LST). Five machine-learning algorithms were used to build yield prediction models with both remote-sensing-only and climate-remote-sensing-combined variables. We found that high-resolution SIF products from OCO-2 and TROPOMI outperformed coarse-resolution GOME-2 SIF product in crop yield prediction. Using high-resolution SIF products gave the best forward predictions for both maize and soybean yields in 2018, indicating the great potential of using satellite-based high-resolution SIF products for crop yield prediction. However, using currently available high-resolution SIF products did not guarantee consistently better yield prediction performances than using other satellite-based remote sensing variables in all the evaluated cases. The relative performances of using different remote sensing variables in yield prediction depended on crop types (maize or soybean), out-of-sample testing methods (five-fold-cross-validation or forward), and record length of training data. We also found that using NIRv could generally lead to better yield prediction performance than using NDVI, EVI, or LST, and using NIRv could achieve similar or even better yield prediction performance than using OCO-2 or TROPOMI SIF products. We concluded that satellite-based SIF products could be beneficial in crop yield prediction with more high-resolution and good-quality SIF products accumulated in the future. © 2020 The Authors","crop yield; forecasting; machine learning; prediction; Solar-induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence","chlorophyll; crop yield; fluorescence; forecasting method; machine learning; maize; NDVI; prediction; satellite imagery; soybean; Midwest; United States; Glycine max",Article,Scopus

Integrating the power of optimization, machine learning, and agronomic insight, we present a new predictive model (referred to as the interaction regression model) for crop yield prediction, which has three salient properties. First, it achieved a relative root mean square error of 8% or less in three Midwest states (Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa) in the US for both corn and soybean yield prediction, outperforming state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Second, it identified about a dozen environment by management interactions for corn and soybean yield, some of which are consistent with conventional agronomic knowledge whereas some others interactions require additional analysis or experiment to prove or disprove. Third, it quantitatively dissected crop yield into contributions from weather, soil, management, and their interactions, allowing agronomists to pinpoint the factors that favorably or unfavorably affect the yield of a given location under a given weather and management scenario. The most significant contribution of the new prediction model is its capability to produce accurate prediction and explainable insights simultaneously.

We employed weather, soil, crop, and agro-management data from 2016 to 2019 acquired from tea fields of the National Tea and High-Value Crop Research Institute (NTHRI), Pakistan, to calibrate the AquaCrop simulation model and to train regression algorithms. We achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.45 t/ha, a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.23 t/ha, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.48 t/ha in the calibration of the AquaCrop model and, out of the ten regression models, we achieved the lowest MAE of 0.093 t/ha, MSE of 0.015 t/ha, and RMSE of 0.120 t/ha using 10-fold cross-validation and MAE of 0.123 t/ha, MSE of 0.024 t/ha, and RMSE of 0.154 t/ha using the XGBoost regressor with train test split. We concluded that the machine learning regression algorithm performed better in yield prediction using fewer data than the simulation model. This study provides a technique to improve tea yield prediction by combining different data sources using a crop simulation model and machine learning algorithms. © 2022 by the authors.","AquaCrop; crop simulation models; crop yield prediction; machine learning; tea yield",,Article,Scopus

Using time series UAV RGB and weather data collected from nine crop fields in Pori, Finland, we evaluated the feasibility of spatio-temporal deep learning architectures in crop yield time series modelling and prediction with RGB time series data. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks as spatial and temporal base architectures, we developed and trained CNN-LSTM, convolutional LSTM and 3D-CNN architectures with full 15 week image frame sequences from the whole growing season of 2018. The best performing architecture, the 3D-CNN, was then evaluated with several shorter frame sequence configurations from the beginning of the season. With 3D-CNN, we were able to achieve 218.9 kg/ha mean absolute error (MAE) and 5.51% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) performance with full length sequences.

Machine learning has risen with massive processing techniques to perceive new contingencies in agricultural development. Machine learning is a novel onset for the investigation and determination of unpredictable agrarian issues. Machine learning models actualize the need for scaling the learning model’s performance. Feature selection can impact a machine learning model’s performance by defining a significant feature subset for increasing the performance and identifying the variability. This paper explains a novel hybrid feature extraction procedure, which is an aggregation of the correlation-based filter (CFS) and random forest recursive feature elimination (RFRFE) wrapper framework. The proposed feature extraction approach aims to identify an optimal subclass of features from a collection of climate, soil, and groundwater characteristics for constructing a crop-yield forecasting machine learning model with better performance and accuracy. The model’s precision and effectiveness are estimated (i) with all the features in the dataset, (ii) with essential features obtained using the learning algorithm’s inbuilt ‘feature_importances’ method, and (iii) with the significant features obtained through the proposed hybrid feature extraction technique. The validation of the hybrid CFS and RFRFE feature extraction approach in terms of evaluation metrics, predictive accuracies, and diagnostic plot performance analysis in comparison with random forest, decision tree, and gradient boosting machine learning algorithms are found to be profoundly satisfying. © 2020 by the authors.

Interactions among different genetic, environmental, and management factors and uncertainty in input values are making crop yield prediction complex. Building upon a previous work in which we coupled crop modeling with machine learning (ML) models to predict maize yields for three US Corn Belt states, here, we expand the concept to the entire US Corn Belt (12 states). More specifically, we built five new ML models and their ensemble models, considering the scenarios with and without crop modeling variables. Additional input values in our models are soil, weather, management, and historical yield data. A unique aspect of our work is the spatial analysis to investigate causes for low or high model prediction errors. Our results indicated that the prediction accuracy increases by coupling crop modeling with machine learning. The ensemble model overperformed the individual ML models, having a relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of about 9% for the test years (2018, 2019, and 2020), which is comparable to previous studies. In addition, analysis of the sources of error revealed that counties and crop reporting districts with low cropland ratios have high RRMSE. Furthermore, we found that soil input data and extreme weather events were responsible for high errors in some regions. The proposed models can be deployed for large-scale prediction at the county level and, contingent upon data availability, can be utilized for field level prediction.

Machine learning (ML) is an essential approach for achieving practical and effective solutions for this problem. Many comparisons of ML methods for yield prediction have been made, seeking for the most accurate technique. Generally, the number of evaluated crops and techniques is too low and does not provide enough information for agricultural planning purposes. This paper compares the predictive accuracy of ML and linear regression techniques for crop yield prediction in ten crop datasets. Multiple linear regression, M5-Prime regression trees, perceptron multilayer neural networks, support vector regression and k-nearest neighbor methods were ranked. Four accuracy metrics were used to validate the models: the root mean square error (RMS), root relative square error (RRSE), normalized mean absolute error (MAE), and correlation factor (R). Real data of an irrigation zone of Mexico were used for building the models. Models were tested with samples of two consecutive years. The results show that M5- Prime and k-nearest neighbor techniques obtain the lowest average RMSE errors (5.14 and 4.91), the lowest RRSE errors (79.46% and 79.78%), the lowest average MAE errors (18.12% and 19.42%), and the highest average correlation factors (0.41 and 0.42). Since M5-Prime achieves the largest number of crop yield models with the lowest errors, it is a very suitable tool for massive crop yield prediction in agricultural planning.","K-nearest neighbor; Multiple linear regression; Neural networks; Regression trees; Support vector regression",,Article,Scopus

Economical and rapid means of identifying spatial variability is obtained through the use of geotechnology (remotely sensed images of the crop field, image processing, GIS modeling approach, and GPS usage) and data mining techniques for model development. Higher-end image processing techniques are followed to establish more precision. The goal of this paper was to investigate the strength of key spectral vegetation indices for agricultural crop yield prediction using neural network techniques. Four widely used spectral indices were investigated in a study of irrigated corn crop yields in the Oakes Irrigation Test Area research site of North Dakota, USA. These indices were: (a) red and near-infrared (NIR) based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), (b) green and NIR based green vegetation index (GVI), (c) red and NIR based soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and (d) red and NIR based perpendicular vegetation index (PVI). These four indices were investigated for corn yield during 3 years (1998, 1999, and 2001) and for the pooled data of these 3 years. Initially, Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN) models were developed, including 16 models (4 indices * 4 years including the data from the pooled years) to test for the efficiency determination of those four vegetation indices in corn crop yield prediction. The corn yield was best predicted using BPNN models that used the means and standard deviations of PVI grid images. In all three years, it provided higher prediction accuracies, coefficient of determination (r2), and lower standard error of prediction than the models involving GVI, NDVI, and SAVI image information. The GVI, NDVI, and SAVI models for all three years provided average testing prediction accuracies of 24.26% to 94.85%, 19.36% to 95.04%, and 19.24% to 95.04%, respectively while the PVI models for all three years provided average testing prediction accuracies of 83.50% to 96.04%. The PVI pool model provided better average testing prediction accuracy of 94% with respect to other vegetation models, for which it ranged from 89-93%. Similarly, the PVI pool model provided coefficient of determination (r2) value of 0.45 as compared to 0.31-0.37 for other index models. Log10 data transformation technique was used to enhance the prediction ability of the PVI models of years 1998, 1999, and 2001 as it was chosen as the preferred index. Another model (Transformed PVI (Pool)) was developed using the log10 transformed PVI image information to show its global application. The transformed PVI models provided average corn yield prediction accuracies of 90%, 97%, and 98% for years 1998, 1999, and 2001, respectively. The pool PVI transformed model provided as average testing accuracy of 93% along with r2 value of 0.72 and standard error of prediction of 0.05 t/ha. © 2010 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International, Basel, Switzerland.","Back propagation neural network (BPNN); Data mining; Green vegetation index (GVI); Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); Perpendicular vegetation index (PVI); Soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI); Yield estimation","Back-propagation neural networks; Green vegetation index (GVI); Normalized difference vegetation index; Perpendicular vegetation index; Yield estimation; Backpropagation; Crops; Data mining; Forecasting; Image processing; Imaging systems; Infrared devices; Investments; Lakes; Metadata; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Standards; Vegetation",Article,Scopus

Accurate predictions with well timed forecasts is very important and is a tremendously challenging task due to numerous complex factors. Mainly crops like wheat, rice, peas, pulses, sugarcane, tea, cotton, green houses etc. can be used for crop yield prediction. Climatic changes and unpredictability influence mainly on crop production and maintenance. Forecasting crop yield well before harvest time can help farmers for selling and storage.

We evaluated a machine-learning method, Random Forests (RF), for its ability to predict crop yield responses to climate and biophysical variables at global and regional scales in wheat, maize, and potato in comparison with multiple linear regressions (MLR) serving as a benchmark. We used crop yield data from various sources and regions for model training and testing: 1) gridded global wheat grain yield, 2) maize grain yield from US counties over thirty years, and 3) potato tuber and maize silage yield from the northeastern seaboard region. RF was found highly capable of predicting crop yields and outperformed MLR benchmarks in all performance statistics that were compared. For example, the root mean square errors (RMSE) ranged between 6 and 14% of the average observed yield with RF models in all test cases whereas these values ranged from 14% to 49% for MLR models. Our results show that RF is an effective and versatile machine-learning method for crop yield predictions at regional and global scales for its high accuracy and precision, ease of use, and utility in data analysis.

A set of nine regional configurations with eight regional models from the ENSEMBLES project is evaluated. Although they are all based on similar large-scale conditions, the performances of regional models in reproducing the most crucial variables for crop production are extremely variable. This therefore leads to a large dispersion in crop yield prediction when using regional models in a climate/crop modelling system. This dispersion comes from the different physics in each regional model and also the choice of parametrizations for a single regional model. Indeed, two configurations of the same regional model are sometimes more distinct than two different regional models. Promising results are obtained when applying a bias correction technique to climate model outputs. Simulated yields with bias corrected climate variables show much more realistic means and standard deviations. However, such a bias correction technique is not able to improve the reproduction of the year-to-year variations of simulated yields. This study confirms the importance of the multi-model approach for quantifying uncertainties for impact studies and also stresses the benefits of combining both regional and statistical downscaling techniques. Finally, it indicates the urgent need to address the main uncertainties in atmospheric processes controlling the monsoon system and to contribute to the evaluation and improvement of climate and weather forecasting models in that respect. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.","climate impacts; climate modelling; crop yield; West Africa",,Article,Scopus

This is so because extreme weather conditions induced by climate change are detrimental to most crops and affect the expected quantity of agricultural production. Although there is no way to fully mitigate these natural phenomena, it could be much better if there is information known earlier about the future so that farmers can plan accordingly. Early information sharing about expected crop production may support food insecurity risk reduction. In this regard, this work employs data mining techniques to predict future crop (i.e., Irish potatoes and Maize) harvests using weather and yields historical data for Musanze, a district in Rwanda. The study applies machine learning techniques to predict crop harvests based on weather data and communicate the information about production trends. Weather data and crop yields for Irish potatoes and maize were gathered from various sources. The collected data were analyzed through Random Forest, Polynomial Regression, and Support Vector Regressor. Rainfall and temperature were used as predictors. The models were trained and tested. The results indicate that Random Forest is the best model with root mean square error of 510.8 and 129.9 for potato and maize, respectively, whereas R2 was 0.875 and 0.817 for the same crops datasets. The optimum weather conditions for the optimal crop yield were identified for each crop. The results suggests that Random Forest is recommended model for early crop yield prediction.

These data are related to climate, amount of water used for irrigation, fertilization products by dose, phytosanitary treatment dose, parcel size, and root-stock type on each parcel. Additionally, two very popular indices, the normalized difference vegetation index and normalized difference water index were extracted from Sentinel 2 and Landsat satellite images to improve prediction scores. We managed to build a total dataset composed of 250 rows, representing the 50 parcels over a period of 5 years labeled with the yield of each parcel. Several machine learning algorithms were tested with the necessary parameter optimization, while the orthonormal automatic pursuit algorithm gave good prediction scores of 0.2489 (MAE: Mean Absolute Error) and 0.0843 (MSE: Mean Squared Error).

It plays an essential role in decision making at global, regional, and field levels. Soil, meteorological, environmental, and crop parameters are used to predict crop yield. A wide variety of decision support models are used to extract significant crop features for prediction. In precision agriculture, monitoring (sensing technologies), management information systems, variable rate technologies, and responses to inter- and intravariability in cropping systems are all important. The benefits of precision agriculture involve increasing crop yield and crop quality, while reducing the environmental impact. Simulations of crop yield help to understand the cumulative effects of water and nutrient deficiencies, pests, diseases, and other field conditions during the growing season. Farm and in situ observations (Internet of Things databases from sensors) together with existing databases provide the opportunity to both predict yields using “simpler” statistical methods or decision support systems that are already used as an extension, and also enable the potential use of artificial intelligence.

This calls for open and timely intelligence on crop production on an agroclimatically meaningful territorial scale. We propose an operationally suitable method for large-scale in-season crop yield estimations from a satellite image time series (SITS) for statistical production. As an object-based method, it is spatially scalable from parcel to regional scale, making it useful for prediction tasks in which the reference data are available only at a coarser level, such as counties. We show that deep learning-based temporal convolutional network (TCN) outperforms the classical machine learning method random forests and produces more accurate results overall than published national crop forecasts. Our novel contribution is to show that mean-aggregated regional predictions with histogram-based features calculated from farm-level observations perform better than other tested approaches. In addition, TCN is robust to the presence of cloudy pixels, suggesting TCN can learn cloud masking from the data. The temporal compositing of information do not improve prediction performance. This indicates that with end-to-end learning less preprocessing in SITS tasks seems viable. © 2022 by the authors.","agriculture; crop production statistics; machine learning; object-based; remote sensing; time series; yield forecasts","Convolution; Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Deep learning; Food supply; Forecasting; Time series; Convolutional networks; Crop production; Crop production statistic; Crop yield; Machine-learning; Object based; Objects-based; Remote-sensing; Times series; Yield forecast; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

However, it is still challenging to identify the most critical features from a dataset. Although either feature selection (FS) or feature extraction (FX) techniques have been employed, no research compares their performances and, more importantly, the benefits of combining both methods. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework that uses non-feature reduction (All-F) as a baseline to investigate the performance of FS, FX, and a combination of both (FSX). The case study employs the vegetation condition index (VCI)/temperature condition index (TCI) to develop 21 rice yield forecasting models for eight sub-regions in Vietnam based on ML methods, namely linear, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (Tree), artificial neural network (ANN), and Ensemble. The results reveal that FSX takes full advantage of the FS and FX, leading FSX-based models to perform the best in 18 out of 21 models, while 2 (1) for FS-based (FX-based) models. These FXS-, FS-, and FX-based models improve All-F-based models at an average level of 21% and up to 60% in terms of RMSE. Furthermore, 21 of the best models are developed based on Ensemble (13 models), Tree (6 models), linear (1 model), and ANN (1 model). These findings highlight the significant role of FS, FX, and specially FSX coupled with a wide range of ML algorithms (especially Ensemble) for enhancing the accuracy of predicting crop yield. © 2022 by the authors.","crop yield; feature extraction; feature selection; machine learning; TCI; VCI","Crops; Decision trees; Extraction; Forecasting; Learning systems; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Condition index; Crop yield; Features extraction; Features selection; Forecasting models; Machine-learning; Performance; Temperature condition index; Temperature conditions; Vegetation condition indices; Feature Selection",Article,Scopus

To improve the winter wheat yield prediction accuracy at the regional scale, we developed a data assimilation scheme that assimilated the MODIS leaf area index (LAI) into the WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) model. The meteorological data of the WOFOST model include current weather data, 15-day THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) forecast dataset and weather forecast data generated by TIGGE forecast and historical meteorological data (1979–2008) using the vectorial angle method. The WOFOST model was calibrated within 10 subregions of Hebei province based on field measured winter wheat growth data from each corresponding agrometeorological station to account for the spatial variability of crop and soil parameters to some extent, and the Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filtered MODIS LAI was then assimilated into the WOFOST model for regional winter wheat yield forecasting. We constructed a four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVar) cost function to account for the observations and model errors from Feb. 10th to Apr. 30th, and the Shuffled Complex Evolution-University of Arizona (SCE-UA) algorithm was used to minimize the cost function by reinitializing three WOFOST parameters. The winter wheat yield forecasting date was started from Apr. 30th, and the results showed that assimilating MODIS LAI into the WOFOST model substantially improved the accuracy of regional wheat yield predictions (R = 0.60, CCC = 0.53, RMSE = 619.73 kg/ha) compared with the unassimilated results (R = 0.35, CCC = 0.24, RMSE = 857.32 kg/ha), and the relative error (RE) between the averaged predicted yield and official statistics for most cities decreased after data assimilation. This demonstrated that assimilating MODIS LAI can optimize the simulation of LAI in the WOFOST model, thereby further reduce the uncertainty of yield forecasting. These promising results highlighted the potential of integrating remotely sensed data, crop model and weather forecasts for in-season prediction of crop yield at the regional scale. © 2021","4Dvar; Data assimilation; Leaf area index; Winter wheat yield forecasting; WOFOST","agricultural management; crop yield; data assimilation; data set; leaf area index; MODIS; prediction; weather forecasting; wheat; winter; China; Hebei",Article,Scopus

Agriculture provides a significant portion of the income for many people all around the world. Additionally, it provides a large number of work possibilities for the general public. Numerous farmers desire for a return to the old-fashioned techniques of farming, which provides little profit in today's market. Long-term economic growth and prosperity are dependent on the success of agriculture and associated companies in the United States. Agribusiness crop yields may be increased by carefully selecting the right crops and putting in place supportive infrastructure. Weather, soil fertility, water availability, water quality, crop pricing, and other factors are taken into consideration while making agricultural predictions. Machine learning is critical in crop production prediction because it can anticipate crop output based on factors such as location, meteorological conditions, and season. It is advantageous for policymakers and farmers alike to be able to precisely estimate crop yields throughout the growing season since it allows them to anticipate market prices, plan import and export operations, and limit the social cost of crop losses. The use of this tool assists farmers in making informed decisions about which crops to grow on their land. In this study, a machine learning framework for agricultural yield prediction is presented. Crop information is collected in an experiment's data set. Then, feature selection is performed using the Relief algorithm. Features are extracted using the linear discriminant analysis algorithm.

Five ML models (linear regression, LASSO, LightGBM, random forest, and XGBoost) and six ensemble models have been designed to address the research question.

The main objective of the article is to predict and improve the accuracy of crop yield forecasting using hybrid machine learning (ML) algorithms. Methods: This article proposes hybrid ML algorithms that use specialized ensembling methods such as stacked generalization, gradient boosting, random forest, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression.

The objective of this study is to analyse the contribution of intra seasonal rainfall indicators, namely dry and wet spells, for predicting millet yields at regional scale in Senegal using multiple linear regression. Using dry and wet spells with traditional indicators i.e. proxies of crop biomass and cumulated rainfall, hereafter called remote sensing indicators (NDVI, SPI3, WSI and RG), we analysed the ability of dry and wet spells alone or combined with these remote sensing indicators to provide intraseasonal forecasts covering the period 1991–2010. We analysed all 12 regions producing millet and found that results vary strongly between regions and also during the season, as a function of the dekad of prediction. At the spatial scale, the strongest performing combinations include the dry spell indicators DSC20 and DSxl in the peanut basin. While in the south of the country, the combination of wet period indicators WS1 or WSC5 with the RG is fairly reliable. Focussing on Thies, our best region in the groundnut basin, we showed that dry and wet spells indicators can explain up to 80% of yield variations, alone or in combination with remote sensing indicators. Regarding the timing of prediction, millet yield can be forecast as early as July with an accuracy of 40% of the mean yield but the best forecast is obtained in early September, at the peak of crop development (accuracy of 100 kg/ha i.e. 20% of the mean yield).

In previous studies, remote sensing data or climate data are often used alone in statistical yield estimation models. In this study, we synthetically used agrometeorological indicators and remote sensing vegetation parameters to estimate maize yield in Jilin and Liaoning Provinces of China. We applied two methods to select input variables, used the random forest method to establish yield estimation models, and verified the accuracy of the models in three disaster years (1997, 2000, and 2001). The results show that the R2 values of the eight yield estimation models established in the two provinces were all above 0.7, Lin’s concordance correlation coefficients were all above 0.84, and the mean absolute relative errors were all below 0.14. The mean absolute relative error of the yield estimations in the three disaster years was 0.12 in Jilin Province and 0.13 in Liaoning Province. A model built using variables selected by a two-stage importance evaluation method can obtain a better accuracy with fewer variables. The final yield estimation model of Jilin province adopts eight independent variables, and the final yield estimation model of Liaoning Province adopts nine independent variables. Among the 11 adopted variables in two provinces, ATT (accumulated temperature above 10◦C) variables accounted for the highest proportion (54.54%). In addition, the GPP (gross primary production) anomaly in August, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) anomaly in August, and standardized precipitation index with a two-month scale in July were selected as important modeling variables by all methods in the two provinces.

Our model was found to have a superior prediction accuracy, with a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) being 12% of the average yield and 50% of the standard deviation for the validation dataset using predicted weather data. With perfect weather data, the RMSE would be reduced to 11% of the average yield and 46% of the standard deviation. We also performed feature selection based on the trained DNN model, which successfully decreased the dimension of the input space without significant drop in the prediction accuracy.

Using data on corn yield from the US Midwest, we show that this approach outperforms both classical statistical methods and fully-nonparametric neural networks in predicting yields of years withheld during model training.

Improvement in the accuracy and timeliness of the information about pre harvest prediction of crops by blending of ancillary data and remotely sensed data in the temporal domain lead to the effective and optimized decision making. Although previous studies have found strong correlation between observed and predicted yield based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), yet there is a pressing need to provide more accurate and reliable yield in the small areas. The objective of the proposed model is to extract the information related to the crop yield for the sugarcane planted in the small fields of Himalayan foothills region. Relation of crop yield information with the different stages of crop growth has been considered in the proposed model. The process based on correlation analysis of spatiotemporal data to identify of the best periods for the reliable estimation of the sugarcane is presented. The best period for the crop predictability is during 210 to 270 days after plantation. Based on the historical data of 10 years, it has been found that predictability of nonlinear modelling is significant and is of the order of 0.6.

In recent years, some data-driven modeling technique comparisons have been made, looking for the best model to yield prediction. However, attributes are usually selected based on expertise assessment or in dimensionality reduction algorithms. A fairer comparison should include the best subset of features for each regression technique; an evaluation including several crops is preferred. This paper evaluates the most common data-driven modeling techniques applied to yield prediction, using a complete method to define the best attribute subset for each model. Multiple linear regression, stepwise linear regression, M5′ regression trees, and artificial neural networks (ANN) were ranked. The models were built using real data of eight crops sowed in an irrigation module of Mexico. To validate the models, three accuracy metrics were used: the root relative square error (RRSE), relative mean absolute error (RMAE), and correlation factor (R). The results show that ANNs are more consistent in the best attribute subset composition between the learning and the training stages, obtaining the lowest average RRSE (86.04%), lowest average RMAE (8.75%), and the highest average correlation factor (0.63). © 2014 Alberto Gonzalez-Sanchez et al.",,"accuracy; analytical error; artificial neural network; controlled study; harvest; irrigation (agriculture); linear regression analysis; Mexico; multiple linear regression analysis; nonhuman; nonlinear regression analysis; prediction; review; statistical model; agriculture; algorithm; artificial neural network; classification; crop; growth, development and aging; nonlinear system; procedures; regression analysis; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; weather; Agricultural Irrigation; Agriculture; Algorithms; Crops, Agricultural; Linear Models; Neural Networks (Computer); Nonlinear Dynamics; Regression Analysis; Weather",Review,Scopus

In order to optimally control greenhouses’ environmental parameters, one indispensable requirement is to accurately predict crop yields based on given environmental parameter settings. In addition, crop yield forecasting in greenhouses plays an important role in greenhouse farming planning and management, which allows cultivators and farmers to utilize the yield prediction results to make knowledgeable management and financial decisions. It is thus important to accurately predict the crop yield in a greenhouse considering the benefits that can be brought by accurate greenhouse crop yield prediction. In this work, we have developed a new greenhouse crop yield prediction technique, by combining two state-of-the-arts networks for temporal sequence processing—temporal convolutional network (TCN) and recurrent neural network (RNN). Comprehensive evaluations of the proposed algorithm have been made on multiple datasets obtained from multiple real greenhouse sites for tomato growing. Based on a statistical analysis of the root mean square errors (RMSEs) between the predicted and actual crop yields, it is shown that the proposed approach achieves more accurate yield prediction performance than both traditional machine learning methods and other classical deep neural networks.

However, designing a robust model for crop yield prediction over a large spatial region remains challenging due to inadequate surveyed samples and an under-development of deep-learning frameworks. To tackle this issue, we integrated multi-source (remote sensing, weather, and soil properties) data into a dual-stream deep-learning neural network model for winter wheat in China’s major planting regions. The model consists of two branches for robust feature learning: one for sequential data (remote sensing and weather series data) and the other for statical data (soil properties). The extracted features by both branches were aggregated through an adaptive fusion model to forecast the final wheat yield. We trained and tested the model by using official county-level statistics of historical winter wheat yields. The model achieved an average R2 of 0.79 and a root-mean-square error of 650.21 kg/ha, superior to the compared methods and outperforming traditional machine-learning methods. The dual-stream deep-learning neural network model provided decent in-season yield prediction, with an error of about 13% compared to official statistics about two months before harvest.

Numerous models have been presented to explain such variability in crop yield using data from multiple sources with varying temporal and spatial resolutions. Some of these models are data driven, which focus on approximating the complex relationship between explanatory variables and crop yield from massive data sets. Others are knowledge driven, which focus on integrating scientific understanding of crop growth mechanism in the modeling structure. We propose a new model that leverages the computational efficiency and prediction accuracy of data driven models and incorporates agronomic insights from knowledge driven models. Referred to as the GEM model, this model estimates three independent components of (G)enetics, (E)nvironment, and (M)anagement, the product of which is used as the predicted crop yield. The aim of this study is to produce not only accurate crop yield predictions but also insightful explanations of temporal and spatial variability with respect to weather, soil, and management variables. Computational experiments were conducted on a data set that includes maize yield, weather, soil, and management data covering 2,649 counties in the U.S. from 1980 to 2019.

Timely, accurate, and reliable rice yield prediction in India is crucial for global food security and health issues. Deep learning models have achieved excellent performances in predicting crop yield. However, the interpretation of deep learning models is still rare. In this study, we proposed a transformer-based model, Informer, to predict rice yield across the Indian Indo-Gangetic Plains by integrating time-series satellite data, environmental variables, and rice yield records from 2001 to 2016. The results showed that Informer had better performance (R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 0.41 t/ha) than four other machine learning and deep learning models for end-of-season prediction. For within-season prediction, the Informer model could achieve stable performances (R2 ≈ 0.78) after late September, which indicated that the optimal prediction could be achieved 2 months before rice maturity. In addition, we interpreted the prediction models by evaluating the input feature importance and analyzing hidden features. The evaluation of feature importance indicated that NIRV was the most critical factor, while intervals 6 (mid-August) and 12 (mid-November) were the key periods for rice yield prediction. The hidden feature analysis demonstrated that the attention-based long short-term memory (AtLSTM) model accumulated the information of each growth period, while the Informer model focused on the information around intervals 5 to 6 (August) and 11 to 12 (November).

While yield prediction with remote sensing has been a research aim for years, it is only recently that observations with the suited spatial and temporal resolutions have become accessible to improve crop yield predictions. Here we developed a yield prediction framework that integrates daily high-resolution (3 m) CubeSat imagery into the APSIM crop model. The approach trains a regression model that correlates simulated yield to simulated leaf area index (LAI) from APSIM. That relationship is then employed to determine the optimum date at which the regression best predicts yield from the LAI. Additionally, our approach can forecast crop yield by utilizing a particle filter to assimilate CubeSat-based LAI in the model APSIM to generate yield maps at 3 m several weeks before the optimum regression date. Our method was evaluated for a rainfed site located in the US Corn belt, using a collection of spatially varying yield data. The proposed approach does not need in situ data to rain the regression, with outcomes reporting that even with a single assimilation step, accurate yield predictions were provided up to 21 days before the optimum regression date. The spatial variability of crop yield was reproduced fairly well, with a good correlation against in situ measurements (R2 Combining double low line 0.73 and RMSE Combining double low line 1.69), demonstrating that high-resolution yield predictions early in the season have great potential to meet and improve upon digital agricultural goals. © Authors 2022","APSIM; Crop modeling; Crop yield prediction; CubeSat; LAI; Particle filter","Crops; Cultivation; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; APSIM; Crop modeling; Crop yield; Crop yield prediction; Cubesat; Field crops; High resolution; Leaf Area Index; Particle filter; Yield prediction; Monte Carlo methods",Conference Paper,Scopus

Also, an increase in food demand due to the ever-growing population has contributed to the cultivation of large tracts of land. Thus has led to the evolution of diverse methods as well as systems deployed for prediction of crop yield including the application of satellite images. Satellite techniques are utilized due to their capacity to continuously cover large areas while providing accurate estimations of crop yields. In this context of crop yield estimations, the vegetation indices provided by the satellite sensors, as well as land surface variables such as weather elements, soil moisture, hydrological conditions, soil fertility, and fertilizer application is used. Where the convenience of data acquisition and high prediction accuracy is mandatory, many empirical models based on machine learning techniques were employed and the most successful methodology applied was the neural network. The neural network data input varied in the form of normalized histograms of a multi-spectral image bands, normalized vegetation index, absorbed active photosynthetic radiation, canopy surface, and environmental factors.

There are several changes faced by the farmers due to various factors such as water shortage, undefined price owing to demand–supply, weather uncertainties, and inaccurate crop prediction. The prediction of crop yield, notably paddy yield, is an intricate assignment owing to its dependency on several factors such as crop genotype, environmental factors, management practices, and their interactions. Researchers are used to predicting the paddy yield using statistical approaches, but they failed to attain higher accuracy due to several factors. Therefore, machine learning methods such as support vector regression (SVR), general regression neural networks (GRNNs), radial basis functional neural networks (RBFNNs), and back-propagation neural networks (BPNNs) are demonstrated to predict the paddy yield accurately for the Cauvery Delta Zone (CDZ), which lies in the eastern part of Tamil Nadu, South India. The performance of each developed model is examined using assessment metrics such as coefficient of determination (R2 ), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of variance (CV), and normalized mean squared error (NMSE). The observed results show that the GRNN algorithm delivers superior evaluation metrics such as R2, RMSE, MAE, MSE, MAPE, CV, and NSME values about 0.9863, 0.2295 and 0.1290, 0.0526, 1.3439, 0.0255, and 0.0136, respectively, which ensures accurate crop yield prediction compared with other methods. Finally, the performance of the GRNN model is compared with other available models from several studies in the literature, and it is found to be high while comparing the prediction accuracy using evaluation metrics. © 2021 by the authors.

Furthermore, such remote sensing-based working models are better suited to extraterrestrial farmers and homogeneous agricultural areas. The development of this innovative framework was prompted by a scarcity of high-quality satellite imagery.

Remote sensing is becoming increasingly important in crop yield prediction. Based on remote sensing data, great progress has been made in this field by using machine learning, especially the Deep Learning (DL) method, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Recent experiments in this area suggested that CNN can explore more spatial features and LSTM has the ability to reveal phenological characteristics, which both play an important role in crop yield prediction. However, very few experiments combining these two models for crop yield prediction have been reported. In this paper, we propose a deep CNN-LSTM model for both end-of-season and in-season soybean yield prediction in CONUS at the county-level. The model was trained by crop growth variables and environment variables, which include weather data, MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) data, and MODIS Surface Reflectance (SR) data; historical soybean yield data were employed as labels. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), all these training data were combined and transformed into histogram-based tensors for deep learning. The results of the experiment indicate that the prediction performance of the proposed CNN-LSTM model can outperform the pure CNN or LSTM model in both end-of-season and in-season. The proposed method shows great potential in improving the accuracy of yield prediction for other crops like corn, wheat, and potatoes at fine scales in the future. © 2019 by the authors.

Previous studies using either climate or satellite data or both to build empirical or statistical models have prevailed for decades. However, to what extent climate and satellite data can improve yield prediction is still unknown. In addition, fertilizer information may also improve crop yield prediction, especially in regions with different fertilizer systems, such as cover crop, min-eral fertilizer, or compost. Machine learning (ML) has been widely and successfully applied in crop yield prediction. Here, we attempted to predict maize yield from 1994 to 2007 at the plot scale by integrating multi-source data, including monthly climate data, satellite data (i.e., vegetation indices (VIs)), fertilizer data, and soil data to explore the accuracy of different inputs to yield prediction. The results show that incorporating all of the datasets using random forests (RF) and AB (adaptive boosting) can achieve better performances in yield prediction (R2: 0.85~0.98). In addition, the com-bination of VIs, climate data, and soil data (VCS) can predict maize yield more effectively than other combinations (e.g., combinations of all data and combinations of VIs and soil data). Furthermore, we also found that including different fertilizer systems had different prediction accuracies. This paper aggregates data from multiple sources and distinguishes the effects of different fertilization scenarios on crop yield predictions. In addition, the effects of different data on crop yield were an-alyzed in this study.

A hybrid of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is the best technique for crop yield prediction because it can effectively handle uncertainty of features. Hence, in this paper, a hybrid CNN-RNN method is proposed to forecast Hevea yields based on environmental data in Kerala state, India. The proposed hybrid CNN-RNN method reduces the internal covariate shift of CNN by batch normalization and solves the gradient vanishing or exploding problem of RNN using LSTM with a cell activation mechanism. The proposed method has three essential characteristics: (i) it captures the time dependency of environmental factors and improves the inherent computational time; (ii) it is capable of generalizing the yield prediction under uncertain conditions without loss of prediction accuracy; (iii) combined with the back propagation and feed forward method it can reveal the extent to which samples of weather conditions and soil data conditions are suitable to provide a clear boundary between rubber yield variations. © 2021 Published by IRCS-ITB.","Convolutional neural networks; Feature selection; Recurrent neural networks; Rubber yield prediction; Weather prediction",,Article,Scopus

Previously, several machine learning methods have been applied to predict crop yield using different types of variables. In this study, we propose using the Geographically Weighted Random Forest Regression (GWRFR) approach to improve crop yield prediction at the county level in the US Corn Belt. We trained the GWRFR and five other popular machine learning algorithms (Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression (DTR), and Random Forest Regression (RFR)) with the following different sets of features: (1) full length features; (2) vegetation indices; (3) gross primary production (GPP); (4) climate data; and (5) soil data. We compared the results of the GWRFR with those of the other five models. The results show that the GWRFR with full length features (R2 = 0.90 and RMSE = 0.764 MT/ha) outperforms other machine learning algorithms. For individual categories of features such as GPP, vegetation indices, climate, and soil features, the GWRFR also outperforms other models. The Moran’s I value of the residuals generated by GWRFR is smaller than that of other models, which shows that GWRFR can better address the spatial non-stationarity issue. The proposed method in this article can also be potentially used to improve yield prediction for other types of crops in other regions. © 2022 by the authors.

Incorporation of spatially correlated adjacent effects in forecasting models in general, results in accurate forecast. The Space Time Autoregressive Moving Average (STARMA) is the most popular class of model in linear spatiotemporal time series modelling. However, STARMA cannot process nonlinear spatiotemporal relationships in datasets. Alternately, Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) is a most popular machine learning algorithm to model the nonlinear pattern in data. To overcome these limitations, two-stage STARMA approach was developed to predict rice yield in some of the most intensive national rice agroecosystems in India. The Mean Absolute Percentage Errors value of proposed STARMA-II approach is lower compared to Autoregressive Moving Average (ARIMA) and STARMA model in all examined districts, while the Diebold-Mariano test confirmed that STARMA-II model is significantly different from classical approaches. The proposed STARMA-II approach is promising alternative to classical linear and nonlinear spatiotemporal time series models for estimating mixed linear and nonlinear patterns and can be advanced tool for mid-to-long-term sustainable planning and management of crop yields and patterns in agroecosystems, i.e., food supply and demand from local to regional levels. © 2021 by the authors.

Here we proposed a generic framework to assess the impact of climate-induced crop yield risk under both current and future scenarios by combining a stochastic model for synthetic climate generation with a well-validated statistical crop yield model. The synthetic climate patterns were generated using the extended Empirical Orthogonal Function method based on historically observed and projected climate conditions. We applied our framework to assess the corn and soybean yield risk in the U.S. Midwest for historical and future climate conditions. We found that: (1) in the U.S. Midwest, about 45% and 40% of the interannual variability in corn and soybean yield, respectively, can be explained by the climate; (2) the risk level is higher in the southwest and northwest regions of the U.S. Midwest corresponding to 25% yield reduction for both corn and soybean compared to other regions; (3) the severity for the 1988 and 2012 major droughts quantified by our method represent 21-year and 30-year events for corn, and 7-year and 12-year events for soybean, respectively; (4) the crop yield risk will increase under a future climate scenario (i.e., Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 or RCP 8.5 at 2050) compared with the current climate condition, with averaged yield decreases and yield variability increases for both corn and soybean.

Its main purpose is reducing the risk in the decision-making process affecting the yield in terms of quantity and quality. The aim of the following study was to generate a linear and non-linear model to forecast the tuber yield of three very early potato cultivars: Arielle, Riviera, and Viviana. In order to achieve the set goal of the study, data from the period 2010–2017 were collected, coming from official varietal experiments carried out in northern and northwestern Poland. The linear model has been created based on multiple linear regression analysis (MLR), while the non-linear model has been built using artificial neural networks (ANN). The created models can predict the yield of very early potato varieties on 20th June. Agronomic, phytophenological, and meteorological data were used to prepare the models, and the correctness of their operation was verified on the basis of separate sets of data not participating in the construc-tion of the models. For the proper validation of the model, six forecast error metrics were used: i.e., global relative approximation error (RAE), root mean square error (RMS), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). As a result of the conducted analyses, the forecast error results for most models did not exceed 15% of MAPE. The predictive neural model NY1 was characterized by better values of quality measures and ex post forecast errors than the regression model RY1. © 2021 by the authors.

The novelty of this work is Borda Count based fusion strategy on the ranked features obtained from various ranking methodologies. Proposed prediction model works in three phases; in the first phase, three feature ranking approaches such as; Random Forest, Support Vector Regression-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVR-RFE) and F-Test are applied individually on the two datasets of three coastal areas and features are ranked as per the their algorithm. In the second phase; Borda Count as a fusion method has been implemented on those ranked features from the above phase to obtain top five best features. The multiquadratic activation function based Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has been used to predict the rice crop yield using those ranked features obtained from fusion based raking strategy and the number of varying features are obtained which gives prediction accuracy above 99% in the third phase of experimentation. Finally, the statistical paired T-test has been used to evaluate and validate the significance of proposed fusion based ranking prediction model. This prediction model not only predicts the rice yield per hector but also able to obtain the significant or most affecting features during Rabi and Kharif seasons. From the observations made during experimentation, it has been found that; relative humidity is playing a vital role along with minimum and maximum temperature for rice crop yield during Rabi and Kharif seasons. © 2021 Slovene Society Informatika.

Currently, crop models are widely used for crop yield prediction. However, they are hampered by the uncertainty or similarity of input parameters when extrapolated to field scale. Data assimilation methods that combine crop models and remote sensing are the most effective methods for field yield estimation. In this study, the World Food Studies (WOFOST) model is used to simulate the growing process of spring maize. Common assimilation methods face some difficulties due to the scarce, constant, or similar nature of the input parameters. For example, yield spatial heterogeneity simulation, coexistence of common assimilation methods and the nutrient module, and time cost are relatively important limiting factors. To address the yield simulation problems at field scale, a simple yet effective method with fast algorithms is presented for assimilating the time-series HJ-1 A/B data into the WOFOST model in order to improve the spring maize yield simulation. First, the WOFOST model is calibrated and validated to obtain the precise mean yield. Second, the time-series leaf area index (LAI) is calculated from the HJ data using an empirical regression model. Third, some fast algorithms are developed to complete assimilation. Finally, several experiments are conducted in a large farmland (Hongxing) to evaluate the yield simulation results. In general, the results indicate that the proposed method reliably improves spring maize yield estimation in terms of spatial heterogeneity simulation ability and prediction accuracy without affecting the simulation efficiency. © 2016 by the authors.","Fast assimilation algorithms; Prediction accuracy; Remote sensing; Spatial heterogeneity; WOFOST model; Yield simulation","Agriculture; Crops; Decision making; Digital storage; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Time series; Assimilation algorithms; Prediction accuracy; Spatial heterogeneity; Wofost models; Yield simulation; Algorithms",Article,Scopus

There are increasing concerns with respect to how to integrate multi-source data and employ machine learning techniques to establish a simple, timely, and accurate crop yield prediction model at an administrative unit. Many previous studies were mainly focused on the whole crop growth period through expensive manual surveys, remote sensing, or climate data. However, the effect of selecting different time window on yield prediction was still unknown. Thus, we separated the whole growth period into four time windows and assessed their corresponding predictive ability by taking the major winter wheat production regions of China as an example in the study. Firstly we developed a modeling framework to integrate climate data, remote sensing data and soil data to predict winter wheat yield based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The results show that the models can accurately predict yield 1~2 months before the harvesting dates at the county level in China with an R2 &gt; 0.75 and yield error less than 10%. Support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and random forest (RF) represent the top three best methods for predicting yields among the eight typical machine learning models tested in this study. In addition, we also found that different agricultural zones and temporal training settings affect prediction accuracy. The three models perform better as more winter wheat growing season information becomes available.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide a fast and convenient approach to crop yield prediction, but most existing crop yield models have rarely been tested across different years, cultivars and sensors. This has limited the ability of these yield models to be transferred to other years or regions or to be potentially used with data from other sensors. In this study, UAV-based multispectral imagery was used to predict rice grain yield at the booting and filling stages from four field experiments, involving three years, two rice cultivars, and two UAV sensors. Reflectance and texture features were extracted from the UAV imagery, and vegetation indices (VIs) and normalized difference texture indices (NDTIs) were computed. The models were independently validated to test the stability and transferability across years, rice cultivars, and sensors. The results showed that the red edge normalized difference texture index (RENDTI) was superior to other texture indices and vegetation indices for model regression with grain yield in most cases. However, the green normalized difference texture index (GNDTI) achieved the highest prediction accuracy in model validation across rice cultivars and sensors. The yield prediction model of Japonica rice achieved stronger transferability to Indica rice with root mean square error (RMSE), bias, and relative RMSE (RRMSE) of 1.16 t/ha, 0.08, and 11.04%, respectively. Model transferability was improved significantly between different sensors after band correction with a decrease of 15.05–59.99% in RRMSE. Random forest (RF) was found to be a good solution to improve the model transferability across different years and cultivars and obtained the highest prediction accuracy with RMSE, bias, and RRMSE of 0.94 t/ha, −0.21, and 9.37%, respectively.

China contributes nearly one-fifth of the total production alone with its decreasing arable land. Timely and accurate prediction of maize yield in China is critical for ensuring global food security. Previous studies primarily used either visible or near-infrared (NIR) based vegetation indices (VIs), or climate data, or both to predict crop yield. However, other satellite data from different spectral bands have been underutilized, which contain unique information on crop growth and yield. In addition, although a joint application of multi-source data significantly improves crop yield prediction, the combinations of input variables that could achieve the best results have not been well investigated. Here we integrated optical, fluorescence, thermal satellite, and environmental data to predict county-level maize yield across four agro-ecological zones (AEZs) in China using a regression-based method (LASSO), two machine learning (ML) methods (RF and XGBoost), and deep learning (DL) network (LSTM). The results showed that combining multi-source data explained more than 75% of yield variation. Satellite data at the silking stage contributed more information than other variables, and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) had an almost equivalent performance with the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) largely due to the low signal to noise ratio and coarse spatial resolution. The extremely high temperature and vapor pressure deficit during the reproductive period were the most important climate variables affecting maize production in China. Soil properties and management factors contained extra information on crop growth conditions that cannot be fully captured by satellite and climate data. We found that ML and DL approaches definitely outperformed regression-based methods, and ML had more computational efficiency and easier generalizations relative to DL. Our study is an important effort to combine multi-source remote sensed and environmental data for large-scale yield prediction. The proposed methodology provides a paradigm for other crop yield predictions and in other regions. © 2019 by the authors.","EVI; LST; LSTM; Machine learning; Maize; SIF; Yield prediction","Computational efficiency; Crops; Deep learning; Fluorescence; Food supply; Forecasting; Forestry; Infrared devices; Long short-term memory; Remote sensing; Satellites; Signal to noise ratio; Vegetation; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Enhanced vegetation index; Low signal-to-noise ratio; LSTM; Machine learning approaches; Maize; Vapor pressure deficit; Yield prediction; Learning systems",Article,Scopus

However, past experience has shown that the empirical nature of the VI based models and the intensive data requirement of the complex mechanistic models has limited their use for regional and spatial crop yield prediction especially for operational use. The present study was aimed at development of an intermediate method based on the use of remote sensing and the physiological concepts such as the photo-synthetically active solar radiation (PAR) and the fraction of PAR absorbed by the crop (fAPAR) in Monteith's radiation use efficiency based equation (Monteith, 1977) for operational wheat yield forecasting by the Department of Agriculture (DoA). Net Primary Product (NPP) has been computed using the Monteith model and stress has been applied to convert the potential NPP to actual NPP. Wheat grain yield has been computed using the actual NPP and Harvest index. Kalpana-VHRR insolation has been used for deriving the PAR. Maximum radiation use efficiency has been collected from literature and wheat crop mask was derived at MNCFC, New Delhi using RS2-AWiFS data. Water stress has been derived from the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) which has been derived periodically from the MODIS surface reflectance data (NIR and SWIR1). Temperature stress has been derived from the interpolated daily mean temperature. Results indicated that this model underestimated the yield by 3.45 % as compared to the reported yield at state level and hence can be used to predict wheat yield at state level.

Through the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (EFAST), the model parameters were divided into three categories: optimized, fixed and ignored. In addition, Bayesian optimization was used as an optimization algorithm, through which the parameters applicable to the greenhouse can be optimized based on the greenhouse data. Compared with TOMGRO and Vanthoor, the output of the integrated model was more reasonable and universal, and the RMSE in the integrated model was 2.5974 while that in TOMGRO and Vanthoor both were over 17, reflecting the fact that the model output was closer to the actual value.

In this study, a computer vision methodology based on YOLOv4 to detect wheat ears is proposed. A large receptive field allows viewing objects globally and increases the connections between the image points and the final activation. Specifically, in order to enhance the receptive field, additional Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) blocks are added to YOLOv4 at the feature fusion section to extract multi-scale features.

This study developed the modified SAFY-height model by incorporating an allometric relationship between ground-based measured crop height and biomass. A piecewise linear regression model is used to establish the relationship between crop height and biomass. The parameters of the modified SAFY-height model are calibrated using ground measurements. Then, the calibrated modified SAFY-height model is applied on the UAV-based photogrammetric point cloud derived crop height and effective leaf area index (LAIe) maps to predict winter wheat yield.

Here, we analyze county-level corn and soybean yields and observed climate for the period 1983-2012 to understand how growing-season (June, July and August) mean T, P and R influence crop yields jointly and in isolation across the CONterminous United States (CONUS). Results show that nationally averaged corn and soybean yields exhibit large interannual variability of 21% and 22%, of which 35% and 32% can be significantly explained by T and P, respectively.

Further analyses indicate large spatial variation in the relative contributions of different climate variables to the variability of historical corn and soybean yields.

However, mixed pixel is a challenging problem in pixel wise classification of coarse resolution satellite images. The linear mixture model is successfully utilized to unmix the signals of a mixed classes. The success of linear mixture model is depending on the selection of endmembers of a mixed class. Therefore, this paper presents an adaptive approach for automatic selection of endmembers of a mixed pixel in linear mixture model using spectral and spatial information. The proposed approach is capable of extracting the fraction area cover of each class by using a constrained least-squares error solution.

To model such areas we need representations that can be reliably estimated already for small parcels and that are invariant to the size of the parcel. We propose representing the parcels using density estimates of remote imaging pixels and provide a computational pipeline that combines the representation with arbitrary supervised learning algorithms, while allowing easy integration of multiple imaging sources.

Most of the variation in yield is attributed to environmental factors such as climate conditions, soil type and cultivation practices. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and random forest regression (RFR) are machine learning tools that are used unambiguously for crop yield prediction. There is limited research regarding the application of these mathematical models for the prediction of rapeseed yield and quality. A four-year study (2015–2018) was carried out in the Republic of Serbia with 40 winter rapeseed genotypes. The field trial was designed as a randomized complete block design in three replications. ANN, based on the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno iterative algorithm, and RFR models were used for prediction of seed yield, oil and protein yield, oil and protein content, and 1000 seed weight, based on the year of production and genotype. The best production year for rapeseed cultivation was 2016, when the highest seed and oil yield were achieved, 2994 kg/ha and 1402 kg/ha, respectively. The RFR model showed better prediction capabilities compared to the ANN model (the r2 values for prediction of output variables were 0.944, 0.935, 0.912, 0.886, 0.936 and 0.900, for oil and protein content, seed yield, 1000 seed weight, oil and protein yield, respectively). © 2021 by the authors.

The traditional yield measurement method is sampling surveys, which require a large area of destructive sampling of cotton fields and consume considerable time and labor costs. This study established a cotton yield estimation model based on time series Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing data. The U-Net semantic segmentation network is used to recognize and extract the boll opening pixels in high-resolution visible images, and the boll opening pixel percentage (BOP) is calculated according to the network extraction results. By combining the multispectral images and the pixel coverage of cotton bolls, a Bayesian regularization BP (back propagation) neural network was used to predict cotton yields. In order to simplify the input parameters of the model, the stepwise sensitivity analysis method is used to eliminate redundant variables and obtain the optimal input feature set. The experimental results show that the R2 of the proposed model is 0.853 at the scale of 0.81 m2 (average results of ten-fold cross validation).

In this context, this paper aims to use and evaluate the contribution of multisensors classification based on machine learning classifiers to crop-type identification in a semiarid area of Morocco. It is a very heterogeneous zone characterized by mixed crops (tree crops with annual crops, same crop with different phenological states during the same agricultural season, crop rotation, etc.). Therefore, such heterogeneity made the crop-type discrimination more complicated. To overcome these challenges, the present work is the first study in this area which used the fusion of high spatiotemporal resolution Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite images for land use and land cover mapping. Three machine learning classifier algorithms, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and maximum likelihood (ML), were applied to identify and map crop types in irrigated perimeter.

Concentrations of 11 leaf nutrients including N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, and B at stages of terminal shoot maturation and fruit development and fruit FAA profile at harvest were examined in longan in South China. The relation between leaf nutrient and fruit FAA was then investigated by multiple stepwise regression analysis. Foliar N content was greatest among the nutrients among the detected elements at both stages. Twenty-nine FAAs were determined in longan flesh, with alanine (19.9%), g-aminobutyric acid (17.5%), glutamic acid (15.2%), and asparagine (10.7%) as the main components. Flesh individual FAA, essential amino acid (AA), umami-, and sweet and bitter taste AA strongly depended on foliar nutrients.

Leaf N was the dominant indicator for most pulp FAAs at two growth stages, while other nutrients (e.g., B, Zn, P, K, Ca, Mg) also played versatile roles on flesh FAAs.

We explored the 3-months lead prediction accuracy of year-to-year variations in yield of four major crops (maize, rice, wheat, and soybean) in global regions and evaluated for which crops and in which areas the system performs well. The results indicated the system is more accurate for wheat relative to the other crops. Also, we found that different strategies would be useful in improving the system, depending on the crop. For winter wheat and rice, we need to improve the temperature predictions, particularly over the mid-latitudes, whereas improving rainfall predictions was more important for maize. For spring wheat and soybeans, the crop growth simulation itself should be improved. Although this study is only a first step, we believe that additional efforts to improve the system by understanding and incorporating processes of climate and crop growth will potentially provide useful prediction information to big stakeholders like global agribusiness companies and countries for improving food security in regions where crop yield is vulnerable to extreme climate shocks and where food markets are isolated from international trade. © Copyright © 2020 Doi, Sakurai and Iizumi.","crop yields; dynamical seasonal climate prediction; eco-physiological crop-growth simulation; process-based prediction; seasonal prediction",,Article,Scopus

Wheat, maize, and rice are major crops contributing to global food security. The impact of climate change on crop yield with different models and techniques has been projected; this article reviewed the worldwide impact of climate change on future wheat, rice, and maize production. Wheat and maize crop yields may increase due to climate change in colder regions and may decrease in the countries near the equator. The increase in carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere may help wheat and maize crops regarding increased carbon intake in colder regions. The rice crop yield may decrease in almost all major rice-producing countries due to water scarcity, which can be amplified due to climate change. The impact of climate change on crop yield prediction involves uncertainties due to different crop models, global circulation models, and bias correction techniques. It is recommended to use multiple climatic models and more than one bias correction technique for better climatic projections. Adaptation measures could help to reduce the adverse impacts of future climate on agriculture. Shifting the planting calendar, irrigation and nutrient management, improving crop varieties, and expanding the agricultural areas are suggested as the most effective adaptation actions in response to climate change.

Weeds are accountable for 45% of the agriculture sector’s crop losses, which primarily occur because of competition with crops. Accurate and rapid weed detection in agricultural fields was a difficult task because of the presence of a wide range of weed species at various densities and growth phases. Presently, several smart agriculture tasks, such as weed detection, plant disease detection, species identification, water and soil conservation, and crop yield prediction, can be realized by using technology. In this article, we propose a Modified Barnacles Mating Optimization with Deep Learning based weed detection (MBMODL-WD) technique. The MBMODL-WD technique aims to automatically identify the weeds in the agricultural field. Primarily, the presented MBMODL-WD technique uses the Gabor filtering (GF) technique for the noise removal process. For automated weed detection, the presented MBMODL-WD technique uses the DenseNet-121 model as feature extraction with the MBMO algorithm as hyperparameter optimization. The design of the MBMO algorithm involves the integration of self-population-based initialization with the standard BMO algorithm. At last, the Elman Neural Network (ENN) method was applied for the weed classification process. To demonstrate the enhanced performance of the MBMODL-WD approach, a series of simulation analyses were performed. A comprehensive set of simulations highlighted the enhanced performance of the presented MBMODL-WD methodology over other DL models with a maximum accuracy of 98.99%. © 2022 by the authors.","computer vision; crop productivity; deep learning; smart agriculture; weed management",,Article,Scopus

Remote sensing is an efficient technique for measuring growing season crop canopies and providing information on the spatial variability of crop yields. In this study, ten vegetation indices (VIs) derived from time series PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 images were used to investigate the potential to estimate corn grain yield with different regression methods. A field-scale spatial crop yield prediction model was developed and used to produce yield maps depicting spatial variability in the field. Results from this study clearly showed that high-resolution PlanetScope satellite data could be used to detect the corn yield variability at field level, which could explain 15% more variability than Sentinel-2A data at the same spatial resolution of 10 m. Comparison of the model performance and variable importance measure between models illustrated satisfactory results for assessing corn productivity with VIs. The green chlorophyll vegetation index (GCVI) values consistently produced the highest correlations with corn yield, accounting for 72% of the observed spatial variation in corn yield. More reliable quantitative yield estimation could be made using a multi-linear stepwise regression (MSR) method with multiple VIs. Good agreement between observed and predicted yield was achieved with the coefficient of determination value being 0.81 at 86 days after seeding.

Hence, to study these relationships, machine learning methodologies have been increasingly adopted from conventional statistical methods. With wheat being a primary and staple food crop in the Indian community, ensuring the country’s food security is crucial. In this paper, we study the prediction of wheat yield for India overall and the top wheat-producing states with a comparison. To accomplish this, we use Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) after extracting the main features by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) considering the parameters such as area under cultivation and production for the years 1962–2018. The performance is evaluated by error analyses such as RMSE, MAE, and R2 . The best-fitted MARS model is chosen using cross-validation and user-defined parameter optimization. We find that the MARS model is well suited to India as a whole and other top wheat-producing states. A comparative result is obtained on yield prediction between India overall and other states, wherein the state of Rajasthan has a better model than other major wheat-producing states.

However, there are few studies on estimating the LAI of winter wheat using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) RGB images. In this study, we estimated the LAI of winter wheat at the jointing stage on simple farmland in Xinjiang, China, using parameters derived from UAV RGB images. According to gray correlation analysis, UAV RGB-image parameters such as the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI), the Red Green Blue Vegetation Index (RGBVI), the Digital Number (DN) of Blue Channel (B) and the Green Leaf Algorithm (GLA) were selected to develop models for estimating the LAI of winter wheat.

Thus, researchers have focused on developing models for estimating soil quality based on artificial intelligence techniques for the processing of multidimensional data from agro-industrial systems, which provide useful information for farmers about soil management and crop conditions. However, a model for the application of these new technologies in medium and low-scale agricultural systems has not been identified. Therefore, a review of recent studies of crop yield prediction based on the estimation of chemical, physical, and biological soil quality indicators (SQI), which incorporate different machine learning (ML) techniques to process data from remote sensing (RS) systems, is presented. The advantages and disadvantages are also analyzed for: SQI estimates at regional and local scale, spectral bands used for analysis of plowed soils (bare soils) of cultivation plots, selection of minimun data set (MDS), use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite platforms, data pre-processing, and selection of ML algorithms for processing biological systems databases (agro-industrial systems). Finally, we present a model to help estimate soil quality in agricultural systems at a local scale, based on ML to process RS data, in the model the inputs to the ML unit come from four different class data sets (RS, SQI, environmental data and crop management data). Crop management uses the production of the ML unit to adjust agricultural management practices and therefore improve crop yield. © 2021","Agricultural systems; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Soil quality indicators","Antennas; Bioinformatics; Crops; Cultivation; Data handling; Indicators (chemical); Information management; Productivity; Remote sensing; Soils; Sustainable development; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Agricultural system; Crop managements; Crop yield; Data set; Industrial systems; Local scale; Remote sensing techniques; Remote-sensing; Soil quality indicators; Soils qualities; Machine learning; agricultural management; agricultural soil; artificial intelligence; crop yield; cultivation; intensive agriculture; machine learning; physicochemical property; remote sensing; soil management; soil quality",Review,Scopus

The main factors are obstruction of cloud, identification of phenology, demand for high computing infrastructure and the complexity of statistical methods. In this research, we created a novel approach by combining four methods. First, we implemented the cloud restoration algorithm called gapfill to restore missed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values derived from Sentinel-2 sensor (S2) due to cloud obstruction. Second, we created square tiles as a solution for high computing infrastructure demand due to the use of high-resolution sensor. Third, we implemented gapfill following critical crop phenology stage. Fourth, observations from restored images combined with original (from cloud-free images) values and applied for winter wheat prediction. We applied seven base machine learning as well as two groups of super learning ensembles. The study successfully applied gapfill on high-resolution image to get good quality estimates for cloudy pixels. Consequently, yield prediction accuracy increased due to the incorporation of restored values in the regression process. Base models such as Generalized Linear Regression (GLM) and Random Forest (RF) showed improved capacity compared to other base and ensemble models. The two models revealed RMSE of 0.001 t/ha and 0.136 t/ha on the holdout group. The two models also revealed consistent and better performance using scatter plot analysis across three datasets.

Large-scale forecasts became possible owing to the introduction of remote sensing technologies in the systems of precision agriculture, providing the information on crops conditions both on a certain field and large croplands. The study on the forecasting of major oil crop yields, namely, sunflower (Helianthus annuus L), winter rape (Brassica napus) and soybean (Glycine max), on the regional level in Kherson oblast of Ukraine was conducted using historical yielding data and monthly MODIS Terrain NDVI smoothed time series imagery with 250 m resolution of the period from 2012 to 2019. The statistical data on the crop yields were linked to the corresponding values of monthly NDVI to determine the type of inter-relationship and work out the regression models for the oil crops yield prediction based on the remotely sensed vegetation index. The highest correlation between the yields of the oil crops and NDVI with the best prediction accuracy were obtained by using the index values at the period of April for winter rape, July for sunflower, and August for soybean. The developed regression models have reasonable accuracy with the mean absolute percentage errors of predictions reaching 25.23 percent for sunflower, 18.28 percent for winter rape, and 13.24 percent for soybean.

Yield forecasting gives an alert regarding economic trading, food production monitoring, and global food security. This research was conducted to investigate whether active optical sensors could be utilized for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) yield prediction at the mid.le of the growing season. Three potato cultivars (Russet Burbank, Superior, and Shepody) were planted and six rates of N (0, 56, 112, 168, 224, and 280 kg ha−1), ammonium sulfate, which was replaced by ammonium nitrate in the 2nd year, were applied on 11 sites in a randomized complete block design, with four replications. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and chlorophyll index (CI) measurements were obtained weekly from the active optical sensors, GreenSeeker (GS) and Crop Circle (CC). The 168 kg N ha−1 produced the maximum potato yield. Indices measurements obtained at the 16th and 20th leaf growth stages were significantly correlated with tuber yield. Multiple regression analysis (potato yield as a dependent variable and vegetation indices, NDVI and CI, as independent variables) could make a remarkable improvement to the accuracy of the prediction model and increase the determination coefficient. The exponential and linear models showed a better fit of the data. Soil organic matter content increased the yield significantly but did not affect the prediction models.

However, ground-based recording networks are not available at spatial and temporal scales needed to drive the models at many critical places on earth. An alternative would be to employ satellite-based observations of either precipitation or soil moisture. Satellite observations of precipitation are currently not considered capable of forcing the models with sufficient accuracy for crop yield predictions. However, deduction of soil moisture from space-based platforms is in a more advanced state than are precipitation estimates so that these data may be capable of forcing the models with better accuracy. In this study, a mature two-source energy balance model, the Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) model, was used to deduce root zone soil moisture for an area of North Alabama, USA. The soil moisture estimates were used in turn to force the state-of-the-art Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop simulation model. The study area consisted of a mixture of rainfed and irrigated cornfields. The results indicate that the model forced with the ALEXI moisture estimates produced yield simulations that compared favorably with observed yields and with the rainfed model. The data appear to indicate that the ALEXI model did detect the soil moisture signal from the mixed rainfed/irrigation corn fields and this signal was of sufficient strength to produce adequate simulations of recorded yields over a 10 year period. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","ALEXI; Crop modeling; DSSAT; Maximum entropy; Remote sensing; Soil moisture","Agrotechnology transfer; ALEXI; Crop modeling; DSSAT; Root zone soil moistures; Satellite observations; Spatial and temporal scale; Two-source energy balance model; Artificial intelligence; Crops; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Estimation; Maximum entropy methods; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Space platforms; Computer simulation",Article,Scopus

As a result of the aforementioned challenges, smart irrigation and precision farming are the only viable solutions. Only with the emergence of the Internet of Things and machine learning have smart irrigation and precision agriculture become economically viable.

Traditional yield prediction method based on secondary traits is time-consuming, costly, and destructive. It is urgent to develop innovative methods to improve selection efficiency and accelerate genetic gains in the breeding cycle. Results: Crop yield prediction using remote sensing has gained popularity in recent years. This paper proposed a novel ensemble feature selection (EFS) method to improve yield prediction from hyperspectral data. For this, 207 wheat cultivars and breeding lines were grown under full and limited irrigation treatments respectively, and their canopy hyperspectral reflectance was measured at the flowering, early grain filling (EGF), mid grain filling (MGF), and late grain filling (LGF) stages. Then, 115 vegetation indices were extracted from the hyperspectral reflectance and combined with four feature selection methods, i.e., mean decrease impurity (MDI), Boruta, FeaLect, and RReliefF to train deep neural network (DNN) models for yield prediction. Next, a learning framework was developed by combining the predicted values of the selected and the full features using multiple linear regression (MLR). The results show that the selected features contributed to higher yield prediction accuracy than the full features, and the MDI method performed well across growth stages, with a mean R2 ranging from 0.634 to 0.666 (mean RMSE = 0.926–0.967 t ha−1). Also, the proposed EFS method outperformed all the individual feature selection methods across growth stages, with a mean R2 ranging from 0.648 to 0.679 (mean RMSE = 0.911–0.950 t ha−1). Conclusions: The proposed EFS method can improve grain yield prediction from hyperspectral data and can be used to assist wheat breeders in earlier decision-making. © 2022, The Author(s).","Deep neural network; Feature selection; Hyperspectral; Vegetation index; Wheat yield",,Article,Scopus

To tackle this problem, this research has designed two-phase universal machine learning (ML) model to predict wheat yield (Wpred), utilizing 27 agricultural counties’ data within the Agro-ecological zone. The universal model, online sequential extreme learning machines coupled with ant colony optimization (ACO-OSELM) is developed, by incorporating the significant annual yield data lagged at (t − 1) as the model’s predictor to generate future yield at 6 test stations. In the first phase, ACO is adopted to search for suitable, statistically relevant data stations for model training, and the corresponding test station by virtue of a feature selection strategy. An annual wheat yield time-series input dataset is constructed utilizing data from each selected training station (1981–2013) and applied against 6 test stations (with each case modelled with 26 station data as the input) to evaluate the hybrid ACO-OSELM model. The partial autocorrelation function is implemented to deduce statistically significant lagged data, and OSELM is applied to generate Wpred. The two-phase hybrid ACO-OSELM model is tested within the 6 agricultural districts (represented as stations) of Punjab province, Pakistan and the results are benchmarked with extreme learning machine (ELM) and random forest (RF) integrated with ACO (i.e., hybrid ACO-ELM and hybrid ACO-RF models, respectively). The performance of the ACO-OSELM model was proven to be good in comparison to ACO-ELM and ACO-RF models. The hybrid ACO-OSELM model revealed its potential to be implemented as a decision-making system for crop yield prediction in areas where a significant association with the historical agricultural crop is well-established. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"ant colony optimization; article; autocorrelation; decision making; feature selection; harvest; machine learning; nonhuman; Pakistan; prediction; random forest; time series analysis; wheat; algorithm; crop; education; machine learning; Algorithms; Crops, Agricultural; Education, Distance; Machine Learning; Triticum",Article,Scopus

The prediction of crop yield in an accurate manner by developing robust machine learning models based on soil health parameters is crucial since it helps keep a track of soil health as well as its impact on overall yield. This study aims to utilize remotely sensed Microwave satellite data from Sentinel-1 and optical data from Sentinel-2, and field data to estimate three important soil health parameters- Soil Moisture, Soil Salinity, and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC). The study has been carried out in the Rupnagar district of Punjab in India. The estimated soil health parameters, SAR backscatter, and optical remote sensing satellite data parameters were utilized to estimate wheat crop yield. The soil health based DLMLP model performed best in crop yield estimation and gave R2 values of 0.723 and 0.684 in the training and testing phases, respectively, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.98 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value of 1.24 for the 2019–20 season.

The integrated use of climate and remote sensing data for predicting yield at regional and national scales has been previously investigated in various parts of the world. However, such attempts for national scale yield prediction, particularly in different planting zones in China have been rarely reported. For this purpose, this study explored the potential of nine climate variables, three remote sensing-derived metrics, and three machine learning methods (random forest, support vector machine, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) for predicting wheat yield based on data acquired during 2002–2010 from 1582 counties across China's three wheat planting zones. Our results illustrated large spatial divergences for yield prediction. The best performance (R2 = 0.79 and R2 = 0.66) was achieved for the northern winter wheat and northern spring wheat planting zones, respectively. Water-related climatic variables outperformed temperature-related variables, with the best individual predictive performance (R2 = 0.67). Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence had better performance (R2 = 0.60) for predicting the crop yield than NDVI and EVI. Climate data across the whole growing season has provided additional information for yield prediction as compared to remote sensing data. The additional contribution for yield prediction in winter wheat planting zones benefiting from climate data decreased from sowing to maturity, which was the opposite in remote sensing data. Typically, the support vector machine outperformed other models and the prediction in winter wheat planting zones performed better than the spring wheat planting zone. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating climate and remote sensing data for accurate county-level yield prediction in China. These kinds of simple and scalable machine learning methods could be targeted for further work by agricultural researchers and advisors. © 2022","Artificial intelligence; Climate data; Large scale; Remote sensing; Wheat yield prediction","artificial intelligence; crop yield; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; wheat; yield response; China",Review,Scopus

This study used leaf reflectance from a spectroradiometer to model grain yield (GY) and aboveground biomass yield (ABY) of maize (Zea mays L.) at Aba Gerima catchment, Ethiopia. A FieldSpec IV (350–2,500 nm wavelengths) spectroradiometer was used to estimate the spectral reflectance of crop leaves during the grain-filling phase. The spectral vegetation indices, such as enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference VI (NDVI), green NDVI (GNDVI), soil adjusted VI, red NDVI, and simple ratio were deduced from the spectral reflectance. We used regression analyses to identify and predict GY and ABY at the catchment level. The coefficient of determination (R2), the root mean square error (RMSE), and relative importance (RI) were used for evaluating model performance. The findings revealed that the best-fitting curve was obtained between GY and NDVI (R2 = 0.70; RMSE = 0.065; P &lt; 0.0001; RI = 0.19), followed by EVI (R2 = 0.65; RMSE = 0.024; RI = 0.61; P &lt; 0.0001). While the best-fitting curve was obtained between ABY and GNDVI (R2 = 0.71; RI = 0.24; P &lt; 0.0001), followed by NDVI (R2 = 0.77; RI = 0.17; P &lt; 0.0001). The highest GY (7.18 ton/ha) and ABY (18.71 ton/ha) of maize were recorded at a soil bunded plot on a gentle slope. Combined spectral indices were also employed to predict GY with R2 (0.83) and RMSE (0.24) and ABY with R2 (0.78) and RMSE (0.12). Thus, the maize’s GY and ABY can be predicted with acceptable accuracy using spectral reflectance indices derived from spectroradiometer in an area like the Aba Gerima catchment.

Based on the adjusted VI (NDVI, EVI2) time series, the VI change rate (dVI) time series was calculated, which represents crop growth rate. The first step was to cluster the adjusted VI and dVI time series, called ‘greenup groups’, according to corresponding greenup dates with a five-day interval. Then in different greenup groups, we constructed empirical univariate models with VI having the maximum correlation with crop yield, and multivariate models with VI and dVI, which were also used to construct the generalized model. After clustering, the days with maximum VI correlation gradually decreased as greenup days increasing, and the univariate VI model and multivariate VI and dVI model performances in different groups improved. The generalized models with specific VI and dVI variables in each group predicted yields of corn and soybean with R2 values mainly ranging from 0.55 to 0.75 and 0.55 to 0.70, while RMSE mainly ranging from 1000 to 1500 kg/ha and 300 to 400 kg/ha for both NDVI and EVI2 from 2008 to 2018 with leave-one-year-out cross-validation for all groups. The model using MODIS data was convenient and scalable with limited data requirements and date-determined variables after greenup, and offered a generalized method to predict crop yields at a large scale before harvest with good performance. © 2022 The Authors","Corn; EVI2; Greenup; MCD12Q2; MODIS; NDVI; Soybean; Yield prediction","Crops; Food supply; Forecasting; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Vegetation; Corn; Crop yield; EVI2; Green-up; MCD12Q2; Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometers; Normalized difference vegetation index; Soybean; Times series; Yield prediction; Time series; crop yield; food security; model validation; MODIS; NDVI; phenology; prediction; satellite imagery; time series analysis; Corn Belt; United States",Article,Scopus

Developing more sustainable production systems requires long-term measurements and assessment of climate change impacts on yields, especially over such a vulnerable region. Providing accurate yield predictions plays a key role in addressing a critical sustainability gap. The goal of this study is the development of effective crop yield predictions to allow for a better-informed cropland management and future production potential, and to develop climate-smart adaptation strategies for increased food security. The objectives were to (1) identify the most important climate variables that significantly influence and can be used to effectively predict yield, (2) evaluate the advantage of using remotely sensed data alone and in combination with climate variables for yield prediction, and (3) determine the significance of using short compared to long historical data records for yield prediction. This study focused on yield prediction for corn, sorghum, alfalfa, and wheat using climate and remotely sensed data for the 1920–2019 period. The results indicated that the use of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) alone is less accurate in predicting crop yields. The combination of climate and NDVI variables provided better predictions compared to the use of NDVI only to predict wheat, sorghum, and corn yields. However, the use of a climate only model performed better in predicting alfalfa yield. Yield predictions can be more accurate with the use of shorter data periods that are based on region-specific trends. The identification of the most important climate variables and accurate yield prediction pertaining to New Mexico’s agricultural systems can aid the state in developing climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies to enhance the sustainability of these systems. © 2021 by the authorsLicensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Alfalfa; Averaging periods; Corn; NDVI; Sorghum; Statistical analysis; Sustainable agriculture systems; Wheat",,Article,Scopus

The yield of a crop may vary from year to year depending on the variations in climate, soil parameters and fertilizers used. Automation in the agricultural industry moderates the usage of resources and can increase the quality of food in the post-pandemic world. Agricultural robots have been developed for crop seeding, monitoring, weed control, pest management and harvesting. Physical counting of fruitlets, flowers or fruits at various phases of growth is labour intensive as well as an expensive procedure for crop yield estimation. Remote sensing technologies offer accuracy and reliability in crop yield prediction and estimation. The automation in image analysis with computer vision and deep learning models provides precise field and yield maps. In this review, it has been observed that the application of deep learning techniques has provided a better accuracy for smart farming. The crops taken for the study are fruits such as grapes, apples, citrus, tomatoes and vegetables such as sugarcane, corn, soybean, cucumber, maize, wheat. The research works which are carried out in this research paper are available as products for applications such as robot harvesting, weed detection and pest infestation. The methods which made use of conventional deep learning techniques have provided an average accuracy of 92.51%. This paper elucidates the diverse automation approaches for crop yield detection techniques with virtual analysis and classifier approaches.

In this study, a phenological approach based on a remote sensing vegetation index was explored to predict the yield in 314 counties within the US Corn Belt, divided into semi-arid and non-semi-arid regions. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data product MOD09Q1 was used to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. According to the NDVI time series, we divided the corn growing season into four growth phases, calculated phe-nological information metrics (duration and rate) for each growth phase, and obtained the maximum correlation NDVI (Max-R2). Duration and rate represent crop growth days and rate, respec-tively. Max-R2 is the NDVI value with the most significant correlation with corn yield in the NDVI time series. We built three groups of yield regression models, including univariate models using phenological metrics and Max-R2, and multivariate models using phenological metrics, and multivariate models using phenological metrics combined with Max-R2 in the whole, semi-arid, and non-semi-arid regions, respectively, and compared the performance of these models. The results show that most phenological metrics had a statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) relationship with corn yield (maximum R2 = 0.44). Models established with phenological metrics realized yield prediction before harvest in the three regions with R2 = 0.64, 0.67, and 0.72. Compared with the univariate Max-R2 models, the accuracy of models built with Max-R2 and phenology metrics improved. Thus, the phe-nology metrics obtained from MODIS-NDVI accurately reflect the corn characteristics and can be used for large-scale yield prediction. Overall, this study showed that phenology metrics derived from remote sensing vegetation indexes could be used as crop yield prediction variables and pro-vide a reference for data organization and yield prediction with physical crop significance. © 2021 by the authors.

Yet, modeling crop yield is challenging because of the complexity of the relationships between crop growth and predictor variables, especially at the field scale. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) method was used: (1) to evaluate the relative importance of predictor variables for the prediction of within-field corn and soybean end-of-season yield and (2) to evaluate the performance of the ANN models with a minimal optimized variable dataset for their capacity to predict corn and soybean yield over multiple years at the within-field level. Several satellite derived vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index-NDVI, red edge NDVI and simple ratio-SR) and elevation derived variables (slope, flow accumulation, aspect) were used as crop yield predictor variables, hypothesizing that the different variables reflect different crop and site conditions. The study identified the SR index and the slope as the most important predictor variables for both crop types during two training and testing years (2011, 2012). The dates of the most important SR images, however, were different for the two crop types and corresponded to their critical crop developmental stages (phenology). The relative mean absolute errors were overall smaller for corn compared to soybean: all of the 2011 corn study fields had errors below 10%; 75% of the fields had errors below 10% in 2012. The errors were more variable for soybean. In 2011, 37% of the fields had errors below 10%, while in 2012, 100% of the fields had errors below 20%. The results are promising and can provide yield estimates at the farm level, which could be useful in refining broader scale (e.g., county, region) yield projections. © 2020 by the authors.","Artificial neural network; Corn; Elevation; Remote sensing; Soybean; Vegetation indices; Within-field scale; Yield prediction","Aspect ratio; Crops; Errors; Food supply; Forecasting; Forestry; Vegetation; Developmental stage; Flow accumulation; Mean absolute error; Normalized difference vegetation index; Predictor variables; Remotely sensed data; Training and testing; Vegetation index; Neural networks",Article,Scopus

Traditionally, crop growth conditions were assessed by comparing Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the current year and past years at a pixel scale on the same calendar day. The assumption of this comparison is that the different years' crops were at the same growing stage on the same day. However, this assumption is often violated in reality. This paper proposes to combine remotely sensed data and meteorological data to assess corn growth conditions at the same growth stages at county level. The proposed approach uses the active accumulated temperature (AAT) computed from Daymet, a daily weather data product, to align different years of NDVI time series at the same growth stages estimated from AATs. The study area covers Carroll County, Iowa. The best index slope extraction (BISE) method and Savitzky-Golay filter are used to filter noise and to reconstruct 11 years of corn growing season NDVI time series from 250 m MODIS daily surface reflectance data product (MOD09GQ). The corn growth stages are identified every year with precise Julian dates from AAT time series. The corn growth conditions are assessed based on the aligned growth stages. The validation of the assessed crop conditions is performed based on National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) reports. The study indicates that the crop condition assessment results based on aligned growth stages are consistent with the NASS reported results and they are more reliable than the results based on the same calendar days. The proposed method provides not only crop growth condition information but also crop phenology information. Potentially, it can help improve crop yield prediction since it can effectively measure crop growth changes with NDVI and AAT data. © 2019 by the authors.","Active accumulated temperature (AAT); Crop condition comparison; Crop growth monitoring; Crop phenology; Daymet; Growing degree unit (GDU); MODIS NDVI","Biology; Condition monitoring; Meteorology; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Time series; Accumulated temperatures; Crop condition; Crop growth; Crop phenology; Daymet; Modis ndvi; Crops",Article,Scopus

Considering the efforts to establish a framework towards quantifying the crop yield prediction at regional scales are limited, we investigated the utility of combining crop model with the regional weather prediction model to forecast winter wheat yields over space. The exercise was performed for various lead-times in the regions of Punjab and Haryana for the years 2008–2009. A numerical weather prediction (NWP) model was used to generate micro-meteorological variables at different lead times (1-week, 2-weeks, 3-weeks and 5-weeks) ahead of crop harvest and used within the CERES-Wheat crop simulation model gridded framework at a spatial resolution of 10 km. Various scenarios of the yield forecasts were verified with district-wide reported yield values. Average deviations of −12 to 3% from the actual district-wise wheat yields were observed across the lead times. The 3-weeks-ahead yield forecasts yielded a maximum agreement index of 0.86 with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 327.75 kg/ha and a relative deviation of −5.35%. The critical crop growth stages were found to be highly sensitive to the errors in the weather forecast, and thus made a huge impact on the predicted crop yields. The 5-weeks-ahead weather forecasts generated anomalous meteorological data during flowering and grain-filling crop growth stages, and thus had the highest negative impact on the simulated yields. The agreement index of the 5-week-ahead forecasts was 0.41 with an RMSE of 415.15 kg ha−1 and relative deviation of −2.77 ± 5.01. The proposed methodology showed significant forecast skill for extended space and time scale crop yield forecasting, offering scope for further research and practical applicability. © 2022 by the authors.","CERES-wheat model; crop-climate model integration; spatial crop yield modelling; winter wheat yield forecasts; WRF weather model",,Article,Scopus

Process-based and semi-empirical crop models are the main approaches to modeling the temporal changes in crop parameters. However, the former requires too many input parameters and the latter has the problem of poor portability. In this study, new semi-empirical geometric and physical parameters of the maize canopy model (GPMCM) crop model adapted to northeast China were proposed based on a time-series field datasets collected from 11 sites in the Nong’an and Changling Counties of Jilin Province, China, during DOY (day of year) 163 to DOY 278 in 2021. The allocation characteristics of and correlations between each maize canopy parameter were investigated for the whole growing season using the 22 algorithms of crop parameters, and the following conclusions were obtained. (1) The high correlation coefficient (mean = 0.79) of LAI with other canopy parameters indicated that it was a good indicator for predicting other parameters. (2) Better performance was achieved by the regression method based on the two-stage simulation. The root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of geometric parameters including maize height, stem long radius, and short radius were 12.91 cm, 0.74 mm, and 0.73 mm, respectively, and the of the physical parameters including the FAGB, AGB, VWC, and RWC of the stems and leaves, ranged from 0.05 kg/m2 to 4.24 kg/m2 (2.0% to 12.9% for mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)). (3) The extension of the field-scale GPMCM to the 500 m MODIS-scale still provided a good accuracy (: 11% to 18.5%) and confirmed the feasibility of the large-scale application of the GPMCM. The proposed CPMCM can predict the temporal dynamics of maize geometric and physical parameters, and it is helpful to establish the forward and re-verse models of remote sensing and improve the inversion accuracy of crop parameters. © 2022 by the authors.

The results of earlier techniques of data collecting and analysis for yield forecasts were typically delayed, expensive, time-consuming, site-specific, and riddled with errors and uncertainties. This study is a novel approach to using high-resolution satellite data in conjunction with environmental and topographic data to predict wheat yield variability at the farm scale using machine learning. In this research, winter wheat yield prediction was based on 36 indicators in machine learning using correlation and different regression models. Winter wheat yield was predicted using linear regression (LR), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) regression models with scikit-learn in machine learning. More than 10,000 data points from 45 farms were trained and validated in Fergana valley, Central Asia. Results indicate that at 10 m resolution using Sentinel-2 and other secondary data such as topographic, soil, environmental, and filed data can generate an accurate wheat yield prediction map. The accuracy of all regressions is lowest for LR (R2:95, RMSE: 2.31), highest for RF (R2:98, RMSE: 1.40), and intermediate for DT regression (R2:97, RMSE: 1.85). Results also indicate that prediction in the early stage of the crop is less accurate in comparison to harvesting time as LR (R2:85, RMSE: 2.66), DT (R2:95, RMSE: 2.06), RF (R2:97, RMSE: 1.54) have different R2 and RMSE values. Appling the RF model, the winter wheat prediction is 3.29 to 4.30 t/ha therefore the total wheat production is approximately 100 t in the study area. Thus this study will demonstrate the capability of high-resolution satellite imagery and secondary data for highly accurate real-time crop yield prediction at the field scale, which can be used to assist precision agriculture and will provide a point of reference for crop area extraction, mapping, monitoring, and sustainable development with food security. © 2022 The Authors","Food security; Machine learning; Phenology; Precision agriculture; Regression; Sentinel-2; Spectral-indices; Yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

However, weather conditions and relatively long revisit cycles often result in an insufficient number of continuous medium-high resolution images over large areas for many years. In addition, the cropland pattern changes frequently in the fallow rotation area. A novel rapid mapping model for winter wheat based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series coefficient of variation (NDVI_COVfp) and peak-slope difference index (PSDI) is proposed in this study. NDVI_COVfp uses the time-series index volatility to distinguish cultivated land from background land-cover types. PSDI combines the key growth stages of winter wheat phenology and special bimodal characteristics, substantially reducing the impact of abandoned land and other crops. Taking the Heilonggang as an example, this study carried out a rapid mapping of winter wheat for four consecutive years (2014–2017), and compared the proposed COV_PSDI with two state-of-the-art methods and traditional methods (the Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM) and the Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm (ISODATA)). The verification results revealed that the COV_PSDI model improved the overall accuracy (94.10%) by 4% compared with the two state-of-art methods (90.80%, 89.00%) and two traditional methods (90.70%, 87.70%). User accuracy was the highest, which was 93.74%. Compared with the other four methods, the percentage error (PE) of COV_PSDI for four years was the lowest in the same year, with the minimum variation range of PE being 1.6–3.6%. The other methods resulted in serious overestimation. This demonstrated the effectiveness and stability of the method proposed in the rapid and accurate extraction of winter wheat in a large area of fallow crop rotation region.

Compared to most wheat producing areas, this island is characterized by wet climate owing to greater annual precipitation and abundant snowmelt water supply in spring. Based on yield statistics collected from 119 municipalities for 14 years (N = 1,516) and high-resolution surface meteorological data, correlation analyses showed that precipitation, daily minimum air temperature, and irradiance during the grain-filling period had significant effects on the yield throughout the island while the effect of snow depth in early winter and spring was dependent on sites. Using 10-d mean meteorological data within a certain period between seeding and harvest as predictor variables and one-year-leave-out cross-validation procedure, performance of machine learning models based on neural network (NN), random forest (RF), support vector machine regression (SVR), partial least squares regression (PLS), and cubist regression (CB) were compared to a multiple linear regression model (MLR) and a null model that returns an average yield of the municipality. The root mean square errors of PLS, SVR, and RF were 872, 982, and 1,024 kg ha−1 and were smaller than those of MLR (1,068 kg ha−1) and null model (1,035 kg ha−1). These models outperformed the controls in other metrics including Pearson's correlation coefficient and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. Variable importance analysis on PLS indicated that minimum air temperature and precipitation during the grain-filling period had major roles in the prediction and excluding predictors in this period (i.e. yield forecast with a longer lead-time) decreased forecast performance of the models. These results were consistent with our understanding of meteorological impacts on wheat yield, suggesting usefulness of explainable machine learning in meteorological crop yield prediction under wet climate.

Timely and reliable wheat yield prediction at a large scale is essential for the agricultural supply chain and global food security, especially in China as an important wheat producing and consuming country. The conventional approach using either climate or satellite data or both to build empirical and crop models has prevailed for decades. However, to what extent climate and satellite data can improve yield prediction is still unknown. In addition, socio-economic (SC) factors may also improve crop yield prediction, but their contributions need in-depth investigation, especially in regions with good irrigation conditions, sufficient fertilization, and pesticide application. Here, we performed the first attempt to predict wheat yield across China from 2001 to 2015 at the county-level by integrating multi-source data, including monthly climate data, satellite data (i.e., Vegetation indices (VIs), and SC factors. The results show that incorporating all the datasets by using three machine learning methods (Ridge Regression (RR), Random Forest (RF), and Light Gradient Boosting (LightGBM) can achieve the best performance in yield prediction (R2: 0.68~0.75), with the most individual contributions from climate (~0.53), followed by VIs (~0.45), and SC factors (~0.30). In addition, the combinations of VIs and climate data can capture inter-annual yield variability more effectively than other combinations (e.g., combinations of climate and SC, and combinations of VIs and SC), while combining SC with climate data can better capture spatial yield variability than others. Climate data can provide extra and unique information across the entire growing season, while the peak stage of VIs (Mar.~Apr.) do so. Furthermore, incorporating spatial information and soil proprieties into the benchmark models can improve wheat yield prediction by 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. The optimal wheat prediction can be achieved with approximately a two-month leading time before maturity.

Among these applications, UAV-based agricultural mapping and monitoring have attracted significant attention from both the research and professional communities. The interest in UAV-based remote sensing for agricultural management is motivated by the need to maximize crop yield. Remote sensing-based crop yield prediction and estimation are primarily based on imaging systems with different spectral coverage and resolution (e.g., RGB and hyperspectral imaging systems). Due to the data volume, RGB imaging is based on frame cameras, while hyperspectral sensors are primarily push-broom scanners. To cope with the limited endurance and payload constraints of low-cost UAVs, the agricultural research and professional communities have to rely on consumer-grade and light-weight sensors. However, the geometric fidelity of derived information from push-broom hyperspectral scanners is quite sensitive to the available position and orientation established through a direct geo-referencing unit onboard the imaging platform (i.e., an integrated Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS). This paper presents an automated framework for the integration of frame RGB images, push-broom hyperspectral scanner data and consumer-grade GNSS/INS navigation data for accurate geometric rectification of the hyperspectral scenes. The approach relies on utilizing the navigation data, together with a modified Speeded-Up Robust Feature (SURF) detector and descriptor, for automating the identification of conjugate features in the RGB and hyperspectral imagery. The SURF modification takes into consideration the available direct geo-referencing information to improve the reliability of the matching procedure in the presence of repetitive texture within a mechanized agricultural field. Identified features are then used to improve the geometric fidelity of the previously ortho-rectified hyperspectral data. Experimental results from two real datasets show that the geometric rectification of the hyperspectral data was improved by almost one order of magnitude. © 2016 by the authors.","Automated image registration; Hyperspectral push-broom scanners; Ortho-rectification; Phenotyping; SURF; UAV-based agricultural management","Agriculture; Air navigation; Automation; Crops; Geometry; Global positioning system; Image resolution; Imaging systems; Inertial navigation systems; Navigation systems; Remote sensing; Scanning; Spectroscopy; Tracking (position); Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Agricultural management; HyperSpectral; Ortho-rectification; Phenotyping; SURF; Hyperspectral imaging",Article,Scopus

A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based method is employed to evaluate crop condition by inter-annual comparisons of both spatial variability (using NDVI images) and seasonal dynamics (based on crop condition profiles). Since this type of method will generate false information if there are changes in crop rotation, cropping area or crop phenology, information on cropped/uncropped arable land is integrated to improve the accuracy of crop condition monitoring. The study proposes a new method to retrieve adjusted NDVI for cropped arable land during the growing season of winter crops by integrating 16-day composite Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data at 250-m resolution with a cropped and uncropped arable land map derived from the multi-temporal China Environmental Satellite (Huan Jing Satellite) charge-coupled device (HJ-1 CCD) images at 30-m resolution. Using the land map's data on cropped and uncropped arable land, a pixel-based uncropped arable land ratio (UALR) at 250-m resolution was generated. Next, the UALR-adjusted NDVI was produced by assuming that the MODIS reflectance value for each pixel is a linear mixed signal composed of the proportional reflectance of cropped and uncropped arable land. When UALR-adjusted NDVI data are used for crop condition assessment, results are expected to be more accurate, because: (i) pixels with only uncropped arable land are not included in the assessment; and (ii) the adjusted NDVI corrects for interannual variation in cropping area. On the provincial level, crop growing profiles based on the two kinds of NDVI data illustrate the difference between the regular and the adjusted NDVI, with the difference depending on the total area of uncropped arable land in the region. The results suggested that the proposed method can be used to improve the assessment of early crop condition, but additional evaluation in other major crop producing regions is needed to better assess the method's application in other regions and agricultural systems. © 2014 by the authors.","Crop condition assessment; Cropped and uncropped arable land; Linear unmixing; NDVI; North China Plain","Agriculture; Charge coupled devices; Condition monitoring; Cultivation; Forestry; Image reconstruction; Land use; Pixels; Radiometers; Reflection; Satellite imagery; Arable land; Crop condition; Linear unmixing; NDVI; North China Plain; Crops",Article,Scopus

Crop models (CMs) are powerful tools for predicting yield and water use, but they still have some limitations and uncertainties; therefore, combining them with machine learning algorithms (MLs) could improve predictions and reduce uncertainty. To that end, the DSSAT-CERES-maize model was calibrated in one location and validated in others across Egypt with varying agro-climatic zones. Following that, the dynamic model (CERES-Maize) was used for long-term simulation (1990–2020) of maize grain yield (GY) and evapotranspiration (ET) under a wide range of management and environmental factors. Detailed outputs from three growing seasons of field experiments in Egypt, as well as CERES-maize outputs, were used to train and test six machine learning algorithms (linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, and XGBoost), resulting in more than 1.5 million simulated yield and evapotranspiration scenarios. Seven warming years (i.e., 1991, 1998, 2002, 2005, 2010, 2013, and 2020) were chosen from a 31-year dataset to test MLs, while the remaining 23 years were used to train the models. The Ensemble model (super learner) and XGBoost outperform other models in predicting GY and ET for maize, as evidenced by R2 values greater than 0.82 and RRMSE less than 9%. The broad range of management practices, when averaged across all locations and 31 years of simulation, not only reduced the hazard impact of environmental factors but also increased GY and reduced ET. Moving beyond prediction and interpreting the outputs from Lasso and XGBoost, and using global and local SHAP values, we found that the most important features for predicting GY and ET are maximum temperatures, minimum temperature, available water content, soil organic carbon, irrigation, cultivars, soil texture, solar radiation, and planting date. Determining the most important features is critical for assisting farmers and agronomists in prioritizing such features over other factors in order to increase yield and resource efficiency values. The combination of CMs and ML algorithms is a powerful tool for predicting yield and water use in arid regions, which are particularly vulnerable to climate change and water scarcity. © 2022 by the authors.","DSSAT models; feature importance; hyperparameters tuning; lasso regression; random forest; super learner; water use; XGBoost","Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Environmental management; Evapotranspiration; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Organic carbon; Plants (botany); Soils; Statistical tests; Textures; DSSAT model; Feature importance; Hyper-parameter; Hyperparameter tuning; Lasso regressions; Machine learning algorithms; Random forests; Super learner; Water use; Xgboost; Forecasting; arid environment; climate change; crop yield; environmental factor; evapotranspiration; maize; soil nutrient; yield response; Egypt",Article,Scopus

Due to rapid progress in remote sensing technology, fine spatial resolution (FSR) remotely sensed imagery now offers great opportunities for mapping crop types in great detail. However, within-class variance can hamper attempts to discriminate crop classes at fine resolutions. Multi-temporal FSR remotely sensed imagery provides a means of increasing crop classification from FSR imagery, although current methods do not exploit the available information fully. In this research, a novel Temporal Sequence Object-based Convolutional Neural Network (TS-OCNN) was proposed to classify agricultural crop type from FSR image time-series. An object-based CNN (OCNN) model was adopted in the TS-OCNN to classify images at the object level (i.e., segmented objects or crop parcels), thus, maintaining the precise boundary information of crop parcels. The combination of image time-series was first utilized as the input to the OCNN model to produce an ‘original’ or baseline classification. Then the single-date images were fed automatically into the deep learning model scene-by-scene in order of image acquisition date to increase successively the crop classification accuracy. By doing so, the joint information in the FSR multi-temporal observations and the unique individual information from the single-date images were exploited comprehensively for crop classification. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was investigated using multitemporal SAR and optical imagery, respectively, over two heterogeneous agricultural areas. The experimental results demonstrated that the newly proposed TS-OCNN approach consistently increased crop classification accuracy, and achieved the greatest accuracies (82.68% and 87.40%) in comparison with state-of-the-art benchmark methods, including the object-based CNN (OCNN) (81.63% and 85.88%), object-based image analysis (OBIA) (78.21% and 84.83%), and standard pixel-wise CNN (79.18% and 82.90%). The proposed approach is the first known attempt to explore simultaneously the joint information from image time-series with the unique information from single-date images for crop classification using a deep learning framework. The TS-OCNN, therefore, represents a new approach for agricultural landscape classification from multi-temporal FSR imagery. Besides, it is readily generalizable to other landscapes (e.g., forest landscapes), with a wide application prospect. © 2022 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

Multitemporal satellite observations allow analyzing vegetation seasonal dynamics over large areas by using vegetation indices or by deriving biophysical variables. The Nile Delta represents about half of all agricultural lands of Egypt. In this region, intensifying farming systems are predominant and multi-cropping rotations schemes are increasing, requiring a high temporal and spatial resolution monitoring for capturing successive crop growth cycles. This study presents a workflow for cropland phenology characterization and mapping based on time series of green Leaf Area Index (LAI) generated from NASA’s Harmonized Landsat 8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) surface reflectance dataset from 2016 to 2019. LAI time series were processed for each satellite dataset, which were used separately and combined to identify seasonal dynamics for a selection of crop types (wheat, clover, maize and rice). For the combination of L8 with S2 LAI products, we proposed two time series smoothing and fitting methods: (1) the Savitzky–Golay (SG) filter and (2) the Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR) fitting function. Single-sensor and L8-S2 combined LAI time series were used for the calculation of key crop Land Surface Phenology (LSP) metrics (start of season, end of season, length of season), whereby the detection of cropland growing seasons was based on two established threshold methods, i.e., a seasonal or a relative amplitude value. Overall, the developed phenology extraction scheme enabled identifying up to two successive crop cycles within a year, with a superior performance observed for the seasonal than for the relative threshold method, in terms of consistency and cropland season detection capability. Differences between the time series collections were analyzed by comparing the phenology metrics per crop type and year. Results suggest that L8-S2 combined LAI data streams with GPR led to a more precise detection of the start and end of growing seasons for most crop types, reaching an overall detection of 74% over the total planted crops versus 69% with S2 and 63% with L8 alone. Finally, the phenology mapping allowed us to evaluate the spatial and temporal evolution of the croplands over the agroecosystem in the Nile Delta. © 2022 by the authors.

Climate change is expected to have an adverse impact particularly on crop production. Previous studies have shown large discrepancies in the magnitude and sometimes in the direction of the impact on crop production. We assessed the impact of climate change on growth and yield of maize and wheat in Ethiopia using a multi-crop model ensemble. The multi-model ensemble (n = 48) was set up using the agroecosystem modelling framework Expert-N. The framework is modular which facilitates combining different submodels for plant growth and soil processes. The multi-model ensemble was driven by climate change projections representing the mid of the century (2021-2050) from ten contrasting climate models downscaled to finer resolution. The contributions of different sources of uncertainty in crop yield prediction were quantified. The sensitivity of crop yield to elevated CO2, increased temperature, changes in precipitations and N fertilizer were also assessed. Our results indicate that grain yields were very sensitive to changes in [CO2], temperature and N fertilizer amounts where the responses were higher for wheat than maize. The response to change in precipitation was weak, which we attribute to the high water holding capacity of the soils due to high organic carbon contents at the study sites. This may provide the sufficient buffering capacity for extended time periods with low amounts of precipitation. Under the changing climate, wheat productivity will be a major challenge with a 36 to 40% reduction in grain yield by 2050 while the impact on maize was modest. A major part of the uncertainty in the projected impact could be attributed to differences in the crop growth models. A considerable fraction of the uncertainty could also be traced back to different soil water dynamics modeling approaches in the model ensemble, which is often ignored. Uncertainties varied among the studied crop species and cultivars as well. The study highlights significant impacts of climate change on wheat yield in Ethiopia whereby differences in crop growth models causes the large part of the uncertainties. © 2022 Rettie et al.

Here we examined both bacterial and fungal communities across soils, epiphytic and endophytic niches of leaf and root, and plastic leaf of fake plant (representing environment-originating microbes) at three developmental stages of maize at two contrasting sites, and further explored the potential function of phylloplane microbiomes based on metagenomics. Results: Our results suggested that plant developmental stage had a much stronger influence on the microbial diversity, composition and interkingdom networks in plant compartments than in soils, with the strongest effect in the phylloplane. Phylloplane microbiomes were co-shaped by both plant growth and seasonal environmental factors, with the air (represented by fake plants) as its important source. Further, we found that bacterial communities in plant compartments were more strongly driven by deterministic processes at the early stage but a similar pattern was for fungal communities at the late stage. Moreover, bacterial taxa played a more important role in microbial interkingdom network and crop yield prediction at the early stage, while fungal taxa did so at the late stage. Metagenomic analyses further indicated that phylloplane microbiomes possessed higher functional diversity at the early stage than the late stage, with functional genes related to nutrient provision enriched at the early stage and N assimilation and C degradation enriched at the late stage. Coincidently, more abundant beneficial bacterial taxa like Actinobacteria, Burkholderiaceae and Rhizobiaceae in plant microbiomes were observed at the early stage, but more saprophytic fungi at the late stage. Conclusions: Our results suggest that host developmental stage profoundly influences plant microbiome assembly and functions, and the bacterial and fungal microbiomes take a differentiated ecological role at different stages of plant development. This study provides empirical evidence for host exerting strong effect on plant microbiomes by deterministic selection during plant growth and development. These findings have implications for the development of future tools to manipulate microbiome for sustainable increase in primary productivity.

In this study, five vegetation indices were derived from the Copernicus-Sentinel 2 satellite to investigate their performance monitoring winter wheat growth in a Mediterranean environment in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley. Among those indices, the fraction of canopy cover was integrated into the AquaCrop model to simulate biomass and yield of wheat grown under rainfed conditions and fully irrigated regimes. The experiment was conducted during three consecutive growing seasons (from 2017 to 2019), characterized by different precipitation patterns. The AquaCrop model was calibrated and validated for different water regimes, and its performance was tested when coupled with remote sensing canopy cover. The results showed a good fit between measured canopy cover and Leaf Area Index (LAI) data and those derived from Sentinel 2 images. The R2 coefficient was 0.79 for canopy cover and 0.77 for LAI. Moreover, the regressions were fitted to relate biomass with Sentinel 2 vegetation indices. In descend-ing order of R2, the indices were ranked: Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC), LAI, the fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Notably, FVC and LAI were highly correlated with biomass. The results of the AquaCrop calibration showed that the modeling efficiency values, NSE, were 0.99 for well-watered treatments and 0.95 for rainfed conditions, confirming the goodness of fit between measured and simulated values. The validation results confirmed that the simulated yield varied from 2.59 to 5.36 t ha−1, while the measured yield varied from 3.08 to 5.63 t ha−1 for full irrigation and rainfed treatments. After integrating the canopy cover into AquaCrop, the % of deviation of simulated and measured variables was reduced. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for yield ranged between 0.08 and 0.69 t ha−1 before coupling and between 0.04 and 0.42 t ha−1 after integration. This result confirmed that the presented integration framework represents a promising method to improve the prediction of wheat crop growth in Mediterranean areas.

High-resolution radar data can be combined with optical remote-sensing data to provide a new approach to estimate high-resolution soil moisture over vegetated areas. In this paper, the Sentinel-1A data and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are combined to retrieve soil moisture over agricultural fields. The advanced integral equation model (AIEM) is utilized to calculate the scattering contribution of the bare soil surface. The water cloud model (WCM) is applied to model the backscattering coecient of vegetated areas, which use two vegetation parameters to parameterize the scattering and attenuation properties of vegetation. Four dierent vegetation parameters extracted from MODIS products are combined to predict the scattering contribution of vegetation, including the leaf area index (LAI), the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), normalized dierence vegetation index (NDVI), and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI). The eective roughness parameters are chosen to parameterize the AIEM. The Sentinel-1A and MODIS data in 2017 are used to calibrate the coupled model, and the datasets in 2018 are used for soil moisture estimation. The calibration results indicate that the Sentinel-1A backscattering coecient can be accurately predicted by the coupled model with the Pearson correlation coecient (R) ranging from 0.58 to 0.81 and a root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.996 to 1.401 dB. The modeled results show that the retrieved soil moisture can capture the seasonal dynamics of soil moisture with R ranging from 0.74 to 0.81. With the dierent vegetation parameter combinations used for parameterizing the scattering contribution of the canopy, the importance of suitable vegetation parameters for describing the scattering and attenuation properties of vegetation is confirmed. The LAI is recommended to characterize the scattering properties. There is no obvious clue for selecting vegetation descriptors to characterize the attenuation properties of vegetation. These promising results confirm the feasibility and validity of the coupled model for soil moisture retrieval from the Sentinel-1A and MODIS data. © 2020, The authors.","Agricultural fields; AIEM; MODIS; Sentinel-1A; Soil moisture retrieval; WCM","Agricultural robots; Backscattering; Correlation methods; Crops; Integral equations; Mean square error; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Soil surveys; Vegetation; Advanced integral equations; Enhanced vegetation index; Fraction of photosynthetically active radiations; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer datum; Optical remote sensing data; Root mean square errors; Soil moisture estimation; Soil moisture retrievals; Soil moisture; accuracy assessment; bare soil; calibration; crop yield; drought; land surface; leaf area index; MODIS; parameterization; photosynthetically active radiation; satellite data; Sentinel; vegetation index",Article,Scopus

However, it still remains unclear the ability of satellite SIF data to predict crop yields at the regional scale, comparing to widely used satellite vegetation index (VI), such as the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Additionally, few attempts have been made to verify if SIF products from the new Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite could be applied for regional corn and soybean yield estimates. With the deep neural networks (DNN) approach, this study investigated the ability of OCO-2 SIF, MODIS EVI, and climate data to estimate county-level corn and soybean yields in the U.S. Corn Belt. Monthly mean and maximum SIF and MODIS EVI during the peak growing season showed similar correlations with corn and soybean yields. The DNNs with SIF as predictors were able to estimate corn and soybean yields well but performed poorer than MODIS EVI and climate variables-based DNNs. The performance of SIF and MODIS EVI-based DNNs varied with the areal dominance of crops while that of climate-based DNNs exhibited less spatial variability. SIF data could provide useful supplementary information to MODIS EVI and climatic variables for improving estimates of crop yields. MODIS EVI and climate predictors (e.g., VPD and temperature) during the peak growing season (from June to August) played important roles in predicting yields of corn and soybean in the Midwestern 12 states in the U.S. The results highlighted the benefit of combining data from both satellite and climate sources in crop yield estimation. Additionally, this study showed the potential of adding SIF in crop yield prediction despite the small improvement of model performances, which might result from the limitation of current available SIF products.

The SCYP consists of an image preprocessing module (IPM) to determine crop diseases through the Google Vision API and image resizing, a crop disease diagnosis module (CDDM) based on CNN to diagnose the types and extent of crop diseases through photographs, and a crop yield prediction module (CYPM) based on ANN by using information of crop diseases, remaining time until harvest (based on the date), current temperature, humidity and precipitation (amount of snowfall) in the area, sunshine amount, ground temperature, atmospheric pressure, moisture evaporation in the ground, etc. Four experiments were conducted to verify the efficiency of the SCYP. In the CDMM, the accuracy and operation time of each model were measured using three neural network models: CNN, region-CNN(R-CNN), and you only look once (YOLO). In the CYPM, rectified linear unit (ReLU), Sigmoid, and Step activation functions were compared to measure ANN accuracy. The accuracy of CNN was about 3.5% higher than that of R-CNN and about 5.4% higher than that of YOLO. The operation time of CNN was about 37 s less than that of R-CNN and about 72 s less than that of YOLO. The CDDM had slightly less operation time, but in this paper, we prefer accuracy over operation time to diagnose crop diseases efficiently and accurately. When the activation function of the ANN used in the CYPM was ReLU, the accuracy of the ANN was 2% higher than that of Sigmoid and 7% higher than that of Step. The CYPM prediction was about 34% more accurate when using multiple diseases than when not using them. Therefore, the SCYP can predict farm yields more accurately than traditional methods. © 2019 by the authors.","ANN; CNN; Crop disease diagnosis; Image preprocessing; Yield prediction","algorithm; artificial neural network; crop yield; detection method; image processing; prediction; yield response",Article,Scopus

The remote sensing data and technique have been widely used for the estimation of crop yield and production in the world. For the current research, nine remote sensing indices were tested that include normalized difference drought index (NDDI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature condition index (TCI), vegetation health index (VHI), normalized multi-band drought index (NMDI), visible and shortwave infrared drought index (VSDI), and vegetation supply water index (VSWI). These nine indices derived from MODIS/Terra satellite have so far not been used for crop yield prediction in Mongolia. The primary objective of this study was to determine the best remote sensing indices in order to develop an estimation model for spring wheat yield using correlation and regression method. The spring wheat yield data from the ground measurements of eight meteorological stations in Darkhan and Selenge provinces from 2000 to 2017 have been used. The data were collected during the period of the growing season (June-August). Based on the analysis, we constructed six models for spring wheat yield estimation. The results showed that the range of the root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of estimated spring wheat yield was between 4.1 (100 kg ha-1) to 4.8 (100 kg ha-1), respectively. The range of the mean absolute error (MAE) values was between 3.3 to 3.8 and the index of agreement (d) values was between 0.74 to 0.84, respectively. The conclusion was that the best model would be (R2 = 0.55) based on NDWI, VSDI, and NDVI out of the nine indices and could serve as the most effective predictor and reliable remote sensing indices for monitoring the spring wheat yield in the northern part of Mongolia. Our results showed that the best timing of yield prediction for spring wheat was around the end of June and the beginning of July, which is the flowering stage of spring wheat in this study area. This means an accurate yield prediction for spring wheat can be achieved two months before the harvest time using the regression model. © 2019 by the authors.","MODIS; Northern Mongolia; Remote sensing indices; Spring wheat; Yield estimation","Crops; Drought; Forecasting; Mean square error; Radiometers; Regression analysis; Vegetation; MODIS; Mongolia; Remote sensing index; Spring wheat; Yield estimation; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

Crop growth models have been widely used for crop growth process description and yield prediction. In particular, the accurate simulation of important state variables, such as leaf area index (LAI) and root zone soil moisture (SM), is of great importance for yield estimation. Data assimilation is a useful tool that combines a crop model and external observations (often derived from remote sensing data) to improve the simulated crop state variables and consequently model outputs like crop total biomass, water use and grain yield. In spite of its effectiveness, applying data assimilation for monitoring crop growth at the regional scale in China remains challenging, due to the lack of high spatiotemporal resolution satellite data that can match the small field sizes which are typical for agriculture in China. With the accessibility of freely available images acquired by Sentinel satellites, it becomes possible to acquire data at high spatiotemporal resolution (10–30 m, 5–6 days), which offers attractive opportunities to characterize crop growth. In this study, we assimilated remotely sensed LAI and SM into the Word Food Studies (WOFOST) model to estimate winter wheat yield using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) algorithm. The LAI was calculated from Sentinel-2 using a lookup table method, and the SM was calculated from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 based on a change detection approach. Through validation with field data, the inverse error was 10% and 35% for LAI and SM, respectively. The open-loop wheat yield estimation, independent assimilations of LAI and SM, and a joint assimilation of LAI + SM were tested and validated using field measurement observation in the city of Hengshui, China, during the 2016–2017 winter wheat growing season. The results indicated that the accuracy of wheat yield simulated by WOFOST was significantly improved after joint assimilation at the field scale. Compared to the open-loop estimation, the yield root mean square error (RMSE) with field observations was decreased by 69 kg/ha for the LAI assimilation, 39 kg/ha for the SM assimilation and 167 kg/ha for the joint LAI + SM assimilation. Yield coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.41, 0.65, 0.50, and 0.76 and mean relative errors (MRE) of 4.87%, 4.32%, 4.45% and 3.17% were obtained for open-loop, LAI assimilation alone, SM assimilation alone and joint LAI + SM assimilation, respectively. The results suggest that LAI was the first-choice variable for crop data assimilation over SM, and when both LAI and SM satellite data are available, the joint data assimilation has a better performance because LAI and SM have interacting effects. Hence, joint assimilation of LAI and SM from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 at a 20 m resolution into the WOFOST provides a robust method to improve crop yield estimations. However, there is still bias between the key soil moisture in the root zone and the Sentinel-1 C band retrieved SM, especially when the vegetation cover is high. By active and passive microwave data fusion, it may be possible to offer a higher accuracy SM for crop yield prediction. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Predicting accurately with well-timed forecasts is important, but it is a difficult task due to numerous complex factors. Mostly crops like wheat, rice, peas, pulses, sugar cane, tea, cotton, green houses, corn, and soybean can all be used to forecast crop yields. We considered corn dataset to predict the yield for 13 different states in United States. Crop development and progression are strongly affected by climatic changes and unpredictability. Predicting crop yield well before harvest time will support farmers for selling and storing their crops. Agriculture involves large datasets and knowledge processes. Factors such as Weather Components, Soil Components, Management practices, genotype and their interactions are used in predicting Corn Yield. Precise crop growth generally necessitates a complete overview of the functional correlations between yield and all these interactive variables, which necessitates the use of large datasets and complex algorithms to demonstrate. Various Machine Learning models, Deep Learning models, and Artificial Neural Network algorithms are used for predicting.

Advanced machine learning techniques are playing a vital role in the accurate prediction of rice yields in dealing with nonlinear complex situations instead of traditional statistical methods. In the present study, the researchers made an attempt to predict the rice yield through support vector regression (SVR) models with various kernels (linear, polynomial, and radial basis function) for India overall and the top five rice producing states by considering influence parameters, such as the area under cultivation and production, as independent variables for the years 1962–2018. The best-fitted models were chosen based on the cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization of various kernel parameters. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were calculated for the training and testing datasets. The results revealed that SVR with various kernels fitted to India overall, as well as the major rice producing states, would explore the nonlinear patterns to understand the precise situations of yield prediction.

The developed data set is a combination of management, environment, and historical corn yields from 1980 to 2019. Two scenarios for ensemble creation are considered: homogenous and heterogenous ensembles. In homogenous ensembles, the base CNN-DNN models are all the same, but they are generated with a bagging procedure to ensure they exhibit a certain level of diversity. Heterogenous ensembles are created from different base CNN-DNN models which share the same architecture but have different hyperparameters. Three types of ensemble creation methods were used to create several ensembles for either of the scenarios: Basic Ensemble Method (BEM), Generalized Ensemble Method (GEM), and stacked generalized ensembles. Results indicated that both designed ensemble types (heterogenous and homogenous) outperform the ensembles created from five individual ML models (linear regression, LASSO, random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM). Furthermore, by introducing improvements over the heterogenous ensembles, the homogenous ensembles provide the most accurate yield predictions across US Corn Belt states. This model could make 2019 yield predictions with a root mean square error of 866 kg/ha, equivalent to 8.5% relative root mean square and could successfully explain about 77% of the spatio-temporal variation in the corn grain yields. The significant predictive power of this model can be leveraged for designing a reliable tool for corn yield prediction which will in turn assist agronomic decision makers. © Copyright © 2021 Shahhosseini, Hu, Khaki and Archontoulis.","CNN-DNN; heterogenous ensemble; homogenous ensemble; US Corn Belt; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

We first increased the dimension of each data set by adding more features, and then we augmented the size of the data by merging the two data sets. To assess the effectiveness of data-augmentation approaches, we conducted three sets of experiments based on three data sets: the primary data sets, data sets with additional features and the augmented data sets obtained by merging, using five regression models (Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, Extreme Learning Machine, Artificial Neural Network, Deep Neural Network).

Precise prediction of crop yield focuses primarily on agriculture research that has a significant effect on making decisions such as import-export, pricing, and distribution of specific crops. There is a severe need to utilize advanced technologies in order to improve yield quality and creation, anticipate crop yields, and study crop diseases/infections. The most prevalent issue among farmers is that they do not select the appropriate crop based on their soil needs. As a result, they see a significant decrease in production. In this paper, we presented a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based crop classification system for precision agriculture selection to solve the farmers' dilemma. DRL-based advanced agriculture techniques eliminate bad options and boost production in the crop recommendation system. We compared the proposed recommendation system with the various machine learning algorithms, such as Random Tree, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbor, for a site-specific crop with effective accuracy. © 2022 The Authors.

Because of the rapid expansion in human population, the ""Green Revolution"" introduced high yield variety (HYV) seeds, which increased crop productivity but degraded crop and soil quality. This is due to the use of excessive amounts of chemical fertilizers in HYV seeds, as well as the irrigation system utilized to grow these seeds. This stunts the growth of the crops, resulting in financial and productivity losses. Because of field surveys, traditional ways to crop production prediction will take longer, and contemporary agriculture will face certain obstacles. As a result, a comprehensive review of various crop key factors such as climatic factors, soil nutrients, production factors, and environmental factors is conducted using a variety of machine learning approaches such as Support Vector Machine, bayes classifier, decision tree, random forest, linear regression and Extreme Learning Machines. The accuracy measures such as root mean square error, coefficient of determination and mean absolute error are used for comparing the performance of the system. Based on the findings of the reviews, an intelligent and robust machine learning technique provides the optimum option for achieving (i) soil fertility, (ii) crop prediction, and (iii) yield prediction. The importance of soil variables and the amount of nutrients available in the soil for growing crops has been found, according to an examination of 51 peer-reviewed studies, to create qualitative yield prediction. Furthermore, the investigations will yield recommendations for future fertilizer research. © 2022 by authors, all rights reserved.

These regulations require that growers apply nitrogen to meet, but not exceed, the annual N demand for crop and tree growth and nut production. To accurately predict seasonal nitrogen demand, therefore, growers need to estimate block-level almond yield early in the growing season so that timely N management decisions can be made. However, methods to predict almond yield are not currently available. To fill this gap, we have developed statistical models using the Stochastic Gradient Boosting, a machine learning approach, for early season yield projection and mid-season yield update over individual orchard blocks. We collected yield records of 185 orchards, dating back to 2005, from the major almond growers in the Central Valley of California. A large set of variables were extracted as predictors, including weather and orchard characteristics from remote sensing imagery. Our results showed that the predicted orchard-level yield agreed well with the independent yield records. For both the early season (March) and mid-season (June) predictions, a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.71, and a ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) of 2.6 were found on average. We also identified several key determinants of yield based on the modeling results. Almond yield increased dramatically with the orchard age until about 7 years old in general, and the higher long-term mean maximum temperature during April–June enhanced the yield in the southern orchards, while a larger amount of precipitation in March reduced the yield, especially in northern orchards. Remote sensing metrics such as annual maximum vegetation indices were also dominant variables for predicting the yield potential. While these results are promising, further refinement is needed; the availability of larger data sets and incorporation of additional variables and methodologies will be required for the model to be used as a fertilization decision support tool for growers. Our study has demonstrated the potential of automatic almond yield prediction to assist growers to manage N adaptively, comply with mandated requirements, and ensure industry sustainability. © 2019 Zhang, Jin, Chen and Brown.","Almond orchard; Central valley; Machine learning; Nitrogen management; Remote sensing; Yield prediction; Yield variation",,Article,Scopus

Recent studies have proven remote sensing is an efficient method for yield estimation and machine learning, especially deep learning, can infer a good prediction by integrating multisource datasets such as satellite data, climate data, soil data, and so on. However, there are some bottleneck challenges to improve accuracy. First, the popular remote sensing data used for yield prediction fall into two major groups - time-series data and constant data. Surprisingly little attention has been devoted to deep learning networks which can integrate the two kinds of data effectively; second, both temporal and spatial features play a role in affecting the yields. But most of the existing approaches employed either convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN). CNN cannot learn temporal patterns, while RNN barely can learn spatial characteristics. This work proposed a novel multilevel deep learning model coupling RNN and CNN to extract both spatial and temporal features. The inputs include both time-series remote sensing data, soil property data, and the model outputs yield. We experimented with the model in U.S. Corn Belt states, and used it to predict corn yield from 2013 to 2016 at the county-level. The results approve the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach over the other methods.

The prediction models developed calculate the fruit fresh weight based on the D leaf fresh weight (DLFW) and stem diameter (SD), measured at the time of floral induction. ANFIS were developed using the genfisOptions function of the Neuro Fuzzy Designer toolbox of the Matlab program (Mathworks®- Neuro Fuzzy Designer, R2018a), considering DLFW and SD as the entry parameters, single and combined. The yield prediction error was calculated using the root mean square error (RMSE). The RMSE found for all ANFIS developed were lower than that predicted by linear or quadratic regression models. The lowest RMSE was obtained when the parameters DLFW and SD were combined for the development of the ANFIS.

A precise prediction of blueberry harvest losses is necessary to mitigate such losses. The performance of three machine learning (ML) algorithms was assessed to predict the wild blueberry harvest losses on the ground. The data from four commercial fields in Atlantic Canada (including Tracadie, Frank Webb, Small Scott, and Cooper fields) were utilized to achieve the goal. Wild blueberry losses (fruit loss on ground, leaf losses, blower losses) and yield were measured manually from randomly selected plots during mechanical harvesting. The plant height of wild blueberry, field slope, and fruit zone readings were collected from each of the plots. For the purpose of predicting ground loss as a function of fruit zone, plant height, fruit production, slope, leaf loss, and blower damage, three ML models i.e., support vector regression (SVR), linear regression (LR), and random forest (RF)—were used. Statistical parameters i.e., mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2), were used to assess the prediction accuracy of the models. The results of the correlation matrices showed that the blueberry yield and losses (leaf loss, blower loss) had medium to strong correlations accessed based on the correlation coefficient (r) range 0.37–0.79. The LR model showed the foremost predictions of ground loss as compared to all the other models analyzed. Tracadie, Frank Webb, Small Scott, and Cooper had R2 values of 0.87, 0.91, 0.91, and 0.73, respectively. Support vector regression performed comparatively better at all the fields i.e., R2 = 0.93 (Frank Webb field), R2 = 0.88 (Tracadie), and R2 = 0.79 (Cooper) except Small Scott field with R2 = 0.07. When comparing the actual and anticipated ground loss, the SVR performed best (R2 = 0.79–0.93) as compared to the other two algorithms i.e., LR (R2 = 0.73 to 0.92), and RF (R2 = 0.53 to 0.89) for the three fields. The outcomes revealed that these ML algorithms can be useful in predicting ground losses during wild blueberry harvesting in the selected fields. © 2022 by the authors.","harvesting losses; machine learning algorithms; wild blueberries",,Article,Scopus

The novelty of this study is to evidence the effective of the temperature, pesticides, and rainfall environment parameters in the influence sustainable agriculture and economic efficiency at the farm level in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, predicting the future values of main crop yield in Saudi Arabia. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to estimate the impact of environment factors and agrotechnical parameters on agricultural crop yields and to anticipate yields is examined in this study. Using artificial neural networks (ANNs), a highly effective multilayer perceptron (MLP) model was built to accurately predict the crop yield, temperature, insecticides, and rainfall based on environmental data. The dataset is collected from different Saudi Arabia regions from 1994 to 2016, including the temperature, insecticides, rainfall, and crop yields for potatoes, rice, sorghum, and wheat. For this study, we relied on five different statistical evaluation metrics: the mean square error (MSE), the root-mean-square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), Pearson's correlation coefficient (R%), and the determination coefficient (R2). Analyses of datasets for crop yields, temperature, and insecticides led to the development of the MLP models. The datasets are randomly divided into separate samples, 70% for training and 30% for testing. The best-performing MLP model is characterized by values of (R = 100%) and (R2 = 96:33) for predicting insecticides in the testing process.

Healthy and fruitful crops are of immense importance for a government to fulfill the food requirements of its inhabitants. Because of land diversities, weather conditions, geographical locations, defensive measures against diseases, and natural disasters, monitoring crops with human intervention becomes quite challenging. Conventional crop classification and yield estimation methods are ineffective under unfavorable circumstances. This research exploits modern precision agriculture tools for enhanced remote crop yield estimation, and types classification by proposing a fuzzy hybrid ensembled classification and estimation method using remote sensory data. The architecture enhances the pooled images with fuzzy neighborhood spatial filtering, scaling, flipping, shearing, and zooming. The study identifies the optimal weights of the strongest candidate classifiers for the ensembled classification method adopting the bagging strategy. We augmented the imagery datasets to achieve an unbiased classification between different crop types, including jute, maize, rice, sugarcane, and wheat. Further, we considered flaxseed, lentils, rice, sugarcane, and wheat for yield estimation on publicly available datasets provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the Word Bank DataBank. The ensemble method outperformed the individual classification methods for crop type classification on an average of 13% and 24% compared to the highest gradient boosting and lowest decision tree methods, respectively. Similarly, we observed that the gradient boosting predictor outperformed the multivariate regressor, random forest, and decision tree regressor, with a comparatively lower mean square error value on yield years 2017 to 2021. Further, the proposed architecture supports embedded devices, where remote devices can adopt a lightweight classification algorithm, such as MobilenetV2. This can significantly reduce the processing time and overhead of a large set of pooled images. © 2023 by the authors.","data analysis; data augmentation; deep learning; feature extraction; precision agriculture; sensory images",,Article,Scopus

To approve the proposed method, 160 field data including water consumption during the growing season, fertilizers, climatic variables, and crop variety were applied. Two types of treatments, namely drip irrigation (DI) and drip irrigation with plastic mulch (PMDI), were considered. Seven different input combinations were used to estimate yield and WP.

A good agreement was presented between the observed (field monitoring data) and estimated (calculated with SO–SVR method) values (R2 = 0.982).

Temperature, rainfall amount, and reference evapotranspiration are major climatic factors affecting maize yield. They are not only interdependent but also have significantly changed due to climate change, which causes nonlinearity and nonstationarity in weather data. Hence, there exists a need for a stochastic process for predicting maize yield with higher precision. To solve the problem, this paper constructs a joint stochastic process that acquires joints effects of the three weather processes from joint a probability density function (pdf) constructed using copulas that maintain interdependence. Stochastic analyses are applied on the pdf and process to account for nonlinearity and nonstationarity, and also establish a corresponding stochastic differential equation (SDE) for maize yield. The trivariate stochastic process predicts maize yield with R2=0.8389 and MAPE=4.31% under a deep learning framework.

Food security is important for decision-makers. The agriculture industry can more accurately supply human demand for food if the crop yield is predicted accurately. Tomato is one of the most important crops so that 160 million tonnes of tomatoes are produced annually around the world. In this study, tomato yield based on data of 40 cities of Iran country including annual average temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), effective rainfall (R), wind speed (WS), and Evapotranspiration (EV) for the period of 1968–2018 was predicted using a new Bayesian model averaging (BMA). The paper's main innovation is the use of the new BMA so that it allows the modellers to quantify the uncertainty of model parameters and inputs simultaneously. For this aim, first, the multiple Adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface system (ANFIS) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) were used for predicting crop yield. To train the ANFIS and MLP model, a new algorithm, namely, multi verse optimization algorithm (MOA) was used. Also, the ability of MOA was benchmarked against the particle swarm optimization (PSO), and firefly algorithm (FFA). In the next level, the new BMA used the outputs of the ANFIS-MOA, MLP-MOA, ANFIS, FFA, MLP-FFA, ANFIS-PSO, MLP-PSO, ANFIS, and MLP for predicting tomato yield in an ensemble framework. The five- input combination of RH, T, and R, WS, and EV gave the best result. The mean absolute error (MAE) of the BMA in the testing level was 20.12 (Ton/ha) while it was 24.12, 24.45, 24.67, 25.12, 29.12, 30.12, 31.12, and 33.45 for the ANFIS-MOA, MLP-MOA, ANFIS-FFA, MLP-FFA, ANFIS-PSO, MLP-PSO, ANFIS, and MLP models. Regarding the results of uncertainty analysis, the uncertainty of BMA was lower than those of the ANFIS-MOA, MLP-MOA, ANFIS-FFA, MLP-FFA, ANFIS-PSO, MLP-PSO, ANFIS, and MLP models while the MLP model provided the highest uncertainty. The results of this study indicated that BMA using multiple MLP and ANFIS model was useful for predicting tomato yield. © 2022 THE AUTHORS","Agriculture; ANFIS; Climate parameters; Crop yield; MLP","Bayesian networks; Climate models; Crops; Decision making; Food supply; Forecasting; Fruits; Fuzzy inference; Uncertainty analysis; Wind; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface system; Bayesian model averaging; Climate parameters; Crop yield; Firefly algorithms; Fuzzy interface systems; Multilayers perceptrons; Optimization algorithms; System layer; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",Article,Scopus

The results suggest that the mean technical efficiency varies from 0.64 in Gujarat to 0.95 in Odisha. Inputs like human labor, mechanical labor, fertilizer, irrigation and insecticide were found to determine the yield in paddy cultivation across India (except for Chhattisgarh). Inefficiency in the paddy production in Punjab, Bihar, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam, Gujarat and Odisha in 2016–2017 was caused by technical inefficiency due to poor input management, as suggested by the significant σ2U and σ2v values of the stochastic frontier model. In addition, most of the farm groups in the study operated in the high‐efficiency group (80–90% technical efficiency). No specific pattern of input use can be visualized through descriptive measures to give any specific policy implication. Thus, machine learning algorithms based on the input parameters were tested on the data in order to predict the farmers’ efficiency class for individual states. The highest mean accuracy of 0.80 for the models of all of the states was achieved in random forest models. Among the various states of India, the best random forest prediction model based on accuracy was fitted to the input data of Bihar (0.91), followed by Uttar Pradesh (0.89), Andhra Pradesh (0.88), Assam (0.88) and West Bengal (0.86). Thus, the study provides a technique for the classification and prediction of a farmer’s efficiency group from the levels of input use in paddy cultivation for each state in the study. The study uses the DES input dataset to classify and predict the efficiency group of the farmer, as other machine learning models in agriculture have used mostly satellite, spectral imaging and soil property data to detect disease, weeds and crops. © 2021 by the authors.

Climate is a major factor that affects production of vegetables and other crops there by having direct impact on pricing. Among the main challenges faced by farmers is accurate prediction of vegetable prices. Farmers therefore need to acquire a better and advanced knowledgeable model to assist them in taking proper decisions when budgeting on how much to spend on planting so that it's proportional to the expected prices of the produce, in prediction of the climatic change effects on vegetable prices, a call for variables and parameters that show the response of vegetable prices, production, consumption and storage with weather conditions is necessary. The most common approach is using the statistical models that are trained using historical yield data with simplified weather measurements, for example average temperature in the growing season, humidly and rainfall. However, such approaches do not take into consideration the weather effects on entire vegetable lifecycle inclusive of the prices for yields necessitating the need for this study. This paper presents a study on Fuzzy based vegetable price prediction considering various changes in climatic parameters including humidity, rainfall and temperature. This system model was developed based on a 4- year vegetable price data and climatic data of the same period for Kisumu (Kenya). The results show that this model can indeed be used by farmers to predict prices and hence assist them to make informed vegetable farming and investment decisions. © 2022 The Authors.

To perform the estimation, a hybrid method based on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and seasons optimization (SO) algorithm was proposed. According to the irrigation and climate factors, six different models have been proposed to combine the parameters in the SO-ANFIS. The proposed method is evaluated on a test data set that contains information about apple orchards in Miandoab city from 2019 to 2021. The NSI model was compared with two popular irrigation methods including two-sided furrow irrigation (TSFI) and basin irrigation (BI) on benchmark scenarios. The results justified that the NSI model increased WUE by 1.90 kg/m3 and 3.13 kg/m3, and yield by 8.57% and 14.30% compared to TSFI and BI methods, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed SO-ANFIS has achieved the performance of 0.989 and 0.988 in terms of R2 criterion in estimating WUE and yield of NSI irrigation method, respectively.

The traditional rice almanac used astronomical and climate factors to estimate yield response. However, this research integrated meteorological, agro-chemical, and soil physiographic factors for yield response prediction. Besides, the impact of those factors on the production of three major rice ecotypes has also been studied in this research. Moreover, this study found a different set of those factors with respect to the yield response of different rice ecotypes. Machine learning algorithms named Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) have been used for predicting the yield response. The SVR shows better results than XGBoost for predicting the yield of the Aus rice ecotype, whereas XGBoost performs better for forecasting the yield of the Aman and Boro rice ecotypes. The result shows that the root mean squared error (RMSE) of three different ecotypes are in between 9.38% and 24.37% and that of R-squared values are between 89.74% and 99.13% on two different machine learning algorithms.

This study analyzes the performance of machine learning and deep learning methods for winter wheat yield prediction using an extensive dataset of weather, soil, and crop phenology variables in 271 counties across Germany from 1999 to 2019. We proposed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which uses a 1-dimensional convolution operation to capture the time dependencies of environmental variables. We used eight supervised machine learning models as baselines and evaluated their predictive performance using RMSE, MAE, and correlation coefficient metrics to benchmark the yield prediction results. Our findings suggested that nonlinear models such as the proposed CNN, Deep Neural Network (DNN), and XGBoost were more effective in understanding the relationship between the crop yield and input data compared to the linear models. Our proposed CNN model outperformed all other baseline models used for winter wheat yield prediction (7 to 14% lower RMSE, 3 to 15% lower MAE, and 4 to 50% higher correlation coefficient than the best performing baseline across test data). We aggregated soil moisture and meteorological features at the weekly resolution to address the seasonality of the data.

Aloe arborescens L. is famous for its medicinal properties used in medicine, cosmetology, and even the food industry. Diagnosing the abnormalities in the plant development in a timely and accurate manner plays an important role in preventing the loss of crop production yields. The current study has built a method for recognizing the causes of abnormalities in the development of Aloe arborescens L. caused by a lack of watering or lighting, based on the use of transfer training of the VGG-16 convolutional neural network (United Kingdom). A given architecture is aimed at recognizing objects in images, which is the main reason for using it to achieve the goal set. The analysis of the quality metrics of the proposed image classification process by specified classes has revealed high recognition reliability (for a normally developing plant, 91%; for a plant without proper watering, 89%; and for a plant without proper lighting, 83%).

In this study, different multispectral and red-green-blue (RGB) vegetation indices were analyzed, as well as the digitally estimated canopy cover and plant density, in order to estimate corn grain yield using a neural network model. The relative importance of the predictor variables was also analyzed. An experiment was established with five levels of nitrogen fertilization (140, 200, 260, 320, and 380 kg/ha) and four replicates, in a completely randomized block design, resulting in 20 experimental polygons. Crop information was captured using two sensors (Parrot Sequoia_4.9, and DJI FC6310_8.8) mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for two flight dates at 47 and 79 days after sowing (DAS). The correlation coefficient between the plant density, obtained through the digital count of corn plants, and the corn grain yield was 0.94; this variable was the one with the highest relative importance in the yield estimation according to Garson’s algorithm. The canopy cover, digitally estimated, showed a correlation coefficient of 0.77 with respect to the corn grain yield, while the relative importance of this variable in the yield estimation was 0.080 and 0.093 for 47 and 79 DAS, respectively. The wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI), plant density, and canopy cover showed the highest correlation coefficient and the smallest errors (R = 0.99, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.028 t ha−1, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.125 t ha−1 ) in the corn grain yield estimation at 47 DAS, with the WDRVI index and the density being the variables with the highest relative importance for this crop development date. For the 79 DAS flight, the combination of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference red edge (NDRE), WDRVI, excess green (EXG), triangular greenness index (TGI), and visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI), as well as plant density and canopy cover, generated the highest correlation coefficient and the smallest errors (R = 0.97, MAE = 0.249 t ha−1, RMSE = 0.425 t ha−1 ) in the corn grain yield estimation, where the density and the NDVI were the variables with the highest relative importance, with values of 0.295 and 0.184, respectively. However, the WDRVI, plant density, and canopy cover estimated the corn grain yield with acceptable precision (R = 0.96, MAE = 0.209 t ha−1, RMSE = 0.449 t ha−1 ). The generated neural network models provided a high correlation coefficient between the estimated and the observed corn grain yield, and also showed acceptable errors in the yield estimation. The spectral information registered through remote sensors mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles and its processing in vegetation indices, canopy cover, and plant density allowed the characterization and estimation of corn grain yield.

The sugarcane yield data were acquired from sugarcane fields around the Godavari Bio-refineries Limited (GBL) factory in Karnataka, India, during the 2017-2018 sugarcane growing season. A dataset detailing agronomic information and VIs was prepared for yield prediction. The study area comprises seven sugarcane growing talukas.

Recent research has shown that machine learning (ML) can provide reasonable predictions faster and with higher flexibility compared to simulation crop modeling. However, a single machine learning model can be outperformed by a “committee” of models (machine learning ensembles) that can reduce prediction bias, variance, or both and is able to better capture the underlying distribution of the data. Yet, there are many aspects to be investigated with regard to prediction accuracy, time of the prediction, and scale. The earlier the prediction during the growing season the better, but this has not been thoroughly investigated as previous studies considered all data available to predict yields. This paper provides a machine leaning based framework to forecast corn yields in three US Corn Belt states (Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa) considering complete and partial in-season weather knowledge. Several ensemble models are designed using blocked sequential procedure to generate out-of-bag predictions. The forecasts are made in county-level scale and aggregated for agricultural district and state level scales. Results show that the proposed optimized weighted ensemble and the average ensemble are the most precise models with RRMSE of 9.5%. Stacked LASSO makes the least biased predictions (MBE of 53 kg/ha), while other ensemble models also outperformed the base learners in terms of bias. On the contrary, although random k-fold cross-validation is replaced by blocked sequential procedure, it is shown that stacked ensembles perform not as good as weighted ensemble models for time series data sets as they require the data to be non-IID to perform favorably. Comparing our proposed model forecasts with the literature demonstrates the acceptable performance of forecasts made by our proposed ensemble model. Results from the scenario of having partial in-season weather knowledge reveals that decent yield forecasts with RRMSE of 9.2% can be made as early as June 1st. Moreover, it was shown that the proposed model performed better than individual models and benchmark ensembles at agricultural district and state-level scales as well as county-level scale. To find the marginal effect of each input feature on the forecasts made by the proposed ensemble model, a methodology is suggested that is the basis for finding feature importance for the ensemble model. The findings suggest that weather features corresponding to weather in weeks 18–24 (May 1st to June 1st) are the most important input features. © Copyright © 2020 Shahhosseini, Hu and Archontoulis.","corn yields; ensemble; forecasting; machine learning; US Corn Belt",,Article,Scopus

Corn planting and harvest scheduling is challenging because corn hybrids have different planting windows, and, subsequently, inaccurate planting and harvest scheduling can result in inconsistent and unpredictable weekly harvest quantities and logistical and productivity issues. In the 2021 Syngenta Crop Challenge, participants were given several large datasets including recorded historical daily growing degree units (GDU) of two sites and provided with planting windows, required GDUs, and harvest quantities of corn hybrids planted in these two sites, and were asked to schedule planting and harvesting dates of corn hybrids under two storage capacity cases so that facilities are not over capacity in harvesting weeks and have consistent weekly harvest quantities. The research problem includes determining the planting and harvest scheduling of corn hybrids under two storage capacity cases: (1) given the maximum storage capacity, and (2) without maximum storage capacity to determine the lowest storage capacity for each site. To help improve corn planting and harvest scheduling, we propose two mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models and a heuristic algorithm to solve this problem for both storage capacity cases. Daily GDUs are required for planting and harvest scheduling, but they are unknown at the beginning of the growing season. As such, we use recurrent neural networks to predict the weekly GDUs of 70 weeks and consider this as the predicted GDU scenario to solve this problem. In addition, we solve this problem considering all given 10 historical GDU scenarios from 2010 to 2019 together for both storage capacity cases to include historical GDUs directly to our model rather than using predicted GDUs. Our extensive computational experiments and results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, which can provide optimal planting and harvest scheduling considering deterministic GDU scenario and uncertainties in historical GDU scenarios for both storage capacity cases to provide consistent weekly harvest quantities that are below the maximum capacity. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"adult; article; computer heuristics; crop production; growing season; human; price; productivity; recurrent neural network; system analysis; uncertainty; crop production; maize; uncertainty; Crop Production; Humans; Uncertainty; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The soil type and environment are critical factors that drive agriculture, especially in terms of crop prediction. To determine which crops grow best in certain types of soil and environment, the characteristics of the latter are to be ascertained. In the past, farmers picked suitable crops for cultivation, based on first-hand experience. Today, however, identifying appropriate crops for particular areas has become a difficult proposition. The application of machine learning techniques to agriculture is an emerging field of research that helps predicts crops for easy cultivation and improved productivity. In this work, a comparative analysis is undertaken using several classifiers like the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF) and Bagging to help suggest the most suitable cultivable crop(s), based on soil and environmental characteristics, for a specific piece of land.

Rainfall, temperature (minimum and maximum), evaporation, average wind speed (morning and evening), and sunshine hours are the climatic factors considered for modeling. Rice harvest and yield data over the last three decades and monthly climatic data were used to develop the prediction model by applying artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machine regression (SVMR), multiple linear regression (MLR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), power regression (PR), and robust regression (RR). The performance of each model was assessed in terms of the mean squared error (MSE), correlation coefficient (R), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean squared error ratio (RSR), BIAS value, and the Nash number, and it was found that the GPR-based model is the most accurate among them.

In this work, we propose to further improve the yield prediction task by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) given their unique ability to exploit the spatial information of small regions of the field. We present a novel CNN architecture called Hyper3DNetReg that takes in a multi-channel input raster and, unlike previous approaches, outputs a two-dimensional raster, where each output pixel represents the predicted yield value of the corresponding input pixel. Our proposed method then generates a yield prediction map by aggregating the overlapping yield prediction patches obtained throughout the field. Our data consist of a set of eight rasterized remotely-sensed features: nitrogen rate applied, precipitation, slope, elevation, topographic position index (TPI), aspect, and two radar backscatter coefficients acquired from the Sentinel-1 satellites.

Because the yield per unit area, planting area of crops, and effective precipitation in the region are uncertain, it is not easy to plan the amount of irrigation water for crops. In order to improve the applicability of the uncertainty programming model, a hybrid LSTM-CPP-FPP-IPP model (long short-term memory, chance-constrained programming, fuzzy possibility programming, interval parameter programming) was developed to plan the irrigation water allocation of irrigation system under uncertainty. The LSTM (long short-term memory) model was used to predict crop yield per unit area, and CPP-FPP-IPP programming (chance-constrained programming, fuzzy possibility programming, interval parameter programming) was used to plan the crop area and the effective precipitation under uncertainty. The hybrid model was used for the crop production profit of winter wheat and summer corn in five cities in the North China Plain. The average absolute error between the model prediction value and the actual value of the yield per unit area of winter wheat and summer maize in four cities in 2020 was controlled within the range of 14.02 to 696.66 kg/hectare. It shows that the model can more accurately predict the yield per unit area of crops. The planning model for the benefit of irrigation water allocation generated three scenarios of rainfall level and four planting intentions, and compared the planned scenarios with the actual production benefits of the two crops in 2020. In a dry year, the possibility of planting areas for winter wheat and summer corn is optimized. Compared with the traditional deterministic planning method, the model takes into account the uncertain parameters, which helps decision makers seek better solutions under uncertain conditions. © 2022 by the authors.

Several studies have been conducted to forecast agricultural yields using machine learning algorithms (MLA), but few studies have used ensemble machine learning algorithms (EMLA). In the current study, we use a dataset generated by a computer simulation program, and meteorological data obtained over 30 years from Maine, United States (USA). The primary goal of this research is to increase the forecast accuracy of the best characteristics for overcoming hunger challenges. We adopted stacking regression (SR) and cascading regression (CR) with a novel combination of MLA based on the wild blueberry dataset. We used features that indicated the best regulation for wild blueberry agroecosystems. Four feature engineering selection techniques are applied, namely variance inflation factor (VIF), sequential forward feature selection (SFFS), sequential backward elimination feature selection (SBEFS), and extreme gradient boosting based on feature importance (XFI). We applied Bayesian optimization on popular MLA to obtain the best hyperparameters to achieve accurate wild blueberry yield prediction. The SR used a two-layer structure: level-0 containing light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), gradient boost regression (GBR) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and level-1 providing the output prediction using a Ridge. The CR topology is the same MLA used in SR, but in a series form that takes the new prediction as a feeder to each MLA and removes the previous prediction in each stage. We assessed the CR, and SR with outcomes according to the root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2). In the results, the proposed SR showed the best performance with R2 of 0.984 and RMSE of 179.898 compared with another study that reported R2 of 0.938 and RMSE of 343.026 on the seven features selected by XFI. The SR achieved the highest R2 of 0.985 on all features and the features that were selected by the SBEFS.

Accurate wheat yield prediction is critical to satisfying local consumption and increasing exports regionally and globally to meet human food security. This paper incorporates remote satellite-based information in a wheat-growing region in South Australia to estimate the yield by integrating the kernel ridge regression (KRR) method coupled with complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and the grey wolf optimisation (GWO). The hybrid model, ‘GWO-CEEMDAN-KRR,’ employing an initial pool of 23 different satellite-based predictors, is seen to outperform all the benchmark models and all the feature selection (ant colony, atom search, and particle swarm optimisation) methods that are implemented using a set of carefully screened satellite variables and a feature decomposition or CEEMDAN approach. A suite of statistical metrics and infographics comparing the pre-dicted and measured yield shows a model prediction error that can be reduced by ~20% by employing the proposed GWO-CEEMDAN-KRR model. With the metrics verifying the accuracy of simulations, we also show that it is possible to optimise the wheat yield to achieve agricultural profits by quantifying and including the effects of satellite variables on potential yield. With further improvements in the proposed methodology, the GWO-CEEMDAN-KRR model can be adopted in agricultural yield simulation that requires remote sensing data to establish the relationships between crop health, yield, and other productivity features to support precision agriculture. © 2022 by the authors.

Early prediction of crop performance can reduce this constraint by allowing breeders more time to focus on the highest-performing varieties. Here, we present a multimodal deep learning model for predicting the performance of maize (Zea mays) at an early developmental stage, offering the potential to accelerate crop breeding. We employed multispectral images and eight vegetation indices, collected by an uncrewed aerial vehicle approximately 60 days after sowing, over three consecutive growing cycles (2017, 2018 and 2019). The multimodal deep learning approach was used to integrate field management and genotype information with the multispectral data, providing context to the conditions that the plants experienced during the trial. Model performance was assessed using holdout data, in which the model accurately predicted the yield (RMSE 1.07 t/ha, a relative RMSE of 7.60% of 16 t/ha, and R2 score 0.73) and identified the majority of high-yielding varieties, outperforming previously published models for early yield prediction. The inclusion of vegetation indices was important for model performance, with a normalized difference vegetation index and green with normalized difference vegetation index contributing the most to model performance. The model provides a decision support tool, identifying promising lines early in the field trial. © 2021 by the authors.

However, to save energy, water and nutrients, additional parameters related to crop performance and physiology will have to be considered. In addition, detecting crop stress before it is clearly visible by naked eye is an advantage that could aid in microclimate control. In this study, a Machine Learning (ML) model which takes into account microclimate and crop physiological data to detect different types of crop stress was developed and tested. For this purpose, a multi-sensor platform was used to record tomato plant physiological characteristics under different fertigation and air temperature conditions. The innovation of the current model lies in the integration of photosynthesis rate (Ps) values estimated by means of remote sensing using a photochemical reflectance index (PRI). Through this process, the time-series Ps data were combined with crop leaf temperature and microclimate data by means of the ML model. Two different algorithms were evaluated: Gradient Boosting (GB) and MultiLayer perceptron (MLP). Two runs with different structures took place for each algorithm. In RUN 1, there were more feature inputs than the outputs to build a model with high predictive accuracy. However, in order to simplify the process and develop a user-friendly approach, a second, different run was carried out. Thus, in RUN 2, the inputs were fewer than the outputs, and that is why the performance of the model in this case was lower than in the case of RUN 1. Particularly, MLP showed 91% and 83% accuracy in the training sample, and 89% and 82% in testing sample, for RUNs 1 and 2, respectively. GB showed 100% accuracy in the training sample for both runs, and 91% and 83% in testing sample in RUN 1 and RUN 2, respectively. To improve the accuracy of RUN 2, a larger database is required. Both models, however, could easily be incorporated into existing greenhouse climate monitoring and control systems, replacing human experience in detecting greenhouse crop stress conditions. © 2022 by the authors.","gradient boosting; microclimate; multilayer perceptron; photosynthesis rate; soft sensor",,Article,Scopus

This study investigated lettuce yield (fresh weight) prediction using four machine learning (ML) models, namely, support vector regressor (SVR), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), random forest (RF), and deep neural network (DNN). It was cultivated in three hydroponics systems (i.e., suspended nutrient film technique system, pyramidal aeroponic system, and tower aeroponic system), which interacted with three different magnetic unit strengths under a controlled greenhouse environment during the growing season in 2018 and 2019. Three scenarios consisting of the combinations of input variables (i.e., leaf number, water consumption, dry weight, stem length, and stem diameter) were assessed. The XGB model with scenario 3 (all input variables) yielded the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 8.88 g followed by SVR with the same scenario that achieved 9.55 g, and the highest result was by RF with scenario 1 (i.e., leaf number and water consumption) that achieved 12.89 g. All model scenarios having Scatter Index (SI) (i.e., RMSE divided by the average values of the observed yield) values less than 0.1 were classified as excellent in predicting fresh lettuce yield. Based on all of the performance statistics, the two best models were SVR with scenario 3 and DNN with scenario 2 (i.e., leaf number, water consumption, and dry weight). However, DNN with scenario 2 requiring less input variables is preferred. The potential of the DNN model to predict fresh lettuce yield is promising, and it can be applied on a large scale as a rapid tool for decision-makers to manage crop yield.

The rapid and accurate estimation of winter wheat yields over large areas is an important prerequisite for food security policy formulation and implementation. In most county-level yield estimation processes, multiple input data are used for yield prediction as much as possible, however, in some regions, data are more difficult to obtain, so we used the single-leaf area index (LAI) as input data for the model for yield prediction. In this study, the effects of different time steps as well as the LAI time series on the estimation results were analyzed for the properties of long short-term memory (LSTM), and multiple machine learning methods were compared with yield estimation models constructed by the LSTM networks. The results show that the accuracy of the yield estimation results using LSTM did not show an increasing trend with the increasing step size and data volume, while the yield estimation results of the LSTM were generally better than those of conventional machine learning methods, with the best R2 and RMSE results of 0.87 and 522.3 kg/ha, respectively, in the comparison between predicted and actual yields. Although the use of LAI as a single input factor may cause yield uncertainty in some extreme years, it is a reliable and promising method for improving the yield estimation, which has important implications for crop yield forecasting, agricultural disaster monitoring, food trade policy, and food security early warning. © 2022 by the authors.","deep learning; LAI; LSTM; winter wheat; yield estimation",,Article,Scopus

In the second approach, the reflectance data of all Sentinel-2 bands for several dates during the growth periods were used as input parameters in three machine learning model algorithms, i.e., random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and boosting regressions (BR). Modeling results were examined against yield data collected by a combine harvester equipped with a yield mapping system. VI-MLR showed a moderate performance with R2 = 0.532 and RMSE = 847 kg ha−1.

Previous studies mainly focused on the whole crop growth period while different time windows on yield prediction were still unknown. The entire growth period was separated into each month to assess their corresponding predictive ability by taking maize production (silage and grain) in Czechia. We present a thorough assessment of county-level maize yield prediction in Czechia using a machine learning algorithm (extreme learning machine (ELM)) and an extensive set of weather data and maize yields from 2002 to 2018. Results show that sunshine in June and water deficit in July were vastly influential factors for silage maize yield. The two primary climate parameters for grain maize yield are minimum temperature in September and water deficit in May. The average absolute relative deviation (AARD), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient (R2) of the proposed models are 6.565–32.148%, 1.006–1.071%, 0.641–0.716, respectively. Based on the results, silage yield will decrease by 1.367 t/ha (3.826% loss), and grain yield will increase by 0.337 t/ha (5.394% increase) when the max temperature in May increases by 2◦C.

As a result, image processing technology must be used to detect plant sickness at an early stage.

However, this problem requires considering long-term dependencies between various features. The most natural way of analyzing all those features together is with deep neural networks. The paper presents neural network models for mid-term forecasting of crop production and export, which considers heterogeneous features such as trade flows, production levels, macroeconomic indicators, fuel pricing, and vegetation indexes.

This combined with increasing protein demands highlight the challenge on providing sustainable protein derived from alternative sources. Microbial protein derived from microorganisms offers potential solutions. Notably, some microbial strains e.g. Fusarium venenatum could efficiently convert carbon sources from food-safe agricultural lignocellulosic ‘waste’ (e.g. food crop residues such as wheat straw) to microbial protein. Our study is underpinned by data-driven approach and presents a modelling framework and analyses to predict spatially-explicit yields of staple crop lignocellulosic residues in response to spatial variation and climate change and highlight their potential for microbial protein production. Five food crops residues have been modelled including barley, wheat, maize, sorghum and rice straws worldwide (around 227 countries) to show future potential for microbial protein production. This study predicts crop residue yields using the data set collection and data pre-processing of crop residues and other environmental factors like temperature. Then, global autocorrelation is used to identify crop residues’ worldwide distribution patterns, and local autocorrelation is used to identify hot and cold spots. Feature selection and four models including ordinary least squares (OLS), multilayer perceptron (MLP), lasso regression and spatial error model are applied in prediction. With the updated independent factor ‘future temperature’ obtained from the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, the selected model is used to predict crop residues in 2030, 2040 and visualizations are created to show the projection outcomes. Our quantitative projection suggests that the future lignocellulosic microbial protein supply in different scenarios would sufficiently satisfy the global protein demands considering the average adult daily protein recommendation (50 g protein per capita 70 kg per day). © 2022 The Author(s)","Crop residues; Microbial protein; Regression; Spatial analysis; Sustainable protein",,Article,Scopus

In this Study, forecasting is done with the help Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM-NN) models on the basis of the historical data of rice cultivation from the year 1950-51 to 2017-18. The well fitted ARIMA models for the parameters such as Area under Cultivation (0,1,1), Production (0,1,1) and Yielding (2,2,1) are obtained from the significant spikes of their respective Auto Correlation Function (ACF) and Partial Auto Correlation Function (PACF) plots. But, the models fitted with a supervised deep learning neural network known as LSTM-NN are found much better time series forecasting model than the ARIMA models. The performances of these models validated with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values. From the study, the LSTM-NN’s are more flexible and able to develop accurate models for predicting the behavior of agricultural parameters than the ARIMA models. © 2019 Kiran Kumar Paidipati and Arjun Banik licensed to EAI.

Instead of pursuing the maximum yield, most turfgrass managers use nitrogen (N) to maintain a sub-maximal growth rate. Few tools or soil tests exist to help managers guide N fertilizer decisions. Turf growth prediction models have the potential to be useful, but the currently existing turf growth prediction model only takes temperature into account, limiting its accuracy. This study developed machine-learning-based turf growth models using the random forest (RF) algorithm to estimate short-term turfgrass clipping yield. To build the RF model, a large set of variables were extracted as predictors including the 7-day weather, traffic intensity, soil moisture content, N fertilization rate, and the normalized difference red edge (NDRE) vegetation index. In this study, the data were collected from two putting greens where the turfgrass received 0 to 1,800 round/week traffic rates, various irrigation rates to maintain the soil moisture content between 9 and 29%, and N fertilization rates of 0 to 17.5 kg ha–1 applied biweekly. The RF model agreed with the actual clipping yield collected from the experimental results. The temperature and relative humidity were the most important weather factors. Including NDRE improved the prediction accuracy of the model. The highest coefficient of determination (R2) of the RF model was 0.64 for the training dataset and was 0.47 for the testing data set upon the evaluation of the model. This represented a large improvement over the existing growth prediction model (R2 = 0.01). However, the machine-learning models created were not able to accurately predict the clipping production at other locations. Individual golf courses can create customized growth prediction models using clipping volume to eliminate the deviation caused by temporal and spatial variability. Overall, this study demonstrated the feasibility of creating machine-learning-based yield prediction models that may be able to guide N fertilization decisions on golf course putting greens and presumably other turfgrass areas. © Copyright © 2021 Zhou and Soldat.","machine learning; nitrogen management; random forest; turfgrass; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

As these variables are important to developing an overall precision farming model, we propose a machine learning approach to predict DM, PH, and GY for soybean cultivars based on multispectral bands. The field experiment considered 524 genotypes of soybeans in the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 growing seasons and a multitemporal–multispectral dataset collected by embedded sensor in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We proposed a multilayer deep learning regression network, trained during 2000 epochs using an adaptive subgradient method, a random Gaussian initialization, and a 50% dropout in the first hidden layer for regularization. Three different scenarios, including only spectral bands, only vegetation indices, and spectral bands plus vegetation indices, were adopted to infer each variable (PH, DM, and GY). The DL model performance was compared against shallow learning methods such as random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and linear regression (LR). The results indicate that our approach has the potential to predict soybean-related variables using multispectral bands only. Both DL and RF models presented a strong (r surpassing 0.77) prediction capacity for the PH variable, regardless of the adopted input variables group. Our results demonstrated that the DL model (r = 0.66) was superior to predict DM when the input variable was the spectral bands. For GY, all machine learning models evaluated presented similar performance (r ranging from 0.42 to 0.44) for each tested scenario. In conclusion, this study demonstrated an efficient approach to a computational solution capable of predicting multiple important soybean crop variables based on remote sensing data. Future research could benefit from the information presented here and be implemented in subsequent processes related to soybean cultivars or other types of agronomic crops. © 2021 by the authors.

Understanding and quantifying the temporal cumulative effect of crop growth and spatial variances across different regions remains challenging for large-scale crop yield estimation. In this study, a deep spatial-temporal learning framework, named DeepCropNet (DCN), has been developed to hierarchically capture the features for county-level corn yield estimation. The temporal features are learned by an attention-based long short-term memory network and the spatial features are learned by the multi-task learning (MTL) output layers. The DCN model has been applied to quantify the relationship between meteorological factors and the county-level corn yield in the US Corn Belt from 1981 to 2016. Three meteorological factors, including growing degree days, killing degree days, and precipitation, are used as time-series inputs. The results show that DCN provides an improved estimation accuracy (RMSE = 0.82 Mg ha-1) as compared to that of conventional methods such as LASSO (RMSE = 1.14 Mg ha-1) and Random Forest (RMSE = 1.05 Mg ha-1). Temporally, the attention values computed from the temporal learning module indicate that DCN captures the temporal cumulative effect and this temporal pattern is consistent across all states. Spatially, the spatial learning module improves the estimation accuracy based on the regional specific features captured by the MTL mechanism. The study highlights that the DCN model provides a promising spatial-temporal learning framework for corn yield estimation under changing meteorological conditions across large spatial regions. © 2020 The Author(s).

Owing to wheat importance in food, wheat demand is increasing continuously. Wheat yield is committed to the availability of water supply. Due to climatic and environmental variations of different countries, water supply is not available in constant and desire quantity that is necessary for better wheat yield. So, there is a strong relationship and dependency that exists between water supply and wheat yield. Therefore, water supply is becoming an issue because it directly effects wheat yield. In this research, a Principle Lasso Radial (PLR) model is proposed using Machine Learning technique to measure the effect of water supply on wheat yield. In this Principle Lasso Radial (PLR) model, various experiments are conducted with respect to the performance metrics, i.e. relative water contents, waxiness, grain per spike and plant height. Principle Lasso Radial (PLR) model's produced reduced dimensional data with respect to performance metrics.

Several researchers have investigated cropping operations’ role in mycotoxin contamination, but these findings were inconclusive, precluding their use in predictive modeling. In this study a machine learning (ML) approach was considered, which included weather-based mechanistic model predictions for AFLA-maize and FER-maize [predicting aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and fumonisins (FBs), respectively], and cropping system factors as the input variables. The occurrence of AFB1 and FBs in maize fields was recorded, and their corresponding cropping system data collected, over the years 2005–2018 in northern Italy. Two deep neural network (DNN) models were trained to predict, at harvest, which maize fields were contaminated beyond the legal limit with AFB1 and FBs. Both models reached an accuracy &gt;75% demonstrating the ML approach added value with respect to classical statistical approaches (i.e., simple or multiple linear regression models). The improved predictive performance compared with that obtained for AFLA-maize and FER-maize was clearly demonstrated.

It is critical to complete this activity with high precision at the regional and national levels to facilitate speedy decision-making. Tea is a big cash crop that contributes significantly to economic development, with a market of USD 200 billion in 2020 that is expected to reach over USD 318 billion by 2025. As a developing country, Bangladesh can be a greater part of this industry and increase its exports through its tea yield and production with favorable climatic features and land quality. Regrettably, the tea yield in Bangladesh has not increased significantly since 2008 like many other countries, despite having suitable climatic and land conditions, which is why quantifying the yield is imperative.

This study used satellite-derived hydro-meteorological variables between 1981 and 2020 from twenty stations across Bangladesh to address the spatiotemporal dependency of the predictor variables for the tea yield (Y). The results illustrated that the proposed DRS-RF hybrid model improved tea yield forecasting over other standalone machine learning approaches, with the least relative error value (11%).

We have used onion weight on growth stages as the response variable and six environmental factors such as average temperature, average ground temperature, rainfall, wind speed, sunshine, and humidity as the explanatory variables in the functional regression model. We then define a least minimum integral squared residual (LMISE) measure to obtain an estimate of the function regression coefficient. In addition, a principal component regression analysis was applied to derive the estimates that minimize the defined measures. Next, to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, data were collected, and the following results were identified through analyses of the collected data. First, through graphical and correlation analysis, the ground temperature, mean temperature, and humidity have a very significant effect on the onion weights, but environmental factors such as wind speed, sunshine, and rainfall have a small negative effect on onion weights. Second, through functional regression analysis, we can determine that the ground temperature, sunshine, and precipitation have a significant effect on onion growth and are essential in the goodness-of-fit test. On the other hand, wind speed, mean temperature, and humidity did not significantly affect onion growth. In conclusion, to promote onion growth, the appropriate ground temperature and amount of sunshine are essential, the rainfall and the humidity must be low, and the appropriate wind or mean temperature must be maintained. © 2020 by the authors.","Agricultural data analysis method; Environmental factors; Functional regression model; Onion weight; Optimum cultivation strategy; R-packages",,Article,Scopus

Agricultural systems that rely on monsoon rainfall are especially vulnerable to changes in climate variability. This paper uses machine learning to deepen understanding of how monsoon variability impacts agricultural productivity. We demonstrate that random forest modelling is effective in representing rice production variability in response to monsoon weather variability. Our random forest modelling found monsoon weather predictors explain similar levels of detrended anomaly variation in both rice yield (33%) and area harvested (35%). The role of weather in explaining harvested rice area highlights that production area changes are an important pathway through which weather extremes impact agricultural productivity, which may exacerbate losses that occur through changes in per-area yields. We find that downwelling shortwave radiation flux is the most important weather variable in explaining variation in yield anomalies, with proportion of area under irrigation being the most important predictor overall. Machine learning modelling is capable of representing crop-climate variability in monsoonal agriculture and reveals additional information compared to traditional parametric models.

Accurate and timely estimation of maize yield is of great significance to crop management and food security. Commonly applied vegetation indexes (VIs) are mainly used in crop yield estimation as they can reflect the greenness of vegetation. However, the environmental pressures of crop growth and development are difficult to monitor and evaluate. Indexes for water content, pigment content, nutrient elements and biomass have been developed to indirectly explain the influencing factors of yield, with extant studies mainly assessing VIs, climate and water content factors. Only a few studies have attempted to systematically evaluate the sensitivity of these indexes. The sensitivity of the spectral indexes, combined indexes and climate factors and the effect of temporal aggregation data need to be evaluated. Thus, this study proposes a novel yield evaluation method for integrating multiple spectral indexes and temporal aggregation data. In particular, spectral indexes were calculated by integrating publicly available data (remote sensing images and climate data) from the Google Earth Engine platform, and county-level maize yields in China from 2015 to 2019 were estimated using a random forest model. Results showed that the normalized moisture difference index (NMDI) is the index most sensitive to yield estimation. Furthermore, the potential of adopting the combined indexes, especially NMDI_NDNI, was verified. Compared with the whole-growth period data and the eight-day time series, the vegetative growth period and the reproductive growth period data were more sensitive to yield estimation. The maize yield in China can be estimated by integrating multiple spectral indexes into the indexes for the vegetative and reproductive growth periods. The obtained R2 of maize yield estimation reached 0.8. This study can provide feature knowledge and references for index assessments for yield estimation research. © 2023 by the authors.","combined index; maize yield; multiple spectral indexes; temporal aggregation; yield estimation","Climate models; Crops; Data integration; Earth (planet); Food supply; Forestry; Remote sensing; %moisture; Combined indices; Growth period; Maize yield; Multiple spectral index; Reproductive growth; Spectral indices; Temporal aggregation; Vegetation index; Yield estimation; Vegetation",Article,Scopus

Therefore, it is essential to provide appropriate solutions to increase water productivity (WP). As an element of research, this study presents a hybrid machine learning approach and investigates its potential for estimating date palm crop yield and WP under different levels of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI). The amount of applied water in the SDI system was compared at three levels of 125% (T1), 100% (T2), and 75% (T3) of water requirement. The proposed ACVO-ANFIS approach is composed of an anti-coronavirus optimization algorithm (ACVO) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Since the effect of irrigation factors, climate, and crop characteristics are not equal in estimating the WP and yield, the importance of these factors should be measured in the estimation phase. To fulfill this aim, ACVO-ANFIS employed eight different feature combination models based on irrigation factors, climate, and crop characteristics. The proposed approach was evaluated on a benchmark dataset that contains information about the groves of Behbahan agricultural research station located in southeast Khuzestan, Iran. The results explained that the treatment T3 advanced data palm crop yield by 3.91 and 1.31%, and WP by 35.50 and 20.40 kg/m3, corresponding to T1 and T2 treatments, respectively. The amount of applied water in treatment T3 was 7528.80 m3/ha, which suggests a decrease of 5019.20 and 2509.6 m3/ha of applied water compared to the T1 and T2 treatments. The modeling results of the ACVO-ANFIS approach using a model with factors of crop variety, irrigation (75% water requirement of SDI system), and effective rainfall achieved RMSE = 0.005, δ = 0.603, and AICC = 183.25.

Despite the clarity of influential factors and deriving forces, estimation of the volumetric irrigation demand using biophysical models is prohibitively difficult. Data-driven models have proven their ability to predict geophysical and hydrological phenomena with only a handful of influential input variables; however, the lack of reliable input data in most agricultural regions of the world hinders the effectiveness of these approaches. Attempting to estimate the irrigation water demand, we first analyze the correlation of potential influencing variables with irrigation water. We develop machine learning models to predict California’s annual, county-level irrigation water demand based on the statistical analysis findings over an 18-year time span. Input variables are different combinations of deriving meteorological forces, geographical characteristics, cropped area, and crop category. After testing various regression machine learning approaches, the result shows that Gaussian process regression produces the best results. Our findings suggest that irrigated cropped area, air temperature, and vapor pressure deficit are the most significant variables in predicting irrigation water demand. This research also shows that Gaussian process regression can predict irrigation water demand with high accuracy (R2 higher than 0.97 and RMSE as low as 0.06 km3) with different input variable combinations. An accurate estimation of irrigation water use of various crop categories and areas can assist decision-making processes and improve water management strategies. The proposed model can help water policy makers evaluate climatological and agricultural scenarios and hence be used as a decision support tool for agricultural water management at a regional scale. © 2022 by the authors.

Machine learning methods can be used to predict crop yield based on a combination of remote sensing data and data collected by ground weather stations. This paper argues that forecasting drylands farming yield can be reliable for management purpose under uncertain conditions using machine learning methods and remote sensing data and determines which indicators are most important in predicting the yield of chickpea. In this study, the yield of rainfed chickpea farms in 11 top chickpea producing counties in Kermanshah province, Iran, was predicted using three machine learning methods, namely support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). To improve prediction accuracy, for each county, remote sensing data were overlaid by the satellite images of rainfed farms with a suitable slope and altitude for rainfed farming. An integrated database was created by combining weather data, remote sensing data, and chickpea yield statistics. The methods were evaluated using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) technique and compared in terms of multiple measures. Given the sensitivity of rainfed chickpea yield to the time of data, the predictions were made in two scenarios: (1) using the averages of the data of all growing months, and (2) using the data of a combination of months. The results showed that RF provides more accurate yield predictions than other methods. The predictions of this method were 7–8% different from the statistics reported by the Statistical Center and the Ministry of Agriculture of Iran. It was found that for pre-harvest prediction of rainfed chickpea yield, using the data of the March–April period (the averages of two months) offers the best result in terms of the correlation coefficient for the relationship between the yield and the predictor indices. © 2021 by the authors.

Crop yield forecasts can help decision makers to formulate policies on maintaining national food reserves, sustaining food supply chains and attaining national food security. Inter field crop yield heterogeneity arising from varied field management and agricultural practices necessitates this forecasting to be done at field-level. Such field level information can aid farmers to identify gaps in water and farm management practices and take corrective actions, if needed. So far, no scalable tools are available to predict crop yields at field level that leverage the availability of open-access high-resolution RS data. This research implements an operational framework to predict field level crop biomass by evaluating different regression algorithms to develop data driven models, leveraging historical and near real time open-access high resolution optical satellite data from Sentinel-2, radar data from Sentinel-1 and evapotranspiration (ETa) and Net Primary Production (NPP) data from Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) Water Productivity through Open-access Remotely sensed data (WaPOR) platform. NPP is used as a proxy for biomass production/yield. Five of the most commonly used regression algorithms were tested to build a data-driven model for sugarcane NPP prediction in Wonji-Shoa sugarcane estate, located in the Awash Basin, Ethiopia. The models tested were the Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR), Stepwise Multivariate Linear Regression (SMLR), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest Regression (RFR). The results revealed that for seasonal sugarcane NPP predictions, the linear regression models (MLR and SMLR) yielded more accurate predictions than the non-linear machine learning models (BRT, SVR and RFR) tested. The highest accuracy was achieved for MLR models for which estimates with 89% accuracy could be made 4 months prior to the harvest and with accuracies of 79% up to 200 days (approx. 6.5 months) before the harvest. The non-linear machine learning models, however, could not provide reliable estimates of sugarcane NPP (accuracies < 61%). Cumulative vegetation indices (VIs) were found to have higher predictive power than standard VIs for predicting future sugarcane NPP. Cumulative Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was found to be the variable with the highest predictive power, followed by VH polarized Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data and WaPOR ETa. The study shows the usefulness of high-resolution RS information to predict seasonal NPP at field level. The methods presented here can be translated into an automated framework towards an operational system. © 2022","Crop biomass prediction; Cumulated vegetation indices; Data driven models; Food security; Operational framework; Regression algorithms; Remote sensing","algorithm; biomass; crop production; data set; food security; regression analysis; remote sensing; vegetation dynamics",Article,Scopus

The introduction of remote sensing in agricultural monitoring makes accurate estimation of regional crop yields possible. However, remote sensing images and crop distribution maps with coarse spatial resolution usually cause inaccuracy in yield estimation due to the existence of mixed pixels. This study aimed to estimate the annual yields of maize and sunflower in Hetao Irrigation District in North China using 30 m spatial resolution HJ-1A/1B CCD images and high accuracy multi-year crop distribution maps. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series obtained from HJ-1A/1B CCD images was fitted with an asymmetric logistic curve to calculate daily NDVI and phenological characteristics. Eight random forest (RF) models using different predictors were developed for maize and sunflower yield estimation, respectively, where predictors of each model were a combination of NDVI series and/or phenological characteristics. We calibrated all RF models with measured crop yields at sampling points in two years (2014 and 2015), and validated the RF models with statistical yields of four counties in six years. Results showed that the optimal model for maize yield estimation was the model using NDVI series from the 120th to the 210th day in a year with 10 days’ interval as predictors, while that for sunflower was the model using the combination of three NDVI characteristics, three phenological characteristics, and two curve parameters as predictors. The selected RF models could estimate multi-year regional crop yields accurately, with the average values of root-mean-square error and the relative error of 0.75 t/ha and 6.1% for maize, and 0.40 t/ha and 10.1% for sunflower, respectively. Moreover, the yields of maize and sunflower can be estimated fairly well with NDVI series 50 days before crop harvest, which implicated the possibility of crop yield forecast before harvest. © 2018 by the authors.

More than 785,000 workers are directly employed in this activity, which represents the 26% of all jobs in the agricultural sector. Colombian coffee growers estimate the production of cherry coffee with the main aim of planning the required activities, and resources (number of workers, required infrastructures), anticipating negotiations, estimating, price, and foreseeing losses of coffee production in a specific territory. These important processes can be affected by several factors that are not easy to predict (e.g., weather variability, diseases, or plagues.). In this paper, we propose a non-destructive time series model, based on weather and crop management information, that estimate coffee production allowing coffee growers to improve their management of agricultural activities such as flowering calendars, harvesting seasons, definition of irrigation methods, nutrition calendars, and programming the times of concentration of production to define the amount of personnel needed for harvesting. The combination of time series and machine learning algorithms based on regression trees (XGBOOST, TR and RF) provides very positive results for the test dataset collected in real conditions for more than a year. The best results were obtained by the XGBOOST model (MAE = 0.03; RMSE = 0.01), and a difference of approximately 0.57% absolute to the main harvest of 2018. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

In the 2020 Syngenta crop challenge, Syngenta challenged participants to predict the yield performance of a list of potential breeding crosses of inbreds and testers based on their historical yield data in different environments. They released a dataset that contained the observed yields for 294,128 corn hybrids through the crossing of 593 unique inbreds and 496 unique testers across multiple environments between 2016 and 2018. To address this challenge, we designed a new predictive approach that integrates random forest and an optimization model for G × E interaction detection. Our computational experiment found that our approach achieved a relative root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.0869 for the validation data, outperforming other state-of-the-art models such as factorization machine and extreme gradient boosting tree.

Remote sensing (RS) and crop models are effective means to predict cotton yield in the field. The satellite vegetation indices (VIs) can describe crop yield variations over large areas but can’t take the exact environmental impact into consideration. Climate variables (CVs), the result of the influence of spatial heterogeneity in large regions, can provide environmental information for better estimation of cotton yield. In this study, the most important VIs and CVs for estimating county-level cotton yield across Xinjiang Province were screened out. We found that the VIs of canopy structure and chlorophyll contents, and the CVs of moisture, were the most significant factors for cotton growth. For yield estimation, we utilized four approaches: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO), support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR) and long short-term memory (LSTM). Due to its ability to capture temporal features over the long term, LSTM performed best, with an R2 of 0.76, root mean square error (RMSE) of 150 kg/ha and relative RMSE (rRMSE) of 8.67%; moreover, an additional 10% of the variance could be explained by adding CVs to the VIs. For the within-season yield estimation using LSTM, predictions made 2 months before harvest were the most accurate (R2 = 0.65, RMSE = 220 kg/ha, rRMSE = 15.97%). Our study demonstrated the feasibility of yield estimation and early prediction at the county level over large cotton cultivation areas by integrating satellite and environmental data.

As such, it is crucial to accurately estimate within-season yield in order to provide critical information for farm management and decision making. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to assess the most appropriate method, indices, and growth stage for predicting the groundnut yield in smallholder agricultural systems in northern Malawi. We have estimated the yield of groundnut in two smallholder farms using the observed yield and vegetation indices (VIs), which were derived from multitemporal PlanetScope satellite data. Simple linear, multiple linear (MLR), and random forest (RF) regressions were applied for the prediction. The leave-one-out cross-validation method was used to validate the models. The results showed that (i) of the modelling approaches, the RF model using the five most important variables (RF5) was the best approach for predicting the groundnut yield, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.96 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.29 kg/ha, followed by the MLR model (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 0.84 kg/ha); in addition, (ii) the best within-season stage to accurately predict groundnut yield is during the R5/beginning seed stage. The RF5 model was used to estimate the yield for four different farms. The estimated yields were compared with the total reported yields from the farms. The results revealed that the RF5 model generally accurately estimated the groundnut yields, with the margins of error ranging between 0.85% and 11%. The errors are within the post-harvest loss margins in Malawi. The results indicate that the observed yield and VIs, which were derived from open-source remote sensing data, can be applied to estimate yield in order to facilitate farming and food security planning. © 2022 by the authors.","food security; Malawi; PlanetScope; random forest regression; vegetation indices; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

Here, climate, satellite data, and meteorological indices were integrated to predict maize yield at the city-level in China from 2000 to 2015 using four machine learning approaches, e.g., cubist, random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost), and support vector machine (SVM). The climate variables included the diffuse flux of photosynthetic active radiation (PDf), the diffuse flux of shortwave radiation (SDf), the direct flux of shortwave radiation (SDr), minimum temperature (Tmn), potential evapotranspiration (Pet), vapor pressure deficit (Vpd), vapor pressure (Vap), and wet day frequency (Wet). Satellite data, including the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), were used. Meteorological indices, including growing degree day (GDD), extreme degree day (EDD), and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), were used. The results showed that integrating all climate, satellite data, and meteorological indices could achieve the highest accuracy. The highest estimated correlation coefficient (R) values for the cubist, RF, SVM, and Xgboost methods were 0.828, 0.806, 0.742, and 0.758, respectively. The climate, satellite data, or meteorological indices inputs from all growth stages were essential for maize yield prediction, especially in late growth stages. R improved by about 0.126, 0.117, and 0.143 by adding climate data from the early, peak, and late-period to satellite data and meteorological indices from all stages via the four machine learning algorithms, respectively. R increased by 0.016, 0.016, and 0.017 when adding satellite data from the early, peak, and late stages to climate data and meteorological indices from all stages, respectively.

In this study, a crop-growth model was integrated with time series of remotely sensed data through deep learning (DL) methods to improve the accuracy of regional wheat-yield estimations in Henan Province, China. Firstly, the time series of moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were input into the long short-term memory network (LSTM) model to identify the wheat-growing region, which was further used to estimate wheat areas at the municipal and county levels. Then, the leaf area index (LAI) and grain-yield time series simulated by the Crop Environment REsource Synthesis for Wheat (CERES-Wheat) model were used to train and evaluate the LSTM, one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D CNN) and random forest (RF) models, respectively. Finally, an exponential model of the relationship between the field-measured LAI and MODIS NDVI was applied to obtain the regional LAI, which was input into the trained LSTM, 1-D CNN and RF models to estimate wheat yields within the wheat-growing region. The results showed that the linear correlations between the estimated wheat areas and the statistical areas were significant at both the municipal and county levels. The LSTM model provided more accurate estimates of wheat yields, with higher R2 values and lower root mean square error (RMSE) and mean relative error (MRE) values than the 1-D CNN and RF models. The LSTM model has an inherent advantage in capturing phenological information contained in the time series of the MODIS-derived LAI, which is important for satellite-based crop-yield estimates. © 2021 by the authors.

Accurate and timely estimation of the sugarcane yield before harvest plays a particularly important role in the management of agroecosystems. The rapid development of remote sensing technologies, especially Light Detecting and Ranging (LiDAR), significantly enhances aboveground fresh weight (AFW) estimations. In our study, we evaluated the capability of LiDAR mounted on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in estimating the sugarcane AFW in Fusui county, Chongzuo city of Guangxi province, China. We measured the height and the fresh weight of sugarcane plants in 105 sampling plots, and eight variables were extracted from the field-based measurements. Six regression algorithms were used to build the sugarcane AFW model: multiple linear regression (MLR), stepwise multiple regression (SMR), generalized linear model (GLM), generalized boosted model (GBM), kernel-based regularized least squares (KRLS), and random forest regression (RFR). The results demonstrate that RFR (R2 = 0.96, RMSE = 1.27 kg m−2) performs better than other models in terms of prediction accuracy. The final fitted sugarcane AFW distribution maps exhibited good agreement with the observed values (R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 1.33 kg m−2). Canopy cover, the distance to the road, and tillage methods all have an impact on sugarcane AFW.

Here we present a thorough assessment of county-level maize yield prediction in U.S. Midwest using six statistical/machine learning algorithms (Lasso, Support Vector Regressor, Random Forest, XGBoost, Long-short term memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)) and an extensive set of environmental variables derived from satellite observations, weather data, land surface model results, soil maps, and crop progress reports. Results show that seasonal crop yield forecasting benefits from both more advanced algorithms and a large composite of information associated with crop canopy, environmental stress, phenology, and soil properties (i.e. hundreds of features). The XGBoost algorithm outperforms other algorithms both in accuracy and stability, while deep neural networks such as LSTM and CNN are not advantageous. The compositing interval (8-day, 16-day or monthly) of time series variable does not have significant effects on the prediction. Combining the best algorithm and inputs improves the prediction accuracy by 5% when compared to a baseline statistical model (Lasso) using only basic climatic and satellite observations. Reasonable county-level yield foresting is achievable from early June, almost four months prior to harvest. At the national level, early-season (June and July) prediction from the best model outperforms that of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE).

Simulation crop models can assist in scenario planning, but their use is limited because of data requirements and long runtimes. Thus, there is a need for more computationally expedient approaches to scale up predictions. We evaluated the potential of four machine learning (ML) algorithms (LASSO Regression, Ridge Regression, random forests, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and their ensembles) as meta-models for a cropping systems simulator (APSIM) to inform future decision support tool development. We asked: (1) How well do ML meta-models predict maize yield and N losses using pre-season information? (2) How many data are needed to train ML algorithms to achieve acceptable predictions? (3) Which input data variables are most important for accurate prediction? And (4) do ensembles of ML meta-models improve prediction? The simulated dataset included more than three million data including genotype, environment and management scenarios. XGBoost was the most accurate ML model in predicting yields with a relative mean square error (RRMSE) of 13.5%, and Random forests most accurately predicted N loss at planting time, with a RRMSE of 54%. ML meta-models reasonably reproduced simulated maize yields using the information available at planting, but not N loss. They also differed in their sensitivities to the size of the training dataset. Across all ML models, yield prediction error decreased by 10%-40% as the training dataset increased from 0.5 to 1.8 million data points, whereas N loss prediction error showed no consistent pattern. ML models also differed in their sensitivities to input variables (weather, soil properties, management, initial conditions), thus depending on the data availability researchers may use a different ML model. Modest prediction improvements resulted from ML ensembles.

Constructing a spatiotemporal dataset requires multiple UAV image mosaics taken at different times. Because the weather or a UAV flight trajectory is subject to change when the images are taken, the mosaics are typically unaligned. This paper proposes a two-step approach, composed of global and local alignments, for spatiotemporal alignment of two wide-area UAV mosaics of high resolution. The first step, global alignment, finds a projection matrix that initially maps keypoints in the source mosaic onto matched counterparts in the target mosaic. The next step, local alignment, refines the result of the global alignment. The proposed method splits input mosaics into patches and applies individual transformations to each patch to enhance the remaining local misalignments at patch level. Such independent local alignments may result in new artifacts at patch boundaries. The proposed method uses a simple yet effective technique to suppress those artifacts without harming the benefit of the local alignment. Extensive experiments validate the proposed method by using several datasets for highland fields and plains in South Korea. Compared with a recent work, the proposed method improves the accuracy of alignment by up to 13.21% over the datasets. © 2023 by the authors.","image alignment; smart agriculture; spatiotemporal image; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)",,Article,Scopus

We investigated the most appropriate ML regressors for exploring LAI estimations of barley and wheat through the relationships between the LAI values and four vegetation indices. After analysing ten ML regression models, we concluded that the gradient boost (GB) regressor most effectively estimated the LAI for both barley and wheat. Furthermore, the GB regressor outperformed the DNN regressor, with model efficiencies of 0.89 for barley and 0.45 for wheat. Additionally, we verified that it would be possible to simulate LAI using proximal and remote sensing data based on assimilating the DNN and ML regressors into a process-based mathematical crop model.

Nutrient management involving rice has been a matter of interest for a long time owing to the unique production environment of rice. In this research, an artificial neural network-based prediction model was developed to understand the role of individual nutrients (N, P, K, Zn, and S) on different plant parameters (plant height, tiller number, dry matter production, leaf area index, grain yield, and straw yield) of rice. A feed-forward neural network with back-propagation training was developed using the neural network (nnet) toolbox available in Matlab. For the training of the model, data obtained from two consecutive crop seasons over two years (a total of four crops of rice) were used. Nutrients interact with each other, and the resulting effect is an outcome of such interaction; hence, understanding the role of individual nutrients under field conditions becomes difficult. In the present study, an attempt was made to understand the role of individual nutrients in achieving crop growth and yield using an artificial neural network-based prediction model. The model predicts that growth parameters such as plant height, tiller number, and leaf area index often achieve their maximum performance at below the maximum applied dose, while the maximum yield in most cases is achieved at 100% N, P, K, Zn, and S dose. In addition, the present study attempted to understand the impact of individual nutrients on both plant growth and yield in order to optimize nutrient recommendation and nutrient management, thereby minimizing environmental pollution and wastage of nutrients. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial neural network; crop performance; digital agriculture; plant nutrients; rice",,Article,Scopus

In this work, we developed an unprecedented optimized framework for the MODIS-based mid-season corn yield forecasting over five producing states of the United States: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, and Ohio. We evaluated Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)-based forecasts under different schemes accounting for: different machine learning techniques with a mid-season composite or multi-temporal composites as inputs, four (county-, district-, state-, and global-based) training domains, and 16-day composites versus daily interpolated composites involving the day of pixels as predictors. Under the best identified scheme, we compared the EVI-based forecasts with those based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Leaf area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetic Active Radiation (FPAR). EVI and NDVI were transformed to LAI (named as LAIEVI and LAINDVI) as predictors for producing EVI- and NDVI-based forecasts. We evaluated both county- and state-level forecasts using the percent error (PE), mean absolute PE (MAPE) and determination coefficient (R2). The linear regression models driven by the single latest composite in mid-season often outperformed elastic net and random forest models driven by multi-temporal composites. The forecast performance decreased with longer subsets of EVI composites being used. The performance under the different training domains varied by states and forecast level (county or state), although the changes within states were mostly non-significant except in Nebraska. The forecasts based on 16-day and daily composites performed similarly, indicating that the use of information about the day of pixel composite provides no additional benefit to the yield forecast. For the best EVI-based schemes, the medium annual MAPE (PE) at the county (state) level varied between 6.1% (2.4%) and 7.7% (5.3%) across states while the medium annual R2 (interannual R2) varied between 0.54 (0.59) and 0.82 (0.86). Results suggested that, while EVI was, in general, the best predictor for the Corn Belt as a whole, the adequacy of the EVI- and NDVI-based forecasts varied by states and largely exceeded that of the LAI- and FPAR-based forecasts. Compared with the EVI-based forecasts, the NDVI-based forecasts performed better in Iowa (MAPE's 0.9% and 1.43% lower at the county and state level), similar in Nebraska and worse in the other states. Overall, the best state-level forecasts consistently outperformed concurrent National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) forecasts. © 2020 The Authors","Crop yield forecast; Enhanced vegetation index; Leaf area index; Machine learning; MODIS; The Corn Belt","crop yield; decision making; leaf area index; machine learning; MODIS; optimization; vegetation index; Illinois; Indiana; Iowa; Nebraska; Ohio; United States",Article,Scopus

Landsat satellite images of three different years 1990, 2000 and 2018 over 28 years were acquired from Global Land Cover Facility Site (GLCF) and earth explorer. Land suitability for agriculture use was assessed on five criteria; rainfall, temperature, slope percentage, soil types and water Wells distribution. The different geospatial layers were transferred using suitability coding system to produce the suitability maps for rainfed and irrigated areas using weighted overlay method. Ma'an Governorate covers approximately 37% of the total area of Jordan, and consists mostly of uncultivated land 33304.66 km2 (99.49%).

Under the FASAL project, the jute acreage estimation was carried out in the last 6 years by using both microwave SAR data (2012-13 to 2016-17) and high resolution optical multi-spectral data (2017-18). In the assessment using SAR data, hierarchical decision rule classification technique and for optical data hybrid classification approach was used. Yield was estimated using, agro-meteorological parameter based statistical models. In the present study, different statistical parameters such as correlation coefficient (r) and RMSE were used for evaluating and comparing the results of the last 6 years (2012-13 to 2017-18) with DES (government) estimates. The RMSE values over the years were found to be 7-20%and 5-13% for area and production, respectively. The correlation coefficient (r) over the years between DES and FASAL estimates ranging between 0.995 to 1.00 and 0.996 to 1.00 in acreage and production estimates respectively. At district level, the correlation coefficient (r) values for the area and production were 0.967 and 0.962 respectively. On the basis of statistical criteria used in this study, FASAL estimates were close to DES estimates and improved over the years. The FASAL jute production estimates could be called better than DES ones in terms of good accuracy, timely reporting and low labour intensive.

Monitoring salt affected areas and assessing land cover changes, which caused by salinization, can be an effective approach to rehabilitate saline soils and prevent further salinization of agricultural fields. Using potential of satellite imagery taken over time along with remote sensing techniques, makes it possible to determine salinity changes at regional scales. This study deals with monitoring salinity changes and trend of the expansion in different land cover types of Bakhtegan Salt Lake district during the last two decades using multi-temporal Landsat images. For this purpose, per-pixel trend analysis of soil salinity during years 2000 to 2016 was performed and slope index maps of the best salinity indicators were generated for each pixel in the scene. The results of this study revealed that vegetation indices (GDVI and EVI) and also salinity indices (SI-1 and SI-3) have great potential to assess soil salinity trends in vegetation and bare soil lands respectively due to more sensitivity to salt features over years of study. In addition, images of May had the best performance to highlight changes in pixels among different months of the year. A comparative analysis of different slope index maps shows that more than 76% of vegetated areas have experienced negative trends during 17 years, of which about 34% are moderately and highly saline. This percent is increased to 92% for bare soil lands and 29% of salt affected soils had severe salinization. It can be concluded that the areas, which are close to the lake, are more affected by salinity and salts from the lake were brought into the soil which will lead to loss of soil productivity ultimately.","Land covers; Landsat time series data; Per-pixel trend analysis; Salinity indicators; Slope index; Soil salinity","Lakes; Maps; Pixels; Productivity; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Time series; Time series analysis; Vegetation; Weathering; Land cover; Landsat time series; Slope index; Soil salinity; Trend analysis; Soils",Conference Paper,Scopus

Automation of fruit recognition for the captured top-view of RGB based images using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a challenge. Image analysis demonstrated the difficulty of processing the captured image under variant illumination in natural environment and with textured objects of non-ideal geometric shapes. However, this is subjected to certain consideration settings and image-processing algorithms. The study presents an automatic method for identifying and recognising the pineapple's crown images in the designated plot using image processing and further counts the detected images using machine learning classifiers namely artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), naive Bayes (NB), decision trees (DT) and k-nearest neighbours (KNN). The high spatial-resolution aerial images were pre-processed and segmented, and its extracted features were analysed according to shape, colour and texture for recognising the pineapple crown before classifying it as fruit or non-fruit. Feature fusion using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was incorporated in this study to optimise the performance of machine learning classifier. The algorithm was quantitatively analysed and validated for performance via accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and precision.

In particular, crop prediction in agriculture is critical and is chiefly contingent upon soil and environment conditions, including rainfall, humidity, and temperature. In the past, farmers were able to decide on the crop to be cultivated, monitor its growth, and determine when it could be harvested. Today, however, rapid changes in environmental conditions have made it difficult for the farming community to continue to do so. Consequently, in recent years, machine learning techniques have taken over the task of prediction, and this work has used several of these to determine crop yield. To ensure that a given machine learning (ML) model works at a high level of precision, it is imperative to employ efficient feature selection methods to preprocess the raw data into an easily computable Machine Learning friendly dataset. To reduce redundancies and make the ML model more accurate, only data features that have a significant degree of relevance in determining the final output of the model must be employed. Thus, optimal feature selection arises to ensure that only the most relevant features are accepted as a part of the model. Conglomerating every single feature from raw data without checking for their role in the process of making the model will unnecessarily complicate our model. Furthermore, additional features which contribute little to the ML model will increase its time and space complexity and affect the accuracy of the model's output. The results depict that an ensemble technique offers better prediction accuracy than the existing classification technique. © 2013 IEEE.","Agriculture; classification; crop prediction; feature selection","Classification (of information); Cultivation; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Machine learning; Agricultural environments; Crop prediction; Environment conditions; Features selection; Humidity and temperatures; Machine learning models; Prediction-based; Security; Selection techniques; Soil conditions; Crops",Article,Scopus

Accordingly, the objective of this investigation was to develop a method that can accurately define the most suitable environment in the greenhouse for an optimal yield of roses. Herein, an optimal and highly accurate BO-DNN surrogate model was developed (based on 300 experimental data points) for a quick and reliable classification of the rose yield environment considering some of the most influential variables including soil humidity, temperature and humidity of air, CO2 concentration, and light intensity (lux) into its architecture. Initially, two BO techniques (GP and GBRT) are used for the tuning process of the hyper-parameters (such as learning rate, batch size, number of dense nodes, number of dense neurons, number of input nodes, activation function, etc.). After that, an optimal and simple combination of the hyper-parameters was selected to develop a DNN algorithm based on 300 data points, which was further used to classify the rose yield environment (the rose yield environments were classified into four classes such as soil without water, correct environment, too hot, and very cold environments). The very high accuracy of the proposed surrogate model (0.98) originated from the introduction of the most vital soil and meteorological parameters as the inputs of the model. The proposed method can help in identifying intelligent greenhouse environments for efficient crop yields. © 2021 by the authors.

SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model was used within ArcGIS, to assess the hydrological situation in general, and surface runoff in particular for Galal Badra Watershed GBW (Wasit Governorate, eastern Iraq). GBW has an area of 2,655 square kilometers (89% of which is in Iran and the rest 11% within Iraq). The data set for SWAT model running were digital elevation model, slope map, soil map, LULC map, and climatic data (precipitation, relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, minimum/ maximum air temperature). SWAT simulation concluded that the annual average surface runoff in GBW was 244x106 cubic meters (with an average discharge of 7.8 M3 / s), which accounts for about 25.7% of the total precipitation. This ratio can be used in preliminary forecasting of surface runoff resulting from different amounts of precipitation. The model was not calibrated due to insufficient data available to complete the calibration process. However, the results provided by the SWAT model regarding the water balance elements in the watershed, make the SWAT model an effective tool for hydrological assessments, especially in cases where the necessary data are scarce for various reasons. Also, SWAT results can be considered as a preliminary assessment, which gives an overview of the hydrological situation of the area, contributes to building an initial perception of the water system, determining the most important elements in it, and anticipating the factors most influencing it. This enables policymakers, decision-makers, and stakeholders to adopt future plans at the level of research and implementation that will develop the reality of water investment in the region under conditions of climate extremism. © 2021, Union of Iraqi Geoogists.

At this time Greenhouse technology has been developed which is one of the technologies that support plant growth. Unfortunately, prediction technology is still done manually so the results are not accurate. This paper proposes the Neural Network Backpropagation method to evaluate the growth of plant seedlings in the greenhouse area. Data collected from the internet network system from temperature sensors, soil humidity, environmental humidity, light intensity and cameras to monitor growth. Seedling prediction is done by building a computer program using the neural network backpropagation algorithm based on time series that has input layer, hidden layer and output prediction architecture. Training data is used to carry out the training process before the program is used to perform predictions. Furthermore, the program is used to make predictions. The results of applying the neural network backpropagation algorithm to predict the growth of plant seedlings in the greenhouse get good results based on the first iteration Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0112, with computing time 0.0193 seconds and data accuracy of 92.79%, which means that the prediction generated approximates actual data for the application of backpropagation neural network algorithms to the evaluation of plant seedling growth. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Backpropagation; Forecasting; Greenhouses; Iterative methods; Mean square error; Back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN); Backpropagation neural network algorithms; Environmental humidities; Mean squared error; Network systems; Prediction technologies; Seedling growth; Training process; Multilayer neural networks",Conference Paper,Scopus

From a public health perspective, food security is an essential social determinant for promoting healthy nutrition. Food security embraces four dimensions: physical availability of food, economic and physical access to food, food utilization, and the sustainability of the dimensions above. Integrally addressing the four dimensions is vital. Surprisingly most of the works focused on a single dimension of food security: the physical availability of food. Objective: The paper proposes a multi-dimensional dataset of open data and satellite images to characterize food security in the department of Cauca, Colombia. Methods: The food security dataset integrates multiple open data sources; therefore, the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining methodology was used to guide the construction of the dataset. It includes sources such as population and agricultural census, nutrition surveys, and satellite images. Results: An open multidimensional dataset for the Department of Cauca with 926 attributes and 9 rows (each row representing a Municipality) from multiple sources in Colombia, is configured. Then, machine learning models were used to characterize food security and nutrition in the Cauca Department. As a result, The Food security index calculated for Cauca using a linear regression model (Mean Absolute Error of 0.391) is 57.444 in a range between 0 and 100, with 100 the best score. Also, an approach for extracting four features (Agriculture, Habitation, Road, Water) of satellite images were tested with the ResNet50 model trained from scratch, having the best performance with a macro-accuracy, macro-precision, macro-recall, and macro-F1-score of 91.7, 86.2, 66.91, and 74.92%, respectively. Conclusion: It shows how the CRISP-DM methodology can be used to create an open public health data repository. Furthermore, this methodology could be generalized to other types of problems requiring the creation of a dataset. In addition, the use of satellite images presents an alternative for places where data collection is challenging. The model and methodology proposed based on open data become a low-cost and effective solution that could be used by decision-makers, especially in developing countries, to support food security planning.

Rainfall, on the other hand, plays a significant role in agriculture-while an adequate amount of rainfall can be considered as a blessing, if the amount is inordinate or scant, it can ruin the entire hard work of the farmers. In this work, the rainfall dataset of the Vellore region, of Tamil Nadu, India, in the years 2021 and 2022 is forecasted using several machine learning algorithms. Feature engineering has been performed in this work in order to generate new features that remove all sorts of autocorrelation present in the data. On removal of autocorrelation, the data could be used for performing operations on the time-series data, which otherwise could only be performed on any other regular regression data. The work uses forecasting techniques like the AutoRegessive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and exponential smoothening, and then the time-series data is further worked on using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Later, regression techniques are used by manipulating the dataset. The work is benchmarked with several evaluation metrics on a test dataset, where XGBoost Regression technique outperformed the test. The uniqueness of this work is that it forecasts the daily rainfall for the year 2021 and 2022 in Vellore region. This work can be extended in the future to predict rainfall over a bigger region based on previously recorded time-series data, which can help the farmers and common people to plan accordingly and take precautionary measures. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

In addition, the efficiency of linear regression, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques are examined with the use of indices in yield estimation. In this context, yield data of 48 sunflower parcels were obtained in 2018. The obtained results showed that both NDVI and NDVIred can be used to estimate the yield of sunflowers. The best results were obtained from the combination of the NDVI and the CNN technique with the RMSE equal to 20,874 Kg/da on 30 June 2018.

Three transfer learning methods, namely, fine-tuned DeepLab V3+, SegNet, and fully convolutional network-8s (FCN-8s), were utilized to detect clover fractions (on an area basis). The detected clover fraction (CFdetected), together with auxiliary variables, viz., measured clover height (Hclover) and grass height (Hgrass), were used to build multiple linear regression (MLR) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) models for BC estimation. A total of 347 clover–grass images were used to build the estimation model on clover fraction and BC. Of the 347 samples, 226 images were augmented to 904 images for training, 25 were selected for validation, and the remaining 96 samples were used as an independent dataset for testing. Testing results showed that the intersection-over-union (IoU) values based on the DeepLab V3+, SegNet, and FCN-8s were 0.73, 0.57, and 0.60, respectively. The root mean square error (RMSE) values for the three transfer learning methods were 8.5, 10.6, and 10.0%. Subsequently, models based on BPNN and MLR were built to estimate BC, by using either CFdetected only or CFdetected, grass height, and clover height all together. Results showed that BPNN was generally superior to MLR in terms of estimating BC. The BPNN model only using CFdetected had a RMSE of 8.7%. In contrast, the BPNN model using all three variables (CFdetected, Hclover, and Hgrass) as inputs had an RMSE of 6.6%, implying that DeepLab V3+ together with BPNN can provide good estimation of BC and can offer a promising method for improving forage management. © Copyright © 2021 Sun, Liang, Zuo, Parsons, Morel, Shi, Wang, Luo, Zhao, Fang, He and Zhou.","back propagation neural network; crop species classification; DeepLab V3+; forage crop; transfer learning",,Article,Scopus

Temperature, radiation, water availability and other environmental conditions influence crop growth, development, and final grain yield in a complex nonlinear manner. Machine learning (ML) techniques, and deep learning (DL) methods in particular, can account for such nonlinear relations between yield and its covariates. However, they typically lack transparency and interpretability, since the way the predictions are derived is not directly evident. Yet, in the context of yield forecasting, understanding which are the underlying factors behind both a predicted loss or gain is of great relevance. Here, we explore how to benefit from the increased predictive performance of DL methods while maintaining the ability to interpret how the models achieve their results. To do so, we applied a deep neural network to multivariate time series of vegetation and meteorological data to estimate the wheat yield in the Indian Wheat Belt. Then, we visualized and analyzed the features and yield drivers learned by the model with the use of regression activation maps. The DL model outperformed other tested models (ridge regression and random forest) and facilitated the interpretation of variables and processes that lead to yield variability. The learned features were mostly related to the length of the growing season, and temperature and light conditions during this time. For example, our results showed that high yields in 2012 were associated with low temperatures accompanied by sunny conditions during the growing period. The proposed methodology can be used for other crops and regions in order to facilitate application of DL models in agriculture. © 2020 The Author(s).

Linear regression is an old data processing tool, and artificial neural networks are a comparatively new one. The goal of the study was to determine whether artificial neural networks are more accurate than linear regression in sweet corn yield prediction. In the study we used a dataset obtained from field experiments on the technological improvement of sweet corn cultivation. The field experiments were conducted during the period from 2014 to 2016 on dark-chestnut soil under drip irrigated conditions in the Steppe Zone of Ukraine. We studied the impact of the moldboard plowing depths, mineral fertilizer application rates and plant densities on the crop yield. A significant impact of all the studied factors on the sweet corn productivity was proved by using the analysis of variance. The highest yield of sweet corn ears without husks (10.93 t ha–1) was under the moldboard plowing at the depth of 20–22 cm, mineral fertilizers application rate of N120P120, plant density of 65,000 plants ha–1. Data processing by using the linear regression and artificial neural network methods showed that the latter is a great deal better than linear regression in sweet corn yield prediction. Higher accuracy of the artificial neural network prediction was proved by the higher value of the coefficient of determination (R2) – 0.978, in comparison to 0.897 for the linear regression prediction model. We conclude that artificial neural networks are a much better data processing tool, especially, in the life sciences and for prediction of the non-linear natural processes and phenomena. The main disadvantage of the neural network models is their “black box” nature. However, linear regression will not lose its popularity among scientists in the nearest future. Linear regression is a much simpler data analysis tool, it is easier to perform the prediction, but it still provides a sufficiently high level of accuracy. © 2018 Oles Honchar Dnipro National University.

This study aimed to make a variable fertilization map in a commercial plot where there is no data from a yield monitor, combining machine learning techniques and farmer’s knowledge. In addition to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from Sentinel-2 and a digital elevation model (DEM), information captured by a yield monitor in 2019 was used to train and validate models. Among the 15 algorithms trained, the best result was obtained by the random forest (RF), with an RMSE of 496 and R2 of 0.90. Using the “leave one out” technique, the capacity to predict an entire plot was tested. Finally, the RF algorithm was tested on a 12-hectare wheat plot where no yield data were available. The novelty of this work lies in the collaborative work developed between farmers and researchers to implement the VRF technique in plots where precise yield data do not exist and in the “leave one out” validation. The collaboration between scientists and farmers resulted in a very positive exchange of information that allowed the farmer to change the fertilization strategy of the whole farm and the scientists to better understand how soil properties and plot history affect yield. © 2022 by the authors.","NDVI; nitrogen fertilization; on-farm experimentation; precision agriculture; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

It is an important baseline observation that is used for ensuring regional and global food security. In this study, a novel deep learning framework was developed for winter wheat yield estimation using meteorological data and two remotely sensed indices, Vegetation Temperature Condition Index (VTCI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) at the main growth stages of winter wheat in the Guanzhong Plain. The proposed deep learning model was based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network with an attention mechanism (ALSTM), which the main idea is to assign attention to the key parts of the input sequence that affect the target vectors so that the specific features can be accurately extracted. The ALSTM model provided an improved estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.63, MAPE = 8.20%, RMSE = 502.71 kg/ha, NRMSE = 11.15%) as compared with the LSTM (R2 = 0.55, MAPE = 13.46%, RMSE = 699.92 kg/ha, NRMSE = 15.52%). A validation based on leave-one-year-out-validation further substantiated the robustness of ALSTM with smaller values of NRMSE and MAPE (13.63% and 11.54%). We demonstrated that the ALSTM model provided good generalization ability for sampling sites under different farming systems, including irrigation and rain-fed sampling sites. In addition, we evaluated the relative importance of each input variable in determining yields based on stepwise sensitivity analysis. It was found that LAI at the heading-filling stage and the milk stage as well as VTCI at the jointing stage contributed more than other input feature variables towards the corresponding yield. In conclusion, our findings highlighted that the attention mechanism helped to improve the interpretability of neural networks and the ALSTM model along with remotely sensed biophysical indices can provide a reliable and robust estimation of crop yield. An accurate estimation of wheat yield is not only helping towards informed crop management decisions but it will improve efficiency and sustainability of farming operations. © 2021 The Authors","Leaf Area Index (LAI); Long short-term memory with an attention mechanism (ALSTM); Vegetation Temperature Condition Index (VTCI); Winter wheat; Yield estimation","crop yield; leaf area index; machine learning; meteorology; remote sensing; vegetation index; wheat; China; Guanzhong Plain; Shaanxi",Article,Scopus

The protein content of pea is characterized by a high lysine content and low allergenicity. This has made consumers appreciate peas increasingly in recent years, not only for their taste, but also for their nutritional value. An important element of pea cultivation is the ability to predict protein content, even before harvest. The aim of this research was to develop a linear and a non-linear model for predicting the percentage of protein content in pea seeds and to perform a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of these models. The analysis also focused on identifying the variables with the greatest impact on protein content. The research included the method of machine learning (artificial neural networks) and multiple linear regression (MLR). The input parameters of the models were weather, agronomic and phytophenological data from 2016–2020. The predictive properties of the models were verified using six ex-post forecast measures. The neural model (N1) outperformed the multiple regression (RS) model. The N1 model had an RMS error magnitude of 0.838, while the RS model obtained an average error value of 2.696. The MAPE error for the N1 and RS models was 2.721 and 8.852, respectively. The sensitivity analysis performed for the best neural network showed that the independent variables most influencing the protein content of pea seeds were the soil abundance of magnesium, potassium and phosphorus. The results presented in this work can be useful for the study of pea crop management. In addition, they can help preserve the country’s protein security. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial neural networks; multiple linear regression; pea; protein prediction; sensitivity analysis; weather conditions",,Article,Scopus

Here, multiple machine learning (ML) techniques are employed to predict sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) seed yields (SSY) using agro-morphological features. Various ML models were applied, coupled with the PCA (principal component analysis) method to compare them with the original ML models, in order to evaluate the prediction efficiency. The Gaussian process regression (GPR) and radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) models exhibited the most accurate SSY predictions, with determination coefficients, or R2 values, of 0.99 and 0.91, respectfully. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) obtained using the ML models ranged between 0 and 0.30 t/ha (metric tons/hectare) for the varied modeling process phases. The estimation of the sesame seed yield with the coupled PCA-ML models improved the performance accuracy. According to the k-fold process, we utilized the datasets with the lowest error rates to ensure the continued accuracy of the GPR and RBF models.

Therefore, the implementation of efficient nutrient management stratigies is important for food security and environmental safety. Amongst the essential plant nutrients, managing nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) based production systems is citically important to maximize profitable production with minimal negative environmental impacts. We investigated the effects of different fertilizer-N (viz. 0–240 kg N ha-1; N0-N240) and fertilizer-K (viz. 0–90 kg K ha-1; K0-K90) application rates on wheat productivity, nutrient (N and K) use efficiency viz. partial factor productivity (PFPN/K), agronomic efficiency (AEN/K), physiological efficiency (PEN/K), reciprocal internal use efficiency (RIUEN/K), and profitability in terms of benefit-cost (B-C) ratio, gross returns above fertilizer cost (GRAFC) and the returns on investment (ROI) on fertilizer application. These results revealed that wheat productivity, plant growth and yield attributes, nutrients uptake and use efficiency increased significantly (p&lt;0.05)with fertilizer-N application, although the interaction effect of N x K application was statistically non-significant (p&lt;0.05). Fertilizer-N application at 120 kg N ha-1 (N120) increased the number of effective tillers (8.7%), grain yield (17.3%), straw yield (15.1%), total N uptake (25.1%) and total K uptake (16.1%) than the N80. Fertilizer-N application significantly increased the SPAD reading by ~4.2–10.6% with fertilizer-N application (N80N240), compared with N0. The PFPN and PFPK increased significantly with fertilizer-N and K application in wheat. The AEN varied between 12.3 and 22.2 kg kg-1 with significantly higher value of 20.8 kg kg-1 in N120. Fertilizer-N application at higher rate (N160) significantly decreased the AEN by ~16.3% over N120. The N120treatment increased the AEK by ~52.6% than N80 treatment. Similarly the RIUEN varied between 10.6 and 25.6 kg Mg-1 grain yield, and increased significantly by ~80.2% with N120 as compared to N0 treatment. The RIUEK varied between 109 and 15.1 kg Mg-1 grain yield, and was significantly higher in N120 treatment. The significant increase in mean gross returns (MGRs) by ~17.3% and mean net returns (MNRs) by ~24.1% increased the B-C ratio by ~15.1% with N120 than the N80 treatment. Fertilizer-N application in N120 treatment increased the economic efficiency of wheat by ~24.1% and GRAFC by ~16.9%. Grain yield was significantly correlated with total N uptake (r = 0.932**, p&lt;0.01), K uptake (r = 0.851**), SPAD value (r = 0.945**), green seeker reading (r = 0.956**), and the RIUEN (r = 0.910**).

Several experiments with transfer of weights from a particular layer to other layers are conducted to analyse how the classification is affected by moving weights into particular layer in a particular position. This paper, for the first time tries to investigate the importance of individual layers in a neural network through systematic experimental evaluation. Experiments are carried out using feed-forward deep neural network with different topologies. Three data sets namely MNIST, IRIS and a synthetic hierarchical data set are used for the experiments. Knowledge extraction and transfer of knowledge (through weights) experiments are performed with multiple strategies. The results indicate that the middle layer weights possess some underlying representation and has highest impact on classification accuracy.

Criteria for the drought occurrence were 1) available soil water content below 50% of available water capacity, 2) soil water content below long-term average soil water content and 3) duration of continuous drought for fifteen or more days. Standardized index of daily available soil water content was used for drought severity classification. According to the index the drought is categorized into four degrees of severity from mild to extreme drought. Cumulative sum of available soil water index was used to drought quantification throughout its duration. Normal climate period 1961- 1990 was chosen as reference period to enable historical comparison of drought severity as well as climate change impacts.

Global energy scenarios indicate a change in coal consumption trends in the future, which in turn will have commercial, geopolitical, and environmental consequences. We investigated coal consumption up to 2030 using a new hybrid method of WOANFIS (whale optimization algorithm and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system). The WOANFIS method’s performance was assessed by the MSE (Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), STD (error standard deviation), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and coefficient of correlation (R2) among the real dataset and the WOANFIS result.

Lastly, future global coal consumption was predicted up to 2030 by WOANFIS.

It is the most often eaten stable food and is in great demand in the market as the world's population continues to expand. Rice output should be boosted to fulfil the growing demand. As a result, the yield of plant crops diminishes, creating an environment conducive to the spread of infectious illnesses. To boost the production of agricultural fields, it is necessary to remove plant diseases from the environment. This study presents ways for recognising three types of rice plant diseases, as well as a healthy leaf, in rice plants. This includes image capture, image preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification of three rice plant illnesses, as well as classification of a healthy leaf, among other techniques. Following the K-means segmentation, the features are extracted utilising three criteria, which are colour, shape, and texture, to generate a final product. Colour, shape, and texture are the parameters used in the extraction of the features. It is proposed that a novel intensity-based technique is used to retrieve colour features from the infected section, whereas the form parameters of the infected section, such as the area and diameter, and the texture characteristics of the infected section are extracted using a grey-level co-occurrence matrix. The colour features are retrieved depending on the characteristics of the features. All three previous techniques were surpassed by the proposed fuzzy logic-based probabilistic neural network on a range of performance metrics, with the new network obtaining greater accuracy. Finally, the result is validated using the fivefold cross-validation method, with the final accuracy for the diseases such as bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, healthy leaf, and rice blast being 95.20 percent, 97.60 percent, 99.20 percent, and 98.40 percent, respectively, and 95.40 percent for the disease brown spot. © 2022 Anusha Preetham et al.",,"Color; Computer circuits; Crops; Diseases; Extraction; Fuzzy neural networks; Image segmentation; K-means clustering; Liquids; Textures; Brown spots; Color features; Food crops; Fractional differential; Fuzzy-Logic; Neural-networks; Plant disease; Probabilistics; Rice plants; Shape and textures; Fuzzy logic",Article,Scopus

Though right crop selection is the main boosting key to maximize crop yield by doing soil analysis and considering metrological factors, the lack of knowledge about soil fertility and crop selection is the main reason for low crop production. In the changed current climate, the farmers having primitive knowledge about conventional farming are facing challenges about making sagacious decisions on crop selection. The selection of the same crop in every seasonal cycle makes the low soil fertility. This study is aimed at making an efficient and accurate system using IoT devices and machine learning (ML) algorithms that can correctly select a crop for maximal yield. Such a system is reliable as compared to the old laboratory testing manual systems, which bear the chances of human errors. Correct selection of a crop is predominantly a priority in agricultural arena. As a contribution, we propose an ML-based model, Smart Crop Selection (SCS), which is based on data of metrological and soil factors. These factors include nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, CO2, pH, EC, temperature, humidity of soil, and rainfall. Existing IoT-based systems are not efficient as compared to our proposed model due to limited consideration of these factors. In the proposed model, real-time sensory data is sent to Firebase cloud for analysis. Its results are also visualized on the Android app. SCS ensembles the following five ML algorithms to increase performance and accuracy: Decision tree, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, and Gaussian Naïve Bayes. For rainfall prediction, a dataset containing historical data of the last fifteen years is acquired from Bahawalpur Agricultural Department. This dataset and an ML algorithm, Multiple Linear Regression leverages prediction of the rainfall in future, a much-desired information for the health of any crop.

Therefore, there is an incentive to apply it in other important domains such as agriculture. Fertilizers, electricity, chemicals, human labor, and water are the components of total energy consumption in agriculture. Yield estimates are critical for food security, crop management, irrigation scheduling, and estimating labor requirements for harvesting and storage. Therefore, estimating product yield can reduce energy consumption. Two deep learning models, Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units, have been developed for the analysis of time-series data such as agricultural datasets. In this paper, the capabilities of these models and their extensions, called Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units, to predict end-of-season yields are investigated. The models use historical data, including climate data, irrigation scheduling, and soil water content, to estimate end-of-season yield. The application of this technique was tested for tomato and potato yields at a site in Portugal. The Bidirectional Long Short-Term memory outperformed the Gated Recurrent Units network, the Long Short-Term Memory, and the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units network on the validation dataset. The model was able to capture the nonlinear relationship between irrigation amount, climate data, and soil water content and predict yield with an MSE of 0.017 to 0.039. The performance of the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory in the test was compared with the most commonly used deep learning method, the Convolutional Neural Network, and machine learning methods including a Multi-Layer Perceptrons model and Random Forest Regression. The Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory outperformed the other models with an R2 score between 0.97 and 0.99. The results show that analyzing agricultural data with the Long Short-Term Memory model improves the performance of the model in terms of accuracy. The Convolutional Neural Network model achieved the second-best performance. Therefore, the deep learning model has a remarkable ability to predict the yield at the end of the season. © 2021 by the authors.

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing offers the possibility of predicting crop yields with its advantages of flexibility and high resolution. However, most of the existing remote sensing yield estimation studies focused solely on crops but did not fully consider the influence of soil on yield formation. As an integrated system, the status of crop and soil together determines the final yield. Compared to crop-only yield prediction, the approach that additionally considers soil background information will effectively improve the accuracy and reduce bias in the results. In this study, a novel method for segmenting crop and soil spectral images based on different vegetation coverage is first proposed, in which pixels of crop and soil can be accurately identified by determining the discriminant value Q. On the basis of extracting crop and soil waveband’s information by individual pixel, an innovative approach, projected non-negative matrix factorization based on good point set and matrix cross fusion (PNMF-MCF), was developed to effectively extract and fuse the yield-related features of crop and soil. The experimental results on winter wheat show that the proposed segmentation method can accurately distinguish crop and soil pixels under complex soil background of four different growth periods. Compared with the single reflectance of crop or soil and the simple combination of crop and soil reflectance, the fused yield features spectral matrix FP obtained with PNMF−MCF achieved the best performance in yield prediction at the flowering, flag leaf and pustulation stages, with R2 higher than 0.7 in these three stages. Especially at the flowering stage, the yield prediction model based on PNMF-MCF had the highest R2 with 0.8516 and the lowest RMSE with 0.0744 kg/m2. Correlation analysis with key biochemical parameters (nitrogen and carbon, pigments and biomass) of yield formation showed that the flowering stage was the most vigorous season for photosynthesis and the most critical stage for yield prediction. This study provides a new perspective and complete framework for high-precision crop yield forecasting using UAV remote sensing technology. © 2022 by the authors.","image segmentation; projected non-negative matrix factorization; soil; spectral features fusion; unmanned aerial vehicle; winter wheat; yield prediction","Antennas; Food supply; Forecasting; Image segmentation; Matrix algebra; Non-negative matrix factorization; Pixels; Reflection; Remote sensing; Soils; Spectroscopy; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Aerial vehicle; Features fusions; Images segmentations; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Projected non-negative matrix factorization; Spectral feature; Spectral feature fusion; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Winter wheat; Yield prediction; Crops",Article,Scopus

Farmer needs awareness about his soil and the methods to improve his soil to grow the healthy crops. We propose an approach which involves deep learning and some IoT features to help our farmers. Soil parameters such as nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium (NPK), pH, organic carbon, moisture content and few more things are considered for predicting the fertility of the soil and also to predict the right crops to be grown and nutrition required for it. We have developed a deep neural network model to predict the crop which can be suitably grown in the soil. We have also implemented the other machine learning classifiers on the same collected dataset to test the accuracies of each classifier and our deep neural network model. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Therefore, one option is to combine the main feed with forages containing a high protein source at a low cost, such as Gramineae (e.g., sorghum). This study aims to estimate the harvest time of sorghum when the biomass content, nutrients, and digestibility for livestock are in good condition using a machine learning algorithm, namely a decision tree. The stages of this study include the collection of observation data in the field, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and validation. Images and field observations are the primary datasets used. These datasets become the model input for the decision tree algorithm. The results of this study are the classification model for estimating harvest time with an accuracy of 98.86% and the rule that is generated by the decision tree model, the right time to be harvested are in the condition (Day After Planting > 77.5 days AND Day After Planting ≤ 84 days AND Diameter > 26 mm) or (Day After Planting > 84 days AND Height ≤ 138.5 cm AND Leaves > 8.5 pieces) or (Day After Planting > 84 days AND Height > 138.5 cm).

They are inspired by the human brain structure and function as if they are based on interconnected nodes in which simple processing operations take place. The spectrum of neural networks application is very wide, and it also includes agriculture. Artificial neural networks are increasingly used by food producers at every stage of agricultural production and in efficient farm management. Examples of their applications include: forecasting of production effects in agriculture on the basis of a wide range of independent variables, verification of diseases and pests, intelligent weed control, and classification of the quality of harvested crops. Artificial intelligence methods support decision-making systems in agriculture, help optimize storage and transport processes, and make it possible to predict the costs incurred depending on the chosen direction of management. The inclusion of machine learning methods in the “life cycle of a farm” requires handling large amounts of data collected during the entire growing season and having the appropriate software. Currently, the visible development of precision farming and digital agriculture is causing more and more farms to turn to tools based on artificial intelligence.

The Švihov dam catchment spreads over 1200 km2 and supplies over 1.5 million people in the capital of Prague and the Central Bohemian region with drinking water. Due to intensive agricultural activities and a lack of wastewater treatment plants in small settlements, the water quality is deteriorating. As a result, corrective measures need to be taken. Technological Agency of the Czech Republic supported this research which proposes different scenarios for a reduction of water quality degradation in the dam. The Trnávka dam watershed was chosen for study purposes as it occupies one quarter of the Švihov dam watershed. Hydrological balance was established using measured data. Point and non-point sources of nutrients were determined by field research and included in a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. This study aims to propose complex watershed management to improve the state of the environment in the entire area and to reduce eutrophication. Different management practices would reduce nutrient loads of streams and increase water quality which is the critical factor in dam eutrophication.

Many approaches are based on classification techniques considering observation at certain points in time. However, some land cover classes, such as crops, change their spectral characteristics due to environmental influences and can thus not be monitored effectively with classical mono-temporal approaches. Nevertheless, these temporal observations should be utilized to benefit the classification process. After extensive research has been conducted on modeling temporal dynamics by spectro-temporal profiles using vegetation indices, we propose a deep learning approach to utilize these temporal characteristics for classification tasks. In this work, we show how long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks can be employed for crop identification purposes with SENTINEL 2A observations from large study areas and label information provided by local authorities. We compare these temporal neural network models, i.e., LSTM and recurrent neural network (RNN), with a classical non-temporal convolutional neural network (CNN) model and an additional support vector machine (SVM) baseline. With our rather straightforward LSTM variant, we exceeded state-of-the-art classification performance, thus opening promising potential for further research.","Crop identification; Deep learning; Land cover classification; Long short-term memory; Recurrent neural networks; Sentinel 2","Brain; Crops; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Education; Neural networks; Recurrent neural networks; Support vector machines; Classification performance; Classification technique; Convolutional neural network; Crop identification; Land cover classification; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Sentinel 2; Spectral characteristics; Long short-term memory",Conference Paper,Scopus

Crop growth and development are influenced by the weather. Therefore, models using weather variables can provide reliable predictions of crop yields. It can be tough to select the best crop production forecasting model. Therefore, in this study, five alternative models, viz., stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), an artificial neural network (ANN), the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), an elastic net (ELNET), and ridge regression, were compared in order to discover the best model for rice yield prediction. The outputs from individual models were used to build ensemble models using the generalized linear model (GLM), random forest (RF), cubist and ELNET methods. For the previous 21 years, historical rice yield statistics and meteorological data were collected for three districts under three separate agro-climatic zones of Chhattisgarh, viz., Raipur in the Chhattisgarh plains, Surguja in the northern hills, and Bastar in the southern plateau. The models were calibrated using 80% of these datasets, and the remaining 20% was used for the validation of models. The present study concluded that for rice crop yield forecasting, the performance of the ANN was good for the Raipur ((Formula presented.) = 1, (Formula presented.) = 1 and (Formula presented.) = 0.002, (Formula presented.) = 0.003) and Surguja ((Formula presented.) = 1, (Formula presented.) = 0.99 and (Formula presented.) = 0.004, (Formula presented.) = 0.214) districts as compared to the other models, whereas for Bastar, ELNET ((Formula presented.) = 90, (Formula presented.) = 0.48) and LASSO ((Formula presented.) = 93, (Formula presented.) = 0.568) performed better. The performance of the ensemble model was better compared to the individual models. For Raipur and Surguja, the performance of all the ensemble methods was comparable, whereas for Bastar, random forest (RF) performed better, with R2 = 0.85 and 0.81 for calibration and validation, respectively, as compared to the GLM, cubist, and ELNET approach. © 2023 by the authors.","ANN; ELNET; LASSO; ridge regression; SMLR; yield forecasting","artificial neural network; comparative study; crop yield; food safety; forecasting method; harvesting; regression analysis; rice; shrinkage; statistical analysis; Chhattisgarh; India",Article,Scopus

However, the acquisition and analysis of spectral data require costs and skills that are often not sufficiently available. In this context, the identification of geometric indices that allow the monitoring of spatial variability with low-cost instruments, without spectral analysis know-how but based on photogrammetry techniques with high-resolution RGB cameras, becomes extremely interesting. The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential of new canopy geometry-based indices for the characterization of vegetative and productive agronomic parameters compared to traditional NDVI based on spectral response of the canopy top. Furthermore, considering grape production as a key parameter directly linked to the economic profit of farmers, this study provides a deeper analysis focused on the development of a rapid yield forecast methodology based on UAV data, evaluating both traditional linear and machine learning regressions. Among the yield assessment models, one of the best results was obtained with the canopy thickness which showed high performance with the Gaussian process regression models (R2 = 0.80), while the yield prediction average accuracy of the best ML models reached 85.95%.

Occurrences and numbers of insects can be monitored through insect traps, which include their permanent touring and checking of their condition. Another more efficient way is to set up sensor devices with a camera at the traps that will photograph the traps and forward the images to the Internet, where the pest insect’s appearance will be predicted by image analysis. Weather conditions, temperature and relative humidity are the parameters that affect the appearance of some pests, such as Helicoverpa armigera. This paper presents a model of machine learning that can predict the appearance of insects during a season on a daily basis, taking into account the air temperature and relative humidity. Several machine learning algorithms for classification were applied and their accuracy for the prediction of insect occurrence was presented (up to 76.5%). Since the data used for testing were given in chronological order according to the days when the measurement was performed, the existing model was expanded to take into account the periods of three and five days. The extended method showed better accuracy of prediction and a lower percentage of false detections. In the case of a period of five days, the accuracy of the affected detections was 86.3%, while the percentage of false detections was 11%.

To examine the effects of extreme weather events, we defined the drought and heatwave by considering the characteristics of corn growth and selected the cases for sensitivity tests from a historical database. In particular, we conducted an optimization for the hyperparameters of the deep neural network (DNN) model to ensure the best configuration for accuracy improvement. The result for drought cases showed that our DNN model was approximately 51-98% more accurate than the other five AI models in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). For the heatwave cases, our DNN model showed approximately 30-77% better accuracy in terms of RMSE. The correlation coefficient was 0.954 for drought cases and 0.887-0.914 for heatwave cases.

We tested four approaches: only spectral bands, spectral bands + topographic position index, spectral bands + topographic wetness index, and spectral bands + topographic position index + topographic wetness index.

Among the different approaches, machine learning (ML) techniques are being increasingly adopted, since they allow exploiting all the information on crop progress and environmental conditions and their relations with crop yield, achieving reliable and accurate estimations. However, interpreting the relationships learned by the ML models, and hence getting insights about the problem, remains a complex and usually unexplored task. Without accountability, confidence and trust in the ML models can be compromised. Here, we develop interpretable ML approaches for crop yield estimation that allow us investigating the most informative agro-ecological drivers and influencial regions learned by the models. We conduct a set of experiments to learn the selection of agro-ecological drivers leading to best estimations of main crops grown in Europe: corn, barley and wheat. As input data, we consider a variety of multi-scale Earth observation products sensitive to canopy greenness (e.g. EVI and LAI), its water-uptake dynamics (e.g. VOD) and available water (soil moisture), as well as climatic variables from the ERA5-Land reanalysis (e.g. temperature and radiation). Our results show that the best performances (R2&gt;0.55 for corn and R2&gt;0.8 for both barley and wheat) are obtained when descriptors of soil, vegetation, and atmosphere status are used as input in the ML models. This combination of variables outperforms the results obtained using single variables as inputs or all variables altogether. We then further analyze the relations of input features with crop yield in the developed models by means of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). We show how the information learned by the GPR model allows us to identify atypical or anomalous crop seasons across the study region, and investigate the underlying factors behind crop progress and failure in Europe. © 2021","Crop Yield Estimation; ERA5-Land; Gaussian Process; Interpretability; Machine Learning; MODIS; Optical and Passive Microwave sensors","crop yield; environmental conditions; Gaussian method; machine learning; MODIS; remote sensing; sensor; Europe",Article,Scopus

Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) enables accurate forest inventory, but it is expensive for large area analyses. Continuously increasing volume of open Earth Observation (EO) imagery from high-resolution (<30 m) satellites together with modern machine learning algorithms provide new prospects for spaceborne large area forest inventory. In this study, we investigated the capability of Sentinel-2 (S2) image and metadata, topography data, and canopy height model (CHM), as well as their combinations, to predict growing stock volume with deep neural networks (DNN) in four forestry districts in Central Finland. We focused on investigating the relevance of different input features, the effect of DNN depth, the amount of training data, and the size of image data sampling window to model prediction performance. We also studied model transfer between different silvicultural districts in Finland, with the objective to minimize the amount of new field data needed. We used forest inventory data provided by the Finnish Forest Centre for model training and performance evaluation. Leaving out CHM features, the model using RGB and NIR bands, the imaging and sun angles, and topography features as additional predictive variables obtained the best plot level accuracy (RMSE% = 42.6%, |BI AS%| = 0.8%). We found 3 × 3 pixels to be the optimal size for the sampling window, and two to three hidden layer DNNs to produce the best results with relatively small improvement to single hidden layer networks. Including CHM features with S2 data and additional features led to reduced relative RMSE (RMSE% = 28.6–30.7%) but increased the absolute value of relative bias (|BI AS%| = 0.9–4.0%).

Firstly, in order to reduce the influence of light on image processing, the RGB color image is converted to HSI color image, and the S component image of the HSI color space is extracted as a research object. Then, the S component image is binarized by the Otsu method, the hole of the binary image is filled by morphology closing algorithm, and the sugarcane and the background are initially separated by the horizontal projection map of the binary image. Finally, the position of sugarcane stem is preliminarily determined by continuously taking the derivative of the vertical projection function of the binary image, and the sum of the local pixel value of the suspicious pixel column is compared to further determine the sugarcane stem node. The experimental results showed that the recognition rate of single stem node is 100%, and the standard deviation is less than 1.1 mm. The accuracy of simultaneous identification of double stem nodes is 98%, and the standard deviation is less than 1.7 mm. The accuracy of simultaneous identification of the three stem nodes is 95%, and the standard deviation is less than 2.2 mm.

Coordination failures among the stakeholders in the agriculture sector result in the inability to provide accurate, timely, and actionable information. As a result, the agriculture sector faces several challenges, such as oversupply, undersupply and crop wastage. The existing digital agriculture eco-system can gather data produced by different stakeholders more frequently and accurately. However, the data collected from various stakeholders should be analyzed and forecasted to deliver the required knowledge to make more informed and appropriate decisions. This study was carried out to propose a ‘Closed-loop information flow model’ to provide forecasted demand and supply to create better coordination among stakeholders. Different prototypes were designed to deliver forecasted demand and supply information for major stakeholders in the agriculture sector. Initially, farmers, input suppliers, and logistic suppliers were selected in this study to expand to other stakeholders in the future. The prediction model was developed and evaluated according to stakeholder requirements by analyzing the actual and predicted data. The existing ‘Govi-Nena’ mobile-based farmer application was refined to provide supply and demand information for farmers. Separate web dashboards were designed to deliver the required information to other stakeholders such as input suppliers and logistic suppliers. Designed prototypes will be evaluated with the stakeholders for further improvements. The proposed Closed-loop information flow model for forecasted demand and supply will bridge the market information gap among stakeholders.

In this study, we demonstrate the use of agronomic knowledge of crop growth drivers in a Long Short-Term Memory-based, domain-guided neural network (DgNN) for in-season crop progress estimation. The DgNN uses a branched structure and attention to separate independent crop growth drivers and captures their varying importance throughout the growing season. The DgNN is implemented for corn, using RS data in Iowa, U.S., for the period 2003–2019, with United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) crop progress reports used as ground truth. State-wide DgNN performance shows significant improvement over sequential and dense-only NN structures, and a widely-used Hidden Markov Model method. The DgNN had a 4.0% higher Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency over all growth stages and 39% more weeks with highest cosine similarity than the next best NN during test years. The DgNN and Sequential NN were more robust during periods of abnormal crop progress, though estimating the Silking–Grainfill transition was difficult for all methods. Finally, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection visualizations of layer activations showed how LSTM-based NNs separate crop growth time-series differently from a dense-only structure. Results from this study exhibit both the viability of NNs in crop growth stage estimation (CGSE) and the benefits of using domain knowledge.

Due to higher population growth and recent climate change scenarios, it is crucial to get timely and accurate rice yield estimates and production forecast of the growing season for governments, planners, and decision makers in formulating policies regarding import/export in the event of shortfall and/or surplus. This study aims to quantify the rice yield at various phenological stages from hyper-temporal satellite-derived-vegetation indices computed from time series Sentinel-II images. Different vegetation indices (viz. NDVI, EVI, SAVI, and REP) were used to predict paddy yield. The predicted yield was validated through RMSE and ME statistical techniques. The integration of PLSR and sequential time-stamped vegetation indices accurately predicted rice yield (i.e., maximum R2 = 0.84 and minimum RMSE = 0.12 ton ha−1 equal to 3% of the mean rice yield). Moreover, our results also established that optimal time spans for predicting rice yield are late vegetative and reproductive (flowering) stages.

This study uses Pucheng County, Fujian Province, a demonstration county of China Good Grains and Oils, as the research area. Using actual rice yield sample data and environment data, a yield simulation model based on random forest regression is constructed to realize a fine-scale simulation of rice yield and its spatial distribution pattern in Pucheng County. On this basis, we construct a method system to identify spatial combination patterns between rice yields and fine-scale multidimensional environmental planting suitability using rice yield data and environmental planting suitability evaluation data. We categorize the areas into four combination model areas to analyze the spatial correlation model of planting suitability, multidimensional environment, and yield: higher-yield and higher-suitability cluster–comprehensive environmental-advantage areas, high-yield and high-suitability cluster–soil condition-limited areas, moderate-yield and moderate-suitability cluster–irrigation and drainage condition-limited areas, and low-yield and low-suitability cluster–site condition-limited areas. The following results are found. (1) The rice yield simulation model, which is based on random forest regression, considers the various complex relationships between yield and natural as well as human factors to realize the refined simulation of rice yields at a county scale. (2) The county rice yield has a strong positive spatial correlation, and the spatial clustering characteristics are obvious; these relationships can provide a basis for effectively imple-menting intensive rice planting in Pucheng County. (3) We construct a spatial combination pattern recognition method based on rice yield and environmental planting suitability. We can use this method to effectively identify the spatial relationship between yield and planting suitability as well as the shortcomings and advantages of different regions in terms of the climate, soil, irrigation, site, mechanical farming, and similar factors. On this basis, we can provide regional rice planting guidance for Pucheng County. In addition, this method system also provides a new perspective and method for research into spatial combination models and related spatial issues. © 2021 by the authors.

The overarching approach is to develop and adopt a systems-agronomy framework relevant to any wheat production system. It first establishes the scale of current yield gaps, identifies defensible benchmarks, and takes a holistic approach to understand and overcome exploitable yield gaps to complement genetic increases in potential yield. New opportunities to increase productivity will be sought by exploiting future Genotype × Environment × Management synergies in different wheat systems. To identify research gaps and opportunities for collaboration among different wheat producing regions, the EWG compiled a comprehensive database of currently funded wheat agronomy research (n = 782) in countries representing a large proportion of the wheat grown in the world. The yield gap analysis and research database positions the EWG to influence priorities for wheat agronomy research in member countries that would facilitate collaborations, minimize duplication, and maximize the global impact on wheat production systems.

A trial was established in the growing season of 2016 at the Texas A&M AgriLife Research Center in Weslaco, Texas, where 15 energy cane elite lines and three checks were grown on experimental plots, arranged in a complete block design and replicated four times. Four flights were executed at different growth stages in 2018, at the first ratoon crop, using two multi-rotor UAS: the DJI Phantom 4 Pro equipped with RGB camera and the DJI Matrice 100, equipped with multispectral sensor (SlantRange 3p). Canopy cover, canopy height, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and ExG (Excess Green Index) were extracted from the images and used to perform a stepwise regression to obtain the yield and TCC models. The results showed a good agreement between the predicted and the measured yields (R2 = 0.88); however, a low coefficient of determination was found between the predicted and the observed TCC (R2 = 0.30).

Of all input data for WXGEN, precipitation is critical due to its sensitivity to the number of wet days. Since global climate model (GCM) data tend to have excessive wet days, use of GCM precipitation data for WXGEN may cause errors in the estimation of climate variables and therefore SWAT predictions. To examine such impacts of GCM data, we prepared two climate data for SWAT using WXGEN with both the original GCM data with the excessive number of wet days (EGCM) and the processed GCM data with the reasonable number of wet days (RGCM). We then compared SWAT simulations from EGCM and RGCM. Results show that because of the excessive wet days in EGCM, solar radiation generated by WXGEN was underestimated, subsequently leading to 143 mm lower ET and 0.6-0.8 m3/s greater streamflow compared to the simulations from RGCM. Simulated crop biomass under EGCM was smaller than RGCM due to less solar radiation. Although use of WXGEN is increasing in projecting climate change impacts using SWAT, potential errors from the combination of WXGEN and GCM have not well investigated. Our findings clearly demonstrate that GCM bias (excessive wet days) leads WXGEN to generate inaccurate climate data, resulting in unreasonable SWAT predictions. Thus, GCM data should be carefully processed to use them for WXGEN. © 2018 by the authors.","Excessive wet days; GCM bias; SWAT; WXGEN","Climate change; Solar radiation; Climate change impact; Excessive wet days; GCM bias; Global circulation model; Global climate model; Soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; WXGEN; Climate models; climate effect; climate modeling; comparative study; hydrological modeling; prediction; soil and water assessment tool; wet season",Article,Scopus

Rice is the predominant dietary source of half the world’s population, and Pakistan contributes around 80% of the rice trade worldwide and is among the top three of the largest exporters. Hitherto, the rice industry has depended on antiquated methods of rice quality assessment through manual inspection, which is time consuming and prone to errors. In this study, an efficient desktop-application-based rice quality evaluation system, ‘National Grain Tech’, based on computer vision and machine learning, is presented. The analysis is based on seven main features, including grain length, width, weight, yellowness, broken, chalky, and/or damaged kernels for six different types of rice: IRRI-6, PK386, 1121 white and Selah, Super kernel basmati brown, and white rice. The system was tested in rice factories for 3 months and demonstrated 99% accuracy in determining the size, weight, color, and chalkiness of rice kernels. An accuracy of 98.8% was achieved for the classification of damaged and undamaged kernels, 98% for determining broken kernels, and 100% for paddy kernels. The results are significant because the developed system improves the local rice quality testing capacity through a faster, more accurate, and less expensive mechanism in comparison to previous research studies, which only evaluated four features of the singular rice type, rather than the seven features achieved in this study for six rice types. © 2022 by the authors.","computer vision; food quality assessment; machine learning; rapid testing; rice quality control",,Article,Scopus

In this paper, a regularized model predictive control (MPC) is proposed for an ARMAX process affected by outlier noise. The outlier noise is modeled as an auxiliary variable in the ARMAX model, and the MPC cost function is reconstructed to reduce the influence of outlier noise on multiple data items.

The proposed TCP is composed of 1 gateway and 2 modules as follows. First, the optimized farm sensor gateway (OFSG) collects data by internetworking sensor nodes which use Zigbee, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth protocol and reduces the number of sensor data fragmentation times through the compression of a fragment header. Second, the data storage module (DSM) stores the collected farm data and weather data in a farm central server. Third, the crop self-diagnosis module (CSM) works in the cloud server and diagnoses by deep learning whether or not the status of a farm is in good condition for growing crops according to current weather and soil information. The TCP performance shows that the data processing rate of the OFSG is increased by about 7% compared with existing sensor gateways. The learning time of the CSM is shorter than that of the long short-term memory models (LSTM) by 0.43 s, and the success rate of the CSM is higher than that of the LSTM by about 7%. Therefore, the TCP based on deep learning interconnects the communication protocols of various sensors, solves the maximum data size that sensor can transfer, predicts in advance crop disease occurrence in an external environment, and helps to make an optimized environment in which to grow crops. © 2018 by the authors.","Crop-diagnosis; Deep leaning; Farm cloud server; Farm sensor gateway",,Article,Scopus

The utility of HadCM3 as a tool in climate change predictions in cross cultural studies is scarce. Therefore, this study sought to investigate and predict climate change induced temperature and precipitation in Iran. The calibration and validation using the HadCM3 was performed during 1961-2001, using daily temperatures and precipitation. The data on temperature and precipitation from 1961 to 1990 were used for calibration, and, for model validation, data from 1991 to 2001 were used. Moreover, in order to downscale general circulation models to station scales, SDSM version 4.2 was utilized. The least difference between observed data and simulation data during calibration and validation showed that the parameter was precisely modeled for most of the year. Simulation under the A2 scenario was performed for three time periods (2020, 2050, and 2080). According to our simulated model, precipitation showed a decreasing trend whereas temperature showed an increasing trend. The result of this research paper makes a significant contribution to climate smart agriculture in Iran. For example, rural development practitioners can devise effective policies and programs in order to reduce the vulnerability of local communities to climate change impacts. Moreover, the result of this study can be used as an optimal model for land allocation in agriculture. Moreover, a shortage of rainfall and decreased temperatures also have implications for agricultural land allocation. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate change; Global circulation model; HadCM3; Iran; Prediction; SDSM","agricultural land; agricultural management; agricultural production; climate change; climate effect; climate prediction; data processing; general circulation model; global climate; model validation; nature-society relations; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; temperature profile; vulnerability; Iran",Article,Scopus

However, only poor approximations of the productivity of wheat crops in China can be obtained using traditional linear regression models based on vegetation indices and observations of the yield. In this study, Sentinel-2 (multispectral data) and ZY-1 02D (hyperspectral data) were used together with 15709 gridded yield data (with a resolution of 5 m × 5 m) to predict the winter wheat yield. These estimates were based on four mainstream data-driven approaches: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The method that gave the best estimate of the winter wheat yield was determined, and the accuracy of the estimates based on multispectral and hyperspectral data were compared. The results showed that the LSTM model, for which the RMSE of the estimates was 0.201 t/ha, performed better than the RF (RMSE = 0.260 t/ha), GBDT (RMSE = 0.306 t/ha), and SVR (RMSE = 0.489 t/ha) methods. The estimates based on the ZY-1 02D hyperspectral data were more accurate than those based on the 30-m Sentinel-2 data: RMSE = 0.237 t/ha for the ZY-1 02D data, which is about a 5% improvement on the RSME of 0.307 t/ha for the 30-m Sentinel-2 data. However, the 10-m Sentinel-2 data performed even better, giving an RMSE of 0.219 t/ha. In addition, it was found that the greenness vegetation index SR (simple ratio index) outperformed the traditional vegetation indices.

The aim of such sequences is to use not only spatial information but also the temporal dimension of the data, which is used for multiple real-world applications, such as classification, segmentation, anomaly detection, and prediction. Several traditional machine learning algorithms have been developed and successfully applied to time series for predictions. However, these methods have limitations in some situations, thus deep learning (DL) techniques have been introduced to achieve the best performance. Reviews of machine learning and DL methods for time series prediction problems have been conducted in previous studies. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these surveys have addressed the specific case of works using DL techniques and satellite images as datasets for predictions. Therefore, this paper concentrates on the DL applications for SITS prediction, giving an overview of the main elements used to design and evaluate the predictive models, namely the architectures, data, optimization functions, and evaluation metrics. The reviewed DL-based models are divided into three categories, namely recurrent neural network based models, hybrid models, and feed-forward-based models (convolutional neural networks and multi-layer perceptron). The main characteristics of satellite images and the major existing applications in the field of SITS prediction are also presented in this article. These applications include weather forecasting, precipitation nowcasting, spatio-temporal analysis, and missing data reconstruction. Finally, current limitations and proposed workable solutions related to the use of DL for SITS prediction are also highlighted. © 2021 by the authors.

Maize is the main crop in China, and its ample production is of vital importance to guarantee regional food security. In this study, the RGB and multispectral images, and maize grain yields were collected from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform. To confirm the optimal indices, RGB-based vegetation indices and textural indices, multispectral-based vegetation indices, and crop height were independently applied to build linear regression relationships with maize grain yields. A stepwise regression model (SRM) was applied to select optimal indices. Three machine learning methods including: backpropagation network (BP), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) and the SRM were separately applied for predicting maize grain yields based on optimal indices. RF achieved the highest accuracy with a coefficient of determination of 0.963 and root mean square error of 0.489 (g/hundred-grain weight).

Through controlling precipitation, an increase in warming of 1 °C could cause a global yield loss of 6.88%, 4.86% or 5.61% according to polynomial regression, long short-term memory (LSTM) and process-based crop models, respectively. With a 10% increase in precipitation, such negative temperature effects could be mitigated by 3.98%, 1.05% or 3.10%, respectively. When temperature is fixed at the baseline level, a 10% increase in precipitation alone could lead to a global yield growth of 0.23%, 1.43% or 3.09% according to polynomial regression, LSTM and process-based crop models, respectively. Further analysis demonstrates substantial uncertainties in impact assessment across crop models, which show a larger discrepancy in predicting temperature impacts than precipitation effects. Overall, global-scale assessment is more uncertain under drier conditions than under wet conditions, while a diverse uncertainty pattern is found for the top ten maize producing countries. This study highlights the important role of climate interactions in regulating yield response to changes in a specific climate factor and emphasizes the value of using both machine learning, statistical and process crop models in a consistent manner for a more realistic estimate of uncertainty than would be provided by a single type of model. © 2022 The Author(s).

This study aims to develop an early forecasting model of cereal yields (soft wheat, barley and durum wheat) at the scale of the agricultural province considering the 15 most productive over 2000–2017 (i.e., 15 × 18 = 270 yields values). To this objective, we built on previous works that showed a tight linkage between cereal yields and various datasets including weather data (rainfall and air temperature), regional climate indices (North Atlantic Oscillation in particular), and drought indices derived from satellite observations in different wavelengths. The combination of the latter three data sets is assessed to predict cereal yields using linear (Multiple Linear Regression, MLR) and non-linear (Support Vector Machine, SVM; Random Forest, RF, and eXtreme Gradient Boost, XGBoost) machine learning algorithms. The calibration of the algorithmic parameters of the different approaches are carried out using a 5-fold cross validation technique and a leave-one-out method is implemented for model validation. The statistical metrics of the models are first analyzed as a function of the input datasets that are used, and as a function of the lead times, from 4 months to 2 months before harvest. The results show that combining data from multiple sources outperformed models based on one dataset only. In addition, the satellite drought indices are a major source of information for cereal prediction when the forecasting is carried out close to harvest (2 months before), while weather data and, to a lesser extent, climate indices, are key variables for earlier predictions. The best models can accurately predict yield in January (4 months before harvest) with an R2 = 0.88 and RMSE around 0.22 t. ha−1 . The XGBoost method exhibited the best metrics. Finally, training a specific model separately for each group of provinces, instead of one global model, improved the prediction performance by reducing the RMSE by 10% to 35% depending on the provinces. In conclusion, the results of this study pointed out that combining remote sensing drought indices with climate and weather variables using a machine learning technique is a promising approach for cereal yield forecasting. © 2021 by the authors.

Hence, there is a need to enhance the yield of crop. One of these important effects on low crop yields is diseases caused by bacteria, fungi and viruses. This can be prevented and handled by means of applying plant disease detection approaches. Machine learning techniques will be employed in the process of disease identification on plants as it mostly applies information themselves and offers fabulous techniques for detection of plant diseases. Methods based on Machine learning can be employed for the identification of diseases because it mainly applies on data superiority outcomes for specified task. In this approach, a comprehensive review has been made on the various techniques employed in plant disease detection using artificial intelligence (AI) based machine learning and deep learning techniques. Likewise, deep learning has also gained a great deal of significance in offering better performance outcome for detecting plant disease in the computer vision field. The deep learning advancements were employed to a range of domains that leads to great attainment in the machine learning and computer vision areas. The comparative study is made in terms of machine and deep learning techniques and their performance and usage in various research papers is related to show the effectiveness of deep learning model over machine learning model.

However, it is difficult for LAI field measurements to collect a sufficient amount of sample data in mangrove wetlands. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposed an approach for expanding training samples and quantitatively evaluated the performance of estimating LAI for mangrove communities using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Transformer algorithms. This study also explored the effects of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Sentinel-2A multispectral, orbital hyper spectral (OHS), and GF-3 SAR images on LAI estimation of different mangrove communities. Finally, this paper evaluated the LAI estimation ability of mangrove communities using ensemble learning regression (ELR) and DLR algorithms. The results showed that: (1) the UAV images achieved the better LAI estimation of different mangrove communities (R2 = 0.5974–0.6186), and GF-3 SAR images were better for LAI estimation of Avicennia marina with high coverage (R2 = 0.567). The optimal spectral range for estimating LAI for mangroves in the optical images was between 650–680 nm. (2) The ELR model outperformed single base model, and produced the high-accuracy LAI estimation (R2 = 0.5266–0.713) for different mangrove communities. (3) The average accuracy (R2) of the ELR model was higher by 0.0019–0.149 than the DLR models, which demonstrated that the ELR model had a better capability (R2 = 0.5865–0.6416) in LAI estimation. The Transformer-based LAI estimation of A. marina (R2 = 0.6355) was better than the DNN model, while the DNN model produced higher accuracy for Kandelia candel (KC) (R2 = 0.5577). (4) With the increase in the expansion ratio of the training sample (10–50%), the LAI estimation accuracy (R2) of DNN and Transformer models for different mangrove communities increased by 0.1166–0.2037 and 0.1037–0.1644, respectively. Under the same estimation accuracy, the sample enhancement method in this paper could reduce the number of filed measurements by 20–40%.

The aim of this study was to identify the key meteorological factors affecting the harvest date (model M_HARV) and yield of the soybean variety Augusta (model M_YIELD) using a neural network sensitivity analysis. The dates of the start of flowering and maturity, the yield data, the average daily temperatures and precipitation were collected, and the Selyaninov hydrothermal coefficients were calculated during a fifteen-year study (2005–2020 growing seasons). During the experiment, highly variable weather conditions occurred, strongly modifying the course of phenological phases in soybean and the achieved seed yield of Augusta cultivar. The harvesting of mature soybean seeds took place between 131 and 156 days after sowing, while the harvested yield ranged from 0.6 t·ha−1 to 2.6 t·ha−1 . The sensitivity analysis of the MLP neural network made it possible to identify the factors which had the greatest impact on the tested dependent variables among all the analyzed factors. It was revealed that the variables assigned ranks 1 and 2 in the sensitivity analysis of the neural network forming the M_HARV model were total rainfall in the first decade of June and the first decade of August. The variables with the highest impact on the Augusta soybean seed yield (model M_YIELD) were the mean daily air temperature in the second decade of May and the Seljaninov coefficient values calculated for the sowing–flowering date period. © 2022 by the authors.

This approach can provide more markers for selection programmes for specific environments whilst also allowing for prioritization.

Due to the absence of complex microbial network interactions and soil heterogeneity in a restricted soilless medium, the architecture of roots is a function of genetics defined by the soilless matrix and exogenously supplied nutrients such as nitrogen (N). The knowledge of root trait combinations that offer the optimal nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is far from being conclusive. The objective of this study was to define the root trait(s) that best predicts and correlates with vegetative biomass under differed N treatments. We used eight image-derived root architectural traits of 202 diverse spinach lines grown in two N concentrations (high N, HN, and low N, LN) in randomized complete blocks design. Supervised random forest (RF) machine learning augmented by ranger hyperparameter grid search was used to predict the variable importance of the root traits. We also determined the broad-sense heritability (H) and genetic (rg) and phenotypic (rp) correlations between root traits and the vegetative biomass (shoot weight, SWt). Each root trait was assigned a predicted importance rank based on the trait’s contribution to the cumulative reduction in the mean square error (MSE) in the RF tree regression models for SWt. The root traits were further prioritized for potential selection based on the rg and SWt correlated response (CR). The predicted importance of the eight root traits showed that the number of root tips (Tips) and root length (RLength) under HN and crossings (Xsings) and root average diameter (RAvdiam) under LN were the most relevant. SWt had a highly antagonistic rg (− 0.83) to RAvdiam, but a high predicted indirect selection efficiency (− 112.8%) with RAvdiam under LN; RAvdiam showed no significant rg or rp to SWt under HN. In limited N availability, we suggest that selecting against larger RAvdiam as a secondary trait might improve biomass and, hence, NUE with no apparent yield penalty under HN. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"nitrogen; anatomy and histology; biomass; genetics; machine learning; metabolism; phenotype; plant root; quantitative trait; seedling; spinach; Biomass; Machine Learning; Nitrogen; Phenotype; Plant Roots; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Seedlings; Spinacia oleracea",Article,Scopus

The three major fruit production areas on the Central Coast complement each other in producing fruits almost throughout the year. Forecasting strawberry yield with some lead time can help growers plan for required and often limited human resources and aid in making strategic business decisions. The objectives of this paper were to investigate the correlation among various weather parameters related with strawberry yield at the field level and to evaluate yield forecasts using the predictive principal component regression (PPCR) and two machine-learning techniques: (a) a single layer neural network (NN) and (b) generic random forest (RF). The meteorological parameters were a combination of the sensor data measured in the strawberry field, meteorological data obtained from the nearest weather station, and calculated agroclimatic indices such as chill hours. The correlation analysis showed that all of the parameters were significantly correlated with strawberry yield and provided the potential to develop weekly yield forecast models. In general, the machine learning technique showed better skills in predicting strawberry yields when compared to the principal component regression. More specifically, the NN provided the most skills in forecasting strawberry yield.

Recently, numerous researchers have utilized machine learning (ML) methods to predict crop yield, using observational climate variables and satellite data. Meanwhile, some studies also illustrated the potential of state-of-the-art dynamical atmospheric prediction in crop yield forecasting. However, the potential of coupling both methods has not been fully explored. Herein, we aimed to establish a skilled ML–dynamical hybrid model for crop yield forecasting (MHCF v1.0), which hybridizes ML and a global dynamical atmospheric prediction system, and applied it to northern China at the S2S time scale. In this study, we adopted three mainstream machining learning algorithms (XGBoost, RF, and SVR) and the multiple linear regression (MLR) model, and three major datasets, including satellite data from MOD13C1, observational climate data from CRU, and S2S atmospheric prediction data from IAP CAS, used to predict winter wheat yield from 2005 to 2014, at the grid level. We found that, among the four models examined in this work, XGBoost reached the highest skill with the S2S prediction as inputs, scoring R2 of 0.85 and RMSE of 0.78 t/ha 3–4 months, leading the winter wheat harvest. Moreover, the results demonstrated that crop yield forecasting with S2S dynamical predictions generally outperforms that with observational climate data. Our findings highlighted that the coupling of ML and S2S dynamical atmospheric prediction provided a useful tool for yield forecasting, which could guide agricultural practices, policy-making and agricultural insurance. © 2022 by the authors.

This study developed a spatial disaggregation method using improved spatial weights generated from machine learning. When applied to Chinese maize yield, extreme gradient boosting (XGB) derived the best prediction results, with a cross-validation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.81 at the municipal level. The disaggregated yield at 1 km grids could explain 54% of the variance of the county-level statistical yield, which is superior to the existing gridded maize yield dataset in China. At the site level, the disaggregated yields also showed much better agreement with observations than the existing gridded maize yield dataset.

A methodology of plant growth observation with the rapid performance of experiments is presented in this paper. The proposed system enables the collection of data with respect to various climate conditions, which are artificially created and permuted in the encapsulated design, suitable for further correlation with plant development identifiers. The design is equipped with a large number of sensors and connected to the central database in a computer cloud, which enables the interconnection and coordination of multiple geographically distributed devices and related experiments in a remote, autonomous, and real-time manner. Over 40 sensors and up to 24 yearly harvests per device enable the yearly collection of approximately 750,000 correlated database entries, which it is possible to independently stack with higher numbers of devices.

The utilized dataset has two Brazilian wheat types, called Parrudo and Toruk. Furthermore, the experimental area has variability in crop growth by varying the amount of nitrogen. To determine AGB, samples of plants were collected at three different crop growth stages, approximately a month apart, making our database spatial and temporal variability.

The feeling is the user's view or attitude towards any topic, object, event, or service. Overall, feelings have always influenced people's decision-making. In recent years, emotions have been analyzed intensively in natural language, but many problems still have to be watched. One of the most important problems is the lack of precise classification resources. Most of the research into feeling gradation is concerned with the issue of polarity grading, although, in many practical applications, this relatively grounded feeling measure is insufficient. Design methods are therefore essential, which can accurately classify feelings into a natural language. The principal goal of the research is to develop an overflow of grammatical rules-based classification of Indian language tweets. In this work, three main challenges are identified to classify feelings in Indian language tweets and possible methods for tackling such issues. Firstly, it has been found that the informal nature of tweets is crucial for the classification of feelings. Based on the tweets, the mental illness of the person has been classified. Therefore, to categorize Indian language tweets, a combination of grammar rules based on adjectives and negations is proposed. Secondly, people often express their feelings with slang words, abbreviations, and mixed words. A technique called field tags is used to include nongrammatical arguments such as slang words and diverse words. Thirdly, if a tweet is more complex, the morphological richness of the Indian language results in a loss of performance. The grammar rules are embedded in N-gram techniques and machine learning methods. These methods are grouped into three approaches, which functionally predict Indian language tweets with syntactic words. © 2022 B.

The use of feature descriptors and detectors allows to find distinctive keypoints in an image and the use of this approach for agronomical applications has become a widespread field of study. By combining near infrared (NIR) images, acquired with a modified Nikon D80 camera, and visible spectrum (VIS) images, acquired with a Nikon D300s, a proper crop identification could be obtained. Still, the use of different sensors brings an image matching challenge due to the difference between cameras and the possible distortions from each imaging technique. The aim of this paper is to compare the performance of several feature descriptors and detectors by comparing near infrared and visual spectral bands in rice crop images. Therefore, a group of 20 different scenes with different cameras and growth stages in a rice crop were evaluated. Thus, red, green, blue (RGB) and L, a, b (CIE L*a*b*) channels were extracted from VIS images in order to compare the matches obtained between each of them and the corresponding NIR image. The BRISK, SURF, SIFT, ORB, KAZE, and AKAZE methods were implemented, which act as descriptors and detectors. Additionally, a combination was made between the FAST algorithm for the detection of keypoints with the BRIEF, BRISK, and FREAK methods for features description. BF and FLANN matching methods were used. The algorithms were implemented in Python using OpenCV library. The green channel presented the highest number of correct matches in all methods. In turn, the method that presented the highest performance both in time and in the number of correct matches was the combination of the FAST feature detector and the BRISK descriptor. © 2021 by the authors.

Soil salinization is one of the key problems of sustainable development of arid agricultural land. Exploring the use of shallow subsurface pipe drainage to improve soil salinization. Methods. This study investigates the desalinization effect of shallow subsurface pipe drainage, in combination with drip irrigation under plastic mulch, in an arid region in China. Field data collection was conducted in 2010. Soil salinity at a range of soil depths, water EC and pH of subsurface pipe drainage and crop yield during crop growth stages in salinized farmlands were measured. Results and Conclusion. The results show that soil salinity was reduced significantly on mildly (1-3 dS m-1) and moderately (3-6 dS m-1) salinized farmlands. The highest desalinization rate of mildly and moderately salinized soils was 51% and 91% respectively. The desalinization in upper soil layers, to a depth of 60 cm, was more significant than that in lower soil layers. Drainage water salinity was much higher than irrigation water salinity. Crop yield on mildly and moderately salinized land increased about 25% and 50%, respectively. This indicates that the combination of drip irrigation and shallow subsurface pipe drainage on farmlands is potential feasible to desalt farmlands and to improve crop yield.

This study has considered various prominent non-parametric methods i.e. Pettitt's, Standard normal homogeneity (SNH) and Buishand's range tests. The core purpose of these three techniques is to capture the mutation point in time series data connected to wheat production during the period 1980-2016. Consequently, Sen's slope estimator has been used to measure the magnitude of the trend for wheat production and their significances examined through Mann Kendall (M-K) test. The analysis provided a clear idea about the trends of wheat production over India. The results exhibit that all the states showed the raising trends. The notable observation is that the trend of Madhya Pradesh got highest Sen's slope estimator (i.e. 1541.999/ year) in the second segmentation period. At present, the production of wheat is highly improved in Madhya Pradesh compared to other states from 2008. However, the production of wheat has been decreased in Uttar Pradesh compared to previous years but it holds the leading position in wheat production still in the country. © ResearchersLinks Ltd.","Change point; India; Non-parametric methods; Trend analysis; Wheat crop",,Article,Scopus

In this study, artificial neural network (ANN) models were used for predicting maize in the major maize producing provinces of South Africa. The maize production prediction and projection analysis were carried out using the following climate variables: precipitation (PRE), maximum temperature (TMX), minimum temperature (TMN), potential evapotranspiration (PET), soil moisture (SM) and land cultivated (Land) for maize. The analyzed datasets spanned from 1990 to 2017 and were divided into two segments with 80% used for model training and the remaining 20% for testing. The results indicated that PET, PRE, TMN, TMX, Land, and SM with two hidden neurons of vector (5,8) were the best combination to predict maize production in the Free State province, whereas the TMN, TMX, PET, PRE, SM and Land with vector (7,8) were the best combination for predicting maize in KwaZulu-Natal province. In addition, the TMN, SM and Land and TMN, TMX, SM and Land with vector (3,4) were the best combination for maize predicting in the North West and Mpumalanga provinces, respectively. The comparison between the actual and predicted maize production using the testing data indicated performance accuracy adjusted R2 of 0.75 for Free State, 0.67 for North West, 0.86 for Mpumalanga and 0.82 for KwaZulu-Natal. Furthermore, a decline in the projected maize production was observed across all the selected provinces (except the Free State province) from 2018 to 2019. Thus, the developed model can help to enhance the decision making process of the farmers and policymakers. © 2019 by the authors.","Artificial intelligence; Climate; Maize; Prediction","artificial neural network; crop production; decision making; maize; potential evapotranspiration; precipitation (climatology); prediction; soil moisture; South Africa; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Recently, deep-learning (DL) approach has been used as a new alternative model in forecasting. In this paper, the enhanced DL approach incorporates multiple long short term memory (LSTM) layers employed with multiple neurons in each layer, fully trained and built a state for forecasting. The enhanced model used the banana harvest yield data from agrarian reform beneficiary (ARB) cooperative of Dapco in Davao del Norte, Philippines. The model parameters such as epoch, batch size and neurons underwent tuning to identify its optimal values to be used in the experiments. Additionally, the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) is used to evaluate the performance of the model. Using the same set of training and testing data, experiment exhibits that the enhanced model achieved the optimal result of 34.805 in terms of RMSE. This means that the enhanced model outperforms the single and multiple LSTM layer with 43.5 percent and 44.95 percent reduction in error rates, respectively. Since there is no proof that LSTM recurrent neutral network has been used with the same agricultural problem domain, therefore, there is no standard available with regards to the level of error reduction in the forecast. Moreover, investigating the performance of the model using diverse datasets specifically with multiple input features (multivariate) is suggested for exploration. Furthermore, extending and embedding this approach to a web-based along with a handy application is the future plan for the benefit of the medium scale banana growers of the region for efficient and effective decision making and advance planning. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.","Banana harvest yield forecasting; Deep Learning; Long short-term memory; Yield forecasting","Brain; Decision making; Errors; Forecasting; Harvesting; Long short-term memory; Mean square error; Banana harvest yield forecasting; Deep learning; Harvest yields; Learning approach; Memory layers; Multifaceted systems; Performance; Root mean squared errors; Yield forecasting; Fruits",Article,Scopus

This study extracted agricultural fields in the former homelands of Venda and Gazankulu in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Landsat 8 imageries for 2015 were used, applying the maximum likelihood supervised classifier to delineate the agricultural fields. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) applied on Landsat imageries on the mapped fields during the dry season (July to August) was used to identify irrigated areas, because years of satellite data analysis suggest that healthy crop conditions during dry seasons are only possible with irrigation. Ground truth points totaling 137 were collected during fieldwork for pre-processing and accuracy assessment. An accuracy of 96% was achieved on the mapped agricultural fields, yet the irrigated area map produced an initial accuracy of only 71%. This study explains and improves the 29% error margin from the irrigated areas. Accuracy was enhanced through post-classification correction (PCC) using 74 post-classification points randomly selected from the 2015 irrigated area map. High resolution aerial photographs of the 74 sample fields were acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to give a clearer picture of the irrigated fields. The analysis shows that mapped irrigated fields that presented anomalies included abandoned croplands that had green invasive alien species or abandoned fruit plantations that had high NDVI values.

To simplify the procedure of generating weather realizations and make them available over the Internet, we implemented novel mechanisms for providing weather generators as web services, as well as a mechanism for sharing identical weather realizations given a climatological information. A web service for preparing long-term climate data was implemented based on an international standard, Sensor Observation Service (SOS). The weather generator services, which are the core components of the framework, analyze climatological data, and can take seasonal climate forecasts as inputs for generating weather realizations. The generated weather realizations are encoded in a standard format, which are ready for use to crop modeling. All outputs are generated in SOS standard, which broadens the extent of data sharing and interoperability with other sectoral applications, e.g., water resources management. These services facilitate the development of other applications requiring input weather realizations, as these can be obtained easily by just calling the service. The workload of analysts related to data preparation and handling of legacy weather generator programs can be reduced.

However, traditional yield assessment approaches are laborious and time-consuming, and thus hinder the acquisition of timely information at the field scale. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant attention in precision agriculture due to their efficiency in data acquisition. In addition, compared with other imaging modalities, hyperspectral data can offer higher spectral fidelity for constructing narrow-band vegetation indices which are of great importance in yield modeling. In this study, we performed an in-season alfalfa yield prediction using UAV-based hyperspectral images. Specifically, we firstly extracted a large number of hyperspectral indices from the original data and performed a feature selection to reduce the data dimensionality. Then, an ensemble machine learning model was developed by combining three widely used base learners including random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR) and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). The model performance was evaluated on experimental fields in Wisconsin. Our results showed that the ensemble model outperformed all the base learners and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.874 was achieved when using the selected features. In addition, we also evaluated the model adaptability on different machinery compaction treatments, and the results further demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed ensemble model. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the timing of the remote sensing field campaigns can profoundly impact the accuracy of yield predictions. Little is known on the effects of phenological phases on skills of high-frequency sensing observations used to predict maize yield. It is also unclear how much improvement can be gained using multi-temporal compared to mono-temporal data. We used a systematic scheme to address those gaps employing UAV multispectral observations at nine development stages of maize (from second-leaf to maturity). Next, the spectral and texture indices calculated from the mono-temporal and multi-temporal UAV images were fed into the Random Forest model for yield prediction. Our results indicated that multi-temporal UAV data could remarkably enhance the yield prediction accuracy compared with mono-temporal UAV data (R2 increased by 8.1% and RMSE decreased by 27.4%). For single temporal UAV observation, the fourteenth-leaf stage was the earliest suitable time and the milking stage was the optimal observing time to estimate grain yield. For multi-temporal UAV data, the combination of tasseling, silking, milking, and dough stages exhibited the highest yield prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 0.77 t·ha−1 ). Furthermore, we found that the Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), and dissimilarity of the near-infrared image at milking stage were the most promising feature variables for maize yield prediction. © 2022 by the authors.

Agricultural big data and artificial intelligence (AI) are key technologies for smart agriculture, bringing cost-effective solutions to the agricultural sector. Deep learning-based crop yield forecast has currently emerged as one of the key methods for guiding agricultural production. In this study, we proposed a Bayesian optimization-based long- and short-term memory model (BO-LSTM) to construct a multi-source data fusion-driven crop growth feature extraction algorithm for winter wheat yield prediction. The yield prediction performance of BO-LSTM, support vector machine (SVM), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) was then compared with multi-source data as input variables. The results showed that effective deep learning hyperparameter optimization is made possible by Bayesian optimization. The BO-LSTM (RMSE = 177.84 kg/ha, R2 = 0.82) model had the highest accuracy of yield prediction with the input combination of “GPP + Climate + LAI + VIs”. BO-LSTM and SVM (RMSE = 185.7 kg/ha, R2 = 0.80) methods outperformed linear regression Lasso (RMSE = 214.5 kg/ha, R2 = 0.76) for winter wheat yield estimation. There were also differences between machine learning and deep learning, BO-LSTM outperformed SVM. indicating that the BO-LSTM model was more effective at capturing data correlations. In order to further verify the robustness of the BO-LSTM method, we explored the performance estimation performance of BO-LSTM in different regions. The results demonstrated that the BO-LSTM model could obtain higher estimation accuracy in regions with concentrated distribution of winter wheat cultivation and less influence of human factors. The approach used in this study can be expected to forecast crop yields, both in regions with a deficit of data and globally; it can also simply and effectively forecast winter wheat yields in a timely way utilizing publicly available multi-source data. © 2022 by the authors.","BO-LSTM; deep learning; meteorological data; remote sensing; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

A field experiment that followed a completely randomized design was conducted at the region of Attica at Oropos. The results indicated that B. mojavensis increased yield by 16%, B. subtilis by 13.8%, B. pumilus by 11.8% and B. pseudomycoides by 9.8% compared to control. In addition, the harvested grains of the plants treated with B. mojavensis, B. subtilis and B. pumilus presented the highest values of protein and fiber content. Moreover, in most of the cases, high values of photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance during the cultivation period, resulted in high productivity. Regarding the texture, the size, the sphericity and the ash content of corn grains, it was found that they were not influenced by the application of different treatments of PGPB.

Ensuring these models can represent cropping field heterogeneity and environmental impact is important, especially given the growing interest in using agroecosystem models to quantify ecosystem services from best management practices and land use change. We posited that augmenting process-based agroecosystem models with additional field-specific information such as topography, hydrologic processes, or independent indicators of yield could help limit simulation artifacts that obscure mechanisms driving observed variations. To test this, we augmented the agroecosystem model Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) with field-specific topography and satellite imagery in a simulation framework we call Foresite. We used Foresite to optimize APSIM yield predictions to match those created from a machine learning model built on remotely sensed indicators of hydrology and plant productivity. Using these improved subfield yield predictions to guide APSIM optimization, total N O 3 − N loss estimates increased by 39% in maize and 20% in soybeans when summed across all years. In addition, we found a disproportionate total amount of leaching in the lowest yielding field areas vs the highest yielding areas in maize (42% vs 15%) and a similar effect in soybeans (31% vs 20%). Overall, we found that augmenting process-based models with now-common subfield remotely sensed data significantly increased values of predicted nutrient loss from fields, indicating opportunities to improve field-scale agroecosystem simulations, particularly if used to calculate nutrient credits in ecosystem service markets. © 2022 The Author(s).

Current approaches based on crop cutting experiments are expensive and usually too late for timely income stabilization measures like crop insurances. We, therefore, utilized a Gradient Boosted Regression (GBR), a machine learning technique, to estimate rice yields at ~500 m spatial resolution for rice-producing areas in India with potential application for near real-time estimates. We used resampled intermediate resolution (~5 km) images of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Leaf Area Index (LAI) and observed yields at the district level in India for calibrating GBR models. These GBRs were then used to downscale district yields to 500 m resolution. Downscaled yields were re-aggregated for validation against out-of-sample district yields not used for model training and an additional independent data set of block-level (below district-level) yields. Our downscaled and re-aggregated yields agree well with reported district-level observations from 2003 to 2015 (r = 0.85 & MAE = 0.15 t/ha). The model performance improved further when estimating separate models for different rice cropping densities (up to r = 0.93). An additional out-of-sample validation for the years 2016 and 2017, proved successful with r = 0.84 and r = 0.77, respectively. Simulated yield accuracy was higher in water-limited, rainfed agricultural systems. We conclude that this downscaling approach of rice yield estimation using GBR is feasible across India and may complement current approaches for timely rice yield estimation required by insurance companies and government agencies. © 2021 by the authors.

Due to the importance of wheat production scale, it is advisable to predict its yield before harvesting. However, the current models are built solely on the basis of quantitative data. Therefore, the aim of the work was to create three multicriteria models for the prediction and simulation of winter wheat yield, which were made on the basis of extended quantitative and qualitative variables from field research in the year period 2008-2015. Neural networks with MLP (multi-layer perceptron) topology were used to build the following models, which can predict and simulate the yield on three dates: 15 April, 31 May, and 30 June. For this reason, they were designated as follows: QQWW15_4, QQWW31_5, and QQWW30_6. Each model is based on a different number of independent features, which ranges from 19 to 25. As a result of the conducted analyses, a MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) forecast error from 6.63% to 6.92% was achieved. This is equivalent of an error ranging from 0.521 to 0.547 t·ha-1, with an average yield of 6.57 ton per hectare of cultivated area. In addition, the most important quantitative and qualitative factors influencing the yield were also indicated. In the first predictive range (15 April), it is the average air temperature from 1 September to 31 December of the previous year (T9-12_PY). In the second predictive range (31 May) it is the sum of precipitation from 1 May to 31 May, and in the third (30 June) is the average air temperature from 1 January to 15 April of the year (T1-4_CY). In addition, one of the qualitative factors had a significant impact on the yield in the first phase-the type of forecrop in the previous year (TF_PY). The presented neural modeling method is a specific extension of the previously used predicting methods. An element of innovation of the presented concept of yield modeling is the possibility of performing a simulation before harvest, in the current agrotechnical season.

Specifically, time series data were fuzzified by the simple maximum-based generalized mean function. Different cases for prediction values were evaluated based on two-set interval-based partitioning to get accurate results. The novelty of the method lies in its ability to approximate a fuzzy relation for forecasting that provides lesser complexity and higher accuracy in linear, cubic, and quadratic order than the existing methods. A lesser complexity as compared to dynamic data approximation makes it easier to find the suitable de-fuzzification process and obtain accurate predicted values.

Backpropagation (BP) neural networks have demonstrated remarkable ability in many prediction scenarios. However, directly utilizing BP neural networks in soil nutrient prediction may not yield promising results due to the random assignment of initial weights and thresholds and the tendency to fall into local extreme points. In this study, a BP neural network model optimized by an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) was proposed to predict soil nutrient time series with high accuracy. First, the crossover and mutation operations of the genetic algorithm (GA) were improved. Next, the IGA was used to optimize the BP model. The symmetric nature of the model lies in its feedforward and feedback connections, i.e., the same weights must be used for the forward and backward passes. An empirical evaluation was performed using annual soil nutrient data from China. Soil pH, total nitrogen, organic matter, fast-acting potassium, and effective phosphorus were selected as evaluation indicators. The prediction results of the IGA–BP, GA–BP, and BP neural network models were compared and analyzed. For the IGA–BP prediction model, the coefficient of determination for soil pH was 0.8, while those for total nitrogen, organic matter, fast-acting potassium, and effective phosphorus were all greater than 0.98, exhibiting a strong generalization ability. The root-mean-square errors of the IGA–BP prediction models were reduced to 50% of the BP models. The results indicated that the IGA–BP method can accurately predict soil nutrient content for future time series. © 2023 by the authors.","BP neural network; genetic algorithm; improved genetic algorithm BP; soil nutrient prediction",,Article,Scopus

The agricultural industry is one of the world’s most important industries, and it is critical to the achievement of the SDGs. The second major aspect of the SDGs, i.e., zero hunger, addresses food security (SDG 2). To measure the status of food security, accurate statistics on paddy production must be accessible. Paddy phenological classification is a way to determine a food plant’s growth phase. Imbalanced data are a common occurrence in agricultural data, and machine learning is frequently utilized as a technique for classification issues. The current trend in agriculture is to use remote sensing data to classify crops. This paper proposes a new approach—one that uses two phases in the bootstrap stage of the random forest method—called a two-phase stratified random forest (TPSRF). The simulation scenario shows that the proposed TPSRF outperforms CART, SVM, and RF. Furthermore, in its application to paddy growth phase data for 2019 in Lamongan Regency, East Java, Indonesia, the proposed TPSRF showed higher overall accuracy (OA) than the compared methods. © 2022 by the authors.","classification; data imbalance; paddy phenology; sustainable development goals; two-phase stratified random forest","accessibility; agricultural market; classification; food security; growth rate; phenology; remote sensing; satellite data; Sustainable Development Goal; East Java; Indonesia",Article,Scopus

Although the main effects of G and E are typically larger and easier to model, the GEI interaction effects are important and a critical factor when considering such issues as to why some genotypes perform consistently well across a range of environments. In plant breeding, a major challenge is limited information, including a single genotype is tested in only a small subset of all possible test environments. The two-way table of phenotype responses will therefore commonly contain missing data. In this paper, we propose a new model of GEI effects that only requires an input of a two-way table of phenotype observations, with genotypes as rows and environments as columns that do not assume the completeness of data. Our analysis can deal with this scenario as it utilizes a novel biclustering algorithm that can handle missing values, resulting in an output of homogeneous cells with no interactions between G and E. In other words, we identify subsets of genotypes and environments where phenotype can be modeled simply. Based on this, we fit no-interaction models to predict phenotypes of a given crop and draw insights into how a particular cultivar will perform in the unused test environments. Our new methodology is validated on data from different plant species and phenotypes and shows superior performance compared to well-studied statistical approaches.

Hence, it is necessary to quickly filter out an optimal dataset from massive dataset to support various remote sensing applications. However, with the improvements in temporal and spatial resolution, remote sensing data have become fragmented, which brings challenges to data retrieval. At present, most data service platforms rely on the query engines to retrieve data. Retrieval results still have a large amount of data with a high degree of overlap, which must be manually selected for further processing. This process is very labour-intensive and time-consuming. This paper proposes an improved coverage-oriented retrieval algorithm that aims to retrieve an optimal image combination with the minimum number of images closest to the imaging time of interest while maximized covering the target area.

There is an existing problem when extracting water temperature information from harvesters: Data redundancy and the loss of time series feature. To solve such problem, a Convolutional denoising autoencoder and Long-Short Term Memory Artificial Neural Network (CDAE-LSTM) hybrid model based on parameter migration is proposed to predict temperature trends. Firstly, the historical data of the combine harvester are taken into account to perform correlation analysis to verify the input rationality of the proposed model. Secondly, pre-training has been performed to determine the model's initial migration parameters, along with the adoption of CDAE to denoise and reconstruct the input data. Finally, after the migration, the CNN-LSTM hybrid model was trained with a real dataset and was able to predict the cooling water temperature. The accuracy of the model has been verified by field test data gathered in June 2019. Results show that the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the model is 0.0817, and the mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.0989. Compared with the performance of LSTM on the prediction data, the RMSE improvement rate is 2.272 %, and the MAE improvement rate is 20.113 %.

Due to this, more electrical power is being consumed in Data Centers therefore Data Center power &amp; cooling management has become quite an important and challenging task. Direct impacting aspects affecting the power energy of data centers are power and commensurate cooling losses. It is difficult to optimise the Power Usage Efficiency (PUE) of the Data Center using conventional methods which essentially need knowledge of each Data Center facility and specific equipment and its working. Hence, a novel optimization approach is necessary to optimise the power and cooling in the data center. This research work is performed by varying the temperature in the data center through a machine learning-based linear regression optimization technique. From the research, the ideal temperature is identified with high accuracy based on the prediction technique evolved out of the available data. With the proposed model, the PUE of the data center can be easily analysed and predicted based on temperature changes maintained in the Data Center. As the temperature is raised from 19.73 oC to 21.17 oC, then the cooling load is decreased in the range 607 KW to 414 KW.

But one of the problems with the approaches so far, is the difficulty in getting a training dataset that is representative of the measurements done by the sensor. Additionally, extracting multiple parameters from a single measurement has been so far an impossible problem to solve efficiently in luminescence. In this work a new approach is described for building an autonomous intelligent sensor, which is able to produce the training dataset self-sufficiently, use it for training a neural network, and then use the trained model to do inference on measurements done on the same hardware.

In this study, we compared parametric and nonparametric methods for estimating size-density relationships for Japanese cedar plantations in Taiwan. Specifically, we compared the efficacy of two segmented regression models with the penalized spline and random forest for regression methods. We also examined various stages in stand development for old-growth Japanese cedar stands. Data collected from 237 Japanese cedar permanent plots were used in model fitting and validation. Results indicated that the parametric and nonparametric methods used in this study can provide reliable estimates of the size-density relationship for Japanese cedar. Higher accuracy was achieved before the stands diverged from the self-thinning line. The penalized spline approach behaved consistently well regardless of datasets or stages in stand development, while the predictability of the random forest algorithm slightly decreased when the validation data was fitted.

The key objective was to develop understanding on site-specific suitability of the Mid Elevation Spray Application (MESA) and Low Elevation Spray Application (LESA) sprinkler systems in irrigating corn crop and potential water as well as energy savings. Aerial data was collected through small UAS flights at 100 m height above ground level and on 49, 59, 65, 77, 105, 114, 134 days after planting (DAP). Small UAS had 5-band multispectral and radiometric thermal imager on-board the platform. Custom image processing algorithms were developed to extract various vegetation indices (Normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI], Green NDVI [GNDVI] and Normalized difference red edge [NDRE]) and canopy temperature maps from the imagery data. Two sample T-test was performed on extracted data to understand significant difference, at 5% level, within the LESA and MESA treatments. For both the irrigation techniques, the crop vigor increased in the early growth stage (49, 65 DAP), peaked in the mid growth stage (77, 105, 114 DAP) and then decreased in the late growth stage (134 DAP). The MESA irrigated sections had higher vigor (NDVI, GNDVI, NDRE), but not significant, compared to LESA throughout the season. Similarly, the MESA irrigated areas had significantly (0.61–2.07 °C) cooler canopies than LESA. Such results were anticipated, in part due to the issues with the sprinkler heads used in LESA.

To this end, a 167&thinsp;ha catchment was delineated consisting of 10 hydrological response units. Daily data for streamflow and nitrate loadings from 2004 to 2015 were used to calibrate and validate the model, while annual values for crop yields (winter wheat, winter barley, rapeseed, maize silage) were available. In addition, the detailed field maps provided by the local farmer were used to implement exact crop rotations and nitrogen fertilization into the model. Nash-Sutcliffe-Efficiencies for streamflow were 0.54 during the calibration and 0.57 for the validation period. The modeling performance for nitrate loadings were lower with 0.31 for the calibration and 0.42 for the validation period. The average crop yields were reproduced well, while SWAT failed to reproduce the inter-annual crop yield variations. A scenario analysis revealed that a slight decrease of nitrogen fertilization leads to significant reductions in nitrate loadings, while crop yields remained on a high level. The outcome of the study may help practitioners to operate according to an economic and environmental optimal N management. Nevertheless, experimental studies with varying fertilization intensities at catchment scale are needed to underpin the modeling results. © Author(s) 2019.",,"agricultural catchment; crop yield; fertilizer application; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; nitrate; nutrient enrichment; prediction; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; Germany; Brassica napus; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

A necessary condition is the assessment and analysis of current trends in changing the characteristics of contrasting groups of varieties. The aim of the study is to identify homogeneous groups of varieties of an ampelographic collection and to compare the rates of reaction of their agrobiological parameters to climate changes. Material for the study consists of observations of 21 agrobiological characteristics of 109 grape varieties from the Don ampelographic collection named after Ya.I. Potapenko (Novocherkassk) with an observation period from 10 to 36 years in 1981–2017. The sample included Vitis vinifera L. varieties and the V. vinifera L. × V. labrusca L. and V. vinifera L. × V. amurensis Rupr. interspecific hybrids, and hybrids from crosses between V. vinifera L. and several American species. Homogeneous groups of characteristics and varieties are identified by principal component analysis (PCA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods. Trends in changing the agrobiological characteristics of the varieties and groups of varieties are calculated. PCA revealed that the main differentiating factor of the studied fragment of the ampelographic collection is the size of the bunch; the second, the yield; the third, the time of ripening. The values of the factors are contrasting in varieties of different directions of use and taxonomic origin, which was confirmed by ANOVA. The groups of the V. vinifera × V. labrusca and V. vinifera × V. amurensis hybrids do not differ significantly from each other in most indicators, exceeding V. vinifera varieties in the number of elements of productivity, winter hardiness and yield. Complex hybrids with American species have an intermediate position between these groups exceeding all groups in bunch weight. All groups of cultivars show trends towards a reduction in productive period, an increase in the mass of bunch and yield, sugar content and a decrease in acidity. The V. vinifera × V. labrusca hybrids are distinguished by the highest growth rate of the bunch mass caused by a reduction in the duration of active growth and a decrease in the percentage of fruit-bearing shoots. A higher reduction rate of the production period and a decrease in acidity were observed in later varieties. Regression analysis showed that the acceleration of the ripening of grapes is largely due to rising temperatures. © Novikova L.Yu., Naumova L.G., 2019.","Adaptability; Agrometeorology; Ampelographic collection; Climate change; Information system; Time series",,Article,Scopus

Consequently, analyzing the fuel consumption of agricultural machinery for farm operations of different sizes makes it possible to predict fuel consumption to set an appropriate budget for energy. The main purpose of this study was to determine the ability of the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the fuel consumption of tractor-chisel plow systems correctly. A training-set design of 139 points of 173 data points obtained from the literature was utilized, and the remaining 34 data points were applied as a test set. The input parameters were tractor power, plowing width, depth and speed of plowing, soil percentages of sand, silt, and clay, initial soil moisture content, and initial soil bulk density. The predictive power of the KNN method was compared with that of multiple linear regression (MLR), and experimental data were used to determine the predictive power of both methods. The KNN method generated better results than the multiple linear regression method. The test dataset correlation coefficients were 0.817 for the KNN (k = 2) method and 0.422 for the multiple linear regression method. This study suggests that the KNN method with k = 2 (two nearest neighbors) is suitable for estimating the fuel consumption of tractor-chisel plow systems for input values within the studied range. © Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Agricola.","Chisel plow; Fuel consumption; K-nearest neighbors; Machine-learning algorithms; Prediction; Tillage",,Article,Scopus

Farmers can fly their UAV spraying pesticides around their crop fields while staying at their remote control room or any place that is separated from their farm land. However, there is a common phenomenon in rice planting management stage that some empty areas are randomly located in farmland. Therefore, a critical problem is that the waste of pesticides that occurs when spraying pesticides over rice fields with empty areas by using the common UAV, because it is difficult to control the flow accuracy based on the empty areas changing. To tackle this problem, a novel vision-based spraying system was proposed that can identify empty areas automatically while spraying a precise amount of pesticides on the target regions. By this approach, the image was preprocessed with the Lucy-Richardson algorithm, then the target area was split from the background with k-means and the feature parameters were extracted, finally the feature parameters were filtered out with a positive contribution which would serve as the input parameters of the support vector machine (SVM) to identify the target area. Also a fuzzy control model was analyzed and exerted to compensate the nonlinearity and hysteresis of the variable rate spraying system. Experimental results proved that the approach was applicable to reducing the amount of pesticides during UAV spraying, which can provide a reference for precision agriculture aviation in the future. © 2019, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Study focus: Climate change is projected to have significant impacts on agricultural production. Therefore, understanding the regional impacts of climate change on irrigation demand for crop production is important for watershed managers and agricultural producers to understand for effective water resources management. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool was used to assess the impact of climate change on corn and soybean irrigation demand in the Kalamazoo River Watershed. Bias-corrected statistically downscaled climate change data from ten global climate models and four emissions scenarios were used in SWAT to develop projections of irrigation demand and yields for 2020-2039 and 2060-2079. Six adaptation scenarios were developed to shift the planting dates (planting earlier and later in the growing season) to take advantage of periods with greater rainfall or lower temperature increases. New hydrological insights for the region: Uncertainty in irrigation demand was found to increase moving from 2020-2039 to 2060-2079, with demand generally decreasing moving further into the future for corn and soybean. A shift in timing of peak irrigation demand and increases in temperature lead to corn yield reductions. However, soybean yield increased under these conditions. Finally, the adaptation strategy of planting earlier increased irrigation demand and water available for transpiration, while delaying planting resulted in demand decreases for both crops. © 2014 The Authors.","Adaptation; Climate change; Crop yield; Irrigation demand; SWAT; Uncertainty","Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

LAI measurements, spectral data derived from two SPOT data acquired on August 24, 2008 and August 23, 2009 and observed rice yield were used as main inputs for rice yield modeling. Each remotely sensed factor was used separately and in combination with LAI to generate the models. The results showed that green spectral band, middle infra-red spectral band and green vegetation index (GVI) did not show sufficient capability as rice yield estimators while other inputs such as red spectral band, near infrared spectral band and vegetation indices that are algebraic ratios from these two spectral bands when used separately or in combined with leaf area index (LAI) produced high accurate rice yield estimation models.

Then we demonstrate the model's performance for the period 2008-2019 over corn and soybean fields in the midwestern United States, which suffer frequent damage from recurrent flooding. We fed the network with remote sensing images and weather fields and divide the growing season into two windows, the early season (May-June) and the late season (July-November) for better performance. The results show mean relative error within ± 25% and relative root mean square error within 35%-75% in majority of the counties for most years. Finally, we show that the model forced with meteorological variables alone can provide acceptable accuracy, which indicates it can be applied to forecasting crop damage area in the upcoming season or the studying of future climate impact on crop productivity.

At present, research on orchard classification based on optical images in complex mountain areas is vulnerable to the influence of cloudy weather, especially in the summer, which leads to a lack of key phenological characteristics. To solve this problem, a parcel-level orchard mapping experiment with an irregular time series was carried out in Qixia City, China. Firstly, the candidate parcels in the study area were extracted from VHR images with a spatial resolution of 0.55 m based on RCF and DABNet models. The F1 score and area-based intersection-over-union (IoU) of the parcel extraction results were calculated. When the boundary buffer radius was 1 m, the F1 score was 0.93. When the radius was 2 m, the F1 score was 0.96. The IoU was 0.872, which shows the effectiveness of the parcel extraction method. Then, based on Sentinel-2 data, the NDVI, EVI, and SAVI vegetation indexes were calculated to construct an irregular time series. A two-dimensional CNN model was used for classification. In order to verify the effectiveness of this method, the study also constructed regular time series for the study area and conducted classification experiments using the 2DCNN and LSTM as classifiers, respectively. Confusion matrices were constructed for the classification results, and the overall accuracy was calculated. The results show that the overall accuracy of the method based on irregular time series is 97.76%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.96, higher than the other experiments, which indicates that the classification method based on irregular time series is effective and can make full use of the fragmented spectral features. Finally, based on the candidate parcels and pixel-level classification results of the study area, the crop categories of the parcels were filled to achieve accurate parcel-level mapping of horticultural crops in complex mountain areas. This method can provide a theoretical reference for orchard crop mapping and serves the development of regional precision agriculture. © 2022 by the authors.","2DCNN; deep leaning; horticultural crop orchard; irregular time-series data; map-level mapping; precise parcel extraction","Crops; Geometrical optics; Image resolution; Landforms; Long short-term memory; Mapping; Orchards; Time series; 2DCNN; Deep leaning; Horticultural crop orchard; Horticultural crops; Irregular time series; Irregular time-series data; Level mapping; Map-level mapping; Precise parcel extraction; Time-series data; Extraction",Article,Scopus

Moreover, cotton and soybean are cultivated together in some areas, further increasing the difficulty of cotton extraction. In this paper, an innovative method for cotton area estimation using Sentinel-2 images, land use status data (LUSD), and field survey data is proposed. Three areas in Hubei province (i.e., Jingzhou, Xiaogan, and Huanggang) were used as research sites to test the performance of the proposed extraction method. First, the Sentinel-2 images were spatially constrained using LUSD categories of irrigated land and dry land. Seven classification schemes were created based on spectral features, vegetation index (VI) features, and texture features, which were then used to generate the SVM classifier. To minimize misclassification between cotton and soybean fields, the cotton and soybean separation index (CSSDI) was introduced based on the red band and red-edge band of Sentinel-2. The configuration combining VI and spectral features yielded the best cotton extraction results, with F1 scores of 86.93%, 80.11%, and 71.58% for Jingzhou, Xiaogan, and Huanggang. When CSSDI was incorporated, the F1 score for Huanggang increased to 79.33%. An alternative approach using LUSD for non-target sample augmentation was also introduced. The method was used for Huangmei county, resulting in an F1 score of 78.69% and an area error of 7.01%.

However, a correctly selected hyperparameter combined with neural network architecture could highly increase the final metrics. Therefore, the hyperparameters optimization problem becomes a key issue in a deep learning algorithm. The process of finding a suitable hyperparameter combination could be performed manually or automatically. Manual search is based on previous research and requires enormous human efforts. However, there are many automated hyperparameter optimization methods have been successfully applied in practice. The automated hyperparameter tuning techniques are divided into two groups: black-box optimization techniques (such as Grid Search, Random Search) and multi-fidelity optimization techniques (HyperBand, BOHB). The most recent and promising among all approaches is BOHB which, which combines both Bayesian optimization and bandit-based methods, outperforms classical approaches, and can run asynchronously with given GPU resources and time budget that plays a vital role in the hyperparameter optimization process. The previous study proposed a convolutional deep learning neural network for solving land cover classification problems in the EuroSAT dataset. It was found that adding spectral indexes NDVI, NDWI, and GNDVI with RGB channels increased the result accuracy (from 64.72% to 84.19%) and F1 (from 63.89 % to 84.05%) score. However, the convolutional neural network architecture and hyperparameter combination were selected manually. The research optimizes convolutional neural network architecture and finds suitable hyperparameter combinations applied to land cover classification problems using multispectral images.

Data of Sentinel satellites, gridded weather data, and Mobile-app based field data were analyzed to generate paddy crop map and crop health indicators, namely NDVI, LSWI, Backscatter and FAPAR for the current (2020) and past years (2016-2019). Using the metrics derived from these indices and entropy technique, a composite index of crop performance called Crop Health Factor (CHF), ranging from 0-1, was generated. Deviations of CHF and yield between the years showed good correlation. The CHF data has successfully replaced the yield data for indemnity and pay-out assessments in 2020, as notified by the Government in advance. Thus, this project makes an entry point for developing remote sensing based transformative crop insurance solutions to enhance risk transfer in agriculture which perhaps the most plausible way forward. © 2022 The Author(s).

To develop non-destructive estimation methods of tea quality-related metabolites in fresh leaves, we estimated the contents of free amino acids, catechins, and caffeine in fresh tea leaves using visible to short-wave infrared hyperspectral reflectance data and machine learning algorithms. We acquired these data from approximately 200 new leaves with various status and then constructed the regression model in the combination of six spectral patterns with pre-processing and five algorithms. In most phenotypes, the combination of de-trending pre-processing and Cubist algorithms was robustly selected as the best combination in each round over 100 repetitions that were evaluated based on the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) values. The mean RPD values were ranged from 1.1 to 2.7 and most of them were above the acceptable or accurate threshold (RPD = 1.4 or 2.0, respectively). Data-based sensitivity analysis identified the important hyperspectral regions around 1500 and 2000 nm.

Cultivar differences can significantly influence potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tuber yield prediction using remote sensing technologies. The objective of this study was to improve potato yield prediction using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing by incorporating cultivar information with machine learning methods. Small plot experiments involving different cultivars and nitrogen (N) rates were conducted in 2018 and 2019. UAV-based multi-spectral images were collected throughout the growing season. Machine learning models, i.e., random forest regression (RFR) and support vector regression (SVR), were used to combine different vegetation indices with cultivar information. It was found that UAV-based spectral data from the early growing season at the tuber initiation stage (late June) were more correlated with potato marketable yield than the spectral data from the later growing season at the tuber maturation stage. However, the best performing vegetation indices and the best timing for potato yield prediction varied with cultivars. The performance of the RFR and SVR models using only remote sensing data was unsatisfactory (R2 = 0.48–0.51 for validation) but was significantly improved when cultivar information was in-corporated (R2 = 0.75–0.79 for validation). It is concluded that combining high spatial-resolution UAV images and cultivar information using machine learning algorithms can significantly improve potato yield prediction than methods without using cultivar information. More studies are needed to improve potato yield prediction using more detailed cultivar information, soil and landscape variables, and management information, as well as more advanced machine learning models. © 2021 by the authors.

In order to further improve the accuracy of estimating winter wheat yield through remote sensing, this study analyzed the quantitative relationship between satellite remote sensing variables obtained from HJ-CCD images and the winter wheat yield, and used the partial least square (PLS) algorithm to construct and validate the multivariate remote sensing models of estimating the yield. The research showed a close relationship between yield and most remote sensing variables. Significant multiple correlations were also recorded between most remote sensing variables. The optimal principal components numbers of PLS models used to estimate yield were 4. Green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI) were sensitive variables for yield remote sensing estimation. Through model development and model validation evaluation, the yield estimation model’s coefficients of determination (R2) were 0.81 and 0.74 respectively. The root mean square error (RMSE) were 693.9 kg ha−1 and 786.5 kg ha−1. It showed that the PLS algorithm model estimates the yield better than the linear regression (LR) and principal components analysis (PCA) algorithms. The estimation accuracy was improved by more than 20% than the LR algorithm, and was 13% higher than the PCA algorithm. The results could provide an effective way to improve the estimation accuracy of winter wheat yield by remote sensing, and was conducive to large-area application and promotion. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"article; least square analysis; linear regression analysis; nonhuman; principal component analysis; quantitative analysis; remote sensing; senescence; soil; vegetation; winter wheat",Article,Scopus

The recently developed simulated observation of point cloud (SOPC) method can generate high spatial resolution winter wheat effective leaf area index (SOPC-LAIe) maps from the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based point cloud data without ground-based measurements. In this study, the SOPC-LAIe maps, for the first time, were applied to the simple algorithm for yield estimation (SAFY) to generate the sub-field biomass and yield maps. First, the dry aboveground biomass (DAM) measurements were used to determine the crop cultivar-specific parameters and simulated green leaf area index (LAI) in the SAFY model. Then, the SOPC-LAIe maps were converted to green LAI using a normalization approach. Finally, the multiple SOPC-LAIe maps were applied to the SAFY model to generate the final DAM and yield maps. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the estimated and measured yield is 88 g/m2, and the relative root mean squire error (RRMSE) is 15.2%. The pixel-based DAM and yield map generated in this study revealed clearly the within-field yield variation.

This information consists of satellite multi-band images, local soil samples obtained from national databases, local weather as well as field data from 23 farms cultivating winter wheat in southern Sweden. This is inherently a large multi-scale problem due to the large temporal and spatial variation of the input data. We aggregate the data on spatially averaged features over grids which temporally span a seasonal timeline from seeding to harvest. Data cleaning is performed through interpolation for satellite images due to cloud obstructions. Furthermore data is heavily imbalanced since the amount of satellite information far exceeds that of the ground data. Data variance therefore can be an issue which we counter by using a decision tree approach. We find that the Light Gradient Boosting decision tree trained on 262 input features is able to predict winter wheat yield with 82% accuracy. Subsequently we employ game theory in order to better understand the relational importance of specific input features towards forecasting yield. Specifically we find that some of the most important features towards the resulting predictions are the percent clay and magnesium in the soil. Similarly the most important features from the satellite data are: a) the NORM index (Euclidean distance of all bands) computed in the second week of April, b) the NORM index computed in the middle of May as well as c) the second spectral band from the last week of June. © 2022 The Authors","Decision trees; Relational importance; Satellite; Shapley values; Soil samples; Winter wheat yield",,Article,Scopus

Frequently, the total number of coffee beans per area unit is estimated manually by physically counting the coffee cherries, the branches, or the flowers. However, estimating yield requires an investment in time and work, so it is not usual for small producers. This paper studies a non-intrusive and attainable alternative to predicting coffee crop yield through multispectral aerial images. The proposal is designed for small low-tech producers monitored by capturing aerial photos with a MapIR camera on an unmanned aerial vehicle. This research shows how to predict yields in the early stages of the coffee tree productive cycle, such as at flowering by using aerial imagery. Physical and spectral descriptors were evaluated as predictors for yield prediction models. The results showed correlations between the selected predictors and 370 yield samples of a Colombian Arabica coffee crop. The coffee tree volume, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the Coffee Ripeness Index (CRI) showed the highest values with 71%, 55%, and 63%, respectively. Further, these predictors were used as the inputs for regression models to analyze their precision in predicting coffee crop yield. The validation stage concluded that Linear Regression and Stochastic Descending Gradient Regression were better models with determination coefficient values of 56% and 55%, respectively, which are promising for predicting yield. © 2023 by the authors.","coffee; crop yield; image segmentation; MapIR; multispectral; predictor; UAV","Aerial photography; Antennas; Crops; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial imagery; Colombia; Crop yield; Images segmentations; MapIR; Multi-spectral; Predictor; Production process; Tree-based; Yield prediction; Image segmentation",Article,Scopus

Based on the results of YE, the farmers can make a better decision on the harvesting period, prevention strategies for crop disease, subsequent follow-up for cultivation practice, etc. In the current scenario, crop YE is performed manually, which has many limitations such as the requirement of experts for the bigger fields, subjective decisions and a more time-consuming process. To overcome these issues, an intelligent YE system was proposed which detects, localizes and counts the number of tomatoes in the field using SegNet with VGG19 (a deep learning-based semantic segmentation architecture). The dataset of 672 images was given as an input to the SegNet with VGG19 architecture for training. It extracts features corresponding to the tomato in each layer and detection was performed based on the feature score. The results were compared against the other semantic segmentation architectures such as U-Net and SegNet with VGG16. The proposed method performed better and unveiled reasonable results.

In Saudi Arabia (SA), agriculture relies on groundwater, seasonal water, desalinated water, and recycled water due to a lack of surface water resources, a dry environment, and scanty rainfall. Estimating water consumption to plan crop water requirements (CWR) in changing environments is difficult due to a lack of micro-level data on water consumption, particularly in agricultural systems. High-resolution satellite data combined with environmental data provides a valuable tool for computing the CWR. This study aimed to estimate the CWR with a greater spatial and temporal resolution and localized field data and environmental variables. Obtaining this at the field level is appropriate, but geospatial technology can produce repeatable, time-series phenomena and align with environmental data for wider coverage regions. The CWR in the study area has been investigated through two methods: firstly, based on the high-resolution PlanetScope (PS) data, and secondly, using the FAO CROPWAT model v8.0. The analysis revealed that evapotranspiration (ETo) showed a minimum response of 2.22 mm/day in January to a maximum of 6.13 mm/day in July, with high temperatures (42.8). The humidity reaches a peak of 51%, falling to a minimum in June of 15%. Annual CWR values (in mm) for seven crops studied in the present investigation, including date palm, wheat, citrus, maize, barley, clover, and vegetables, were 1377, 296, 964, 275, 259, 1077, 214, respectively. The monthly averaged CWR derived using PS showed a higher correlation (r = 0.83) with CROPWAT model results. The study was promising and highlighted that such analysis is decisive and can be implemented in any region by using Machine Learning and Deep Learning for in-depth insights. © 2022 by the authors.","agriculture; CWR; evapotranspiration; Saudi Arabia","arid region; climate change; evapotranspiration; machine learning; water use; Saudi Arabia",Article,Scopus

Some state-of-the-art fusion discriminations are used to identify stator SLG fault, but these methods extract fault features artificially, and application conditions are limited. Convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown superior automatic feature extraction ability in various fields, but it cannot directly extract features from one-dimensional time series vectors collected by powerformers. Therefore, this article proposed a novel SLG fault protection scheme based on the hub-and-spoke grid data converting algorithm (HSGC) and CNN. First, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients (PCCs) are used to calculate the correlations of one-dimensional time series vectors, establish a correspondence between them and the distance of two-dimensional grid cells, and then convert one-dimensional time series vectors to two-dimensional grid-structured data by HSGC. Second, the trained CNN automatically extracts the features of two-dimensional grid-structured data. Finally, the faulty powerformer can be identified based on the output of CNN. The proposed protection scheme is verified through the simulation of ATP-EMTP and Python. The results show that the scheme can accurately detect a faulty Powerformer under different conditions where neutral point is high-resistance or reactance grounding, even if fault resistance is 8,000 Ω.

This study investigated four spectral indices for high-resolution RGB images for segmenting yellow flower pixels. The study compared vegetation indices to digitally quantify canola flower area to develop a seed yield prediction model. A small plot (2.75 m × 6 m) experiment was conducted at Kernen Research Farm, Saskatoon, where canola was grown under six row spacings and eight seeding rates with four replicates (192 plots). The flower canopy reflectance was imaged using a high-resolution (0.15 cm ground sampling distance) 100 MP iXU 1000 RGB sensor mounted on an unpiloted aerial vehicle (UAV). The spectral indices were evaluated for their efficiency in identifying canola flower pixels using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Digitized flower pixel area was used as a predictor of seed yield to develop four models. Seventy percent of the data were used for model training and 30% for testing. Models were compared using performance metrics: coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean squared error (RMSE). The High-resolution Flowering Index (HrFI), a new flower index proposed in this study, was identified as the most accurate in detecting flower pixels, especially in high-resolution imagery containing within-canopy shadow pixels. There were strong, positive associations between digitized flower area and canola seed yield with the peak flowering timing having a greater R2 (0.82) compared to early flowering (0.72). Cumulative flower pixel area predicted 75% of yield. Our results indicate that the HrFI and Modified Yellowness Index (MYI) were better predictors of canola yield compared to the NDYI and RBNI (Red Blue Normalizing Index) as they were able to discriminate between canola petals and within-canopy shadows. We suggest further studies to evaluate the performance of the HrFI and MYI vegetation indices using medium-resolution UAV and satellite imagery. © 2022 by the authors.","high-resolution RGB; UAV; yellowness indices; yield prediction","Antennas; Discriminant analysis; Mean square error; Satellite imagery; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Aerial vehicle; High resolution; High-resolution RGB; Pixel areas; Seed yield; Spectral indices; Unpiloted aerial vehicle; Vegetation index; Yellowness indices; Yield prediction; Pixels",Article,Scopus

The climate model was examined in the historical period 1996–2015 for its ability to capture observed precipitation and temperature. Bias correction was performed on RCM temperature and precipitation to minimize the uncertainties that may occur from climate model projection. After the successful calibration and validation of the HBV hydrological model, streamflow was simulated for the periods of 2021–2040 and 2041–2060 and compared to streamflow of the baseline period 1996–2015 to investigate the changes. The results suggested that overall, following the precipitation increment, streamflow is expected to increase under both RCPs.

It becomes a difficult and time-consuming process for radiologists to do the manual identification and categorization of the tumour. It is a complex and time-consuming procedure conducted by radiologists or clinical professionals to remove the contaminated tumour region from magnetic resonance (MR) pictures. It is the goal of this study to improve the performance and reduce the complexity of the image segmentation process by investigating FCM predicted image segmentation procedures in order to reduce the intricacy of the process. Furthermore, relevant characteristics are collected from each segmented tissue and aligned as input to the classifiers for autonomous identification and relegation of encephalon cancers in order to increase the accuracy and quality rate of the neural network classifier. An evaluation, validation, and presentation of the experimental performance of the suggested approach have been completed. A unique APSO (accelerated particle swarm optimization) based artificial neural network model (ANNM) for the relegation of benign and malignant tumours is presented in this study effort, which allows for the automated identification and categorization of brain tumours. Using APSO training to improve the suggested ANNM model parameters would give a unique method to alleviate the stressful work of radiologists performing manual identification of encephalon cancers from MR images. The use of an APSO-based ANNM (artificial neural network model) model for automated brain tumour classification has been presented in order to demonstrate the resilience of the classification model. It has been suggested to utilise the improved enhanced fuzzy c means (IEnFCM) method for image segmentation, while the GLCM (gray level co-occurrence matrix) feature extraction approach has been employed for feature extraction from magnetic resonance imaging (MR pictures). © 2022 K.

Soil temperature is the most significant factor that influences the freezing depth. Therefore, monitoring and predicting this characteristic is crucial for frostbite protection. This study aims to predict soil temperature on cold days to prevent frostbite injury in crops. For this matter, we used the registered and logged hourly data by the HOBO U30 data logging device and predicted the soil temperature from air temperature, soil water content, and relative humidity. We used 80% of the data set for the training data and assigned the other 20% to the test data. RMSE and MSE were two of the evaluation criteria of the neural network in this study. Also, we calculated P-value and T-value for statistical hypothesis testing. In another approach for weighting the neural network, we used evolutionary algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization instead of the gradient-based methods. According to the results, Multi-layer perceptron neural network with the respective values 0.082 and 0.0068 for RMSE and MSE in training data and 0.085 and 0.0073 for RMSE and MSE in testing data proved to have a better performance in the soil temperature prediction compared to the ANN-GA and ANN-PSO models.

Can we use ML to find a variable that significantly affects the TCP throughput in WiFi? In this work, we employ a publicly available WiFi dataset to investigate these questions. We use ML techniques, including principal component analysis (PCA), linear regression (LR), and random forest (RF), to study the effect of link speed, received signal strength, round-trip time (RTT), and number of available access points on TCP throughput in WiFi. More specifically, we are interested in employing ML to find the variable that most accurately predicts and thereby most significantly affects the throughput. Simple correlation analysis indicates that a combination of multiple variables is more likely to act as a reasonable predictor of the throughput, whereas a single variable, such as RTT, alone is not likely to predict the throughput with reasonable accuracy. From PCA, the first principal component (PC1) is seen as highly correlated to RTT. During predictive analysis, it is observed that the LR model is unable to find any hidden relationship between throughput and other variables. However, the RF model discovers that RTT explains the variation in throughput more closely and as such it predicts the throughput more accurately compared to other variables. PC1 captures nearly all of the variation in throughput with the RF model and predicts throughput with very high accuracy, which indirectly confirms RTT as the variable that most significantly affects the TCP throughput in WiFi. Consequently, we discover a very close relationship between RTT and TCP throughput using appropriate ML techniques, and these results can be helpful in developing a better understanding of the relationship between latency and throughput for designing future low-latency networks. © 2021, The Author(s).","Machine learning; Random forest; Round-trip time; TCP throughput; WiFi","Decision trees; Flow control; Principal component analysis; Transmission control protocol; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Link speed; Machine learning techniques; Principal-component analysis; Random forest modeling; Random forests; Regression forests; Round-trip-time; TCP throughput; Wi Fi networks; Wifi; Machine learning",Article,Scopus

The rice production mainly depends on climatic parameters such as rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed etc. If the farmers can get the timely advice on variation of climatic condition, they can take appropriate action to increase the rice production. This factor motivate us to prepare a computational model for the farmers and ultimately to the society also. The main contribution of this work is to present a classifier ensemble based prediction model by considering the original rice yield and climatic datasets of coastal districts Odisha namely Balasore, Cuttack and Puri for the period of 1983 to 2014 for Rabi and Kharif seasons. This ensemble method uses five diversified classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbour, Naive Bayesian, Decision Tree, and Linear Discriminant Analysis. This is an iterative approach; where at each iteration one classifier acts as main classifier and other four classifiers are used as base classifiers whose output has been considered after taking the majority voting. The performance measure increases 95.38% to 98.10% and 95.38% to 98.10% for specificity, 88.48% to 96.25% and 83.60% to 94.81% for both sensitivity and precision and 91.78% to 97.17% and 74.48% to 88.59% for AUC for Rabi and Kharif seasons dataset of Balasore district and also same improvement in Puri and Cuttack District.

The proposed model utilizes as inputs three different kinds of data (soil data, cultivation management data, and yield management data) which are treated and handled independently. The significant advantages of the selected architecture are that it is able to efficiently exploit mixed data, which usually requires being processed separately, reduces overfitting, and provides more flexibility and adaptivity for low computational cost compared to a classical fully-connected neural network.

At this time, data related to rice avaibility is still spread across several agencies and difficult to access easily and quickly to support strategic and rapid decision making. This data is the level of fertility of rice plants, fertilizers and water content at certain locations and times. Fertilizers, new superior varieties and water content are production factors that are vital in supporting the efforts to increase national rice production. New superior varieties including hybrid rice are generally responsive to macro fertilizers NPC (Nitrogen-Phosporus-Calcium), where fertilization efficiency and effectiveness is very dependent on local location. The use of fertilizers with excessive doses must be prevented by socializing the right dosage specifically for location and time. The use of fertilizers with high doses of nitrogen also results in plants being more susceptible to plant pests.

However, some studies have raised concerns as to whether the function is able to adequately simulate representative irrigation practices. In this study, observations of climate, irrigation, evapotranspiration (ET), leaf area index (LAI), and crop yield derived from an irrigated lysimeter field at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory at Bushland, Texas were used to evaluate the efficacy of the SWAT auto-irrigation functions. Results indicated good agreement between simulated and observed daily ET during both model calibration (2001-2005) and validation (2006-2010) periods for the baseline scenario (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency; NSE ≥ 0.80). The auto-irrigation scenarios resulted in reasonable ET simulations under all the thresholds of soil water deficit (SWD) triggers as indicated by NSE values > 0.5.

Data from the yield monitor was used to generate yield maps, which illustrated a definite spatial variation in alfalfa yield across the experimental field for the four studied harvests as indicated by the high spatial correlation values (0.75 to 0.97) and the low P-values (4.7E-103 to 8.9E-27). The yield monitor-measured alfalfa actual yield was compared to the predicted yield form the Vis. Results of the study showed that there was a correlation between actual and predicted yield. The highest correlations were observed between actual yield and the predicted using NIR reflectance, SAVI and NDVI with maximum correlation coefficients of 0.69, 0.68 and 0.63, respectively. © 2016 Kayad et al.

The challenge of increasing crop yield while ensuring sustainable development of environmentally friendly agriculture is a common issue through-out the world. Autonomous systems, sensing technologies, and artificial intelligence offer great opportunities to tackle this issue. In precision agriculture (PA), non-destructive and non-invasive remote and proximal sensing methods have been widely used to observe crops in visible and invisible spectra. Nowadays, the integration of high-performance imagery sensors (e.g., RGB, multispec-tral, hyperspectral, thermal, and SAR) and unmanned mobile platforms (e.g., satellites, UAVs, and terrestrial agricultural robots) are yielding a huge number of high-resolution farmland images, in which rich crop information is compressed. However, this has been accompanied by challenges, i.e., ways to swiftly and efficiently making full use of these images, and then, to perform fine crop management based on information-supported decision making. In the past few years, deep learning (DL) has shown great potential to reshape many industries because of its powerful capabilities of feature learning from massive datasets, and the agriculture industry is no exception. More and more agricultural scientists are paying attention to applications of deep learning in image-based farmland observations, such as land mapping, crop classification, biotic/abiotic stress monitoring, and yield prediction. To provide an update on these studies, we conducted a comprehensive investigation with a special emphasis on deep learning in multiscale agricultural remote and proximal sensing. Specifically, the applications of convolutional neural network-based supervised learning (CNN-SL), transfer learning (TL), and few-shot learning (FSL) in crop sensing at land, field, canopy, and leaf scales are the focus of this review. We hope that this work can act as a reference for the global agricultural community regarding DL in PA and can inspire deeper and broader research to promote the evolution of modern agriculture. © 2022 by the authors.

Although many remote sensing approaches have been developed to estimate maize yields, few have been tested under lodging conditions. Thus, the feasibility of existing approaches under lodging conditions and the influence of lodging on maize yield estimates both remain unclear. To address this situation, this study develops a lodging index to quantify the degree of lodging. The index is based on RGB and multispectral images obtained from a low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle and proves to be an important predictor variable in a random forest regression (RFR) model for accurately estimating maize yield after lodging. The results show that (1) the lodging index accurately describes the degree of lodging of each maize plot, (2) the yield-estimation model that incorporates the lodging index provides slightly more accurate yield estimates than without the lodging index at three important growth stages of maize (tasseling, milking, denting), and (3) the RFR model with lodging index applied at the denting (R5) stage yields the best performance of the three growth stages, with R2 = 0.859, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1086.412 kg/ha, and a relative RMSE of 13.1%. This study thus provides valuable insight into the precise estimation of crop yield and demonstra\tes that incorporating a lodging stress-related variable into the model leads to accurate and robust estimates of crop grain yield.

We also tested the influence of adjusting the quantity of local fertilization and irrigation on crop production in Guizhou Province. Results showed that the total yield of the selected crops had, on average, reached over 72.5% of the theoretical maximum yield. Increasing irrigation tended to be more consistently effective at increasing crop yield than additional fertilization. Conversely, appropriate reduction of fertilization may even benefit crop yield in some regions, simultaneously resulting in significantly higher fertilization efficiency with lower residuals in the environment. The total positive impact of continuous intensification of irrigation and fertilization on most crop species was limited.

We implemented a remote sensing and evapotranspiration-based light use efficiency model globally and integrated abiotic environmental stressors (temperature, soil moisture, and vapor deficit stressors). The operational model (Global Yield Mapper in Earth Engine (GYMEE)) was validated against actual yield data for three agricultural schemes with different climatic, soil, and management conditions located in Lebanon, Brazil, and Spain. Field-level crop yield data on wheat, potato, and corn for 2015–2020 were used for assessment. The performance of GYMEE was statistically evaluated through root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean bias error (MBE), relative error (RE), and index of agreement (d). The results showed that the absolute difference between the modeled and predicted field-level yield was within ±16% for the analyzed crops in both Brazil and Lebanon study sites and within ±15% in the Spain site (except for two fields). GYMEE performed best for wheat crop in Lebanon with a low RMSE (0.6 t/ha), MAE (0.5 t/ha), MBE (−0.06 t/ha), and RE (0.83%). A very good agreement was observed for all analyzed crop yields, with an index of agreement (d) averaging at 0.8 in all studied sites. GYMEE shows potential in providing yield estimates for potato, wheat, and corn yields at a relative error of ±6%. We also quantified and spatialized the soil moisture stress constraint and its impact on reducing biomass production. A showcasing of moisture stress impact on two emphasized fields from the Lebanon site revealed that a 12% difference in soil moisture stress can decrease yield by 17%. A comparison between the 2017 and 2018 seasons for the potato culture of Lebanon showed that the 2017 season with lower abiotic stresses had higher light use efficiency, above-ground biomass, and yield by 5%, 10%, and 9%, respectively.

Thus, it is difficult for deep learning models to detect and distinguish every weed species with high accuracy. Training convolutional neural networks for detecting weeds susceptible to herbicides can offer a new strategy for implementing site-specific weed detection in turf. DenseNet, EfficientNet-v2, and ResNet showed high F1 scores (≥0.986) and MCC values (≥0.984) to detect and distinguish the sub-images containing dollarweed, goosegrass, old world diamond-flower, purple nutsedge, or Virginia buttonweed growing in bermudagrass turf. However, they failed to reliably detect crabgrass and tropical signalgrass due to the similarity in plant morphology. When training the convolutional neural networks for detecting and distinguishing the sub-images containing weeds susceptible to ACCase-inhibitors, weeds susceptible to ALS-inhibitors, or weeds susceptible to synthetic auxin herbicides, all neural networks evaluated in this study achieved excellent F1 scores (≥0.995) and MCC values (≥0.994) in the validation and testing datasets. ResNet demonstrated the fastest inference rate and outperformed the other convolutional neural networks on detection efficiency, while the slow inference of EfficientNet-v2 may limit its potential applications. Grouping different weed species growing in turf according to their susceptibility to herbicides and detecting and distinguishing weeds by herbicide categories enables the implementation of herbicide susceptibility-based precision herbicide application. We conclude that the proposed method is an effective strategy for site-specific weed detection in turf, which can be employed in a smart sprayer to achieve precision herbicide spraying.

The use of multispectral sensor data coupled with irrigation management in maize allows further exploration of water behavior and its relationship with changes in spectral bands presented by the crop. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate, by means of multivariate statistics and machine learning techniques, the relationship between irrigation management and spectral bands in predicting maize yields. Field experiments were carried out over two seasons (first and second seasons) in a randomized block design with four treatments (control and three additional irrigation levels) and eighteen sample repetitions. The response variables analyzed were vegetation indices (IVs) and crop yield (GY). Measurement of spectral wavelengths was performed with the Sensefly eBee RTK, with autonomous flight control. The eBee was equipped with the Parrot Sequoia multispectral sensor acquiring reflectance at the wavelengths of green (550 nm ± 40 nm), red (660 nm ± 40 nm), red-edge (735 nm ± 10 nm), and NIR (790 nm ± 40 nm). The blue length (496 nm) was obtained by additional RGB imaging. Data were subjected to Pearson correlations (r) between the evaluated variables represented by a correlation and scatter plot. Subsequently, the canonical analysis was performed to verify the interrelationship between the variables evaluated. Data were also subjected to machine learning (ML) analysis, in which three different input dataset configurations were tested: using only irrigation management (IR), using irrigation management and spectral bands (SB+IR), and using irrigation management, spectral bands, and temperature (IR+SB+Temp).

Blueberries are blooming plants, valued for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Yield on the plantations depends on several factors, both internal and external. Predicting the accurate amount of harvest is an important aspect in work planning and storage space selection. Machine learning algorithms are commonly used in such prediction tasks, since they are capable of finding correlations between various factors at play. Overall data were collected from years 2016–2021, and included agronomic, climatic and soil data as well satellite-imaging vegetation data.

This paper proposes a systematic methodology to predict the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using time-series data extracted from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The key idea is to obtain accurate NDVI predictions by combining the merits of two effective computational intelligence techniques; namely, fuzzy clustering and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks under the framework of dynamic time warping (DTW) similarity measure. The study area is the Lesvos Island, located in the Aegean Sea, Greece, which is an insular environment in the Mediterranean coastal region. The algorithmic steps and the main contributions of the current work are described as follows. (1) A data reduction mechanism was applied to obtain a set of representative time series. (2) Since DTW is a similarity measure and not a distance, a multidimensional scaling approach was applied to transform the representative time series into points in a low-dimensional space, thus enabling the use of the Euclidean distance. (3) An efficient optimal fuzzy clustering scheme was implemented to obtain the optimal number of clusters that better described the underline distribution of the low-dimensional points. (4) The center of each cluster was mapped into time series, which were the mean of all representative time series that corresponded to the points belonging to that cluster. (5) Finally, the time series obtained in the last step were further processed in terms of LSTM neural networks. In particular, development and evaluation of the LSTM models was carried out considering a one-year period, i.e., 12 monthly time steps. The results indicate that the method identified unique time-series patterns of NDVI among different CORINE land-use/land-cover (LULC) types. The LSTM networks predicted the NDVI with root mean squared error (RMSE) ranging from 0.017 to 0.079. For the validation year of 2020, the difference between forecasted and actual NDVI was less than 0.1 in most of the study area. This study indicates that the synergy of the optimal fuzzy clustering based on DTW similarity of NDVI time-series data and the use of LSTM networks with clustered data can provide useful results for monitoring vegetation dynamics in fragmented Mediterranean ecosystems. © 2022 by the authors.

Yield prediction in the early growth stages significantly informs field management decisions for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A 10-year field experiment carried out in the Loess Plateau area tested how three tillage practices (deep ploughing (DP), subsoiling (SS), and no tillage (NT)) influenced cultivation and yield across different fallow periods. The experiment used the random forest (RF) algorithm to construct a prediction model of yields and yield components. Our results revealed that tillage during the fallow period was more effective than NT in improving yield in dryland wheat. Under drought condition, DP during the fallow period achieved a higher yield than SS, especially in drought years; DP was 16% higher than SS. RF was deemed fit for yield prediction across different precipitation years. An RF model was developed using meteorological factors for fixed variables and soil water storage after tillage during a fallow period for a control variable. Small error values existed in the prediction yield, spike number, and grains number per spike.

Previously, hyperspectral indices for chlorophyll (Chl) estimation, namely a green peak and red edge in the visible region, have been identified and used for N estimation because leaf N content closely related to Chl content in green leaves. Herein, datasets of N and Chl contents, and visible and near-infrared hyperspectral reflectance, derived from green leaves under various N nutrient conditions and albino yellow leaves were obtained. A regression model was then constructed using several machine learning algorithms and preprocessing techniques. Machine learning algorithms achieved high-performance models for N and Chl content, ensuring an accuracy threshold of 1.4 or 2.0 based on the ratio of performance to deviation values. Data-based sensitivity analysis through integration of the green and yellow leaves datasets identified clear differences in reflectance to estimate N and Chl contents, especially at 1325–1575 nm, suggesting an N content-specific region. These findings will enable the nondestructive estimation of leaf N content in tea plants and contribute advanced indices for nondestructive tracking of N status in crops. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"chlorophyll; nitrogen; algorithm; Camellia sinensis; chemistry; machine learning; plant leaf; procedures; spectroscopy; Algorithms; Camellia sinensis; Chlorophyll; Machine Learning; Nitrogen; Plant Leaves; Spectrum Analysis",Article,Scopus

This study provides land productivity estimates in the contiguous United States (CONUS) through a machine learning approach. Land productivity is defined as the potential in producing agricultural outputs given biophysical properties including climate, soil, and land slope. The land productivity is approximated by the potential yields of six major crops in the CONUS, i.e. corn, soybean, winter wheat, spring wheat, cotton, and alfalfa. This quantitative relationship is then applied to estimating the availability of marginal land for bioenergy crop production in the CONUS. Furthermore, the levels of uncertainties associated with land productivity and marginal land estimates are quantified and discussed. Based on the modeling results, the total marginal land of the CONUS ranges 55.0-172.8 mha, but the 95% inter-percentile distance of the estimated productivity index reaches up to 60% of its expected value in data-scarce regions. Finally, in a cross-check analysis, marginal lands estimated based on biophysical criteria are found to be comparable to those based on an economic criterion. © 2020 The Author(s).

The current advances in remote sensing and the availability of high resolution, high frequency, and free Sentinel-2 images improve the implementation of Precision Agriculture (PA) for a wider range of farmers. This study investigated the possibility of using vegetation indices (VIs) derived from Sentinel-2 images and machine learning techniques to assess corn (Zea mays) grain yield spatial variability within the field scale. A 22-ha study field in North Italy was monitored between 2016 and 2018; corn yield was measured and recorded by a grain yield monitor mounted on the harvester machine recording more than 20,000 georeferenced yield observation points from the study field for each season. VIs from a total of 34 Sentinel-2 images at different crop ages were analyzed for correlation with the measured yield observations. Multiple regression and two different machine learning approaches were also tested to model corn grain yield. The three main results were the following: (i) the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) provided the highest R2 value of 0.48 for monitoring within-field variability of corn grain yield; (ii) the most suitable period for corn yield monitoring was a crop age between 105 and 135 days from the planting date (R4-R6); (iii) Random Forests was the most accurate machine learning approach for predicting within-field variability of corn yield, with an R2 value of almost 0.6 over an independent validation set of half of the total observations. Based on the results, within-field variability of corn yield for previous seasons could be investigated from archived Sentinel-2 data with GNDVI at crop stage (R4-R6). © 2019 by the authors.","Corn yield; Digital farming; Machine learning; Precision agriculture; Sentinel-2; Vegetation indices; Within-field variability","Crops; Decision trees; Image enhancement; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Corn yields; Digital farming; Field variability; Sentinel-2; Vegetation index; Grain (agricultural product)",Article,Scopus

However, data scarcity remains a critical bottleneck for rapidly growing computer vision applications. Several deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable results in disease classification. However, these models have been trained on small datasets that are not reliable due to model generalization issues.

Timely and accurate forecast of the price helps the farmers switch between the alternative nearby markets to sale their produce and getting good prices. The farmers can use the information to make choices around the timing of marketing. For forecasting price of agricultural commodities, several statistical models have been applied in past but those models have their own limitations in terms of assumptions. Methods In recent times, Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been much successful in modeling time series data. Though, numerous empirical studies have shown that ML approaches outperform time series models in forecasting time series, but their application in forecasting vegetables prices in India is scared. In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to explore efficient ML algorithms e.g. Generalized Neural Network (GRNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) for forecasting wholesale price of Brinjal in seventeen major markets of Odisha, India. Results An empirical comparison of the predictive accuracies of different models with that of the usual stochastic model i.e. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is carried out and it is observed that ML techniques particularly GRNN performs better in most of the cases. The superiority of the models is established by means of Model Confidence Set (MCS), and other accuracy measures such as Mean Error (ME), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Prediction Error (MAPE). To this end, Diebold-Mariano test is performed to test for the significant differences in predictive accuracy of different models. Conclusions Among the machine learning techniques, GRNN performs better in all the seventeen markets as compared to other techniques. RF performs at par with GRNN in four markets. The accuracies of other techniques such as SVR, GBM and ARIMA are not up to the mark. © 2022 Paul et al.

As with any design problem, two challenges are faced; firstly, how to determine all the input data required by the simulation model, and secondly to, a priori, anticipate what the performance of the designed system will be. This study sought to evaluate the performance of the WaSim model to simulate fluctuating water table depths (WTD), and drainage discharges (DD) in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), which is an input to the WaSim model, was estimated by the Rosetta computer program, based on soil particle size distribution data, bulk density, and soil water retention characteristics at pressure heads of – 33 and – 1500 kPa. performance of the WaSim model was statistically assessed using the coefficient of determination (R2), coefficient of residual mass (CRM), mean absolute error (MAE), mean percent error (MPE), and the nash–sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). during the validation period, the WaSim model predicted WTDs with R2, CRM, MAE, MPE, and NSE of 0.86, 0.003, 4.9 cm, 6.0%, and 0.98, respectively. In the same validation period, the model predicted DDs with R2, CRM, MAE, MPE, and NSE of 0.57, 0.002, 0.30 mm day−1,11%, and 0.76, respectively. These results suggest that the use of Rosetta-estimated Ksat data as inputs to the WaSim model compromised its accuracy and applicability as a subsurface drainage design tool. Owing to the relatively low R2 value of 0.57, and that the WaSim model was empirically developed, we recommend further improvement on the calibration of the model for it to be suitable for application under the prevailing conditions. Also, in the absence of other means of determining Ksat, we caution the use of Rosetta-estimated Ksat data as inputs to the WaSim model for the design and analysis of subsurface drainage systems in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. © 2022, The Author(s).","Drainage; Pedotransfer functions; Rosetta; WaSim; Water management","Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Hydraulic conductivity; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Soil moisture; Water management; Mean absolute error; Mean percent error; Pedo-transfer functions; Pedotransfer functions; Performance; Residual mass; Rosetta; Subsurface drainage design; Wasim; Waters managements; Drainage; design; drainage; estimation method; hydraulic conductivity; modeling; particle size; size distribution; soil water; water management; water table; KwaZulu-Natal; South Africa",Article,Scopus

The experimental results show that the precision, accuracy, and recall of SDNet are 94.26%, 93.15%, and 90.72%, respectively, and the monitoring speed is 30.5 ms. It is 4.08%, 3.64 and 2.04% higher than the precision, accuracy, and recall of YOLOX, respectively, and there is no significant change in the model size.

Automation systems have been developed to improve these issues. In the process of automation, images are processed and sent to the remote brain for processing and decision making. It is noted that the image is written for compaction to reduce processing and computational costs. Images require large storage and transmission resources to perform their operations. A good strategy for pictures compression can help minimize these requirements. The question of compressing data on accuracy is always a challenge. Therefore, to optimize imaging, it is necessary to reduce inconsistencies in medical imaging. So this document introduces a new image compression scheme called the GenPSOWVQ method that uses a recurrent neural network with wavelet VQ. The codebook is built using a combination of fragments and genetic algorithms. The newly developed image compression model attains precise compression while maintaining image accuracy with lower computational costs when encoding clinical images. The proposed method was tested using real-time medical imaging using PSNR, MSE, SSIM, NMSE, SNR, and CR indicators. Experimental results show that the proposed GenPSOWVQ method yields higher PSNR SSIMM values for a given compression ratio than the existing methods. In addition, the proposed GenPSOWVQ method yields lower values of MSE, RMSE, and SNR for a given compression ratio than the existing methods. © 2022 Chethana Sridhar et al.",,"Automation; Decision making; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Genetic algorithms; Image compression; Recurrent neural networks; Automation systems; Computational costs; Decisions makings; Medical treatment; Model creation; Processing costs; Reduction models; Size-reduction; Storage resources; Transmission resources; Medical imaging; article; automation; brain; data compression; decision making; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic test accuracy study; genetic algorithm; recurrent neural network; algorithm; human; image processing; information processing; procedures; Algorithms; Data Compression; Diagnostic Imaging; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neural Networks, Computer",Article,Scopus

Oil palm is known as the most efficient commercial crop with the capacity to fulfill the growing global demand for vegetable oil consumption. However, oil palm production dependence on pollination is experiencing issues with decreasing the actual yield. Consequently, alternative methods in commercial plantations such as human-assisted pollination and recently Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) have been deployed despite their high economic costs due to labor requirements. Oil palm assisted pollination requires precision, inspection, traceability, and validation processes in the field. Currently, all these processes are performed by humans that can be associated with false assumptions, uncertainty, and pollination latency. Therefore, Machine Learning (ML) approaches as a subset of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain provides efficient, cost-effective, and non-destructive solutions to determine these reproductive stages for future autonomous pollination system. Our goal was to reduce the variability of worker's performance in oil palms, using ML algorithms to make expert decisions and reduce the risk related to a transient workforce. This comparative empirical study examined and compared the performance of the Random Forest (RF) against k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification of oil palm pre-anthesis and anthesis stages, dividing into four classes (1, 2, 3, and 4). These models were tested using thermal features (endogenous) individually and in combination with meteorological variables (exogenous). The performance of models is evaluated with specific measures of performance, such as overall user's and producer's accuracies and F-measure values derived from the confusion matrix. The results showed that the RF model produced better results with regard to average F-measure (88.6%, 71.83%), producer's accuracies (88.70%, 71.35%), and user's accuracies (88.27%, 72.36%) on test sets using exogenous + exogenous and endogenous feature sets, respectively. Among the three classifiers tested with two datasets, the RF method outperforms the other two popular algorithms, i.e., kNN and SVM with respect to accuracy and F-measure metrics. The results validated the significance of thermal parameters, provided valuable features to devise an intelligent pollination management system, and proved the feasibility of using the RF model for the classification of oil palms four stages of anthesis. © 2020 China Agricultural University","Anthesis stage; Classification; Machine Learning; Oil palm; Pollination","Agricultural robots; Classification (of information); Cost effectiveness; Decision trees; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Petroleum industry; Support vector machines; Wireless sensor networks; Commercial plantation; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Machine learning approaches; Measures of performance; Meteorological variables; Oil palm plantations; Reproductive stage; Vegetable oil consumption; Palm oil; image classification; machine learning; pollination; prediction; tree",Article,Scopus

The key to ensuring grain yield is to recognize the risks caused by climate change. In this paper, the trends of temperature and precipitation over the next thirty years in China are analysed using CMIP6 under the SSP1–2.6, SSP2–4.5 and SSP 5–8.5 climate scenarios. The resilience indicators of grain yield are proposed for the first time. We find that the higher the emission concentration is, the greater the temperature increase will be and further northward the precipitation belt will move. Meanwhile, the resilience varies across different climate zones. The temperate monsoon climate zone has a stronger resilience to adapt to climate change compared to that of other areas. The resilience of the temperate continental and plateau alpine climate zones are moderate. However, the resilience of the subtropical and tropical monsoon climates zones are poor. © Copyright © 2021 Chou, Sun, Xu, Yang, Li and Zhao.","adoption; global warming; grain yield; resilience index; risk",,Article,Scopus

This paper analyses the butterfly effect in the agricultural product industry chain from the perspective of producer and consumer by using multidimensional time and space theory and proposes a new price forecasting method. We consider that the price change of agricultural products is not only affected by the balance of market supply and demand but also by the factors of time and space. Taking the pig industry chain of Sichuan Province as an example, this paper explores and excavates the data from 2010 to 2020 in the time dimension. Interestingly, we found that the price changes in pork in the market are generally highly correlated with the prices of slaughtered pigs, piglets a few weeks ago and the prices of multiple feed a few months ago. Based on the precise time-space factors, we improved the price forecasting model, greatly improved the accuracy of price prediction, and proved the effectiveness of multidimen­sional spatiotemporal association mining.

Observations of GY and SN were performed at harvest on six fields (three locations in two seasons: 2017 and 2018) in three regions of Poland, i.e., northeastern (A—Brożówka), central (B—Zdziechów) and southeastern Poland (C—Kryłów). Vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), modified SAVI (mSAVI), modified SAVI 2 (mSAVI2), Infrared Percentage Vegetation Index (IPVI), Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI), and Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI)) calculated for sampling points from mid-March until mid-July, covering within-field soil and topographical variability, were included in the analysis. Depending on the location, the highest correlation coefficients (of about 0.6–0.9) for most of VIs with GY and SN were obtained about 4–6 weeks before harvest (from the beginning of shooting to milk maturity). Therefore, satellite-derived VIs are useful for the prediction of within-field cereal GY as well as SN variability. Information on GY, predicted together with the results for soil nutrient availability, is the basis for the formulation of variable fertilize rates in precision agriculture. All examined VIs were similarly correlated with GY and SN via the commonly used NDVI.

In order to strengthen the economy and also to meet the food demand for the exponentially growing population, optimizing the agricultural practices has become necessity. In India, weather and geographical conditions are highly variable and were thought to be the major bottleneck of agricultural practices to achieve improved crop yield. Agricultural practices in India are facing many challenges such as change in climatic conditions, different geographical environment, conventional agricultural practices; economic and political scenario. Economic loss due to the lack of information on crop yield productivity is another major concern in the country. These hurdles can be overcome by the implementation of advanced technology in agriculture. Some of the trends observed are smart farming, digital agriculture and Big Data Analytics which provide useful information regarding various crop yields influencing factors and predicting the accurate amounts of crop yield. The exact prediction of crop yield helps formers to develop a suitable cultivation plan, crop health monitoring system, management of crop yield efficiently and also to establish the business strategy in order to decrease economic losses. This also makes the agricultural practices as one of the highly profitable ventures.

FMZs require monitoring of the vegetation condition to promptly proceed with the maintenance and cleaning of these zones. To improve FMZ monitoring, this paper proposes the use of satellite images, such as the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, along with vegetation indices and extracted temporal characteristics (max, min, mean and standard deviation) associated with the vegetation within and outside the FMZs and to determine if they were treated. These characteristics feed machine-learning algorithms, such as XGBoost, Support Vector Machines, K-nearest neighbors and Random Forest.

An overestimation may thus incur further costs, whereas an underestimation entails potential crop waste. More interestingly, an accurate yield estimation enables stakeholders to better place themselves in the market. Yet, computer-aided precision farming is set to play a pivotal role in this respect. Kiwifruit represents a major produce in several countries (e.g., Italy, China, New and Zealand). However, up to date, the relevant literature remains short of a complete as well as automatic system for kiwifruit yield estimation. In this paper, we present a fully automatic and noninvasive computer vision system for kiwifruit yield estimation across a given orchard. It consists mainly of an optical sensor mounted on a minitractor that surveys the orchard of interest at a low pace. Afterwards, the acquired images are fed to a pipeline that incorporates image preprocessing, stitching, and fruit counting stages and outputs an estimated fruit count and yield estimation. Experimental results conducted on two large kiwifruit orchards confirm a high plausibility (i.e., errors of 6% and 15%) of the proposed system. The proposed yield estimation solution has been in commercial use for about 2 years. With respect to the traditional manual yield estimation carried out by kiwifruit companies, it was demonstrated to save a significant amount of time and cut down on estimation errors, especially when speaking of large-scale farming. © 2020 by the authors.

Mature tomato detection has been wildly studied, while immature tomato detection, especially when occluded with leaves, is difficult to perform using traditional image analysis, which is more important for long-term yield prediction. Therefore, tomato detection that can generalize well in real tomato cultivation scenes and is robust to issues such as fruit occlusion and variable lighting conditions is highly desired. In this study, we build a tomato detection model to automatically detect intact green tomatoes regardless of occlusions or fruit growth stage using deep learning approaches. The tomato detection model used faster region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) with Resnet-101 and transfer learned from the Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset. The detection on test dataset achieved high average precision of 87.83% (intersection over union ≥ 0.5) and showed a high accuracy of tomato counting (R2 = 0.87).

In today's world condition, the existence of humans is not possible without the essential proliferation of plants. In the photosynthesis procedure, plants use solar energy to convert into chemical energy. This process is responsible for all life on earth, and the main controlling factor for proper plant growth is soil since it holds water, air, and all essential nutrients of plant nourishment. Though, due to overexposure, soil gets despoiled, so fertilizer is an essential component to hold the soil quality. In that regard, soil analysis is a suitable method to determine soil quality. Soil analysis examines the soil in laboratories and generates reports of unorganized and insignificant data. In this study, different big data analysis machine learning methods are used to extracting knowledge from data to find out fertilizer recommendation classes on behalf of present soil nutrition composition. For this experiment, soil analysis reports are collected from the Tata soil and water testing center. In this paper, Mahoot library is used for analysis of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), artificial neural network (ANN) performance on Hadoop environment. For better performance evaluation, we also used single machine experiments for random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbors K-NN, regression tree (RT), support vector machine (SVM) using polynomial function, SVM using radial basis function (RBF) methods. Detailed experimental analysis was carried out using overall accuracy, AUC-ROC (receiver operating characteristics (ROC), and area under the ROC curve (AUC)) curve, mean absolute prediction error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) validation measurements on soil reports dataset. The results provide a comparison of solution classes and conclude that the SGD outperforms other approaches.

This deficiency during the fruiting and leafing phases of tomato plant are based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). A total of 571 images were captured with tomato leaves and fruits containing the crop species at the growth stage. Among all images, 80% (461 captured images) were used for the training dataset and 20% (110 captured images) were applied for the validation dataset. In this study, we provide an analysis of two different model architectures based on convolutional neural network for classifying and predicting the nutrient deficiency symptoms. For instance, Inception-ResNet v2 and Autoencoder with the captured images of tomato plant growth under the greenhouse conditions. Moreover, a major type of statistical structure, namely Ensemble Averaging, was applied with two aforementioned predictive models to increase the accuracy of predictive validation. Three mineral nutrients, i.e., Calcium/Ca2+, Potassium/K+, and Nitrogen/N, are considered for use in evaluating the nutrient status in the development of tomato plant with these models. The aim of this study is to predict the nutrient deficiency accurately in order to increase crop production and prevent the emergence of tomato pathology caused by lack of nutrients. The predictive performance of the three models in this paper are validated, with the accuracy rates of 87.273% and 79.091% for Inception-ResNet v2 and Autoencoder, respectively, and with 91% validity using Ensemble Averaging. © 2019 by the authors.","Autoencoder; Classification; Deep learning; Ensemble averaging; Inception-ResNet v2; Nutrient deficiency; Prediction; Tomato plant",,Article,Scopus

However, the productivity of many agroforestry systems has been lower than expected in recent years, highlighting the need for an actionably deep mechanistic understanding of the competition between crops and trees. Here, three different fruit tree/ wheat (jujube/wheat, apricot /wheat, and walnut /wheat) intercropping agroforestry systems were chosen to investigate influence of different fruit tree shade intensity on the growth, yield and quality of intercropping wheat. Compared to the monoculture wheat system, the mean daily shade intensity of the jujube-, apricot-, and walnut-based intercropping systems were, respectively, 23.2%, 57.5%, and 80.7% shade. The photosynthetic rate of wheat in the jujube-, apricot-, and walnut-based intercropping systems decreased by, respectively, 11.3%, 31.9%, and 36.2% compared to monoculture wheat, and the mean number of fertile florets per spike decreased by 26.4%, 37.4%, and 49.5%. Moreover, the apricot- and walnut-based intercropping systems deleteriously affected grain yield (constituent components spike number, grains per spike, and thousand grain weight) and decreased the total N, P, and K content of intercropping wheat. Tree shading intensity strongly enhanced the grain protein content, wet gluten content, dough development time, and dough stability time of wheat, but significantly decreased the softening degree. Strong negative linear correlations were observed between tree shade intensity and the number of fertile florets, grain yield related traits (including spike number, grains per spike, and thousand grain weight), nutrient content (N, P and K), and softening degree of wheat. In contrast, Daily shade intensity was positively linearly correlated with grain protein content, wet gluten content, dough development time, and dough stability time. We conclude that jujube-based intercropping systems can be practical in the region, as they do not decrease the yield and quality of intercropping wheat. © 2019 Qiao et al.

However, there is a lack of research about the price at which mines sell copper concentrate to smelters. The market reality is more complex since smelters obtain the copper that they sell from the concentrate that mines produce by processing the ore which they have extracted. It therefore becomes necessary to thoroughly analyse the price at which smelters buy the concentrates from the mines, besides the price at which they sell the copper. In practice, this cost is set by applying discounts to the price of cathodic copper, the most relevant being those corresponding to the smelters' benefit margin (Treatment Charges-TC and Refining Charges-RC). These discounts are agreed upon annually in the markets and their correct forecasting will enable making more adequate models to estimate the price of copper concentrates, which would help smelters to duly forecast their benefit margin. Hence, the aim of this paper is to provide an effective tool to forecast copper TC/RC annual benchmark levels. With the annual benchmark data from 2004 to 2017 agreed upon during the LME Copper Week, a three-model comparison is made by contrasting different measures of error. The results obtained indicate that the LES (Linear Exponential Smoothing) model is the one that has the best predictive capacity to explain the evolution of TC/RC in both the long and the short term. This suggests a certain dependency on the previous levels of TC/RC, as well as the potential existence of cyclical patterns in them. This model thus allows us to make a more precise estimation of copper TC/RC levels, which makes it useful for smelters and mining companies. © 2019 Francisco J.

Inherently, these are difficult to translate into information useful for decision support in agriculture. For example, probabilistic SCF must first be downscaled to daily weather realizations to link with process-based crop models, a tedious process, especially for non-technical users. Here, we present two approaches for downscaling probabilistic seasonal climate forecasts – a parametric method, predictWTD, and a non-parametric method, FResampler1, and compare their performance. The predictWTD, which is based on a conditional stochastic weather generator, was found to be not very sensitive to types of rainfall information (amount, frequency or intensity) in constraining or conditioning the stochastic weather generator, but conditioning the stochastic weather generator on both rainfall frequency and rainfall intensity had distorted the distribution of the downscaled seasonal rainfall total. Both predictWTD and FResampler1 are sensitive to the length of climate data, especially for a wet SCF; climate data longer than 30 years was found suitable for reproducing the theoretical distribution of SCF. FResampler1 performed well as predictWTD in downscaling probabilistic SCF, however, it requires the generation of more realizations to ensure stable simulations of the seasonal rainfall total distributions. © 2017 The Authors","Non-parametric downscaling; Parametric downscaling; Probabilistic seasonal climate forecast; Stochastic disaggregation",,Article,Scopus

Neural networks (NNs) are new computational tools that provide a quick and accurate means of physical properties prediction of agricultural materials, and have been shown to perform well in comparison with traditional methods. In this research, some physical properties of pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) seeds, including linear dimensions, volume, surface and projected area, geometric mean diameter and sphericity were calculated tridimensional in lab conditions. Then, prediction of these parameters was carried out using NNs. The research was divided into two parts; experimental investigation and simulation analysis with NNs.

In recent years, geostatistical methods have proven valuable for estimating hydrological variables in ungauged catchments. However, four major problems restrict the development of geostatistical methods. We established a new information diffusion model based on genetic algorithm (GIDM) for spatial interpolating of runoff in the ungauged basins. Genetic algorithms (GA) are used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems. So, using GA, the parameter of optimal window width can be obtained. To test our new method, seven experiments for the annual runoff interpolation based on GIDM at 17 stations on the mainstream and tributaries of the Yellow River are carried out and compared with the inverse distance weighting (IDW) method, Cokriging (COK) method, and conventional IDMs using the same sparse observed data. The seven experiments all show that the GIDM method can solve four problems of the previous geostatistical methods to some extent and obtains best accuracy among four different models. The key problems of the PUB research are the lack of observation data and the difficulties in information extraction.

Thus, drainage design simulation models provide for a simplistic and cost-effective method of determining the most appropriate subsurface drainage design parameters. In this study, the performance of the DRAINMOD model (Version 6.1) in predicting WTDs and DDs was investigated for a 32 ha sugarcane field in Pongola, South Africa. Water table depths were monitored in 1.7 m deep piezometers installed mid-way between two drains by using an electronic dip meter with a beeper, while DDs were measured at drain lateral outlet points, using a bucket and a stop watch. Both WTDs and DDs were monitored from September 2011 to February 2012. Results of the DRAINMOD model evaluation in predicting WTD, during calibration period, showed that there was a very strong agreement between simulated and observed WTDs with a goodness-of-fit (R2) of 0.826 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3 cm. Similarly, simulated and observed DDs during the model validation period also showed very strong agreement, with an R2 value of 0.801 and an MAE of 0.2 mm∙day-1. Results of simulated WTDs at various combinations of drain depth and spacing indicated that in clay soil a WTD of 1.0 to 1.5 m from the soil surface can be achieved by installing drain pipes at drain spacing ranging from 25 to 40 m and drain depth between 1.4 and 1.8 m. On the other hand, in clay-loam soil, the same 1.0 to 1.5 m WTD can be achieved when the drain pipes are installed at drain depths ranging from 1.4 to 1.8 m and corresponding drain spacing ranging from 55 to 70 m. Based on these results, it was concluded that DRAINMOD 6.1 can reliably be used as a subsurface drainage design tool in the Pongola region. This would simplify the design of subsurface drainage systems and the formulation of subsurface drainage design criteria for different crops and soil types found in the area and possibly throughout South Africa. © 2015, South African Water Research Commission.

However, few studies have focused on using the crop model data assimilation (CMDA) method for regional-scale winter wheat yield estimation under drought stress and partial-irrigation conditions. In this study, we developed a CMDA framework to integrate remotely sensed water stress factor (MOD16 ET PET−1) with the WOFOST model using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for winter wheat yield estimation at the regional scale in the North China Plain (NCP) during 2008–2018. According to our results, integration of MOD16 ET PET−1 with the WOFOST model produced more accurate estimates of regional winter wheat yield than open-loop simulation. The correlation coefficient of simulated yield with statistical yield increased for each year and error decreased in most years, with r ranging from 0.28 to 0.65 and RMSE ranging from 700.08 to 1966.12 kg ha−1. Yield estimation using the CMDA method was more suitable in drought years (r = 0.47, RMSE = 919.04 kg ha−1) than in normal years (r = 0.30, RMSE = 1215.51 kg ha−1). Our approach performed better in yield estimation under drought conditions than the conventional empirical correlation method using vegetation condition index (VCI). This research highlighted the potential of assimilating remotely sensed water stress factor, which can account for irrigation benefit, into crop model for improving the accuracy of winter wheat yield estimation at the regional scale especially under drought conditions, and this approach can be easily adapted to other regions and crops. © 2022 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS","Data assimilation; Drought; Evapotranspiration; Winter wheat yield; WOFOST",,Article,Scopus

It has been a great challenge to non-destructively estimate plant N status across different agro-ecological zones (AZs). The objective of this study was to use random forest regression (RFR) models together with multi-source data to improve the estimation of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) N status across two AZs. Fifteen site-year plot and farmers' field experiments involving different N rates and 19 cultivars were conducted in two AZs from 2015 to 2020. The results indicated that RFR models integrating climatic and management factors with vegetation index (R2 = 0.72–0.86) outperformed the models by only using the vegetation index (R2 = 0.36–0.68) and performed well across AZs. The Pearson correlation coefficient-based variables selection strategy worked well to select 6–7 key variables for developing RFR models that could achieve similar performance as models using full variables. The contributions of climatic and management factors to N status estimation varied with AZs and N status indicators. In higher-latitude areas, climatic factors were more important to N status estimation, especially water-related factors. The addition of climatic factors significantly improved the performance of the RFR models for N nutrition index estimation. Climatic factors were important for the estimation of the aboveground biomass, while management variables were more important to N status estimation in lower-latitude areas. It is concluded that integrating multi-source data using RFR models can significantly improve the estimation of winter wheat N status indicators across AZs compared to models only using one vegetation index. However, more studies are needed to develop unmanned aerial vehicles and satellite remote sensing-based machine learning models incorporating multi-source data for more efficient monitoring of crop N status under more diverse soil, climatic, and management conditions across large regions.

Hence, the estimation of within-field variability of GY is pivotal for the agricultural management, especially in the current global change context. In this sense, Earth Observation Systems (EOS) are key technologies that use satellite data to monitor crop yield, which can guide the application of precision farming. Yet, novel research is required to improve the multiplatform integration of data, including data processing, and the application of this discipline in agricultural management. This article provides a novel methodological analysis and assessment of its applications in precision farming. It presents an integration of wheat GY, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), combine harvester data, and EOS Sentinel-2 multispectral bands. Moreover, it compares several indices and machine learning (ML) approaches to map within-field wheat GY. It also analyses the importance of multi-date remote sensing imagery and explores its potential applications in precision agriculture. The study was conducted in Spain, a major European wheat producer. Within-field GY data was obtained from a GPS combine harvester machine for 8 fields over three seasons (2017–2019) and consecutively processed to match Sentinel-2 10 m pixel size. Seven vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, EVI, RVI, TGI, CVI and NGRDI) as well as the biophysical parameter LAI (leaf area index) retrieved with radiative transfer models (RTM) were calculated from Sentinel-2 bands. Sentinel-2 10 m resolution bands alone were also used as variables. Random forest, support vector machine and boosted regressions were used as modelling approaches, and multilinear regression was calculated as baseline. Different combinations of dates of measurement were tested to find the most suitable model feeding data. LAI retrieved from RTM had a slightly improved performance in estimating within-field GY in comparison with vegetation indices or Sentinel-2 bands alone. At validation, the use of multi-date Sentinel-2 data was found to be the most suitable in comparison with single date images. Thus, the model developed with random forest regression (e.g. R2 = 0.89, and RSME = 0.74 t/ha when using LAI) outperformed support vector machine (R2 = 0.84 and RSME = 0.92 t/ha), boosting regression (R2 = 0.85 and RSME = 0.88 t/ha) and multilinear regression (R2 = 0.69 and RSME = 1.29 t/ha). However, single date images at specific phenological stages (e.g. R2 = 0.84, and RSME = 0.88 t/ha using random forest at stem elongation) also posed relatively high R2 and low RMSE, with potential for precision farming management before harvest. © 2022 The Author(s)","Grain yield; Machine learning; Precision farming; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Wheat","agricultural production; crop production; crop yield; estimation method; precision agriculture; remote sensing; Sentinel; wheat",Article,Scopus

We found that leaf area index (LAI) inversion based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) vegetation index has a high accuracy, with R2 and root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.877 and 0.609, respectively. Maize yield estimation based on UAV remote sensing data and simple algorithm for yield (SAFY) crop model data assimilation has different yield estimation accuracy under different water treatments. This method can be used to estimate corn yield, where R2 is 0.855 and RMSE is 692.8kg/ha. Generally, the higher the water stress, the lower the estimation accuracy. Furthermore, we perform the yield estimate mapping at 2 m spatial resolution, which has a higher spatial resolution and accuracy than satellite remote sensing. The great potential of incorporating UAV observations with crop data to monitor crop yield, and improve agricultural management is therefore indicated. © 2021 by the authors.

This study was conducted in a 11.07 ha area under Mediterranean climate in Northern Italy to evaluate the spatial variability and the relationships between six remotely sensed vegetation indices (VIs) and grain yield (GY) in five consecutive years. A total of 25 satellite (Landsat 5, 7, and 8) images were downloaded during crop growth to obtain the following VIs: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), EnhancedVegetation Index (EVI), Soil AdjustedVegetation Index (SAVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Green Chlorophyll Index (GCI), and Simple Ratio (SR). The surveyed crops were durum wheat in 2010, sunflower in 2011, bread wheat in 2012 and 2014, and coriander in 2013. Geo-referenced GY and VI data were used to generate spatial trend maps across the experimental field through geostatistical analysis. Crop stages featuring the best correlations between VIs and GY at the same spatial resolution (30 m) were acknowledged as the best periods for GY prediction. Based on this, 2-4 VIs were selected each year, totalling 15 VIs in the five years with r values with GY between 0.729** and 0.935**. SR and NDVI were most frequently chosen (six and four times, respectively) across stages from mid vegetative to mid reproductive growth. Conversely, SAVI never had correlations high enough to be selected. Correspondence analysis between remote VIs and GY based on quantile ranking in the 126 (30 m size) pixels exhibited a final agreement between 64% and 86%. Therefore, Landsat imagery with its spatial and temporal resolution proved a good potential for estimating final GY over different crops in a rotation, at a relatively small field scale. © 2019 by the authors.","Crop rotation; Field spatial variability; Geostatistics; Grain yield prediction; Landsat imagery; Spectral vegetation indices","Grain (agricultural product); Image enhancement; Vegetation; Crop rotation; Geo-statistics; Grain yield; Landsat imagery; Spatial variability; Spectral vegetation indices; Crops",Article,Scopus

However, due to irregular climatic events, ASA regions are affected commonly by frequent droughts that can impact food production. In addition, ASA regions in the Middle East and Africa are often characterised by political instability, which can increase population vulnerability to hunger and ill health. Remote sensing (RS) provides a platform to improve the spatial prediction of crop production and food availability, with the potential to positively impact populations. This paper, firstly, describes some of the important characteristics of agriculture in ASA regions that require monitoring to improve their management. Secondly, it demonstrates how freely available RS data can support decision-making through a cost-effective monitoring system that complements traditional approaches for collecting agricultural data. Thirdly, it illustrates the challenges of employing freely available RS data for mapping and monitoring crop area, crop status and forecasting crop yield in these regions. Finally, existing approaches used in these applications are evaluated, and the challenges associated with their use and possible future improvements are discussed. We demonstrate that agricultural activities can be monitored effectively and both crop area and crop yield can be predicted in advance using RS data. We also discuss the future challenges associated with maintaining food security in ASA regions and explore some recent advances in RS that can be used to monitor cropland and forecast crop production and yield. © 2021 by the authors.

As massive data processing develops in its practicality, machine learning (ML) techniques applied to time series can automate and improve prediction models. The radical novelty of this paper is the development of a hybrid model that combines a new approach to the classical Kalman filter with machine learning techniques, i.e., support vector regression (SVR) and nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) neural networks, to improve the performance of existing predictive models. The proposed hybrid model uses, on the one hand, an improved Kalman filter method that eliminates the convergence problems of time series data with large error variance and, on the other hand, an ML algorithm as a correction factor to predict the model error. The results reveal that our hybrid models obtain accurate predictions, substantially reducing the root mean square and absolute mean errors compared to the classical and alternative Kalman filter models and achieving a goodness of fit greater than 0.95.

Several models based on remote sensing data have been developed in yield assessment, but their robustness—especially in small field scale areas—needs to be examined. Here we aim to develop a robust methodology for estimation/prediction of sunflower yield at pilot field scale using Sentinel-2 remote sensing satellite imagery. We conducted the study in Mezőhegyes, south-eastern Hungary. The Random Forest Regression (RFR), a machine learning technique was used in this research to translate the Sentinel-2 spectral bands to sunflower yield based on crop yield data provided by a combine harvester equipped with a yield-monitoring system. Sentinel-2 images obtained from April to September were used to find the best image for prediction. The satellite image acquired on June 28 was found best and considered further for prediction sunflower yield. A developed training model was tested and validated in 10 different parcels to evaluate the performance of the prediction. We examined the results of the prediction model (predicted) against the actual yield data (observed) collected by a combine harvester. The results demonstrated that using 10 spectral bands from Sentinel-2 imagery the best time to predict sunflower yields was between 85 and 105 d into the growing season during the flowering stage. This model achieved high accuracy with low normalized root means square error (RMSE) ranging from 121.9 to 284.5 kg/ha for different test fields. Our results are promising because they prove the possibility of predicting sunflower grain yield at the pixel or field level, 3–4 months before the harvest, which is crucial for planning food policy. © 2022","Random forest regression; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Sunflower; Yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

Satellite-based remote sensing offers a suitable and cost-effective technique for regional- and national-scale crop monitoring. The use of remote sensing data for crop yield estimation has been demonstrated using a semi-physical approach with reasonable success. Assimilating remote sensing data with the DSSAT model and spectral indices-based regression analysis are promising methods for spatially estimating rice crop yields. Rice area and yield in the Cauvery delta zone of Tamil Nadu, India was estimated during samba (August–January) season in the years 2020–2021 using Sentinel 1A Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite data with three different spatial yield estimation methods, namely a spectral indices-based regression analysis, semi-physical approach, and integrating remote products with DSSAT crop growth model. A rice area map was generated for the study area using a rule-based classifier approach utilizing parameterization with a classification accuracy of 94.5% and a kappa score of 0.89. The total classified rice area in Cauvery Delta Region was 379,767 ha, and the Start of Season (SoS) maps for samba season revealed that the major planting period for rice was between 22 September and 9 November in 2020. The study also aimed to identify promising spatial yield estimation techniques for optimal rice yield prediction over large areas. Regression models resulted in rice yields of 3234 to 3905 kg ha−1 with a mean of 3654 kg ha−1. The net primary product was computed using the periodical PAR, fAPAR, Wstress, Tstress, and maximum radiation use efficiency in a semi-physical approach. The resultant rice yields ranged between 2652 and 3438 kg ha−1 with the mean of 3076 kg ha−1. During the integration of remote sensing products with crop growth models, LAI values were extracted from dB images and utilized to simulate rice yields in the range of 3684 to 4012 kg ha−1 with the mean of 3855 kg ha−1. When compared to the semi-physical approach, both integrating remote sensing products with the DSSAT crop growth model and spectral indices-based regression analysis had R2 greater than 0.80, NRMSE of less than 10%, and agreement of more than 90%, indicating that these two approaches could be used for spatial rice yield estimation. © 2022 by the authors.","crop growth model; fAPAR; remote sensing; rice yield; semi-physical approach; spectral indices; synthetic aperture radar",,Article,Scopus

Studies conducted in this area are not at the level that is desirable due to the diversity of plant species and the regional characteristics of many of these species. Although numerous researchers have studied diseases on plant leaves, it is undeniable that timely diagnosis of diseases on olive leaves remains a difficult task. It is estimated that people have been cultivating olive trees for 6000 years, making it one of the most useful and profitable fruit trees in history. Symptoms that appear on infected leaves can vary from one plant to another or even between individual leaves on the same plant. Because olive groves are susceptible to a variety of pathogens, including bacterial blight, olive knot, Aculus olearius, and olive peacock spot, it has been difficult to develop an effective olive disease detection algorithm. For this reason, we developed a unique deep ensemble learning strategy that combines the convolutional neural network model with vision transformer model. The goal of this method is to detect and classify diseases that can affect olive leaves. In addition, binary and multiclassification systems based on deep convolutional models were used to categorize olive leaf disease.

However, knowledge on application of these tools to manage peanut maturity variability is still lacking. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare and validate linear and multiple linear regression with models using artificial neural networks (ANN) for estimating peanut maturity under irrigated and rainfed conditions. The models were trained (80% dataset) and tested (20% dataset) using results from the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons from irrigated and rainfed fields. In each field, plant reflectance was collected weekly from 90 days after planting using a UAV-mounted multispectral camera. Images were used to develop vegetation indices (VIs). Peanut pods were collected on the same dates as the UAV flights for maturity assessment using the peanut maturity index (PMI). The precision and accuracy of the linear models to estimate PMI using VIs were, in general, greater in irrigated fields with R2 > 0.40 than in rainfed areas, which had a maximum R2 value of 0.21. Multiple linear regressions combining adjusted growing degree days (aGDD) and VIs resulted in decreased RMSE for both irrigated and rainfed conditions and increased R2 in irrigated areas. However, these models did not perform successfully in the test process. On the other hand, ANN models that included VIs and aGDD showed accuracy of R2 = 0.91 in irrigated areas, regardless of using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP, RMSE = 0.062) or Radial Basis Function (RBF, RMSE = 0.065), as well as low tendency (1:1 line). These results indicated that, regardless of the ANN architecture used to predict complex and nonlinear variables, peanut maturity can be estimated accurately through models with multiple inputs using VIs and aGDD. Although the accuracy of the MLP or RBF models for irrigated and rainfed areas separately was high, the overall ANN models using both irrigated and rainfed areas can be used to predict peanut maturity with the same precision. © 2021 by the authors.","Arachis hypogaea L; Artificial intelligence; Remote sensing; Vegetation index","Crops; Image enhancement; Linear regression; Oilseeds; Radial basis function networks; Testing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Arachis hypogaea L; Artificial neural network modeling; Growing degree-days; Linear modeling; Maturity indices; Multispectral images; Rainfed; Rainfed condition; Remote-sensing; Vegetation index; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

Due to the exponential data growth in the agricultural sector, extracting significant information has become a challenging task. Though existing deep learning-based techniques have been applied in smart agriculture for crop cultivation, crop disease detection, weed removal, and yield production, still it is difficult to find the semantics between extracted information due to unswerving effects of weather, soil, pest, and fertilizer data. This paper consists of two parts. An initial phase, which proposes a data preprocessing technique for removal of ambiguity in input corpora, and the second phase proposes a novel deep learning-based long short-term memory with rectification in Adam optimizer and multilayer perceptron to find agricultural-based named entity recognition, events, and relations between them. The proposed algorithm has been trained and tested on four input corpora i.e., agriculture, weather, soil, and pest & fertilizers. The experimental results have been compared with existing techniques and it was observed that the proposed algorithm outperforms Weighted-SOM, LSTM+RAO, PLR-DBN, KNN, and Naïve Bayes on standard parameters like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

The quality of spatial information and the fidelity of spectral information are normally contradictory. However, these two properties are non-negligible indicators for multi-source remote-sensing images fusion. The smoothing filter-based intensity modulation (SFIM) method is a simple yet effective model for image fusion, which can improve the spatial texture details of the image well, and maintain the spectral characteristics of the image significantly. However, traditional SFIM has a poor effect for edge information sharpening, leading to a bad overall fusion result. In order to obtain better spatial infor-mation, a spatial filter-based improved LSE-SFIM algorithm is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the least square estimation (LSE) algorithm is combined with SFIM, which can effectively improve the spatial information quality of the fused image. At the same time, in order to better maintain the spatial information, four spatial filters (mean, median, nearest and bilinear) are used for the simu-lated MSI image to extract fine spatial information. Six quality indexes are used to compare the performance of different algorithms, and the experimental results demonstrate that the LSE-SFIM based on bilinear (LES-SFIM-B) performs significantly better than the traditional SFIM algorithm and other spatially enhanced LSE-SFIM algorithms proposed in this paper. Furthermore, LSE-SFIM-B could also obtain similar performance compared with three state-of-the-art HSI-MSI fusion algorithms (CNMF, HySure, and FUSE), while the computing time is much shorter. © 2021 by the authors.

Robots have historically been used for carrying out routine tasks that require physical strength, accuracy, and repeatability, whereas humans are used to engage with more value‐added tasks that need reasoning and decision‐making skills. On the other hand, robots are also increasingly exploited in several non‐routine tasks that require cognitive skills. This technological evolution will create a fundamental and an unavoidable transformation of the agricultural occupations landscape with a high social and economic impact in terms of jobs creation and jobs destruction. To that effect, the aim of the present work is two‐fold: (a) to map agricultural occupations in terms of their cognitive/manual and routine/non‐routine characteristics and (b) to assess the susceptibility of each agricultural occupation to robotization. Seventeen (17) agricultural occupations were reviewed in relation to the characteristics of each individual task they entail and mapped onto a two‐dimensional space representing the manual versus cognitive nature and the routine versus non‐routine nature of an occupation. Subsequently, the potential for ro-botization was investigated, again concerning each task individually, and resulted in a weighted average potential adoption rate for each one of the agricultural occupations. It can be concluded that most of the occupations entail manual tasks that need to be performed in a standardised man-ner. Considering also that almost 81% of the agricultural work force is involved with these activities, it turns out that there is strong evidence for possible robotization of 70% of the agricultural domain, which, in turn, could affect 56% of the total annual budget dedicated to agricultural occupations. The presented work silhouettes the expected transformation of occupational landscape in agricultural production as an effort for a subsequent identification of social threats in terms of unemploy-ment and job and wages polarization, among others, but also of opportunities in terms of emerged skills and training requirements for a social sustainable development of agricultural domain. © 2021 by the authors.

In general, the interaction between humans and computers relies on the flexibility of the interactive visualization system. Electromyography (EMG) is a bioelectric signal used in HCI that can be captured noninvasively by placing electrodes on the human hand. Due to the impact of complex background, accurate recognition and analysis of human motion in real-time multitarget scenarios are considered challenging in HCI. Further, EMG signals of human hand motions are exceedingly nonlinear, and it is important to utilize a dynamic approach to address the noise problem in EMG signals. Hence, in this paper, the Optimized Noninvasive Human-Computer Interaction (ONIHCI) model has been proposed to predict human motion recognition. Average Intrinsic Mode Function (AIMF) has been used to reduce the noise factor in EMG signals. Furthermore, this paper introduces spatial thermographic imaging to overcome the conventional sensor problem, such as gesture recognition and human target identification in multitarget scenarios. The human motion behavior in spatial thermographic images is examined by target trajectory, and body movement kinematics is employed to classify human targets and objects. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed method reduces noise by 7.2% and improves accuracy by 97.2% in human motion recognition and human target identification.

This makes it easier to take proactive steps to reduce losses before they occur. The proposed model attempts to find an association between agrometeorological parameters and the occurrence of the four types of rice diseases. Rice is the staple food of people in Maharashtra. The four major diseases that occur on rice crops are focused on this paper (namely Rice Blast, False Smut, Bacterial Blight and Brown Spot) as these diseases spread rapidly and lead to economic loss. This research paper demonstrates the usage of artificial neural network (ANN) to detect, classify and predict the occurrence of rice diseases based on diverse agro-meteorological conditions. The results were carried out on two cases of dataset split that is 70-30% and 80-20%. The various types of activation function (AF) such as sigmoid, tanH, ReLU and softmax are implemented and compared based on various evaluation metrics such as overall Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 score.

Enterprise-scale geographic information system (GIS) software and high-resolution aerial or satellite imagery are tools which are typically not available to or affordable for resource-limited communities. In this paper, we present a concept of aerial data collection, 3D cadastre modeling, and disaster risk assessment using low-cost drones and adapted open-source software. Computer vision/machine learning methods are used to create a classified 3D cadastre that contextualizes and quantifies potential natural disaster risk to existing or planned infrastructure. Building type and integrity are determined from aerial imagery. Potential flood damage risk to a building is evaluated as a function of three mechanisms: undermining (erosion) of the foundation, hydraulic pressure damage, and building collapse due to water load. Use of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) provides water runoff estimates that are improved using classified land features (urban ecology, erosion marks) to improve flow direction estimates. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to find these flood-induced erosion marks from high-resolution drone imagery.

A number of requirements are imposed on farmers, including the maintenance of permanent grassland, fallow land or crop diversification. To meet these requirements, the European Union guarantees subsidies, but at the same time fields must be monitored focusing on crop identification. The limitation of field inspection and substituting it with crop recognition using satellite images could increase the effectiveness of this procedure. The application of satellite imagery in automatic detection and identification of dominant crops over a large area seems to be technically and economically sound. The paper discusses the concept and the results of automatic classification based on a Random Forests classifier performed on multitemporal images of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8. A test site was established in a complex agricultural structure with long and narrow parcels in the south-eastern part of Poland. Time-series images acquired during the growing season 2016 were used for multispectral classification in different configurations: for Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 separately and for both sensors integrated. Different Random Forests approaches and post-processing methods were examined based on independent data from farmers' declarations records, reaching the best accuracy of over 90% for crops like winter or spring cereals. Overall accuracy of the classification ranged from 72% to 91% depending on the classification variant.

By analysing this type of data, the pattern of the changes in the object of concern can be explored. The natural change in the Earth's surface is relatively slow and exhibits a pronounced pattern. Some natural events (for example, fires, floods, plant diseases, and insect pests) and human activities (for example, deforestation and urbanisation) will disturb this pattern and cause a relatively profound change on the Earth's surface. These events are usually referred to as disturbances. However, disturbances in ecosystems are not easy to detect from SITS data, because SITS contain combined information on disturbances, phenological variations and noise in remote sensing data. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed for online disturbance detection from SITS. The framework is based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. First, LSTM networks are trained by historical SITS. The trained LSTM networks are then used to predict new time series data. Last, the predicted data are compared with real data, and the noticeable deviations reveal disturbances.

Wheat is one of the major food crops, covering 21% of global food needs. The food supply issue necessitates reliable mathematical methods for predicting wheat yields. Crop yield information is necessary for agricultural management and strategic planning. Our mathematical model was developed based on a three-year field experiment in a semi-arid climate zone. Wheat yields ranged from 4310 to 6020 kg/ha. The novelty of this model is the inclusion of some stochastic data (weather and technological). The proposed method for wheat yield modeling is based on the theory of random sequence analysis. The model does not impose any restrictions on the number of production parameters and environmental indicators. A significant advantage of the proposed model is the absence of limits on the yield function. Consideration of the stochastic features of wheat production (technological and weather parameters) allows researchers to achieve the best accuracy. The numerical experiment confirmed the high accuracy of the proposed mathematical model for the prediction of wheat yield.

Plant height and yield are important traits for crop improvement. The traditional plant height and yield measurement are labor intensive and time consuming. Therefore, it is essential to estimate these two parameters rapidly and efficiently. The purpose of this study was to provide an alternative way to accurately identify and evaluate faba bean germplasm and breeding materials. Results: The results showed that 80% of the maximum plant height extracted from two-dimensional red–green–blue (2D-RGB) images had the best fitting degree with the ground measured values, with the coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) were 0.9915, 1.4411 cm and 5.02%, respectively. In terms of yield estimation, support vector machines (SVM) showed the best performance (R2 = 0.7238, RMSE = 823.54 kg ha−1, NRMSE = 18.38%), followed by random forests (RF) and decision trees (DT).

The adaptability of trees to drought is likely to be of increasing importance as climate changes occur around the world. Modelling stomatal regulation can help improve our understanding of how forests respond to their environment. Traditionally, empirical models have been used to model stomatal responses, however these models cannot always capture nonlinear responses and their parameters are often difficult to measure. In this study various machine learning (ML) models were able to capture stomatal responses of multiple tree species. We showed that ML can be a useful tool for predicting stomatal response based on climate variables and species traits. A random forest model performed the best with an R2 of 75 %, compared to the empirical Ball-Berry stomatal conductance model (BWB) (R2 = 41 %). In this study, the use of a combined dataset consisting out of data from multiple studies were successfully used, showcasing the use of data across studies. This also allowed for an ML model to be trained on 36 tree species from 5 forest biomes, from measurements taken across 6 continents, instead of being limited to one species, increasing the versatility of the model. The importance of species-specific stomatal responses was highlighted, with the drought strategies used by plants significantly influencing stomatal responses and predictions. ML models were able to capture these trends parsimoniously without prior knowledge of the underlying physiology of the tree species. The quality of combined datasets are however still not desirable, and long-term data collection using standardized measuring protocols are required to increase the strength of ML models. Data taken across different climatic regions and vegetation types can also help improve the adaptability of ML models. Regardless of limitations on data accessibility, ML shows promise in modelling plant responses to changes in climate. Focus on the use of ML together with traditional models can help give further insight into various ecological mechanisms. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate data; Machine learning; Stomatal conductance","climate change; drought; drought resistance; drought stress; environmental factor; forest management; machine learning; numerical model; physiological response; regional climate; stomatal conductance",Article,Scopus

With the development of research on plant phenotype and artificial intelligence technology in agriculture, deep learning has demonstrated a great potential in agriculture for recognizing nonde-structive nitrogen nutrition diagnosis in plants by automation and high throughput at a low cost. To build a nitrogen nutrient-diagnosis model, muskmelons were cultivated under different nitrogen levels in a greenhouse. The digital images of canopy leaves and the environmental factors (light and temperature) during the growth period of muskmelons were tracked and analyzed. The nitrogen concentrations of the plants were measured, we successfully constructed and trained machine-learning-and deep-learning models based on the traditional backpropagation neural network (BPNN), the emerging convolution neural network (CNN), the deep convolution neural network (DCNN) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) for the nitrogen nutrition diagnosis of muskmelon.

The food system, in turn, is a critical component in sustainable development, with direct linkages to the social, economic, and ecological systems. Weeds are one of the major factors responsible for the crop yield gap in the different regions of the world. In this work, a plant and weed identifier tool was conceptualized, developed, and trained based on artificial deep neural networks to be used for the purpose of weeding the inter‐row space in crop fields. A high‐level design of the weeding robot is conceptualized and proposed as a solution to the problem of weed infestation in farming systems. The implementation process includes data collection, data pre‐processing, training and optimizing a neural network model. A selective pre‐trained neural network model was considered for implementing the task of plant and weed identification. The faster R‐CNN (Region based Convolution Neural Network) method achieved an overall mean Average Precision (mAP) of around 31% while considering the learning rate hyperparameter of 0.0002. In the plant and weed prediction tests, prediction values in the range of 88–98% were observed in comparison to the ground truth. While as on a completely unknown dataset of plants and weeds, predictions were observed in the range of 67–95% for plants, and 84% to 99% in the case of weeds.

However, extensive validation data at a matching resolution remain uncommon or infeasible due to data availability. This has limited the ability to evaluate different yield estimation models and improve understanding of key features useful for yield estimation in both data-rich and data-poor contexts. Here, we assess machine learning models’ capacity for soybean yield prediction using a unique ground-truth dataset of high-resolution (5 m) yield maps generated from combine harvester yield monitor data for over a million field-year observations across the Midwestern United States from 2008 to 2018. First, we compare random forest (RF) implementations, testing a range of feature engineering approaches using Sentinel-2 and Landsat spectral data for 20-and 30-m scale yield prediction. We find that Sentinel-2-based models can explain up to 45% of out-of-sample yield variability from 2017 to 2018 (r2 = 0.45), while Landsat models explain up to 43% across the longer 2008–2018 period. Using discrete Fourier transforms, or harmonic regressions, to capture soybean phenology improved the Landsat-based model considerably. Second, we compare RF models trained using this ground-truth data to models trained on available county-level statistics. We find that county-level models rely more heavily on just a few predictors, namely August weather covariates (vapor pressure deficit, rainfall, temperature) and July and August near-infrared observations. As a result, county-scale models perform relatively poorly on field-scale validation (r2 = 0.32), especially for high-yielding fields, but perform similarly to field-scale models when evaluated at the county scale (r2 = 0.82). Finally, we test whether our findings on variable importance can inform a simple, generalizable framework for regions or time periods beyond ground data availability. To do so, we test improvements to a Scalable Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM) approach that uses crop simulations to train statistical models for yield estimation. Based on findings from our RF models, we employ harmonic regressions to estimate peak vegetation index (VI) and a VI observation 30 days later, with August rainfall as the sole weather covariate in our new SCYM model. Modifications improved SCYM’s explained variance (r2 = 0.27 at the 30 m scale) and provide a new, parsimonious model. © 2020 by the authors.

Because the United States is a major producer and exporter of wheat to the world market, accurate and timely forecasting of wheat yield in the United States (U.S.) is fundamental to national crop management as well as global food security. Previous studies mainly have focused on developing empirical models using only satellite remote sensing images, while other yield determinants have not yet been adequately explored. In addition, these models are based on traditional statistical regression algorithms, while more advanced machine learning approaches have not been explored. This study used advanced machine learning algorithms to establish within-season yield prediction models for winter wheat using multi-source data to address these issues. Specifically, yield driving factors were extracted from four different data sources, including satellite images, climate data, soil maps, and historical yield records. Subsequently, two linear regression methods, including ordinary least square (OLS) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and four well-known machine learning methods, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and deep neural network (DNN), were applied and compared for estimating the county-level winter wheat yield in the Conterminous United States (CONUS) within the growing season. Our models were trained on data from 2008 to 2016 and evaluated on data from 2017 and 2018, with the results demonstrating that the machine learning approaches performed better than the linear regression models, with the best performance being achieved using the AdaBoost model (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.51 t/ha, MAE = 0.39 t/ha). Additionally, the results showed that combining data from multiple sources outperformed single source satellite data, with the highest accuracy being obtained when the four data sources were all considered in the model development. Finally, the prediction accuracy was also evaluated against timeliness within the growing season, with reliable predictions (R2 &gt; 0.84) being able to be achieved 2.5 months before the harvest when the multi-source data were combined. © 2020 by the authors.","CONUS; Machine learning; Multi-source data; Winter wheat; Yield prediction","Adaptive boosting; Crops; Decision trees; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Food supply; Forecasting; International trade; Least squares approximations; Remote sensing; Satellites; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Least absolute shrinkage and selection operators; Linear regression methods; Linear regression models; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning methods; Satellite remote sensing; Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.); Yield prediction models; Learning systems",Article,Scopus

We achieve accurate identification and counting of pods without reducing the speed of inference. The results showed that the R2 between the number predicted by YOLO POD and the ground truth reached 0.967, which is improved by 0.049 compared to YOLO X, while the inference time only increased by 0.08 s.

With the use of satellite remote sensing, it is possible to identify and monitor wheat species on a large scale at any stage of the crop life cycle.

Two thousand samples of eachwheat crop species are acquired every fifteen days with a temporal resolution of ten multispectral bands (band two to band eleven).

However, it is a challenging task to accurately predict water demand affected by a range of factors with nonlinear and uncertainty temporal patterns. This paper proposes a new hybrid framework for urban daily water demand with multiple variables, called the attention-based CNN-LSTM model, which combines convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), attention mechanism (AM), and encoder-decoder network. CNN layers are used to learn the representation and correlation between multivariate variables. LSTM layers are utilized as the building blocks of the encoder-decoder network to capture temporal characteristics from the input sequence, while AM is introduced to the encoder-decoder network to assign corresponding attention according to the importance of water demand multivariable time series at different times. The new hybrid framework considers correlation between multiple variables and neglects irrelevant data points, which helps to improve the prediction accuracy of multivariable time series. The proposed model is contrasted with the LSTM model, the CNN-LSTM model, and the attention-based LSTM to predict the daily water demand time series in Suzhou, China.

Plants of the family Lemnaceae (duckweeds) are the smallest flowering plants in the world, and biometric measurements of single plants and their growth rate are highly challenging. Although the use of software for digital image analysis has changed the way scientists extract phenomenological data (also for studies on duckweeds), the procedure is often not wholly automated and sometimes relies on the intervention of a human operator. Such a constraint can limit the objectivity of the measurements and generally slows down the time required to produce scientific data. Herein lies the need to implement image analysis software with artificial intelligence that can substitute the human operator. In this paper, we present a new method to study the growth rates of the plants of the Lemnaceae family based on the application of machine-learning procedures to digital image analysis. The method is compared to existing analogical and computer-operated procedures. The results showed that our method drastically reduces the time consumption of the human operator while retaining a high correlation in the growth rates measured with other procedures. As expected, machine-learning methods applied to digital image analysis can overcome the constraints of measuring growth rates of very small plants and might help duckweeds gain worldwide attention thanks to their strong nutritional qualities and biological plasticity. © 2022 by the authors.","aquatic plants; duckweed; image analysis; Lemna; Lemnaceae; machine learning; machine training",,Article,Scopus

In this study, we applied machine learning to 16S rRNA sequence and nitrification potential data from an experiment examining interactions between cropping systems and rhizosphere on microbial community assembly and nitrogen cycling processes. Given the high dimensionality of microbiome datasets, we only included nitrifers since only a few taxa are capable of ammonia and nitrite oxidation. We compared the performance of linear and nonlinear algorithms with and without qPCR measures of bacterial and archaea ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) gene abundance. Our feature selection process facilitated the identification of taxons that are most predictive of nitrification and to compare habitats. We found that Nitrosomonas and Nitrospirae were more frequently identified as important predictors of nitrification in conventional systems, whereas Thaumarchaeota were more important predictors in diversified systems. Our results suggest that model performance was not substantively improved by incorporating additional time-consuming and expensive qPCR data on amoA gene abundance. We also identified several clades of nitrifiers important for nitrification in different cropping systems, though we were unable to detect system- or rhizosphere-specific patterns in OTU-level biomarkers for nitrification. Finally, our results highlight the inherent risk of combining data from disparate habitats with the goal of increasing sample size to avoid overfitting models.

This is because the yield record is not long enough, and/or the data are only available at a local farm level. A data-driven approach is developed here to 1) identify how sensitive Vietnamese robusta coffee is to weather on district and provincial levels, 2) during which key moments weather is most influential for yield, and 3) how long before harvest, yield could potentially be forecasted. Robusta coffee yield time series were available from 2000 to 2018 for the Central Highlands, where 40% of global robusta coffee is produced. Multiple linear regression has been used to assess the effect of weather on coffee yield, with regularization techniques such as PCA and leave-one-out to avoid over-fitting the regression models. The data suggest that robusta coffee in Vietnam is most sensitive to two key moments: a prolonged rainy season of the previous year favoring vegetative growth, thereby increasing the potential yield (i.e., number of fruiting nodes), while low rainfall during bean formation decreases yield. Depending on location, these moments could be used to forecast the yield anomaly with 3–6 months’ anticipation. The sensitivity of yield anomalies to weather varied substantially between provinces and even districts. In Dak Lak and some Lam Dong districts, weather explained up to 36% of the robusta coffee yield anomalies variation, while low sensitivities were identified in Dak Nong and Gia Lai districts. Our statistical model can be used as a seasonal forecasting tool for the management of coffee production. It can also be applied to climate change studies, i.e., using this statistical model in climate simulations to see the tendency of coffee in the following decades.

Affected by light, weather, and operating angle, it brings new challenges to the efficient and accurate detection and segmentation of the green object fruit under complex orchard backgrounds. For the green fruit segmentation, an efficient YOLOF-snake segmentation model is proposed. First, the ResNet101 structure is adopted as the backbone network to achieve feature extraction of the green object fruit. Then, the C5 feature maps are expanded with receptive fields and the decoder is used for classification and regression. Besides, the center point in the regression box is employed to get a diamond-shaped structure and fed into an additional Deep-snake network, which is adjusted to the contours of the target fruit to achieve fast and accurate segmentation of green fruit. The experimental results show that YOLOF-snake is sensitive to the green fruit, and the segmentation accuracy and efficiency are significantly improved. The proposed model can effectively extend the application of agricultural equipment and provide theoretical references for other fruits and vegetable segmentation.

However, in recent years, the planting area in China has decreased by approximately 12.2% due to the low yield and economic benefits. Thus, to ensure oil security, it is necessary to develop high-efficiency cultivation for rapeseed production. Crop growth models are powerful tools to analyze and optimize the yield composition of crops under certain environmental and management conditions. In this study, the CROPGRO-Canola model was first calibrated and evaluated using the rapeseed planting data of four growing seasons in Wuhan with nine nitrogen fertilizer levels (from 120 to 360 kg ha−1 ) and five planting densities (from 15 to 75 plants m−2 ). The results indicated that the CROPGRO-Canola model simulated rapeseed growth well under different nitrogen rates and planting densities in China, with a simulation error of 0–3 days for the anthesis and maturity dates and a normalized root mean square error lower than 7.48% for the yield. Furthermore, we optimized the management of rapeseed by calculating the marginal net return under 10 nitrogen rates (from 0 to 360 kg ha−1 at an increasing rate of 40 kg ha−1 ) and 6 planting densities (from 15 to 90 plant m−2 at an increasing rate of 15 plant m−2 ) from 1989 to 2019. The results indicated that the long-term optimal nitrogen rate was 120–160 kg N ha−1, and the optimal planting density was 45–75 plants m−2 under normal fertilizer prices. The optimal nitrogen rate decreased with increasing fertilizer price within a reasonable range. In conclusion, long-term rapeseed management can be optimized based on rapeseed and nitrogen cost using long-term weather records and local soil information. © 2022 by the authors.

Many comparative experiments, considering the mapping feature dimensions and base data sizes, were conducted to testify the validity and robustness of this indicator.

In contrast to linear approaches, which often provide algorithms that are simple to apply, nonlinear learning machines such as neural networks demand more computing and are more likely to have nonlinear optimization difficulties, which are more difficult to solve. Kernel methods, a recently developed technology, are strong machine learning approaches that have a less complicated architecture and give a straightforward way to transforming nonlinear optimization issues into convex optimization problems. Typical analytical tasks in kernel-based learning include classification, regression, and clustering, all of which are compromised. For image processing applications, a semisupervised deep learning approach, which is driven by a little amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data, has shown excellent performance in recent years. For their part, today's semisupervised learning methods operate on the assumption that both labeled and unlabeled information are distributed in a similar manner, and their performance is mostly impacted by the fact that the two data sets are in a similar state of distribution as well. When there is out-of-class data in unlabeled data, the system's performance will be adversely affected. When used in real-world applications, the capacity to verify that unlabeled data does not include data that belongs to a different category is difficult to obtain, and this is especially true in the field of synthetic aperture radar image identification (SAR). Using threshold filtering, this work addresses the problem of unlabeled input, including out-of-class data, having a detrimental influence on the performance of the model when it is utilized to train the model in a semisupervised learning environment. When the model is being trained, unlabeled data that does not belong to a category is filtered out by the model using two different sets of data that the model selects in order to optimize its performance. A series of experiments was carried out on the MSTAR data set, and the superiority of our method was shown when it was compared against a large number of current semisupervised classification algorithms of the highest level of sophistication. This was especially true when the unlabeled data had a significant proportion of data that did not fall into any of the categories. The performance of each kernel function is tested independently using two metrics, namely, the false alarm (FA) and the target miss (TM), respectively. These factors are used to calculate the proportion of incorrect judgments made using the techniques. © 2022 Pooja Chopra et al.",,"Classification (of information); Computer aided instruction; Convex optimization; Data handling; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Radar imaging; Supervised learning; Synthetic aperture radar; Automated registration; Data set; Linear methods; Multi angle; Non-linear optimization; Nonlinear data; Performance; Polynomial filters; SAR Images; Unlabeled data; Nonlinear programming",Article,Scopus

Regardless of their strength, the CP-ANNs still have some limitations in pattern recognition tasks when they encounter ambiguities during the learning process, which leads to the inaccurate classification of the Kohonen-Self-Organizing-Map (K-SOM). This problem has an impact on the performance of the CP-ANNs. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel strategy to improve the CP-ANNs by the Gram-Schmidt algorithm (GSHM) as a pre-processing step of the original data without changing their architecture. Three datasets examples from various domains, such as correlation, crop, and fertilizer, were employed for experimental validation. To obtain the results, we relied on two simulations. The first simulation uses CP-ANNs, and the datasets are inputted into the network without any prior pre-processing. The second simulation uses MCP-ANNs, and the datasets are pre-processed through the GSHM block. Experiment results show that the proposed MCP-ANNs recognize all patterns with a classification accuracy of 100% versus 62.5% for CP-ANNs in the Correlation Dataset. Furthermore, the proposed MCP-ANNs reduce the execution time and training parameter values in all datasets versus CP-ANNs. Thus, the proposed approach based on the GSHM algorithm significantly improves the performance of the CP-ANNs. © 2022 CCIS.","Classification performance; Counter propagation artificial neural networks (CP-ANNs); Data preprocessing; Gram-Schmidt algorithm (GSHM); Kohonen-self organizing-map (K-SOM); Modified counter propagation artificial neural networks (MCP-ANNs)",,Article,Scopus

In total, 10,246 Gr from 95 cultivations were obtained with three cultivars, TK9, TNG71, and KH147, in Central and Southern Taiwan. The model performance was evaluated by the Pearson correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative RMSE (r-RMSE) in the whole growth period (lifecycle), as well as the average and specific key stages (transplanting, 50% initial tillering, panicle initiation, 50% heading, and physiological maturity). The results in lifecycle Gr modeling showed that ANN and GEP models had comparable r (0.9893), but the GEP model had the lowest RMSE (3.83 days) and r-RMSE (7.24%). In stage average and specific key stages, each model has its own best-fit growth period. Overall, GEP model is recommended for rice growth prediction considering the model performance, applicability, and routine farming work.

Results showed the largest irrigation depth led to reductions in irrigation and crop evapotranspiration (ETc) with slightly increased cotton yields compared to the baseline scenarios under different hydroclimatic regimes. However, soil water content and surface runoff values were increased when using the largest irrigation depth. The opposite results were observed for the small irrigation depth. Early planting of cotton resulted in decreased irrigation and ETc, and increased cotton yields under both irrigated and dryland conditions, particularly in normal and wet years. By contrast, the late planting scenarios indicated the opposite for those variables. Simulated hydrologic variables were relatively stable using various maturity cultivars. Nevertheless, greater than 10% reductions in irrigated cotton yield under diverse hydroclimatic years and dryland yields during normal and wet years were identified in the long-season cotton. The opposite was determined for the short-season cotton.

Methods: In May 2019, an orthophoto was reconstructed through a flight over an olive grove to predict oil production from segmentation of plant canopy surfaces. The orchard was divided into four plots (three considered as training plots and one considered as a test plot). For each olive tree of the considered plot, the leaf surface was assessed by segmenting the orthophoto and counting the pixels belonging to the canopy. At harvesting, the olive production per plant was measured. The canopy radius of the plant (R) was automatically obtained from the pixel classification and the measured production was plotted as a function of R. Results: After applying a k-means-classification to the four plots, two distinct subsets emerged in association with the year of loading (high-production) and unloading. For each plot of the training set the logarithm of the production curves against R were fitted with a linear function considering only four samples (two samples belonging to the loading region and two samples belonging to the unloading one) and the total production estimate was obtained by integrating the exponent of the fitting-curve over R. The three fitting curves obtained were used to estimate the total production of the test plot. The resulting estimate of the total production deviates from the real one by less than 12% in training and less than 18% in tests. Conclusions: The early estimation of the total production based on R extracted by the orthophotos can allow the design of an anti-fraud protocol on the declared production. © 2021 by the authors.

Index insurance contracts inevitably make errors, failing to detect losses that occur and issuing payments when no losses occur. The quality of these contracts and the indices on which they are based, need to be evaluated to assess their fitness as insurance, and to provide a guide to choosing the index that best protects the insured. In the remote sensing literature, indices are often evaluated with generic model evaluation statistics such as R2 or Root Mean Square Error that do not directly consider the effect of errors on the quality of the insurance contract. Economic analysis suggests using measures that capture the impact of insurance on the expected economic well-being of the insured. To bridge the gap between the remote sensing and economic perspectives, we adopt a standard economic measure of expected well-being and transform it into a Relative Insurance Benefit (RIB) metric. RIB expresses the welfare benefits derived from an index insurance contract relative to a hypothetical contract that perfectly measures losses. RIB takes on its maximal value of one when the index contract offers the same economic benefits as the perfect contract. When it achieves none of the benefits of insurance it takes on a value of zero, and becomes negative if the contract leaves the insured worse off than having no insurance. Part of our contribution is to decompose this economic well-being measure into an asymmetric loss function. We also argue that the expected well-being measure we use has advantages over other economic measures for the normative purpose of insurance quality ascertainment. Finally, we illustrate the use of the RIB measure with a case study of potential livestock insurance contracts in Northern Kenya. We compared 24 indices that were made with 4 different statistical models and 3 remote sensing data sources. RIB for these indices ranged from 0.09 to 0.5, and R2 ranged from 0.2 to 0.51. While RIB and R2 were correlated, the model with the highest RIB did not have the highest R2. Our findings suggest that, when designing and evaluating an index insurance program, it is useful to separately consider the quality of a remote sensing-based index with a metric like the RIB instead of a generic goodness-of-fit metric.

(steadily supported by the Hellenic Agricultural Organization—Demeter) towards offering precision farming services to rice growers. Within this framework, a new methodology for topdressing nitrogen prediction was developed based on machine learning. Nitrogen is a key element in rice culture and its rational management can increase productivity, reduce costs, and prevent environmental impacts. A multi-source, multi-temporal, and multi-scale dataset was collected, including optical and radar imagery, soil data, and yield maps by monitoring a 110 ha pilot rice farm in Thessaloniki Plain, Greece, for four consecutive years. RapidEye imagery underwent image segmentation to delineate management zones (ancillary, visual interpretation of unmanned aerial system scenes was employed, too); Sentinel-1 (SAR) imagery was modelled with Computer Vision to detect inundated fields and (through this) indicate the exact growth stage of the crop; and Sentinel-2 image data were used to map leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) exactly before topdressing applications. Several machine learning algorithms were configured to predict yield for various nitrogen levels, with the XGBoost model resulting in the highest accuracy. Finally, yield curves were used to select the nitrogen dose maximizing yield, which was thus recommended to the grower. Inundation mapping proved to be critical in the prediction process. Currently, Ecodevelopment S.A. is expanding the application of the new method in different study areas, with a view to further empower its generality and operationality. © 2021 by the authors.

In areas where such data are not readily available, an independent seasonal monitoring method is needed. Remote sensing is a widely used tool to map land use types, although there are some limitations that can partly be circumvented by using, among others, multiple observations, careful feature selection and appropriate analysis methods. Here, we used Sentinel-2 satellite image time series (SITS) over the land area of Norway to map three agricultural land use classes: cereal crops, fodder crops (grass) and unused areas. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and two variants of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are implemented on SITS data of four different temporal resolutions. These enabled us to compare twelve model-dataset combinations to identify the model-dataset combination that results in the most accurate predictions. The CNN is implemented in the spectral and temporal dimensions instead of the conventional spatial dimension. Rather than using existing deep learning architectures, an autotuning procedure is implemented so that the model hyperparameters are empirically optimized during the training. The results obtained on held-out test data show that up to 94% overall accuracy and 90% Cohen’s Kappa can be obtained when the 2D CNN is applied on the SITS data with a temporal resolution of 7 days. This is closely followed by the 1D CNN on the same dataset. However, the latter performs better than the former in predicting data outside the training set. It is further observed that cereal is predicted with the highest accuracy, followed by grass. Predicting the unused areas has been found to be difficult as there is no distinct surface condition that is common for all unused areas. © 2021 by the authors.

How to reflect the external morphological features of the disease and completely retain the color and texture information of the disease area is one of the key research issues for crop disease segmentation. Meanwhile, aiming at the problem of low segmentation accuracy with traditional convolution neural network-based methods in the crop disease leaf image, this paper proposes a spatial pyramid-oriented encoder-decoder cascade convolution neural network for crop disease leaf segmentation. The network consists of a region disease detection network and a region disease segmentation network. Region disease detection network is a kind of network combining cascade convolution neural network with spatial pyramid. This method connects the three-level convolution neural network model, where the structure of the three-level neural network model varies from simple to complex. Different crop disease leaf features are extracted from the different neural network levels. And images are screened to complete the detection of crop disease leaf. What's more, a space pyramid pooling layer is added to each network level. This pooling strategy does not require fixed size input, which increases the size selection of input model. The region segmentation network is established based on the Encoder-Decoder structure. The multi-scale convolution kernel is used to improve the local receptive field of the original convolution kernel and accurately segment the crop disease leaf area. Finally, we conduct experiments on the crop disease leaf images under different conditions, the results show that the proposed method has higher segmentation accuracy. In terms of Precision, Correct segmentation, over-segmentation and under-segmentation indexes, etc., the average values of proposed method are more than 90%.

Once the patterns of a crop are obtained, the correspondence of the declaration with the model of the neural network can be systematically predicted, and can be used for monitoring the CAP.

Water scarcity due to climate change, together with the increasing demand of food, is leading experts from around the world find appropriate indicators for water-use efficiency. In this paper we propose and test different indicators for service delivery performance, productive efficiency, and economic efficiency. Since the characteristics of the studied area and the citrus cropping system in the East of Spain are particular, we include in our analysis two other variables which are key to understanding the changes in the indicators: the obtained productivity, and the applied irrigation. The indicators and these two variables are tested with the information provided by farmers of citrus orchards belonging to an irrigation community from the East of Spain. The effect of different factors, such as cultivated varieties, type of farmer (professional or non-professional), or plantations’ size, are evaluated against the productivity and irrigation performance of the evaluated orchards. The effect of excess of irrigation on the indicators is also studied with the previous factors. Finally, an artificial intelligence system is used to predict productive efficiency of an orchard, based on the size and the water supply. Among the proposed indicators, the service delivery performance indicators came out to be the least useful and might provoke overirrigation due to the lack of accuracy of the data used for its calculation. The productive and economic efficiency indicators have been useful to illustrate the remarkable effect that excess of irrigation has on water efficiency, since a reduction of 66% of productive efficiency is found for some of the analysed varieties. On other cases, a reduction of 50% in economic efficiency is detected due to the excess of irrigation. Moreover, the excess of irrigation implied higher economic efficiency in only one of the evaluated varieties. © 2020 by the authors.

Due to the high number of plants per unit area, early plant overlapping and eventual plant loss, the estimation of soybean plant density in the later stages of development should enable the determination of the final plant number and reflect the state of the harvest. In order to assess soybean plant density in a digital, nondestructive, and less intense way, analysis was performed on RGB images (containing three channels: RED, GREEN, and BLUE) taken with a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) on 66 experimental plots in 2018, and 200 experimental plots in 2019. Mean values of the R, G, and B channels were extracted for each plot, then vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated and used as predictors for the machine learning model (MLM). The model was calibrated in 2018 and validated in 2019. For validation purposes, the predicted values for the 200 experimental plots were compared with the real number of plants per unit area (m2). Model validation resulted in the correlation coefficient-R = 0.87, mean absolute error (MAE) = 6.24, and root mean square error (RMSE) = 7.47.

The estimation of leaf area index (LAI) in tropical savanna ecosystems is therefore fundamental for the proper planning and management of this natural capital. In this study, we assess the spatio-temporal seasonal LAI dynamics (dry and wet seasons) as a proxy for rangeland condition and productivity in the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. The 30 m Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) spectral bands, derived vegetation indices and a non-parametric approach (i.e., random forest, RF) were used to assess dry and wet season LAI condition and variability in the KNP. The results showed that RF optimization enhanced the model performance in estimating LAI. Moderately high accuracies were observed for the dry season (R2 of 0.63-0.72 and average RMSE of 0.60 m2/m2) and wet season (0.62-0.63 and 0.79 m2/m2). Derived thematic maps demonstrated that the park had high LAI estimates during the wet season when compared to the dry season. On average, LAI estimates ranged between 3 and 7 m2/m2 during the wet season, whereas for the dry season most parts of the park had LAI estimates ranging between 0.00 and 3.5 m2/m2. The findings indicate that Kruger National Park had high levels of productivity during the wet season monitoring period. Overall, this work shows the unique potential of Landsat 8-derived metrics in assessing LAI as a proxy for tropical savanna rangelands productivity.

The overarching goal of this study was to develop a higher-spatial-resolution vegetation outlook (VegOut-UBN) model that integrates multiple satellite, climatic, and biophysical input variables for the Upper Blue Nile (UBN) basin. VegOut-UBN uses current and historical observations in predicting the vegetation condition at multiple leading time steps of 1, 3, 6, and 9 dekades. VegOut-UBN was developed to predict the vegetation condition during the main crop-growing season locally called ""Kiremt"" (June to September) using historical input data from 2001 to 2016. The rule-based regression tree approach was used to develop the relationship between the predictand and predictor variables. The results for the recent historic drought (2009 and 2015) and non-drought (2007) years are presented to evaluate the model accuracy during extreme weather conditions. The result, in general, shows that the predictive accuracy of the model decreases as the prediction interval increases for the cross-validation years. The coefficient of determination (R2) of the predictive and observed vegetation condition shows a higher value (R2 &gt; 0.8) for one-month prediction and a relatively lower value (R2 ≅= 0.70) for three-month prediction. The result also reveals strong spatial integrity and similarity of the observed and predicted maps. VegOut-UBN was evaluated and compared with the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) (derived from independent rainfall datasets from meteorological stations) at different aggregate periods and with a food security status map. The result was encouraging and indicative of the potential application of VegOut-UBN for drought monitoring and prediction. The VegOut-UBN model could be informative in decision-making processes and could contribute to the development of operational drought monitoring and predictive models for the UBN basin. © 2019 by the authors.","Drought; Regression model; Upper Blue Nile; VegOut-UBN","Cultivation; Decision making; Developing countries; Food supply; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Vegetation; Blue Nile; Coefficient of determination; Decision making process; Extreme weather conditions; Historical observation; Regression model; Standardized precipitation index; VegOut-UBN; Drought",Article,Scopus

Each of the models was constructed in such a way that the yield prediction can be carried out on three dates: April 15th, May 31st, and June 30th. For model building, artificial neural networks with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) topology were used, on the basis of meteorological data (temperature and precipitation) and information about mineral fertilisation. The data were collected from the years, 2008-2015, from 328 production fields located in Greater Poland, Poland. An assessment of the quality of forecasts produced based on neural models was verified by determination of forecast errors using RAE (relative approximation error), RMS (root mean square error), MAE (mean absolute error) error indicators, and MAPE (mean absolute percentage error). An important feature of the produced prediction models is the ability to realize the forecast in the current agrotechnical year on the basis of the current weather and fertiliser information. The lowest MAPE error values were obtained for the neural model WR15_04 (April 15th) based on the MLP network with structure 15:15-18-11-1:1, which reached 7.51%. Other models reached MAPE errors of 7.85% for model WR31_05 (May 31st) and 8.12% for model WR30_06 (June 30th). The performed sensitivity analysis gave information about the factors that have the greatest impact on winter rapeseed yields. The highest rank of 1 was obtained by two networks for the same independent variable in the form of the sum of precipitation within a period from September 1st to December 31st of the previous year. However, in model WR15_04, the highest rank obtained a feature in the form of a sum of molybdenum fertilization in the current year (MO_CY). The models of winter rapeseed yield produced in the work will be the basis for the construction of new forecasting tools, which may be an important element of precision agriculture and the main element of decision support systems. © 2018 by the authors.","MLP network; Neural model; Precision agriculture; Sensitivity analysis; Winter rapeseed; Yield prediction","agricultural technology; artificial neural network; crop yield; fertilizer application; molybdenum; precision agriculture; sensitivity analysis; topology; Poland [Central Europe]; Brassica napus",Article,Scopus

Two artificial intelligence algorithms, ensemble-bagging (EB) and deep neural network (DNN), were used to predict soybean seed yield and FBIO using HVI. Considering HVI as input variables, the coefficients of determination (R2 ) of 0.76 and 0.77 for yield and 0.91 and 0.89 for FBIO were obtained using DNN and EB, respectively. In this study, we also used hybrid DNN-SPEA2 to estimate the optimum HVI values in soybeans with maximized yield and FBIO productions.

In order to address these issues, we develop a model to predict potato yield using satellite remote sensing. In an effort to offer a good predictive model that improves the state of the art on potato precision agriculture, we use images from the twin Sentinel 2 satellites (European Space Agency-Copernicus Programme) over three growing seasons, applying different machine learning models. First, we fitted nine machine learning algorithms with various pre-processing scenarios using variables from July, August and September based on the red, red-edge and infra-red bands of the spectrum. Second, we selected the best performing models and evaluated them against independent test data. Finally, we repeated the previous two steps using only variables corresponding to July and August. Our results showed that the feature selection step proved vital during data pre-processing in order to reduce multicollinearity among predictors. The Regression Quantile Lasso model (11.67% Root Mean Square Error, RMSE; R2 = 0.88 and 9.18% Mean Absolute Error, MAE) and Leap Backwards model (10.94% RMSE, R2 = 0.89 and 8.95% MAE) performed better when predictors with a correlation coefficient &gt; 0.5 were removed from the dataset. In contrast, the Support Vector Machine Radial (svmRadial) performed better with no feature selection method (11.7% RMSE, R2 = 0.93 and 8.64% MAE).

This crop management has high technological and economic demand, thus the search for the efficient use of inputs such as crop growth regulator (to balance vegetative and reproductive growth) has become important in applied research areas such as precision agriculture. The objective of this work was to evaluate a predictive framework for cotton height based on field and remote sensing data and machine learning techniques, since this is an important variable in management planning of crop growth regulators on large scale cotton production. Field data from two agricultural seasons (2020/2021 and 2021/2022) from 16 fields and approximately 2800 hectares of commercial planted area were used as input along with Planet's satellite imagery. Machine learning techniques were used to answer the following main questions: (i) Can algorithms accurately predict crop height using two entire seasons of this data and remote sensing? (ii) Which remote sensing data and machine learning algorithm presents the best performance in the predictions? The algorithms could predict cotton height for the entire season with R-squared ranging from 0.31 to 0.87. Considering the main phenological phases, R-squared of the predictions ranged from -0.2 to 0.83. The inclusion of days after emergence showed an improvement in the performance of all models, decreasing the mean absolute error. For the main phenological phases, the best model performances were found from emergence to first flower appearance. Difference vegetation index and near infrared bands were the best predictors, considering the entire season and phenological phases. Random forest regressor presented the best overall performance, considering R-squared and mean absolute error. The use of two variables (remote sensing and time) proved to be sufficient to achieve one of the best performances. © 2022 The Author(s)","Cerrado; Multispectral imagery; Phenology; Plant biometrics; Regression models",,Article,Scopus

A case in point is remote sensing images (RSI), now available in large-scale RSI archives, which have attracted a considerable amount of research on image classification within the remote sensing community. The basic task of single-target multi-class image classification considers the case where each image is assigned exactly one label from a predefined finite set of class labels. Recently, however, image annotations have become increasingly complex, with images labeled with several labels (instead of just one). In other words, the goal is to assign multiple semantic categories to an image, based on its high-level context. The corresponding machine learning tasks is called multi-label classification (MLC). The classification of RSI is currently predominantly addressed by deep neural network (DNN) approaches, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can be utilized as feature extractors as well as end-to-end methods. After only considering single-target classification for a long period, DNNs have recently emerged that address the task of MLC. On the other hand, trees and tree ensembles for MLC have a long tradition and are the best-performing class of MLC methods, but need predefined feature representations to operate on. In this work, we explore different strategies for model training based on the transfer learning paradigm, where we utilize different families of (pre-trained) CNN architectures, such as VGG, EfficientNet, and ResNet. The architectures are trained in an end-to-end manner and used in two different modes of operation, namely, as standalone models that directly perform the MLC task, and as feature extractors. In the latter case, the learned representations are used with tree ensemble methods for MLC, such as random forests and extremely randomized trees. We conduct an extensive experimental analysis of methods over several publicly available RSI datasets and evaluate their effectiveness in terms of standard MLC measures. Of these, ranking-based evaluation measures are most relevant, especially ranking loss. The results show that, for addressing the RSI-MLC task, it is favorable to use lightweight network architectures, such as EfficientNet-B2, which is the best performing end-to-end approach, as well as a feature extractor. Furthermore, in the datasets with a limited number of images, using traditional tree ensembles for MLC can yield better performance compared to end-to-end deep approaches. © 2023 by the authors.","convolutional neural networks; multi-label classification; remote sensing; tree ensemble methods","Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Image classification; Learning systems; Network architecture; Semantics; Transfer learning; Classification of remote sensing image; Convolutional neural network; End to end; Ensemble methods; Feature extractor; Multi-label classifications; Remote sensing images; Remote-sensing; Tree ensemble method; Tree ensembles; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

The unknowns that accompany projects, the different risks, the uniqueness of each project, and the differences between organizations’ culture and management techniques, hinder the ability to build one project duration prediction tool that can fit all types of projects and organizations. When machine learning (ML) techniques are used for project duration prediction, the challenge is even greater, as each organization has a different dataset structure, different features, and different quality of data. This hinders the ability to create one ML model that fits all types of organizations. This paper presents a new dynamic ML tool for improving the prediction accuracy of project duration. The tool is based on an artificial neural network (ANN) which is automatically adapted and optimized to different types of prediction methods and different datasets. The tool trains the ANN model multiple times with different architectures and uses a genetic algorithm to eventually choose the architecture which gives the most accurate prediction results. The validation process of the prediction accuracy is performed by using real-life project datasets supplied by two different organizations which have different project management approaches, different project types, and different project features. The results show that the proposed tool significantly improved the prediction accuracy for both organizations despite the major differences in the size, type, and structure of their datasets. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; GPU; machine learning; prediction; project management",,Article,Scopus

The model estimates crop yield, production, water requirement, and net income. In this system, the Simulated Annealing algorithm (SA) is used as an optimization tool inside the DSS developed, and the result is as robust as the exact solution with higher computational efficiency. From the model applied, it is found that the current crop pattern and water distribution plan used in the study area should be improved.

In particular, the characteristics of smallholder systems pose a unique challenge in the development of reliable prediction methods. Therefore, in this study, a fast and reproducible new approach to wheat prediction is developed by combining predictors derived from optical (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) sensors using a diverse set of machine learning and deep learning methods under a small dataset domain. This study takes place in the wheat belt region of Ethiopia and evaluates forty-two predictors that represent the major vegetation index categories of green, water, chlorophyll, dry biomass, and VH polarization SAR indices. The study also applies field-collected agronomic data from 165 farm fields for training and validation. According to results, compared to other methods, a combined automated machine learning (AutoML) approach with a generalized linear model (GLM) showed higher performance. AutoML, which reduces training time, delivered ten influential parameters. For the combined approach, the mean RMSE of wheat yield was from 0.84 to 0.98 ton/ha using ten predictors from the test dataset, achieving a 99% confidence interval. It also showed a correlation coefficient as high as 0.69 between the estimated yield and measured yield, and it was less sensitive to the small datasets used for model training and validation. A deep neural network with three hidden layers using the ten influential parameters was the second model. For this model, the mean RMSE of wheat yield was between 1.31 and 1.36 ton/ha on the test dataset, achieving a 99% confidence interval. This model used 55 neurons with respective values of 0.1, 0.5, and 1 × 10−4 for the hidden dropout ratio, input dropout ratio, and l2 regularization. The approaches implemented in this study are fast and reproducible and beneficial to predict yield at scale.

In this technology-driven farming era, this portfolio of technologies has aided farmers to overcome many of the challenges associated with their farming activities by enabling precise and timely decision making on the basis of data that are observed and subsequently converged. In this regard, Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds a key place, whereby it can assist key stakeholders in making precise decisions regarding the conditions on their farms. Machine Learning (ML), which is a branch of AI, enables systems to learn and improve from their experience without explicitly being programmed, by imitating intelligent behavior in solving tasks in a manner that requires low computational power. For the time being, ML is involved in a variety of aspects of farming, assisting ranchers in making smarter decisions on the basis of the observed data.

Accurately estimating the effect of change in structural parameters on the discharge exponent is critical for the design and optimization of emitters. In this research, the response surface methodology (RSM) and two machine learning models, the artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR), are used to predict the discharge exponent of tooth-shaped labyrinth channel emitters. The input parameters consist of the number of channel units (N), channel depth (D), tooth angle (α), tooth height (H) and channel width (W). The applied models are assessed through the coefficient of determination (R2 ), root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The analysis of variance shows that tooth height had the greatest effect on the discharge exponent. Statistical criteria indicate that among the three models, the SVR model has the highest prediction accuracy and the best robustness with an average R2 of 0.9696, an average RMSE of 0.0037 and an average MAE of 0.0031.

One hundred hybrids were evaluated under sub-optimal and optimal N environments for two years. The experimental layout was a 10 × 10 alpha lattice design with two replications for two experiments. The results obtained showed that, the genotypes evaluated varied for grain yield and the characters measured under sub-optimal and optimal N conditions. Grain yield reduction due to N stress was 40.9%. General and specific combining ability (GCA) and (SCA) effects for mean squares varied for grain yield demonstrating the importance of additive and non-additive genetic effects for the hybrids evaluated under the study conditions. Even though significant variations were detected for GCA and SCA, GCA which is the additive gene action component mainly controlled the heritage of grain yield under both conditions. Inbred line 15 was identified as the superior parent with positive and significant GCA for grain yield under sub-optimal N. Genotypic correlation studies displayed that grain yield was positively correlated with ears per plant under sub-optimal N and was also positively associated with anthesis-silking interval under high N.

Using network devices in agriculture has the potential to enhance the production process. One of the key challenges WSN faces is energy efficiency. A model based on the water pipeline method is proposed in order to efficiently utilize sensor nodes in agricultural production and water distribution. A water pipeline serves as an important structure for transporting potable water across a distance for consumption or irrigation. In contrast, the biggest transportation problems of water pipelines are leaks. So, water resources may be lost as a result. These pipes need real-time monitoring to prevent such problems. The wireless sensor network technique, however, is considered one of the best solutions available today for monitoring water pipelines. A detailed analysis of agriculture is provided by the model. Aspects of WSN are discussed and their agricultural use is expounded. Moreover, this paper describes the various types of applicability of existing sensor networks in the field of agriculture, along with some technical perspectives. To achieve the best power consumption and communication for the two types of range, ZigBee wireless protocols are utilized. As such, high-performance information that provides a platform for WSNs to better support agricultural production is also included in our proposed model in order to address the shortcomings of existing WSNs regarding energy efficiency.

We hypothesized that the use of N nutrition index and N uptake combined with red-edge or green reflectance would provide extended linearity and higher accuracy in estimating N status across different years, genotypes, and densities, and the accuracy of N status estimation will be further improved by using artificial neural network based on multiple spectral reflectance wavelengths. Multifactorial field experiments on interactive effects of N nutrition, sowing density, and genotype were conducted in 2011–2013 to develop methods for estimation of N status and to reduce dependency on changing environmental conditions, genotype, or barley management. N nutrition index (NNI) and total N uptake were used to correct the effect of biomass accumulation and N dilution during plant development. We employed an artificial neural network to integrate data from multiple reflectance wavelengths and thereby eliminate the effects of such interfering factors as genotype, sowing density, and year. NNI and N uptake significantly reduced the interannual variation in relationships to vegetation indices documented for N content. The vegetation indices showing the best performance across years were mainly based on red-edge and carotenoid absorption bands. The use of an artificial neural network also significantly improved the estimation of all N status indicators, including N content. The critical reflectance wavelengths for neural network training were in spectral bands 400–490, 530–570, and 710–720 nm. In summary, combining NNI or N uptake and neural network increased the accuracy of N status estimation to up 94%, compared to less than 60% for N concentration. © 2021 by the authors.

MIF provides a key performance shop floor metric called the value of information flow (VIF). Previous methods have been used to analyze VIF in developed countries. However, these methods are sometimes limited when applied to developing countries where the shop floor is disorganized. It then renders the MIF with the imported software inefficient because of the gap between the user environments. Taking Cameroon as a case study, this study proposes a new method of modeling and analyzing the information flow and its value based on the characteristics of information flow (CIF) for developing countries. In addition, a predictive analysis of the VIF based on CIF using an artificial neural network (ANN) on one hand and optimized ANN with particle swarm optimizer (PSO) and genetic algorithms (GA) on the other is performed. The ANN model of regression developed has the following performance: coefficient of determination: 0.99 and mean squared error (MSE): 0.00043. For the PSO-ANN, the MSE decreased to 0.00011, and this model result was similar to that of the deep learning model used for regression. The GA-ANN model results were not as satisfactory as those of the PSO-ANN model. A predictive system to analyze VIF is proposed for managers of companies in developing countries. © 2021 The Author(s)","Characteristics of information flow; Deep learning; Developing countries; Performance; PSO-ANN; Value of information flow",,Article,Scopus

The occurrence of panicle initiation could be determined via either green ring, internode-elongation, or a 1–2 mm panicle, and was observed through manual dissection. The quadratic polynomial regression model was used to construct the model of the trend of normalized difference vegetation index-based vegetation indexes (NDVI-based VIs) between pre-tillering and panicle differentiation stages. The slope of the quadratic polynomial regression model tended to be alleviated in the period in which the panicle initiation stage should occur. The results indicated that the trend of the NDVI-based VIs was correlated with panicle initiation.

Mechanical transplanting is gaining popularity as a cost-saving and on-time operation with less labor orientation in rice cultivation. This experiment was performed to investigate the relation of rice yield (g m−2) with four mechanical rice transplanting parameters (i.e., seedling density in the tray (nos.cm−2), missing hill percentage, floating hill percentage, and seedling number per hill), and to develop an Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) model to predict the yield from the transplanting parameters. A regression analysis was also conducted to validate the accuracy of the trained ANN model. This study reveals that the dependency of yield on these four parameters is not ignorable and significant. The ANN model performed an accurate match in predicting yield from transplanting parameters with an R2 value of 0.994 and adjusted R2 of 0.993. The ANN model possessed an RMSE of 4.577 in predicting yield which lied in the allowable range of 10 %. The ANN model showed better accuracy in predicting yield than the regression model and pretended to be an alternative to numerical models in predicting yield.

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to simulate the watershed hydrology and crop yield. It was used to estimate corn and soybean water productivity using different irrigation sources, including treated wastewater from adjacent wastewa-ter treatment plants (WWTPs). The SWAT model was able to estimate crop water productivity at both subbasin and hydrologic response unit (HRU) levels.

This study focuses on the land cover classification and change detection with multitemporal and multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite data. To address the challenging land cover change detection task, we rely on two different deep learning architectures and selected pre-processing steps. For example, we define an excluded class and deal with temporal water shoreline changes in the pre-processing. We employ a fully convolutional neural network (FCN), and we combine the FCN with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The FCN can only handle monotemporal input data, while the FCN combined with LSTM can use sequential information (multitemporal). Besides, we provided fixed and variable sequences as training sequences for the combined FCN and LSTM approach. The former refers to using six defined satellite images, while the latter consists of image sequences from an extended training pool of ten images. Further, we propose measures for the robustness concerning the selection of Sentinel-2 image data as evaluation metrics. We can distinguish between actual land cover changes and misclassifications of the deep learning approaches with these metrics. According to the provided metrics, both multitemporal LSTM approaches outperform the monotemporal FCN approach, about 3 to 5 percentage points (p.p.). The LSTM approach trained on the variable sequences detects 3 p.p. more land cover changes than the LSTM approach trained on the fixed sequences. Besides, applying our selected pre-processing improves the water classification and avoids reducing the dataset effectively by 17.6%. The presented LSTM approaches can be modified to provide applicability for a variable number of image sequences since we published the code of the deep learning models.

The productivity of tree crops such as almond orchards, is particularly complex. To understand and mitigate these threats requires a collection of multi-layer large data sets, and advanced analytics is also critical to integrate these highly heterogeneous datasets to generate insights about the key constraints on the yields at tree and field scales. Here we used a machine learning approach to investigate the determinants of almond yield variation in California’s almond orchards, based on a unique 10-year dataset of field measurements of light interception and almond yield along with meteorological data. We found that overall the maximum almond yield was highly dependent on light interception, e.g., with each one percent increase in light interception resulting in an increase of 57.9 lbs/acre in the potential yield. Light interception was highest for mature sites with higher long term mean spring incoming solar radiation (SRAD), and lowest for younger orchards when March maximum temperature was lower than 19°C. However, at any given level of light interception, actual yield often falls significantly below full yield potential, driven mostly by tree age, temperature profiles in June and winter, summer mean daily maximum vapor pressure deficit (VPDmax), and SRAD. Utilizing a full random forest model, 82% (±1%) of yield variation could be explained when using a sixfold cross validation, with a RMSE of 480 ± 9 lbs/acre. When excluding light interception from the predictors, overall orchard characteristics (such as age, location, and tree density) and inclusive meteorological variables could still explain 78% of yield variation. The model analysis also showed that warmer winter conditions often limited mature orchards from reaching maximum yield potential and summer VPDmax beyond 40 hPa significantly limited the yield. Our findings through the machine learning approach improved our understanding of the complex interaction between climate, canopy light interception, and almond nut production, and demonstrated a relatively robust predictability of almond yield. This will ultimately benefit data-driven climate adaptation and orchard nutrient management approaches. © Copyright © 2020 Jin, Chen, Lampinen and Brown.","artificial intelligence; big data; light interceptioon; nutrient management; Prunus dulcis; yield gap",,Article,Scopus

Pakistan has its GDP based on agriculture, however it relies on manual monitoring of crops, which is a labour intensive and ineffective method. In contrast to this, several cutting edge technology-based solutions are being employed in the developed countries to enhance the crop yield with the optimal use of resources. To this end, we have proposed an integrated approach for monitoring crop health using IoT, machine learning and drone technology. The integration of these sensing modalities generate heterogeneous data which not only varies in nature (i.e. observed parameter) but also has different temporal fidelity. The spatial resolution of these methods is also different, hence, the optimal integration of these sensing modalities and their implementation in practice are addressed in the proposed system. In our proposed solution, the IoT sensors provide the real-time status of environmental parameters impacting the crop, and the drone platform provide the multispectral data used for generating Vegetation Indices (VIs) such as Normalized Difference vegetation Index (NDVI) for analyzing the crop health. The NDVI provides information about the crop based on the chlorophyll content, which offers limited information regarding the crop health. In order to obtain a rich and detailed knowledge about crop health, the variable length time series data of IoT sensors and multispectral images were converted to a fixed-sized representation to generate crop health maps. A number of machine and deep learning algorithms were applied on the collected data wherein deep neural network with two hidden layers was found to be the most optimal model among all the selected models, providing an accuracy of (98.4%). Further, the health maps were validated through ground surveys and by agriculture experts due to the absence of reference data. The proposed research is basically an indigenous, technology based agriculture solution capable of providing important insights into the crop health by extracting complementary features from multi-modal data set, and minimizing the crop ground survey effort, particularly useful when the agriculture land is large in size. © 2013 IEEE.","crop health; Internet of Things (IoT); NDVI; precision agriculture","Agricultural robots; Crops; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Drones; Health; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Modal analysis; Multilayer neural networks; Remote sensing; Surveys; Vegetation; Chlorophyll contents; Complementary features; Cutting edge technology; Environmental parameter; Internet of Things (IOT); Multi-modal approach; Multispectral images; Normalized difference vegetation index; Internet of things",Article,Scopus

This research aims to develop tools based on data analytics to predict the magnitude of these discrepancies, improving enterprise profitability while, at the same time, reducing environmental impact aiding food waste management. A food company that produces liquid products based on fruits and vegetables was analyzed. Data was gathered on 1,795 batches, including the characteristics of the product (recipe, components used…) and the difference between the input and the output weight. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were used to predict deviations in production, reducing uncertainties related to the amount of waste produced. The ML models had greater predictive capacity than a linear model with stepwise parameter selection. Then, uncertainty is included in the predictions using a normal distribution based on the residuals of the model. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that ML models can be used as a tool to identify possible production anomalies. This research shows innovative ways to deal with uncertainty in production planning using modern methods in the field of operation research. These tools improve classical methods and provide production managers with valuable information to assess the economic benefits of improved machinery or process controls.

This is accomplished by empirical P and T copula functions and the X2-test, and is demonstrated in two locations in Kenya with different major precipitation processes. It is shown that the selection based on traditional approaches alone may lead to nonoptimal decisions in terms of joint dependence structure between P and T. It was found that the copula-based approach may reduce the need for complex multivariate bias correction, as demonstrated using local intensity scaling for P and linear scaling for T. The new approach may contribute to improving RCM and ESM simulations and climate-impact studies worldwide. © 2019 by the authors.

In Sahelian countries, irregular spatial and temporal rainfall distribution remains a threat for rainfed agriculture despite the use of a wide range of techniques for soil conservation. Objectives. To analyze several irrigation strategies for rainfed crops and to assess the likely economic incentives to support the adoption of supplemental irrigation from farm ponds in response to dry spells. Method. The supplemental irrigation strategies and economic incentives were analyzed using an applied bio-economic model in a typical farm. Results. The simulations showed that supplemental irrigation from small individual ponds would increase farmers’ income compared to the situation without irrigation. Maize, sorghum and millet production under supplemental irrigation in a dry year would increase expected income by 26.49% (133,030 CFA francs equivalent to 202.80 euros) compared to the situation without irrigation. Simulations with incentives to promote supplemental irrigation focused on four subsidy modalities and the introduction of a credit system for agricultural households. Conclusions. Of the incentives studied, the food-for-work subsidy to mobilize labor for basin building seems particularly suitable for scaling-up supplemental irrigation. © 2019 FAC UNIV SCIENCES AGRONOMIQUES GEMBLOUX.

This dataset was obtained using the cumulative distribution function transform (CDF-t) method, a method that has been applied to several regions and contexts but never to Africa. Here CDF-t has been applied over the period 1950-2099 combining Historical runs and climate change scenarios for six variables: precipitation, mean near-surface air temperature, near-surface maximum air temperature, near-surface minimum air temperature, surface downwelling shortwave radiation, and wind speed, which are critical variables for agricultural purposes. WFDEI has been used as the reference dataset to correct the GCMs. Evaluation of the results over West Africa has been carried out on a list of priority user-based metrics that were discussed and selected with stakeholders. It includes simulated yield using a crop model simulating maize growth. These bias-corrected GCM data have been compared with another available dataset of bias-corrected GCMs using WATCH Forcing Data as the reference dataset. The impact of WFD, WFDEI, and also EWEMBI reference datasets has been also examined in detail. It is shown that CDF-t is very effective at removing the biases and reducing the high inter-GCM scattering. Differences with other bias-corrected GCM data are mainly due to the differences among the reference datasets. This is particularly true for surface downwelling shortwave radiation, which has a significant impact in terms of simulated maize yields. Projections of future yields over West Africa are quite different, depending on the bias-correction method used. However all these projections show a similar relative decreasing trend over the 21st century. © Author(s) 2018.",,"Agriculture; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Distribution functions; Wind; Agricultural impacts; Agricultural purpose; Bias-correction methods; Climate change scenarios; Cumulative distribution function; Global climate model; Near surface air temperature; Short-wave radiation; Climate models; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

A vegetation index (VI) derived from an aerially observed multispectral image (MSI) can quantify crop health, moisture and nutrient content. However, due to the high cost of multispectral sensors, alternate, low-cost solutions have lately received great interest. We present a novel method for model-based estimation of a VI using RGB color images. The non-linear spatio-spectral relationship between the RGB image of vegetation and the index computed by its corresponding MSI is learned through deep neural networks. The learned models can be used to estimate VI of a crop segment. Results: Analysis of images obtained in wheat breeding trials show that the aerially observed VI was highly correlated with ground-measured VI. In addition, VI estimates based on RGB images were highly correlated with VI deduced from MSIs. Spatial, spectral and temporal information of images contributed to estimation of VI. Both intra-variety and inter-variety differences were preserved by estimated VI. However, VI estimates were reliable until just before significant appearance of senescence. Conclusion: The proposed approach validates that it is reasonable to accurately estimate VI using deep neural networks. The results prove that RGB images contain sufficient information for VI estimation. It demonstrates that low-cost VI measurement is possible with standard RGB cameras. © 2018 The Author(s).","Deep learning; Phenotyping; Precision agriculture; Wheat",,Article,Scopus

Changes in climate result in changes in streamflow and rising water temperatures, which impact biochemical reaction rates and increase stratification in lakes and reservoirs. Using two water quality modeling systems (the Hydrologic and Water Quality System; HAWQS and US Basins), five climate models, and two greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation policies, we assess future water quality in the continental U.S. to 2100 considering four water quality parameters: water temperature, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus. Once these parameters are aggregated into a water quality index, we find that, while the water quality models differ under the baseline, there is more agreement between future projections. In addition, we find that the difference in national-scale economic benefits across climate models is generally larger than the difference between the two water quality models. Both water quality models find that water quality will more likely worsen in the East than in the West. Under the business-as-usual emissions scenario, we find that climate change is likely to cause economic impacts ranging from 1.2 to 2.3 (2005 billion USD/year) in 2050 and 2.7 to 4.8 in 2090 across all climate and water quality models. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate change; Economic valuation; Greenhouse gases; Mitigation; Model comparison; Water quality","Biochemical oxygen demand; Climate models; Dissolved oxygen; Economic and social effects; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen; Reaction rates; Temperature; Water quality; Biochemical reaction rate; Climate change impact; Economic valuation; Mitigation; Model comparison; Water quality indexes; Water quality modeling; Water quality parameters; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; economic impact; greenhouse gas; hydrological modeling; lake; mitigation; reservoir; river basin; streamflow; valuation; water quality; United States",Article,Scopus

Research on ecosystem services has increased recently, though relatively fewer studies apply a data driven approach to quantify freshwater provisioning for different ecosystem services. In this study, freshwater provisioning was quantified annually from 1995 to 2013 for 13 watersheds in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). Results showed that the annual freshwater provision indices for all watersheds were less than one indicating that freshwater provisioning is diminished in the UMRB. The concentrations of sediment and nutrients (total nitrogen, and total phosphorus) are the most sensitive factors that impact freshwater provisioning in the UMRB. A significant linear relationship was observed between precipitation and freshwater provisioning index. During wet periods freshwater provisioning generally decreased in the study watersheds, primarily because of relatively high concentrations and loads of sediment and nutrients delivered from nonpoint sources.

Here, we have applied the process-based crop model SARRA-H calibrated and validated over multi-year field trials and surveys at eight contrasting sites in terms of climate and agricultural practices in Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. The model gives a reasonable correlation with observed yields of sorghum and millet under a range of cultivars and traditional crop management practices. We applied the model to more than 7000 simulations of yields of sorghum and millet for 35 stations across West Africa and under very different future climate conditions. We took into account 35 possible climate scenarios by combining precipitation anomalies from -20% to 20% and temperature anomalies from +0 to +6 °C. We found that most of the 35 scenarios (31/35) showed a negative impact on yields, up to -41% for +6 °C/ - 20% rainfall. Moreover, the potential future climate impacts on yields are very different from those recorded in the recent past. This is because of the increasingly adverse role of higher temperatures in reducing crop yields, irrespective of rainfall changes. When warming exceeds +2 °C, negative impacts caused by temperature rise cannot be counteracted by any rainfall change. The probability of a yield reduction appears to be greater in the Sudanian region (southern Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, northern Togo and Benin), because of an exacerbated sensitivity to temperature changes compared to the Sahelian region (Niger, Mali, northern parts of Senegal and Burkina Faso), where crop yields are more sensitive to rainfall change. Finally, our simulations show that the photoperiod-sensitive traditional cultivars of millet and sorghum used by local farmers for centuries seem more resilient to future climate conditions than modern cultivars bred for their high yield potential (-28% versus -40% for the +4 °C/ - 20% scenario). Photoperiod-sensitive cultivars counteract the effect of temperature increase on shortening cultivar duration and thus would likely avoid the need to shift to cultivars with a greater thermal time requirement. However, given the large difference in mean yields of the modern versus traditional varieties, the modern varieties would still yield more under optimal fertility conditions in a warmer world, even if they are more affected by climate change. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.","agriculture; climate change; impacts; West Africa","Agriculture; Climate models; Computer simulation; Crops; Plants (botany); Rain; Agricultural practices; Climate change impact; Crop management practices; Effect of temperature; impacts; Precipitation anomalies; Sensitivity to temperatures; West Africa; Climate change; agricultural management; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; cultivar; management practice; millet; model validation; savanna; sorghum; West Africa",Article,Scopus

However, different stakeholders in the agri-food sector require different levels of accuracy and lead times in which a yield prediction should be available. For the producers, predictions during the growing season are essential to ensure that information is available early enough for the timely implementation of agronomic decisions, while industries can wait until later in the season to optimize their production process and increase their production traceability. In this study, we used machine learning algorithms, dynamic and static predictors, and a phenology approach to determine the time for issuing the yield prediction. In addition, the effect of data reduction was evaluated by comparing results obtained with and without principal component analysis (PCA). Gaussian process regression (GPR) was the best for predicting maize yield. Its best performance (nRMSE of 13.31%) was obtained late in the season and with the full set of predictors (vegetation indices, meteorological and soil predictors). In contrast, neural network (NNET) and support vector machines linear basis function (SVMl) achieved their best accuracy with only vegetation indices and at the tasseling phenological stage. Only slight differences in performance were observed between the algorithms considered, highlighting that the main factors influencing performance are the timing of the yield prediction and the predictors with which the machine learning algorithms are fed. Interestingly, PCA was instrumental in increasing the performances of NNET after this stage. An additional benefit of the application of PCA was the overall reduction between 12 and 30.20% in the standard deviation of the maize yield prediction performance from the leave one-year outer-loop cross-validation, depending on the feature set. © 2022 by the authors.","dimensionality reduction; machine learning; multi-source data; phenology; Sentinel-2; yield prediction","Data reduction; Food supply; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Supply chains; Support vector machines; Vegetation; Dimensionality reduction; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Maize yield; Multisource data; Performance; Phenology; Principal-component analysis; Sentinel-2; Yield prediction; Principal component analysis",Article,Scopus

For example, drought-induced increases in plant diseases and rainfall caused a decrease in food production. Machine Learning and Agricultural Big Data are high-performance computing technologies that allow analyzing a large amount of data to understand agricultural production. Machine Learning and Agricultural Big Data are high-performance computing technologies that allow the processing and analysis of large amounts of heterogeneous data for which intelligent IT and high-resolution remote sensing techniques are required. However, the selection of ML algorithms depends on the types of data to be used. Therefore, agricultural scientists need to understand the data and the sources from which they are derived. These data can be structured, such as temperature and humidity data, which are usually numerical (e.g., float); semi-structured, such as those from spreadsheets and information repositories, since these data types are not previously defined and are stored in No-SQL databases; and unstructured, such as those from files such as PDF, TIFF, and satellite images, since they have not been processed and therefore are not stored in any database but in repositories (e.g., Hadoop).

It analyzes 43 papers selected through the protocol proposed by Kitchenham and Charters and validated with the PRISMA criteria. It was found that the primary data sources are Databases, Sensors, Cameras, GPS, and Remote Sensing, which capture data stored in Platforms such as Hadoop, Cloud Computing, and Google Earth Engine.

The mechanisms of action are complex and interwoven, making it difficult to identify relevant management and adaptation options. The present study uses random forests to investigate such highly non-linear systems for predicting yield anomalies in winter wheat at district levels in Germany. In order to take into account sub-seasonality, monthly features are used that explicitly take soil moisture into account in addition to extreme meteorological events. Clustering is used to show spatially different damage potentials, such as a higher susceptibility to drought damage from May to July in eastern Germany compared to the rest of the country. In addition, relevant heat effects are not detected if the clusters are not sufficiently defined. The variable with the highest importance is soil moisture in March, where higher soil moisture has a detrimental effect on crop yields. In general, soil moisture explains more yield variations than the meteorological variables. The approach has proven to be suitable for explaining historical extreme yield anomalies for years with exceptionally high losses (2003, 2018) and gains (2014) and the spatial distribution of these anomalies. The highest test R-squared (R2) is about 0.68. Furthermore, the sensitivity of yield variations to soil moisture and extreme meteorological conditions, as shown by the visualization of average marginal effects, contributes to the promotion of targeted decision support systems. © 2021 Michael Peichl et al.",,"Crops; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Linear systems; Machine learning; Sensitivity analysis; Agricultural productions; Clusterings; Machine learning methods; Mechanism of action; Non linear system; Non-linear damages; Seasonality; Spectra's; Winter wheat; Winter wheat yields; Soil moisture; assessment method; crop yield; machine learning; soil moisture; soil water; wheat; Germany",Article,Scopus

Parameter estimation is challenging, especially for time-dependent parameters such as cultivar parameters with 2–3 years of lifespan. Manual calibration of the parameters is time-consuming, requires expertise, and is prone to error. This research develops a new automated framework to estimate time-dependent parameters for crop models using a parallel Bayesian optimization algorithm. This approach integrates the power of optimization and machine learning with prior agronomic knowledge. To test the proposed time-dependent parameter estimation method, we simulated historical yield increase (from 1985 to 2018) in 25 environments in the US Corn Belt with APSIM. Then we compared yield simulation results and nine parameter estimates from our proposed parallel Bayesian framework, with Bayesian optimization and manual calibration. Results indicated that parameters calibrated using the proposed framework achieved an 11.6% reduction in the prediction error over Bayesian optimization and a 52.1% reduction over manual calibration. We also trained nine machine learning models for yield prediction and found that none of them was able to outperform the proposed method in terms of root mean square error and R2. The most significant contribution of the new automated framework for time-dependent parameter estimation is its capability to find close-to-optimal parameters for the crop model. The proposed approach also produced explainable insight into cultivar traits’ trends over 34 years (1985–2018). © 2021, The Author(s).",,"algorithm; article; calibration; crop; cultivar; machine learning; nonhuman; prediction; simulation",Article,Scopus

At first, data types, phenotype traits, current ML models, and evaluation technique will be identified through a literature survey. This study found that the phenotype and genotype data are widely used in oil palm breeding programs.

While a number of studies have reported using different remote sensing approaches and crop traits to quantify crop growth, stress, and yield variation, studies are limited using the combination of these techniques including machine learning to improve estimation of genotypic biomass and yield, especially in constrained sodic soil environments. At close to flowering, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and ground-based proximal sensing was used to obtain remote and/or proximal sensing data, while biomass yield and crop heights were also manually measured in the field. Grain yield was machine-harvested at maturity. UAV remote and/or proximal sensing-derived spectral vegetation indices (VIs), such as normalized difference vegetation index, optimized soil adjusted vegetation index, and enhanced vegetation index and crop height were closely corresponded to wheat genotypic biomass and grain yields. UAV multispectral VIs more closely associated with biomass and grain yields compared to proximal sensing data. The red-green-blue (RGB) 3D point cloud technique was effective in determining crop height, which was slightly better correlated with genotypic biomass and grain yield than ground-measured crop height data. These remote sensing-derived crop traits (VIs and crop height) and wheat biomass and grain yields were further simulated using machine learning algorithms (multitarget linear regression, support vector machine regression, Gaussian process regression, and artificial neural network) with different kernels to improve estimation of biomass and grain yield. The artificial neural network predicted biomass yield (R2 = 0.89; RMSE = 34.8 g/m2 for the MS and R2 = 0.82; RMSE = 26.4 g/m2 for the HS site) and grain yield (R2 = 0.88; RMSE = 11.8 g/m2 for the MS and R2 = 0.74; RMSE = 16.1 g/m2 for the HS site) with slightly less error than the others. Wheat genotypes Mitch, Corack, Mace, Trojan, Lancer, and Bremer were identified as more tolerant to sodic soil constraints than Emu Rock, Janz, Flanker, and Gladius. The study improves our ability to select appropriate traits and techniques in accurate estimation of wheat genotypic biomass and grain yields on sodic soils. This will also assist farmers in identifying cultivars tolerant to sodic soil constraints. © 2021 by the authorsLicensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Biomass and grain yields; Crop height; Machine learning; Phenotyping; Sodic soil; Vegetation indices","Antennas; Biomass; Crops; Cultivation; Grain (agricultural product); Green computing; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Predictive analytics; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Yield stress; Accurate estimation; Enhanced vegetation index; Gaussian process regression; Machine learning techniques; Normalized difference vegetation index; Remote sensing approaches; Spectral vegetation indices; Support vector machine regressions; Soils",Article,Scopus

Yield is a complex trait and reliant on various related variables called yield components. In this study, the five most important yield component traits in soybean were measured using a panel of 250 genotypes grown in four environments. These traits were the number of nodes per plant (NP), number of non-reproductive nodes per plant (NRNP), number of reproductive nodes per plant (RNP), number of pods per plant (PP), and the ratio of number of pods to number of nodes per plant (P/N). These data were used for predicting the total soybean seed yield using the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Random Forest (RF), machine learning (ML) algorithms, individually and collectively through an ensemble method based on bagging strategy (E-B). The RBF algorithm with highest Coefficient of Determination (R2) value of 0.81 and the lowest Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of 148.61 kg.ha-1, and 185.31 kg.ha-1, respectively, was the most accurate algorithm and, therefore, selected as the meta- Classifier for the E-B algorithm. Using the E-B algorithm, we were able to increase the prediction accuracy by improving the values of R2, MAE, and RMSE by 0.1, 0.24 kg.ha-1, and 0.96 kg.ha-1, respectively. Furthermore, for the first time in this study, we allied the E-B with the genetic algorithm (GA) to model the optimum values of yield components in an ideotype genotype in which the yield is maximized. The results revealed a better understanding of the relationships between soybean yield and its components, which can be used for selecting parental lines and designing promising crosses for developing cultivars with improved genetic yield potential. © 2021 Yoosefzadeh-Najafabadi et al.

The objective was to explore the relationships between soybean yield and its components, generate equations to estimate yield and evaluate its prediction accuracy. The training dataset was composed of soybean yield and its components’ data from 2010 to 2019. Linear regression models based on NG, TGW and yield were fitted on the training dataset and applied to a validation dataset composed of 58 on-field collected samples. It was found that globally TGW and NG presented weak (r = 0.50) and strong (r = 0.92) linear relationships with yield, respectively.

The combination of their high temporal frequency with their extended geographical coverage generally associated with low costs per area unit makes these images a convenient choice at both national and regional scales. Several qualitative and quantitative approaches can be clearly distinguished, going from the use of low resolution satellite imagery as the main predictor of final crop yield to complex crop growth models where remote sensing-derived indicators play different roles, depending on the nature of the model and on the availability of data measured on the ground. Vegetation performance anomaly detection with low resolution images continues to be a fundamental component of early warning and drought monitoring systems at the regional scale. For applications at more detailed scales, the limitations created by the mixed nature of low resolution pixels are being progressively reduced by the higher resolution offered by new sensors, while the continuity of existing systems remains crucial for ensuring the availability of long time series as needed by the majority of the yield prediction methods used today. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Agriculture; Low resolution; Remote sensing; Yield forecasts","Fundamental component; Geographical coverage; High temporal frequency; Low resolution; Low resolution images; Operational systems; Performance anomaly; Qualitative and quantitative approaches; Agriculture; Crops; Forecasting; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery",Review,Scopus

Although the use of regression models is common in forest measurement, there is a constant search for estimation procedures that provide greater accuracy. Recently, machine learning techniques have been used with satisfactory performance in measuring forests. However, methods such as Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Random Forest are relatively poorly studied for predicting the volume of wood in eucalyptus plantations in Brazil. Therefore, it is essential to check whether these techniques can provide gains in terms of accuracy. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the use of Random Forest and ANFIS techniques in the prognosis of forest production. The data used come from continuous forest inventories carried out in stands of eucalyptus clones. The data were divided into 70% for training and 30% for validation. The algorithms used to generate rules in ANFIS were Subtractive Clustering and Fuzzy-C-Means. Besides, training was done with the hybrid algorithm (descending gradient and least squares) with the number of seasons ranging from 1 to 20. Several RFs were trained, varying the number of trees from 50 to 850 and the number of observations by five leaves to 35. Artificial neural networks and decision trees were also trained to compare the feasibility of the techniques. The evaluation of the estimates generated by the techniques for training and validation was calculated based on the following statistics: correlation coefficient (r), relative Bias (RB), and the relative root mean square error (RRMSE) in percentage. In general, the techniques studied in this work showed excellent performance for the training and validation data set with RRMSE values <6%, RB < 0.5%, and r > 0.98. The RF presented inferior statistics about the ANFIS for the prognosis of forest production. The Subtractive Clustering (SC) and Fuzzy-C-Means (FCM) algorithms provide accurate baseline and volume projection estimates; both techniques are good alternatives for selecting variables used in modeling forest production. © 2021 China Agricultural University","Artificial Intelligence; Artificial Neural Networks; Ensemble Learning; Forest inventory; Forest Measurement; Regression","Clustering algorithms; Error statistics; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mean square error; Regression analysis; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference; Ensemble learning; Forest inventory; Forest measurement; Forest production; Machine learning techniques; Neuro-fuzzy inference systems; Performance; Random forests; Regression; Decision trees",Article,Scopus

Such early season predictions are of practical relevance for instance for yield forecasts or the modeling of agricultural water balances, therefore being important for the public as well as the private sector. Furthermore, we improve the mechanism of combining different data sources for the prediction task, allowing for both optical and radar data as inputs (multi-modal data fusion) without the need for temporal interpolation.

The results of traditional detection methods are accurate, but the sampling cost is high and has a hysteresis, which makes it difficult to measure cotton fiber quality parameters in real time and at a large scale. The purpose of this study is to use time-series UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) multispectral and RGB remote sensing images combined with machine learning to model four main quality indicators of cotton fibers. A deep learning algorithm is used to identify and extract cotton boll pixels in remote sensing images and improve the accuracy of quantitative extraction of spectral features. In order to simplify the input parameters of the model, the stepwise sensitivity analysis method is used to eliminate redundant variables and obtain the optimal input feature set. The results of this study show that the R2 of the prediction model established by a neural network is improved by 29.67% compared with the model established by linear regression. When the spectral index is calculated after removing the soil pixels used for prediction, R2 is improved by 4.01% compared with the ordinary method. The prediction model can well predict the average length, uniformity index, and micronaire value of the upper half. R2 is 0.8250, 0.8014, and 0.7722, respectively.

The exploration of key growth phases and features is beneficial to improving the efficiency and accuracy of yield prediction. In this study, a hybrid approach using the WOFOST model and deep learning was developed to forecast corn yield, which analysed yield prediction potential at different growth phases and features. The World Food Studies (WOFOST) model was used to build a comprehensive simulated dataset by inputting meteorological, soil, crop and management data. Different feature combinations at various growth phases were designed to forecast yield using machine learning and deep learning methods. The results show that the key features of corn’s vegetative growth stage and reproductive growth stage were growth state features and water-related features, respectively. With the continuous advancement of the crop growth stage, the ability to predict yield continued to improve. Especially after entering the reproductive growth stage, corn kernels begin to form, and the yield prediction performance is significantly improved.

Thus, seasonal forecasts of precipitation and temperature are an essential tool for stakeholders to make timely choices regarding the strategies required to maximize their expected cereal yield outcomes. The availability of state-of-the-art seasonal forecasts such as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) system 5 (SEAS5) may be an asset to help decision making. However, uncertainties and reduced skill may hamper the use of seasonal forecasts in several applications. Hence, in this work, we aim to understand the added value of such dynamical forecasts when compared to persistent anomalies of climate conditions used to predict the production of wheat and barley yields. With that in mind, empirical models relating annual wheat and barley yields in Spain to monthly values of precipitation and temperature are developed by taking advantage of ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis. Then, dynamical and persistence forecasts are issued at different lead times, and the skill of the subsequent forecasted yield is verified through probabilistic metrics. The results presented in this study demonstrate two different outcomes: (1) wheat and barley yield anomaly forecasts (dynamical and persistent) start to gain skill later in the season (typically from April onwards); and (2) the added value of using the SEAS5 forecast as an alternative to persistence ranges from 6 to 16%, with better results in the southern Spanish regions. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"article; cereal; climate; harvest; human; nonhuman; plant yield; precipitation; season; skill; Spain; uncertainty; weather; wheat; food grain; forecasting; temperature; weather; Edible Grain; Forecasting; Seasons; Temperature; Triticum; Weather",Article,Scopus

Thus, it is an important and urgent task for crop breeders to find the freezing-tolerant rapeseed materials in the process of breeding. Existing large-scale freezing-tolerant rapeseed material recognition methods mainly rely on the field investigation conducted by the agricultural experts using some professional equipments. These methods are time-consuming, inefficient and laborious. In addition, the accuracy of these traditional methods depends heavily on the knowledge and experience of the experts. Methods: To solve these problems of existing methods, we propose a low-cost freezing-tolerant rapeseed material recognition approach using deep learning and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images captured by a consumer UAV. We formulate the problem of freezing-tolerant material recognition as a binary classification problem, which can be solved well using deep learning. The proposed method can automatically and efficiently recognize the freezing-tolerant rapeseed materials from a large number of crop candidates. To train the deep learning network, we first manually construct the real dataset using the UAV images of rapeseed materials captured by the DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2.0. Then, five classic deep learning networks (AlexNet, VGGNet16, ResNet18, ResNet50 and GoogLeNet) are selected to perform the freezing-tolerant rapeseed material recognition. Result and conclusion: The accuracy of the five deep learning networks used in our work is all over 92%. Especially, ResNet50 provides the best accuracy (93.33%) in this task. In addition, we also compare deep learning networks with traditional machine learning methods. The comparison results show that the deep learning-based methods significantly outperform the traditional machine learning-based methods in our task. The experimental results show that it is feasible to recognize the freezing-tolerant rapeseed using UAV images and deep learning. © 2022, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Freezing injury recognition; Machine learning; Rapeseed; UAV images",,Article,Scopus

Knowing banana production is due to the need to maximize the investment–profit ratio, and the availability of this information in advance allows decisions to be made about the management of important diseases. The objective of this study was to predict the number of banana bunches from epidemiological parameters of Black Sigatoka (BS), using random forests (RF) for its ability to predict crop production responses to epidemiological variables. Weekly production data (number of banana bunches) and epidemiological parameters of BS from three adjacent banana sites in Panama during 2015–2018 were used. RF was found to be very capable of predicting the number of banana bunches, with variance explained as 70.0% and root mean square error (RMSE) of 1107.93 ± 22 of the mean banana bunches observed in the test case. The site, week, youngest leaf spotted and youngest leaf with symptoms in plants with 10 weeks of physiological age were found to be the best predictor group.

With an expanding base of dynamic customer demands and the adoption of multiple technological advancements, there is a high possibility that human-centric sales management will be transformed into a fully automated form aimed at increasing productivity and being able to cater to effectively a broader customer base. A review of the relevant literature demonstrates that machine learning is one of the most prevalent techniques in analytics for predicting sales behaviour. However, SESaaS includes many features beyond the sales component. Internet-of-Things (IoT) can additionally be used for networking and data analytics to enrich sales data. Therefore, the proposed scheme introduces a novel SESaaS model capable of balancing the sales team’s needs with those of the customers to maximise profits. The proposed model also presents a novel learning scheme in the IoT environment that aids in projecting the service quality score to the final customer, thereby positively influencing the customer to pay a service fee for a superior and desired quality of experience. Unlike any existing sales management scheme, the proposed scheme offers a novel research methodology for improving sales enablement practices, emphasising service scalability, and forecasting company profit. In contrast to any existing system for sales management, the proposed scheme provides greater accuracy, higher service quality, and faster response time in its predictive strategy for projecting the cost of the adoption of SESaaS, which is not reported in any existing studies. In an extensive testing environment, it is determined that the proposed scheme achieves accuracy and service quality of approximately 98.75% and 92.91%, respectively.

This article covers how to evaluate the performance of the designed antenna by using a combination of simulation, measurement, creation of the RLC equivalent circuit model, and the implementation of machine learning approaches. The MPA’s measured frequency range is 7.9–14.6 GHz, while its simulated frequency range is 8.35–14.25 GHz in CST microwave studio (CST MWS) 2018. The measured and simulated bandwidths are 6.7 GHz and 5.9 GHz, respectively. The antenna substrate is composed of FR-4 Epoxy, which has a dielectric constant of 4.4 and a loss tangent of 0.02. The equivalent model of the proposed MPA is developed by using an advanced design system (ADS) to compare the resonance frequencies obtained by using CST. In addition, the measured return loss of the prototype is compared with the simulated return loss observed by using CST and ADS. At the end, 86 data samples are gathered through the simulation by using CST MWS, and seven machine learning (ML) approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN), linear regression (LR), random forest regression (RFR), decision tree regression (DTR), lasso regression, ridge regression, and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) regression, are applied to estimate the resonant frequency of the patch antenna. The performance of the seven ML models is evaluated based on mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and variance score. Among the seven ML models, the prediction result of DTR (MSE = 0.71%, MAE = 5.63%, RMSE = 8.42%, and var score = 99.68%) is superior to other ML models.

Prediction and early warning of temperature changes is an important measure to ensure the healthy growth of sheep. Aiming at the randomness and empirical problem of parameter selection of the traditional single Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, this paper proposes an optimization method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Then, using the proposed PCA-PSO-XGBoost to predict the temperature in the sheep house. First, PCA is used to screen the key influencing factors of the sheep house temperature. The dimension of the input vector of the model is reduced; PSO-XGBoost is used to build a temperature prediction model, and the PSO optimization algorithm selects the main hyperparameters of XGBoost. We carried out a global search and determined the optimal hyperparameters of the XGBoost model through iterative calculation. Using the data of the Xinjiang Manas intensive sheep breeding base to conduct a simulation experiment, the results show that it is different from the existing ones. Compared with the temperature prediction model, the evaluation indicators of the PCA-PSO-XGBoost model proposed in this paper are root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), which are 0.0433, 0.0019, 0.9995, 0.0065, respectively. RMSE, MSE, and MAE are improved by 68, 90, and 94% compared with the traditional XGBoost model.

The objective of this study was to develop a fusion-based framework for improving land crop mapping accuracy. First, the features were retrieved using the Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2, and Landsat-8 imagery. Then, training data and various feature selection algorithms including recursive feature elimination (RFE), random forest (RF), and Boruta were used for optimal feature selection. Various classifiers, including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and RF, were implemented to create maps of land crops relying on optimal features and training data. After that, in order to increase the result accuracy, maps of land crops derived from several scenarios were fused using a fusion-based voting strategy at the level of decision, and new maps of land crops and classification uncertainty maps were prepared. Subsequently, the performance of different scenarios was evaluated and compared. Among the feature selection algorithms, RF accuracy was higher than RFE and Boruta. Moreover, the efficiency of RF was higher than SVM and ANN. The overall accuracy of the voting scenario was higher than all other scenarios.

Sybil Attack is one of the most challenging attacks in VANETS, which forge false identities in the network to undermine communication between network nodes. This attack highly impacts transportation safety services and may create traffic congestion. In this regard, a novel collaborative framework based on majority voting is proposed to detect the Sybil attack in the network. The framework works by ensembling individual classifiers, i.e., K-Nearest Neighbor, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM, and Logistic Regression in a parallel manner. The Majority Voting (Hard and Soft) mechanism is adopted for a final prediction. A comparison is made between Majority Voting Hard and soft to choose the best approach.

Among the different plant parts, the economic part, the yield, has the highest importance and becomes the ultimate goal for the farming community. It depends on many genetic and environmental factors, so this curiosity about knowing the yield brought several precise pre-harvest prediction methods using different ways. Out of those techniques, non-invasive yield prediction techniques using computer vision have been proved to be the most efficient and trusted platform. This study developed a novel methodology, called SlypNet, using advanced deep learning networks, i.e., Mask R-CNN and U-Net, which can extract various plant morphological features like spike and spikelet from the visual image of the wheat plant and provide a high-throughput yield estimate with great precision. Mask R-CNN outperformed previous networks in spike detection by its precise detection performance with a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.57%, a F1 score of 0.67, and an MCC of 0.91 by overcoming several natural field constraints like overlapping and background interference, variable resolution, and high bushiness of plants. The spikelet detection module’s accuracy and consistency were tested with about 99% validation accuracy of the model and the least error, i.e., a mean square error of 1.3 from a set of typical and complex views of wheat spikes. Spikelet yield cumulatively showed the probable production capability of each plant. Our method presents an integrated deep learning platform of spikelet-based yield prediction comprising spike and spikelet detection, leading to higher precision over the existing methods.

However, ET is difficult to directly measure, so an ideal solution was to develop a simulation model to obtain ET. There are many ways to calculate ET, most of which use models based on the Penman–Monteith equation, but they are often inaccurate when applied to greenhouse crop evapotranspiration. The use of machine learning models to predict ET has gradually increased, but research into their application for greenhouse crops is relatively rare. We used experimental data for three years (2019–2021) to model the effects on ET of eight meteorological factors (net solar radiation (Rn), mean temperature (Ta), minimum temperature (Tamin), maximum temperature (Tamax), relative humidity (RH), minimum relative humidity (RHmin), maximum relative humidity (RHmax), and wind speed (V)) using a greenhouse drip irrigated tomato crop ET prediction model (XGBR-ET) that was based on XGBoost regression (XGBR). The model was compared with seven other common regression models (linear regression (LR), support vector regression (SVR), K neighbors regression (KNR), random forest regression (RFR), AdaBoost regression (ABR), bagging regression (BR), and gradient boosting regression (GBR)). The results showed that Rn, Ta, and Tamax were positively correlated with ET, and that Tamin, RH, RHmin, RHmax, and V were negatively correlated with ET. Rn had the greatest correlation with ET (r = 0.89), and V had the least correlation with ET (r = 0.43). The eight models were ordered, in terms of prediction accuracy, XGBR-ET &gt; GBR-ET &gt; SVR-ET &gt; ABR-ET &gt; BR-ET &gt; LR-ET &gt; KNR-ET &gt; RFR-ET. The statistical indicators mean square error (0.032), root mean square error (0.163), mean absolute error (0.132), mean absolute percentage error (4.47%), and coefficient of determination (0.981) of XGBR-ET showed that XGBR-ET modeled daily ET for greenhouse tomatoes well. The parameters of the XGBR-ET model were ablated to show that the order of importance of meteorological factors on XGBR-ET was Rn &gt; RH &gt; RHmin&gt; Tamax&gt; RHmax&gt; Tamin&gt; Ta&gt; V. Selecting Rn, RH, RHmin, Tamax, and Tamin as model input variables using XGBR ensured the prediction accuracy of the model (mean square error 0.047). This study has value as a reference for the simplification of the calculation of evapotranspiration for drip irrigated greenhouse tomato crops using a novel application of machine learning as a basis for an effective irrigation program. © 2022 by the authors.","drip irrigated tomato; evapotranspiration; machine learning; solar greenhouse; XGBoost regression",,Article,Scopus

The aim of this study is to develop and assess a coffee yield forecasting method at the regional scale in Dak Lak province in the central highlands of Vietnam using the Crop Growth Monitoring System Statistical Tool (CGMSstatTool— CST) software and vegetation biophysical variables (NDVI, LAI, and FAPAR) derived from satellite remote sensing (SPOT-VEGETATION and PROBA-V). There has been no research to date applying this approach to this specific crop, which is the main contribution of this study. The findings of this research reveal that the elaboration of multiple linear regression models based on a combination of information from satellite-derived vegetation biophysical variables (LAI, NDVI, and FAPAR) corresponding to the first six months of the years 2000–2019 resulted in coffee yield forecast models presenting satisfactory accuracy (Adj.R2 = 64 to 69%, RMSEp = 0.155 to 0.158 ton/ha and MAPE = 3.9 to 4.7%). These results demonstrate that the CST may efficiently predict coffee yields on a regional scale by using only satellite-derived vegetation biophysical variables.

However, accurate small green fruit detection, affected by many factors such as the unstructured orchard environment, the morphological diversity of target fruits, and multiple-scale fruits, is still an unsolved challenge, especially for small-scale fruits in the night environment. In this paper, we propose an optimized Retinanet-PVTv2 by introducing the gradient harmonizing mechanism to detect small green apple/begonia fruits in the night environment, namely GHFormer-Net. Specifically, PVTv2-B1 based on Transformer is applied as the backbone network to extract feature information from the global receptive, which breaks the limitation that spatial convolution is utilized to extract information from the local area; Next, with the help of FPN, shallow features and high-level features with rich semantic information are incorporated by lateral connections and a top-down structure to generate multi-scale feature maps; Then, a detector of RetinaNet is applied to detect green fruits. To adapt to small apple/begonia fruits detection in the night environment, a gradient harmonizing classification loss (GHM-R Loss) and a gradient harmonizing regression loss (GHM-R Loss) are introduced to improve RetinaNet-PVTv2. The experimental results show that our method achieves 85.2%/61.0% AP and 67.5%/45.2% APS on the benchmark of the NightFruit and Gala datasets respectively, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method for small green apple/begonia fruits detection. © 2022 The Author(s)","Fruit detection; Gradient harmonizing mechanism; Nighttime; RetinaNet-PVTv2; Small green apple/begonia",,Article,Scopus

With the vigorous emergence of remote sensing land surface observations in recent decades, data assimilation methodology has become an effective means to promote the accuracy and efficiency of yield estimation by integrating regional data and point-scale crop models. This paper focuses on the black soil area of Northeast China, a national strategic grain production base, applying the AquaCrop crop growth model to simulate the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and maize yield from 2000 to 2020 and then forming a reliable FVC optimization dataset based on an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) assimilation algorithm with remote sensing products. Using the random forest model, the regression relationship between FVC and yield was established from the long-term time series data, which is crucial to achieve better yield estimation through the optimized FVC. The major findings include the following: (1) The R2 of the assimilated FVC and maize yield can reach 0.557. (2) When compared with the local statistical yield, our method reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) from 1.164 ton/ha (based on GLASS FVC products) to 1.004 ton/ha (based on the calibrated AquaCrop model) and then to 0.888 ton/ha (the result after assimilation). The above results show that we have proposed a yield estimation method to provide accurate yield estimations by combining data assimilation and machine learning. This study provided deep insights into understanding the variations in FVC and revealed the spatially explicit yield prediction ability from the time series land surface parameters, which has significant potential for optimizing water and soil resource management.

Information was extracted from five central irrigation pivots in the same region and with the same sowing date in the 2015/2016 crop year, in which each pivot was cultivated with a different cultivar, in which the cultivars used were: CV1—P98y12 RR, CV2—Desafio RR, CV3—M6410 IPRO, CV4—M7110 IPRO, and CV5—NA5909 RR. A cloud-free orbital image of the site was acquired from the Google Earth Engine platform. In addition to the spectral bands alone, a total of 13 vegetation indices were calculated. The models tested were: artificial neural networks (ANN), radial basis function network (RBF), decision tree algorithms J48 (DT) and reduced error pruning tree (REP), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). The five soybean cultivars were classified by the six-machine learning (ML) models in stratified randomized cross-validation with k-fold = 10 and 10 repetitions (100 runs for each model). After obtaining the r and MAE statistics, analysis of variance was performed considering a 6 × 3 factorial scheme (models versus inputs) with 10 repetitions (folds).

Assessing the impact of climate warming on suitable planting regions, especially the potential northern planting boundaries of these crops, is therefore critical to help guide agricultural policymaking and further maintain food security. In this study, we analyzed the effect of climate warming on the potential northern planting boundaries of three specific crops (winter wheat, spring maize, double and triple rice cropping systems) during two time periods (1961–1990 and 1991–2020) using meteorological data from 2437 national weather stations. Results show that the potential planting boundaries of these crops present a northward movement and a westward expansion during the time period of 1991–2020 under the background of temperature increase compared with the time period of 1961–1990. Moreover, the boundaries of winter wheat and spring maize also show a trend of expansion to high-altitude areas (e.g., the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau). The average moving distance of these crops ranged from 20 km to 300 km. In general, the potential planting boundaries of winter wheat, spring maize, double and triple rice cropping systems changed significantly due to climate warming, and the suitable planting area was increased.

With the recent advances in deep learning, many supervised learning approaches have been implemented to perform phenotypic trait measurement from images for various crops, but few studies have been conducted to count cotton bolls from field images. Supervised learning models require a vast number of annotated images for training, which has become a bottleneck for machine learning model development. The goal of this study is to develop both fully supervised and weakly supervised deep learning models to segment and count cotton bolls from proximal imagery. A total of 290 RGB images of cotton plants from both potted (indoor and outdoor) and in-field settings were taken by consumer-grade cameras and the raw images were divided into 4350 image tiles for further model training and testing. Two supervised models (Mask R-CNN and S-Count) and two weakly supervised approaches (WS-Count and CountSeg) were compared in terms of boll count accuracy and annotation costs. The results revealed that the weakly supervised counting approaches performed well with RMSE values of 1.826 and 1.284 for WS-Count and CountSeg, respectively, whereas the fully supervised models achieve RMSE values of 1.181 and 1.175 for S-Count and Mask R-CNN, respectively, when the number of bolls in an image patch is less than 10. In terms of data annotation costs, the weakly supervised approaches were at least 10 times more cost efficient than the supervised approach for boll counting. In the future, the deep learning models developed in this study can be extended to other plant organs, such as main stalks, nodes, and primary and secondary branches. Both the supervised and weakly supervised deep learning models for boll counting with low-cost RGB images can be used by cotton breeders, physiologists, and growers alike to improve crop breeding and yield estimation. © 2022 by the authors.

In the absence of sufficient field observations and environmental parameters required in a suitable spatial coverage, remote sensing data can be effective in predicting the habitats of Anopheles mosquitoes. In this article, high-risk depressions that have the potential for Anopheles larval habitats had been identified by fusing a Digital Surface Model (DSM) extracted from very high spatial resolution aerial stereo images with land-use and soil type maps. land-useFinally, the high-risk map of malaria based on the prone larval habitats of Anopheles was created. To evaluate the results, 22 important depressions were identified using field observations in the 1.5 km buffer around Qaleh-Ganj city, Kerman Province, Iran. Of these 22 samples, 14 of them were stable for more than one month at temperatures above 30 °C and the rest were able to store water for three to four weeks. 12 out of 14 samples were consistent with the identified 130 high-risk depressions in the buffer range. Also, 19 of these 22 samples were compatible with the optimal depressions in the buffer range. By comparing the proposed method with previous methods based on data with medium and low spatial resolution or meteorological data, it was concluded that the correct and accurate seasonal and temporary position of Anopheles larval habitats depend on higher spatial resolution of remote sensing data. In addition, this study demonstrated that the use of vegetation and water indices cannot predict the exact location of all habitats of Anopheles. Because many of these habitats were temporary and these indices could not estimate and predict their exact location.

Here we compare two deep learning-based strategies for early warning detection of crop stress, using multitemporal imagery throughout the growing season to predict field-scale yield in irrigated rice in eastern Arkansas. Both deep learning strategies showed improvements upon traditional statistical learning approaches including linear regression and gradient boosted decision trees. First, we explicitly accounted for variation across developmental stages using a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that captures both spatial and temporal dimensions of UAV images from multiple time points throughout one growing season. 3D-CNNs achieved low prediction error on the test set, with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 8.8% of the mean yield. For the second strategy, a 2D-CNN, we considered only spatial relationships among pixels for image features acquired during a single flyover. 2D-CNNs trained on images from a single day were most accurate when images were taken during booting stage or later, with RMSE ranging from 7.4 to 8.2% of the mean yield. A primary benefit of convolutional autoencoder-like models (based on analyses of prediction maps and feature importance) is the spatial denoising effect that corrects yield predictions for individual pixels based on the values of vegetation index and thermal features for nearby pixels. Our results highlight the promise of convolutional autoencoders for UAV-based yield prediction in rice.

The symbol agreement rates (SAR) of simulations produced by MLR, PLS, and SVM models are 55%, 57%, and 66%, respectively. The SVM model shows obviously better performance than PLS and MLR models in simulating meteorological elements-related interannual variation of vegetation coverage in North China.

The agricultural sector is one of the most affected by these changes, having to optimise scarce water resources. An important phenomenon within the water cycle is the evaporation from water reservoirs, which implies a considerable amount of water lost during warmer periods of the year. Indeed, evaporation rate forecasting can help farmers grow crops more sustainably by managing water resources more efficiently in the context of precision agriculture. In this work, we expose an interpretable machine learning approach, based on a multivariate decision tree, to forecast the evaporation rate on a daily basis using data from an Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, which is deployed on a real irrigated plot located in Murcia (southeastern Spain). The climate data collected feed the models that provide a forecast of evaporation and a summary of the parameters involved in this process. Finally, the results of the interpretable presented model are validated with the best literature models for evaporation rate prediction, i.e., Artificial Neural Networks, obtaining results very similar to those obtained for them, reaching up to 0.85R2 and 0.6MAE. Therefore, in this work, a double objective is faced: to maintain the performance obtained by the models most frequently used in the problem while maintaining the interpretability of the knowledge captured in it, which allows better understanding the problem and carrying out appropriate actions. © 2022 by the authors.

We demonstrate these effects using simulation modelling at two contrasting sites supporting Eucalyptus globulus Labill. or Pinus radiata D.Don plantations. The APSIM Eucalyptus and Pinus models simulated plantation growth within 2% of observed growth where the water table was at 4 m depth for eucalypts (height 28 m, MAI 32 m3 ha−1 year−1) and at 23 m for pines (height 37 m, MAI 20 m3 ha−1 year−1). In simulations without an aquifer, observed growth could only be matched using unrealistically high surface soil nitrogen (N) supply, suggesting this is an unlikely mechanism. Simulated aquifer N concentrations, evapotranspiration, and net N mineralization and leaching (emergent properties of modelling) were similar to measured values. These results strengthen the plausibility that aquifer N uptake by plantations could be contributing to tree growth. This hypothesis warrants further research that quantifies these processes at multiple sites. Simulations included growth of herbaceous and tree weed species, and pasture, which demonstrated the utility of the process-based APSIM modelling framework for dynamically simulating carbon, water and N of plantations and other mixed-species systems. © 2022 by the authors.

The earlier the prediction during the growing season the better. Accurate soybean yield prediction is important for germplasm innovation and planting environment factor improvement. But until now, soybean yield has been determined by weight measurement manually after soybean plant harvest which is time-consuming, has high cost and low precision. This paper proposed a soybean yield in-field prediction method based on bean pods and leaves image recognition using a deep learning algorithm combined with a generalized regression neural network (GRNN). A faster region-convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN), feature pyramid network (FPN), single shot multibox detector (SSD), and You Only Look Once (YOLOv3) were employed for bean pods recognition in which recognition precision and speed were 86.2, 89.8, 80.1, 87.4%, and 13 frames per second (FPS), 7 FPS, 24 FPS, and 39 FPS, respectively. Therefore, YOLOv3 was selected considering both recognition precision and speed. For enhancing detection performance, YOLOv3 was improved by changing IoU loss function, using the anchor frame clustering algorithm, and utilizing the partial neural network structure with which recognition precision increased to 90.3%. In order to improve soybean yield prediction precision, leaves were identified and counted, moreover, pods were further classified as single, double, treble, four, and five seeds types by improved YOLOv3 because each type seed weight varies. In addition, soybean seed number prediction models of each soybean planter were built using PLSR, BP, and GRNN with the input of different type pod numbers and leaf numbers with which prediction results were 96.24, 96.97, and 97.5%, respectively. Finally, the soybean yield of each planter was obtained by accumulating the weight of all soybean pod types and the average accuracy was up to 97.43%. The results show that it is feasible to predict the soybean yield of plants in situ with high precision by fusing the number of leaves and different type soybean pods recognized by a deep neural network combined with GRNN which can speed up germplasm innovation and planting environmental factor optimization.

Researchers have focused their efforts on understanding social interaction and opinion prediction via the use of images, such as photographs, films, and animated GIFs (graphics interchange formats). The results of various individual studies have resulted in important advancements being achieved in the disciplines of text sentiment analysis and image sentiment analysis.

In the proposed work, fault diameter in rotary part of machine is detected and classified using the machine learning methods. In the first stage, we have employed empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for high-frequency noise removal. Residue signal is obtained by removing first IMF from base signal considering first IMF as a high-frequency noisy signal, followed by wavelet decomposition. Entropy of the wavelet coefficient obtained from 3rd level decomposition of residue signal is calculated which acts as an input parameter to the machine learning techniques to determine the diameter for fault.

Therefore, developing corn production and accurately estimating corn biomass yield are of great significance to improving people's lives, developing rural economy and climate issues. In this paper, a 3-layer BP neural network model is constructed by using the LM algorithm as the training algorithm of the corn biomass BP network model. From the three aspects of elevation, slope, and aspect, combined with the BP neural network model of corn biomass, the spatial distribution of corn biomass in the study area is analyzed. The results showed that the average biomass per unit area of maize increased with the increase in altitude below 1000 m. There are relatively more human activities in low altitude areas, which are more active in forestry production. The best planting altitude of corn is 0 ∼ 1000 m. When the altitude is higher than 1000 m, the corn biomass gradually decreases. In terms of slope, if the slope is lower than 15°, the biomass of maize increases with the increase in slope. If the slope is lower than 15°, the biomass of maize decreases gradually with the increase in slope.

It has global data coverage and high temporal resolution, which constitute the most attractive features for medium-resolution 3D reconstruction and change detection in remote sensing applications. One shortfall of the PlanetScope images is that they are often captured at very small off-nadir angles to minimize relief differences for 2D time-series image analysis, which is not intended for classic stereo 3D reconstruction due tothe very small base-to-height ratios of stereo pairs. However, considering the abundant PlanetScope images, the multi-view stereo 3D reconstruction approach leveraging a large number of images may drive the possibility of achieving more accurate 3D reconstruction, and consequently, 3D change detection on a global scale. In this paper, a multi-view stereo 3D reconstruction pipeline was adopted to comprehensively evaluate the 3D potential of PlanetScope images by performing accuracy analysis for both 3D reconstruction and change detection in semi-randomly selected regions with ground truth data. Three case studies using the PlanetScope images were performed: (1) a case study on multi-view stereo 3D reconstruction, (2) a case study on 3D change detection of buildings and trees, and (3) a case study on volumetric estimation for natural disaster monitoring. Our experiments showed that the PlanetScope images provided sufficient coverage for multi-view stereo 3D reconstruction given an area of interest. It could achieve a reasonably acceptable accuracy with root-mean-square errors of 4–6 m in our test regions and detect significant 3D changes.

Aiming at the real-time identification of rice weeds by UAV low-altitude remote sensing, two improved identification models, MobileNetV2-UNet and FFB-BiSeNetV2, were proposed based on the semantic segmentation models U-Net and BiSeNetV2, respectively. The MobileNetV2-UNet model focuses on reducing the amount of calculation of the original model parameters, and the FFB-BiSeNetV2 model focuses on improving the segmentation accuracy of the original model. In this study, we first tested and compared the segmentation accuracy and operating efficiency of the models before and after the improvement on the computer platform, and then transplanted the improved models to the embedded hardware platform Jetson AGX Xavier, and used TensorRT to optimize the model structure to improve the inference speed. Finally, the real-time segmentation effect of the two improved models on rice weeds was further verified through the collected low-altitude remote sensing video data. The results show that on the computer platform, the MobileNetV2-UNet model reduced the amount of network parameters, model size, and floating point calculations by 89.12%, 86.16%, and 92.6%, and the inference speed also increased by 2.77 times, when compared with the U-Net model. The FFB-BiSeNetV2 model improved the segmentation accuracy compared with the BiSeNetV2 model and achieved the highest pixel accuracy and mean Intersection over Union ratio of 93.09% and 80.28%.

Therefore, the Dubai Emirate began relying on new technology to increase productivity and efficiency. Agriculture applications also depend on accurate land monitoring for timely food security control and support actions. However, traditional monitoring requires field surveys to be performed by experts, which is costly, slow, and rare. Agriculture monitoring systems must be furnished with sustainable land use monitoring solutions, starting with remote sensing using drone surveys for affordable, efficient, and time-sensitive agriculture mapping. Hence, the Dubai Municipality is currently using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to map the farming areas all over the Emirate, support locating lands conducive to cultivation, and create an accurate agriculture database contributing to the decision-making process in determining areas suitable for crop growth. This study used a novel object detection method coupled with geospatial analysis as an integrated workflow to detect individual crops. The UAV flights were executed using a Trimble UX5 (HP) over twelve communities across the Dubai Emirate for six months. Detection methods were applied to high-resolution drone images, consisting of RGB and near-infrared (NIR) bands. Advanced geoprocessing tools were also used to analyze, evaluate, and enhance the results.

However, combining the two types of materials can potentially create a more efficient method of finding predictive QTLs. In this simulation study, we focused on scenarios involving causal marker expression suppressed by trans-regulatory mechanisms, where the otherwise easily lost associated signals benefit the most from combining the two types of data.

Rapid recognition and timely treatment of diseases can minimize tomato production loss. Nowadays, a large number of researchers (including different institutes, laboratories, and universities) have developed and examined various traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms for plant disease classification. However, through pass survey analysis, we found that there are no studies comparing the classification performance of ML and DL for the tomato disease classification problem. The performance and outcomes of different traditional ML and DL (a subset of ML) methods may vary depending on the datasets used and the tasks to be solved. This study generally aimed to identify the most suitable ML/DL models for the PlantVillage tomato dataset and the tomato disease classification problem. For machine learning algorithm implementation, we used different methods to extract disease features manually. In our study, we extracted a total of 52 texture features using local binary pattern (LBP) and gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) methods and 105 color features using color moment and color histogram methods.

By comparing the different methods, we found that the metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) of the tested deep learning networks (AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet34, EfficientNet-b0, and MobileNetV2) were all better than those of the measured machine learning algorithms (support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and random forest (RF)).

Model development was accomplished through a two-step process: firstly, the capacity of Sentinel-2 vegetation indices (VIs) to follow plant ecophysiological parameters was established through measurements in a pilot field and secondly, the results of the first step were extended/evaluated in 31 fields, during two growing periods, to increase the applicability range and robustness of the models. Modelling results were examined against yield data collected by a combine harvester equipped with a yield-monitoring system. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) were examined as plant signals and combined with Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and/or Normalized Multiband Drought Index (NMDI) during the growth period or before sowing, as water and soil signals, respectively. The best performing model involved the EVI integral for the 20 April–31 May period as a plant signal and NMDI on 29 April and before sowing as water and soil signals, respectively (R2 = 0.629, RMSE = 538). However, model versions with a single date and maximum seasonal VIs values as a plant signal, performed almost equally well. Since the maximum seasonal VIs values occurred during the last ten days of April, these model versions are suitable for yield prediction. © 2021 by the authors.

However, research on SIF retrieval using hyperspectral data is performed in narrow spectral windows, assuming that SIF remains constant. In this paper, based on the singular vector decomposition (SVD) technique, we present an approach for retrieving SIF, which can be applied to remotely sensed data with ultra-high spectral resolution and in a broad spectral window without assuming that the SIF remains constant. The idea is to combine the first singular vector, the pivotal information of the non-fluorescence spectrum, with the low-frequency contribution of the atmosphere, plus a linear combination of the remaining singular vectors to express the non-fluorescence spectrum. Subject to instrument settings, the retrieval was performed within a spectral window of approximately 7 nm that contained only Fraunhofer lines. In our retrieval, hyperspectral data of the O2-A band from the first Chinese carbon dioxide observation satellite (TanSat) was used. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was introduced to self-adaptively determine the number of free parameters and reduce retrieval noise. SIF retrievals were compared with TanSat SIF and OCO-2 SIF. The results showed good consistency and rationality. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to verify the performance of this approach. To summarize, the approach would provide more possibilities for retrieving SIF from hyperspectral data. © 2021 by the authors.

Typhoon Lekima is among the top five most devastating typhoons in China and caused economic losses totaling over USD 8 billion in Zhejiang Province alone during 9–12 August 2019. However, there still is no assessment of its impacts on forests. Here we detected forest damage and its spatial distribution caused by Typhoon Lekima by classifying Landsat 8 OLI images using the random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm and the univariate image differencing (UID) method on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The accuracy assessment indicated a high overall accuracy (&gt;87%) and kappa coefficient (&gt;0.75) for forest-damage detection, as evaluated against field-investigated plot data, with better performance using the RF method. The total affected forest area by Lekima was 4598.87 km2, accounting for 8.44% of the total forest area in Zhejiang Province. The light-, moderate-and severe-damage forest areas were 2106.29 km2, 2024.26 km2 and 469.76 km2, respectively. Considering the damage severity, the net forest canopy loss fraction was 2.57%. The affected forest area and damage severity exhibited large spatial variations, which were affected by elevation, slope, precipitation and forest type. Our study indicated a larger uncertainty for affected forest area and a smaller uncertainty for the proportion of damage severity, based on multiple assessment approaches. This is among the first studies on forest damage due to typhoons at a regional scale in China, and the methods can be extended to examine the impacts of other super-strong typhoons on forests. Our study results on damage severity, spatial distribution and controlling factors could help local governments, the forest sector and forest landowners make decision on tree-planting planning and sustainable management after typhoon strikes and could also raise public and governmental awareness of typhoons’ damage on China’s inland forests. © 2021 by the authors.

To accomplish this goal, numerous areas are required for Napier grass plantations. Before introducing crops, the land potential of the country and the impact of crops on the environment should be assessed. The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model is very useful in investigating crop impacts and land potential. Unfortunately, the crop growth parameters of Napier grass are yet to be identified and, thus, conducting effective analysis has not been possible. Accordingly, in this study, parameter calibration and SWAT model validation of Napier grass production in Thailand was carried out using datasets from eight sites with 93 samples. Parameter sensitivity analysis was performed prior to parameter calibration, the results of which suggest that the radiation use efficiency and potential harvested index are both highly sensitive. The crop growth parameters were calibrated in order of their sensitivity index ranking, and the final values were obtained by reducing the root mean square error from 10.77 to 1.38 t·ha−1 . The validation provides satisfactory results with coefficient of determination of 0.951 and a mean error of 0.321 t·ha−1 . Using the developed model and calibrated parameters, local Napier grass dry matter yield can be evaluated accurately. The results reveal that, if only abandoned area in Thailand is used, then Napier grass can provide roughly 33,600–44,900 GWh of annual electricity, and power plant carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions can be reduced by approximately 21.2–28.3 Mt-CO2 . The spatial distribution of estimated yield obtained in this work can be further utilized for land suitability analysis to help identify locations for Napier grass plantations, anaerobic digesters, and biogas power plants. © 2021 by the authors.

The excess green minus excess red index, combined with the minimum error threshold segmentation method, was used to segment green plants and bare land. A modified U-net was used to segment crops from images. After removing the bare land and crops from the field, images of weeds were obtained. The weed density was evaluated by the ratio of weed area to total area on the segmented image. The accuracy of the green plant segmentation was 93.5%.

Huanglongbing disease is a major bottleneck in the export of citrus fruits from Pakistan. It is being responsible for huge citrus economic losses globally. In the current study, several prediction models were developed based on regression algorithms of machine learning to monitor different phenological stages of Asian citrus psyllid to predict its population about different abiotic variables (average maximum temperature, average minimum temperature, average weekly temperature, average weekly relative humidity, and average weekly rainfall) and biotic variable (host plant phenological patterns) in citrus-growing regions of Pakistan. The pest prediction models can be used for proper applications of pesticides only when needed for reducing the environmental and cost impacts of pesticides. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to find the relationship between different predictor (abiotic and biotic) variables and pest infestation rate on citrus plants.

The proposed framework addresses the gaps in policymaking, the role of all stakeholders, and uses historical data of crop production in different sectors of land in optimizing the profits that shall meet the defined constraints including national requirement, and export demand of different crops. There are many agro-economy-based countries where agriculture is the main contributor to their GDP, while there are others who always struggle to meet their national need while optimizing the agro-economy component of their earnings. Crops are not always produced with keeping the demand and production balance. Rather, the crops are mostly produced according to the farmer's ease and last year's prices for profit maximization leading to excessive production of one type of crop, lowering of profit margins, and shortage of some key crops for national need. This paper presents a decision aiding tool that can be used for farmer's awareness for crop production planning that meets the national and export needs while maximizing farmer's earnings. The model is tested on historical data of different segments of cultivated lands in Pakistan for validation, with the first experiment performed on single farmland with multi-fields while the second performed for multi-locations and multi-fields.

Since plants integrate their genetics, surrounding environments, and management conditions, crop phenotypes have been measured over cropping seasons to represent the traits of varieties. These days, UAS (unmanned aircraft system) provides a new opportunity to collect high-quality images and generate reliable phenotypic data efficiently. Here, we propose high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) from multitemporal UAS images for tomato yield estimation. UAS-based RGB and multispectral images were collected weekly and biweekly, respectively. The shape of the features of tomatoes such as canopy cover, canopy, volume, and vegetation indices derived from UAS imagery was estimated throughout the entire season. To extract time-series features from UAS-based phenotypic data, crop growth and growth rate curves were fitted using mathematical curves and first derivative equations. Time-series features such as the maximum growth rate, day at a specific event, and duration were extracted from the fitted curves of different phenotypes. The linear regression model produced high R2 values even with different variable selection methods: all variables (0.79), forward selection (0.7), and backward selection (0.77). With factor analysis, we figured out two significant factors, growth speed and timing, related to high-yield varieties. Then, five time-series phenotypes were selected for yield prediction models explaining 65 percent of the variance in the actual harvest. The phenotypic features derived from RGB images played more important roles in prediction yield. This research also demonstrates that it is possible to select lower-performing tomato varieties successfully.

Given the recent commercialization of low-cost multispectral cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles and advances in machine learning techniques, prediction systems for crop characteristics can be more precisely developed using machine learning techniques. Therefore, the model performances for predicting wheat grain yield and protein content between the machine learning algorithms based on spectral reflectance and plant height (e.g. random forest and artificial neural network) and the traditional linear regression based on vegetation indices were compared. Although the machine learning approaches based on reflectance could not improve the grain yield prediction accuracy, they have great potential for development in predicting protein content. The linear regression model based on a 2-band enhanced vegetation index was capable of predicting the yield with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 972 kg ha−1. The random forest model based on reflectance was capable of predicting the protein content with an RMSE of 1.07%. The reflectance may have been linearly correlated with total biomass; thus, it was also linearly correlated with grain yield. There was a nonlinear relationship between the grain yield and protein content, which may have resulted in the higher model performance of the machine learning approaches in predicting protein content. However, this relationship would be variable according to the environment and agronomic practice. Further, field-scale research is required to assess how this relationship can be varied and affect the model generality, particularly when predicting protein content. © 2020 The Author(s).

Prevailing weather conditions during the crop growth period determine the yield of sorghum. Hence, the crop yield forecasting models based on weather parameters will be an appropriate option for policymakers and researchers to develop sustainable cropping strategies. In the present study, six multivariate weather‐based models viz., least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), elastic net (ENET), principal component analysis (PCA) in combination with stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), artificial neural network (ANN) alone and in combination with PCA and ridge regression model are examined by fixing 90% of the data for calibration and remaining dataset for validation to forecast rabi sorghum yield for different districts of Karnataka. The R2 and root mean square error (RMSE) during calibration ranged between 0.42 to 0.98 and 30.48 to 304.17 kg ha−1, respectively, without actual evapotranspiration (AET) whereas, these evaluation parameters varied from 0.38 to 0.99 and 19.84 to 308.79 kg ha−1, respectively with AET inclusion. During validation, the RMSE and nRMSE (normalized root mean square error) varied between 88.99 to 1265.03 kg ha−1 and 4.49 to 96.84%, respectively without AET and including AET as one of the weather variable RMSE and nRMSE were 63.48 to 1172.01 kg ha−1 and 4.16 to 92.56%, respectively. The performance of six multivariate models revealed that LASSO was the best model followed by ENET compared to PCA_SMLR, ANN, PCA_ANN and ridge regression models because of reduced overfitting through penalisation of regression coefficient. Thus, it can be concluded that LASSO and ENET weather‐based models can be effectively utilized for the district level forecast of sorghum yield. © 2020 by the authors.

For period 2009 to 2018, the prediction tea yield by the RF model was the best with a R2 = 0.73, by SVM it was 0.66, and 0.57 with the TLRM. Three evaluation indicators were used to consider accuracy: the coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and percentage error of tea yield (PETY). The highest accuracy for the three models was in 2015 with a R2 ≥ 0.87, RMSE &lt; 50 kg/ha, and PETY less 3% error. In the other years, the prediction accuracy was higher in the SVM and RF models. Meanwhile, the RF algorithm was better than PETY (≤10%) and the root mean square error for this algorithm was significantly less (≤80 kg/ha). RMSE and PETY showed relatively good values in the TLRM model with a RMSE from 80 to 100 kg/ha and a PETY from 8 to 15%. © 2020 by the authors.","NDVI; Random forest (RF); Remote sensing; Support vector machine (SVM); Tea monitoring; Yield forecasting","Crops; Decision trees; Errors; Forecasting; Logistic regression; Mean square error; Meteorology; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Coefficient of determination; Evaluation indicators; Linear regression models; Linear relationships; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Normalized difference vegetation index; Root mean square errors; Temporal and spatial changes; Tea",Article,Scopus

To estimate potato (Solanum tubersum L.) yield over Mexico at a municipal level, we used meteorological data provided by the ERA5 (ECMWF Re-Analysis) dataset developed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service, satellite imagery from the TERRA platform, and field information. Five different machine learning algorithms were used to build the models: Random forest (rf), support vector machine linear (svmL), support vector machine polynomial (svmP), support vector machine radial (svmR), and general linear model (glm). The optimized models were tested using independent data (2017 and 2018) not used in the training and optimization phase (2004-2016). In terms of percent root mean squared error (%RMSE), the best results were obtained by the rf algorithm in the winter cycle using variables from the first three months of the cycle (R2 = 0.757 and %RMSE = 18.9). For the summer cycle, the best performing model was the svmP which used the first five months of the cycle as variables (R2 = 0.858 and %RMSE = 14.9). Our results indicated that adding predictor variables of the last two months before the harvest did not significantly improved model performances. These results demonstrate that our models can predict potato yield by analyzing the yield of the previous year, the general conditions of NDVI, meteorology, and information related to the irrigation system at a municipal level. © 2020 by the authors.","Machine learning; Meteorological data; Municipal level; Potato yield; Satellite imagery",,Article,Scopus

It helps to effectively use the agricultural resources and management tools and monitors different parameters to attain better quality yield and production. WSN makes use of Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), a wireless technology to transmit data over long distances with minimal power consumption. LoRaWAN is one of the most successful LPWAN technologies despite its low data rate and because of its low deployment and management costs. Greenhouses are susceptible to different types of interference and diversification, demanding an improved WSN design scheme. In this paper, we contemplate the viable challenges for PA in greenhouses and propose the successive steps essential for effectual WSN deployment and facilitation. We performed a real-time, end-to-end deployment of a LoRaWAN-based sensor network in a greenhouse of the ’Proefcentrum Hoogstraten’ research center in Belgium. We have designed a dashboard for better visualization and analysis of the data, analyzed the power consumption for the LoRaWAN communication, and tried three different enclosure types (commercial, simple box and airflow box, respectively). We validated the implications of real-word challenges on the end-to-end deployment and air circulation for the correct sensor readings. We found that temperature and humidity have a larger impact on the sensor readings inside the greenhouse than we initially thought, which we successfully solved through the airflow box design. © 2020 by the authors.

In the U.S., yearly crop data layers (CDLs) are available starting in the early 2000s and have been developed using combined field information and sets of temporal imagery from multiple sensors. Development of long-term crop-type layers similar to CDLs is restricted by reduced accessibility to imagery and the necessary auxiliary datasets. In this study, a procedure to generate a historical crop type was developed and evaluated. Time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets from Landsat 5 TM sensor for the Lower Bear Creek watershed were collected and processed. Object-based pseudo phenology curves, represented by the NDVI time series, were generated using noise filtering and dimensionality standardization procedures for the years 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005. Classifiers were developed and evaluated using random-forest machine learning algorithms and CDL datasets as the reference. Increased generalization performance was obtained when the model was developed using multi-year datasets. This can be attributed to improved crop type representation during the training phase coupled with characterization of yearly variations due to natural (weather) and anthropogenic factors (farming management). Source of uncertainties were the presence of multiple crops within objects, phenological similarities between soybean and corn/maize, and the accuracy of CDL itself. The proposed procedure supports the development of historic crop types for long-term studies at the field scale in agricultural watersheds. © 2020 by the authors.","Agricultural watershed; Crop-type classification; Cropland data layer; Random forest","Classification (of information); Crops; Decision trees; Random forests; Remote sensing; Time series; Watersheds; Agricultural watersheds; Anthropogenic factors; Crop type classification; Data layer; Generalization performance; Machine learning approaches; Normalized difference vegetation index; Temporal and spatial; Machine learning",Article,Scopus

It is a process in which we estimate the coordinates of the unknown nodes using sensors with known coordinates called anchor nodes. Several bio-inspired algorithms have been proposed for accurate estimation of the unknown nodes. However, use of bio-inspired algorithms is a highly time-consuming process. Hence, finding optimal network parameters for node localisation during the network set-up process with the desired accuracy in a short time is still a challenging task. In this article, we have proposed an efficient way to evaluate the optimal network parameters that result in low Average Localisation Error (ALE) using a machine learning approach based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) model.

For this, a generalized method of whole-farm management approach, based on the potent cross-industry cooperation of stakeholders, infrastructures, technologies and applications will be applied. Indeed, beyond the actual involvement of advanced technologies, the substantial challenge of agriculture towards sustainable growth resides in the competency to enact more sophisticated and effective agricultural processes at lower costs, provide safer and more efficient operating conditions both for the environment and stakeholders (involving farmers, agronomist engineers, policy makers, etc.), and finally increase the synergies among them, offering the ability to make decisions even on issues that have ordinarily been outside their areas of expertise. In this context, traditional farm management approaches should undergo fundamental transformations, enabling smart technologies not just for the sake of innovation but to re-engineer the entire value chain so as to preserve sustainability in the agricultural sector. Current advancements in communication technologies, such as Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things, tend to combine with other sophisticated technologies like Computational Intelligence, Robotics, Big Data, etc., leading to the fourth stage of revolution in the agricultural sector, known as Agriculture 4.0.

Remote sensing, as a non-destructive measurement technology, has been proved to be useful for estimating vegetation growth parameters, especially at large scale. With the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), this novel remote sensing platform has been widely used to provide remote sensing images which have much higher spatial resolution. Previous reports have shown that the spectral feature of remote sensing images could be an effective indicator to estimate vegetation growth parameters. However, the texture feature of high-resolution remote sensing images is rarely employed for this purpose. Besides, the physical mechanism between the texture feature and vegetation growth parameters is still unclear. Results: In this study, a Fourier spectrum texture based on the UAV Image was developed to estimate rice LAI. And the relationship between Fourier spectrum texture and rice LAI was also analyzed. The results showed that Fourier spectrum texture could improve the accuracy of rice LAI estimation. Conclusions: In conclusion, the texture feature of high-resolution remote sensing images may be more effective in rice LAI estimation than the spectral feature. © 2019 The Author(s).","Fourier spectrum texture; Remote sensing; Rice LAI; UAV; Vegetation index",,Article,Scopus

Consequently, VIs originally developed for traditional airborne and spaceborne sensors have become applicable to UAV systems. In this study, we investigated the difference in tillage treatments for cotton and sorghum using various RGB and NIR VIs. Minimized tillage has been known to increase farm sustainability and potentially optimize productivity over time; however, repeated tillage is the most commonly-adopted management practice in agriculture. To this day, quantitative comparisons of plant growth patterns between conventional tillage (CT) and no tillage (NT) fields are often inconsistent. In this study, high-resolution and multi-temporal UAV data were used for the analysis of tillage effects on plant health and the performance of various vegetation indices investigated. Time series data over ten dates were acquired on a weekly basis by RGB and multispectral (MS) UAV platforms: a DJI Phantom 4 Pro and a DJI Matrice 100 with the SlantRange 3p sensor. Ground reflectance panels and an ambient illumination sensor were used for the radiometric calibration of RGB and MS orthomosaic images, respectively. Various RGB and NIR-based vegetation indices were then calculated for the comparison between CT and NT treatments. In addition, a one-tailed Z-test was conducted to check the significance of VIs' difference between CT and NT treatments. The results showed distinct differences in VIs between tillage treatments during the whole growing season. NIR-based VIs showed better discrimination performance than RGB-based VIs. Out of 13 VIs, the modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) and optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) showed better performance in terms of quantitative difference measurements and the Z-test between tillage treatments. The modified green red vegetation index (MGRVI) and excess green (ExG) showed reliable separability and can be an alternative for economic RGB UAV application. © 2019 by the authors.","Tillage effect; Time series analysis; UAV; Vegetation indices comparison","Antennas; Computerized tomography; Cultivation; Infrared devices; Time series analysis; Vegetation; Ambient illumination; Conventional tillage; Difference measurements; Management practices; Quantitative comparison; Radiometric calibrations; Tillage effects; Vegetation index; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)",Article,Scopus

The paper presents a theoretical approach for investigating frequency vegetation indices (VIs) in different areas of the experimental plot for early detection of agronomic spatial variability. Four flights were carried out with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to calculate high-resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) images. Ground agronomic data (biomass, leaf area index (LAI), spikes, plant height, and yield) have been linked to the vegetation indices (VIs) at different growth stages. Regression coefficients of all samplings data were highly significant for both the cultivars and VIs at anthesis and tillering stage. At harvest, the whole plot (W) data were analyzed and compared with two sub-areas characterized by high agronomic performance (H) yield 20% higher than the whole plot, and low performances (L), about 20% lower of yield related to the whole plot). The whole plot and two sub-areas were analyzed backward in time comparing the VIs frequency curves. At anthesis, more than 75% of the surface of H sub-areas showed a VIs value higher than the L sub-plot. The differences were evident also at the tillering and seedling stages, when the 75% (third percentile) of VIs H data was over the 50% (second percentile) of the W curve and over the 25% (first percentile) of L sub-plot. The use of high-resolution images for analyzing the frequency value of VIs in different areas can be a useful approach for the detection of agronomic constraints for precision agriculture purposes. © 2019 by the authors.","Cultivars; Precision agriculture; Relative frequencies; UAV; Vegetation indices; Yield",,Article,Scopus

Understanding the spatial and temporal variabilities of water security can play a pivotal role in sustainable management of fresh water resources. In this study, a long-term water security analysis of the Grand River watershed (GRW), Ontario, Canada, was carried out using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). Analyses on blue and green water availability and water security were carried out by dividing the GRW into eight drainage zones. As such, both anthropogenic as well as environmental demand were considered. In particular, while calculating blue water scarcity, three different methods were used in determining the environmental flow requirement, namely, the presumptive standards method, the modified low stream-flow method, and the variable monthly flow method. Model results showed that the SWAT model could simulate streamflow dynamics of the GRW with 'good' to 'very good' accuracy with an average Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.75, R2 value of 0.78, and percentage of bias (PBIAS) of 8.23%. Sen's slope calculated using data from over 60 years confirmed that the blue water flow, green water flow, and storage had increasing trends. The presumptive standards method and the modified low stream-flow method, respectively, were found to be the most and least restrictive method in calculating environmental flow requirements. While both green (0.4-1.1) and blue (0.25-2.0) water scarcity values showed marked temporal and spatial variabilities, blue water scarcity was found to be the highest in urban areas on account of higher water usage and less blue water availability. Similarly, green water scarcity was found to be highest in zones with higher temperatures and intensive agricultural practices. We believe that knowledge of the green and blue water security situation would be helpful in sustainable water resources management of the GRW and help to identify hotspots that need immediate attention. © 2019 by the authors.","Blue water; Grand River watershed; Green water; Soil and water assessment tool (SWAT); Water security","agricultural practice; assessment method; soil and water assessment tool; spatiotemporal analysis; streamflow; water availability; water management; water resource; watershed; Canada; Grand River [Ontario]; Ontario [Canada]",Article,Scopus

One step further is then the maximization of the agricultural economic benefits, by properly adjusting the irrigated crop area pattern to optimally use the limited amount of water available. To that avail, a sequential hydro-economic model has been developed and applied to the agriculturally intensively used Zarrine River Basin (ZRB), Iran. In the first step, the surface and groundwater resources, especially, the inflow to the Boukan Dam, as well as the potential crop yields are simulated using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model, driven by GCM/QM-downscaled climate predictions for three future 21th-century periods under three climate RCPs. While in all nine combinations consistently higher temperatures are predicted, the precipitation pattern are much more versatile, leading to corresponding changes in the future water yields. Using the basin-wide water management tool MODSIM, the SWAT-simulated water available is then optimally distributed across the different irrigation plots in the ZRB, while adhering to various environmental/demand priority constraints. MODSIM is subsequently coupled with CSPSO to optimize (maximize) the agro-economic water productivity (AEWP) of the various crops and, subsequently, the net economic benefit (NEB), using crop areas as decision variables, while respecting various crop cultivation constraints. Adhering to political food security recommendations for the country, three variants of cereal cultivation area constraints are investigated. The results indicate considerably-augmented AEWPs, resulting in a future increase of the annual NEB of ~16% to 37.4 Million USD for the 65%-cereal acreage variant, while, at the same time, the irrigation water required is reduced by ~38%. This NEB-rise is achieved by augmenting the total future crop area in the ZRB by about 47%-indicating some deficit irrigation-wherefore most of this extension will be cultivated by the high AEWP-yielding crops wheat and barley, at the expense of a tremendous reduction of alfalfa acreage. Though presently making up only small base acreages, depending on the future period/RCP, tomato- and, less so, potato- and sugar beet-cultivation areas will also be increased significantly. © 2018 by the authors.","Agro-economic water productivity; Climate change; CSPSO-MODSIM; Hydro-economic modeling; Iran; Net economic benefits; Optimal crop pattern; Zarrine River Basin","agricultural economics; agricultural production; alfalfa; climate change; crop yield; cultivation; food security; high temperature; twenty first century; water availability; water resource; water use; water use efficiency; wheat; Iran; Zarrineh River; Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Hordeum; Lycopersicon esculentum; Medicago sativa; Solanum tuberosum; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

The increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles in recent times opens up new possibilities for remotely sensing crop status and yields even on complex smallholder farms. This study demonstrates the applicability of a vegetation index derived from UAV imagery to assess maize (Zea mays L.) crop vigor and yields at various stages of crop growth. The study employs a quadcopter flown at 100 m over farm plots and equipped with two consumer-grade cameras, one of which is modified to capture images in the near infrared. We find that UAV-derived GNDVI is a better indicator of crop vigor and a better estimator of yields—r = 0.372 and r = 0.393 for mean and maximum GNDVI respectively at about five weeks after planting compared to in-field methods like SPAD readings at the same stage (r = 0.259). Our study therefore demonstrates that GNDVI derived from UAV imagery is a reliable and timeous predictor of crop vigor and yields and that this is applicable even in complex smallholder farms in SSA. © 2018 by the authors.

To this aim, proximal and remote spectral vegetation indices are increasingly replacing soil analysis. In this study the spatial variation of soil properties, proximal and remote spectral vegetation indices were compared in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop grown in a 4.15 ha field in northern Italy. Soil analysis (particle size distribution, pH, carbonates, C, total N, available P, exchangeable cations and electrical conductivity) was geo-referentially carried out; the proximal indices chlorophyll content by N-Tester and normalised difference vegetation index through GreenSeeker were determined in three dates during stem elongation; the remote indices PurePixel ™ chlorophyll index and PurePixel™ vegetation index were determined through the Landsat 8 satellite in three dates during the same wheat stage. Dry biomass yield (DBY), grain yield (GY) and yield components were determined at harvest. Soil, proximal and remote data were submitted to principal component analysis (PCA), and the retained PCs were clustered to delineate areas at low, intermediate and high yield potential, based on soil parameters (CLUsp), proximal (CLUpi), and remote vegetation indices (CLUri). DBY and GY were significantly correlated with several soil parameters and vegetation indices. Spatiabl distribution of soil and crop data consistently depicted a low performing area (GY&lt;3 Mg ha-1) and a high performing one (GY&gt;8 Mg ha-1). CLUsp determined a lower GY difference between low and high performing area (+60%), compared to CLUpi and CLUri (almost +100%). In CLUsp and CLUpi the low and high performing area were of similar size (25 and 29% for the two respective areas in CLUsp; 25 and 33% in CLUpi), whereas in CLUri they were quite different (16 and 46%). Lastly, yield potential levels determined by vegetation indices (CLUpi and CLUri) exhibited a better degree of agreement with DBY and GY levels, than soil parameters (CLUsp). In exchange for this, the above referred soil parameters are quite consistent in time, allowing soil data to be used for more years. On concluding, PCA followed by clustering resulted in a robust delineation of field areas at different yield potential. This is the premise for developing research driven strategies of practical use. © L.

Furthermore, yield was predicted for all the possible weather scenarios approximated by 15 historical weather instances contained in the dataset. Using predicted yields and covariance between varieties through different weather scenarios, we performed portfolio optimisation. In this way, for each subregion, we obtained a selection of varieties, that proved superior to others in terms of the amount and stability of yield.

In this study empirical relationships suitable for Taiwan were established for GSR retrieval from geostationary satellite images using the Heliosat method for the period from 2011-2013. The derived GSR data has been used to generate consecutive maps of 10-day averaged pan evaporation (Epan) as the basis to produce regional ET estimation using a strategy that does not require remote sensed land surface temperatures (LST). The retrieved daily GSR and the derived 10-day averaged Epan were validated against pyranometer and class-A pan measurements at selected Central Weather Bureau (CWB) stations spread across various climatic regions in Taiwan. Compared with the CWB observed data the overall relative mean bias deviations (MBD%) and root mean square differences (RMSD%) in daily solar irradiance retrieval were about 5 and 15%, respectively. Seasonally, the largest MBD% and RMSD% of retrieved daily solar irradiance occur in spring (9.5 and 21.3% on average), while the least MBD% (-0.3% on average) and RMSD% (9.7% on average) occur in autumn and winter, respectively. For 10-day averaged Epan estimation, the mean MBD% and RMSD% for stations located in the coastal plain areas were 0.1 and 16.9%, respectively. However, in mountainous areas the mean MBD% and RMSD% increased to 30.2 and 34.5%, respectively. This overestimation was due mainly to the large differences in surrounding micro-environments between the mountainous and plain areas.","Evapotranspiration; Geostationary satellite; Solar radiation; Water resources","evaporation; evapotranspiration; geostationary satellite; irradiance; mountain region; satellite data; solar radiation; spatial variation; temporal variation; Taiwan",Article,Scopus

The aim of the paper is to study whether satellite observation of plant phenology are consistent with ground knowledge of crop cycles as expressed in agro-simulations. We used phenological variables from a MODIS Land Cover Dynamics (MCD12Q2) product and examined whether they reproduced the spatio-temporal variability of crop phenological stages in Southern Mali. Furthermore, a validated cereal crop growth model for this region, SARRA-H (System for Regional Analysis of Agro-Climatic Risks), provided precise agronomic information. Remotely-sensed green-up, maturity, senescence and dormancy MODIS dates were extracted for areas previously identified as crops and were compared with simulated leaf area indices (LAI) temporal profiles generated using the SARRA-H crop model, which considered the main cropping practices. We studied both spatial (eight sites throughout South Mali during 2007) and temporal (two sites from 2002 to 2008) differences between simulated crop cycles and determined how the differences were indicated in satellite-derived phenometrics. The spatial comparison of the phenological indicator observations and simulations showed mainly that (i) the satellite-derived start-of-season (SOS) was detected approximately 30 days before the model-derived SOS; and (ii) the satellite-derived end-of-season (EOS) was typically detected 40 days after the model-derived EOS. Studying the inter-annual difference, we verified that the mean bias was globally consistent for different climatic conditions. Therefore, the land cover dynamics derived from the MODIS time series can reproduce the spatial and temporal variability of different start-of-season and end-of-season crop species. In particular, we recommend simultaneously using start-of-season phenometrics with crop models for yield forecasting to complement commonly used climate data and provide a better estimate of vegetation phenological changes that integrate rainfall variability, land cover diversity, and the main farmer practices.","Crops; Mali; MODIS; Phenology; Practices; SARRA-H model",,Article,Scopus

Improvements in the timeliness and accuracy of yield forecasting by incorporating near real-time remote sensing data and the use of sophisticated statistical methods can improve our capacity to respond effectively to these challenges. The objectives of this study were (i) to investigate the use of derived vegetation indices for the yield forecasting of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) from the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at the ecodistrict scale across Western Canada with the Integrated Canadian Crop Yield Forecaster (ICCYF); and (ii) to compare the ICCYF-model based forecasts and their accuracy across two spatial scales-the ecodistrict and Census Agricultural Region (CAR), namely in CAR with previously reported ICCYF weak performance. Ecodistricts are areas with distinct climate, soil, landscape and ecological aspects, whereas CARs are census-based/statistically-delineated areas. Agroclimate variables combined respectively with MODIS-NDVI and MODIS-EVI indices were used as inputs for the in-season yield forecasting of spring wheat during the 2000-2010 period. Regression models were built based on a procedure of a leave-one-year-out. The results showed that both agroclimate + MODIS-NDVI and agroclimate + MODIS-EVI performed equally well predicting spring wheat yield at the ECD scale. The mean absolute error percentages (MAPE) of the models selected from both the two data sets ranged from 2% to 33% over the study period. The model efficiency index (MEI) varied between ??1.1 and 0.99 and ??1.8 and 0.99, respectively for the agroclimate + MODIS-NDVI and agroclimate + MODIS-EVI data sets. Moreover, significant improvement in forecasting skill (with decreasing MAPE of 40% and 5 times increasing MEI, on average) was obtained at the finer, ecodistrict spatial scale, compared to the coarser CAR scale. Forecast models need to consider the distribution of extreme values of predictor variables to improve the selection of remote sensing indices. Our findings indicate that statistical-based forecastingerror could be significantly reduced by making use of MODIS-EVI and NDVI indices at different times in the crop growing season and within different sub-regions. © 2014 by the authors.","Ecodistrict; ICCYF; MODIS; Spring wheat; Yield forecasting","Agriculture; Climate change; Crops; Cultivation; Forecasting; Image reconstruction; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Surveys; Ecodistrict; ICCYF; MODIS; Spring wheat; Yield forecasting; Radiometers",Article,Scopus

Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer, responsible for one third of the world production. A coffee plot exhibits high and low production in alternated years, a characteristic so called biennial yield. High yield is generally a result of suitable conditions of foliar biomass. Moreover, in high production years one plot tends to lose more leaves than it does in low production years. In both cases some correlation between coffee yield and leaf biomass can be deduced which can be monitored through time series of vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery. In Brazil, a comprehensive, spatially distributed study assessing this relationship has not yet been done. The objective of this study was to assess possible correlations between coffee yield and MODIS derived vegetation indices in the Brazilian largest coffee-exporting province. We assessed EVI and NDVI MODIS products over the period between 2002 and 2009 in the south of Minas Gerais State whose production accounts for about one third of the Brazilian coffee production. Landsat images were used to obtain a reference map of coffee areas and to identify MODIS 250 m pure pixels overlapping homogeneous coffee crops. Only MODIS pixels with 100% coffee were included in the analysis. A wavelet-based filter was used to smooth EVI and NDVI time profiles. Correlations were observedbetween variations on yield of coffee plots and variations on vegetation indices for pixels overlapping the same coffee plots. The vegetation index metrics best correlated to yield were the amplitude and the minimum values over the growing season. The best correlations were obtained between variation on yield and variation on vegetation indices the previous year (R = 0.74 for minEVI metric and R = 0.68 for minNDVI metric). Although correlations were not enough to estimate coffee yield exclusively from vegetation indices, trends properly reflect the biennial bearing effect on coffee yield. © 2012 by the authors.","Coffee yield; Remote sensing; Vegetation indices; Wavelet filtering","Foliar biomass; Growing season; High yield; Landsat images; Leaf biomass; Minas Gerais; Minimum value; Previous year; Pure pixel; Reference map; Remote sensing imagery; Vegetation index; Wavelet filtering; Pixels; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Satellite imagery",Article,Scopus

The study focused mainly on three fundamental aspects, namely descriptive modelling, predictive modelling, and spatial modelling of expected risks and vulnerability to drought. Thus, out of 417 articles across all studies on drought, 226 articles published from 2010 to 2022 were analyzed to provide a global overview of the current state of knowledge on multivariate drought modelling using the inclusion criteria. The main objective is to review the recent available scientific evidence regarding multivariate drought modelling based on the joint use of geospatial technologies and artificial intelligence. The analysis focused on the different methods used, the choice of algorithms and the most relevant variables depending on whether they are descriptive or predictive models. Criteria such as the skill score, the given game complexity used, and the nature of validation data were considered to draw the main conclusions. The results highlight the very heterogeneous nature of studies on multivariate modelling of agricultural drought, and the very original nature of studies on multivariate modelling of agricultural drought in the recent literature. For future studies, in addition to scientific advances in prospects, case studies and comparative studies appear necessary for an in-depth analysis of the reproducibility and operational applicability of the different approaches proposed for spatial and temporal modelling of agricultural drought. HIGHLIGHTS The components and fundamentals of multivariate modelling of agricultural drought were discussed. The importance of hybrid artificial intelligence models is widely discussed in improving the performance of traditional machine learning models. Quantum machine learning algorithms are weakly explored in multivariate drought modelling. Therefore, future studies should explore this approach. The major challenge of multivariate modelling of drought frequency is mainly related to the difference in the return periods of the different variables (time-shifted and spatially effects). © 2022 The Author(s).

Permanent grassland represents around 70% of all agricultural land. In comparison with other agroecosystems, grasslands are more sensitive to climate change. The aim of this study was to create deterministic models based on artificial neural networks to identify highly significant factors influencing the yield and digestibility of grassland sward in the climatic conditions of central Poland. The models were based on data from a grassland experiment conducted between 2014 and 2016. Phytophenological data (harvest date and botanical composition of sward) and meteorological data (average temperatures, total rainfall, and total effective temperatures) were used as independent variables, whereas qualitative and quantitative parameters of the feed made from the grassland sward (dry matter digestibility, dry matter yield, and protein yield) were used as dependent variables. Nine deterministic models were proposed Y_G, DIG_G, P_G, Y_GB, DIG_GB, P_GB, Y_GC, DIG_GC, and P_GC, which differed in the input variable and the main factor from the grassland experiment. The analysis of the sensitivity of the neural networks in the models enabled the identification of the independent variables with the greatest influence on the yield of dry matter and protein as well as the digestibility of the dry matter of the first regrowth of grassland sward, taking its diverse botanical composition into account. The results showed that the following factors were the most significant (rank 1): the average daily air temperature, total rainfall, and the percentage of legume plants.

The recent availability of long time series of remote sensing data offers opportunities for crop monitoring. In this paper, four machine learning models, namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were adopted to estimate the seasonal corn biomass based on field observation data and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data from 2012 to 2019 in the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin, China. Nine variables were selected with the forward feature selection approach from among twenty-seven variables potentially influencing corn biomass: soil-adjusted total vegetation index (SATVI), green ratio vegetation index (GRVI), Nadir_B7 (2105–2155 nm), Nadir_B6 (1628–1652 nm), land surface water index (LSWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Nadir_B4 (545–565 nm), and Nadir_B3 (459–479 nm). The results indicated that the corn biomass was suitably estimated (the coefficient of determination (R2) was between 0.72 and 0.78) with the four machine learning models. The XGBoost model performed better than the other three models (R2 = 0.78, root mean squared error (RMSE) = 2.86 t/ha and mean absolute error (MAE) = 1.86 t/ha). Moreover, the RF model was an effective method (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 2.91 t/ha and MAE = 1.91 t/ha), with a performance comparable to that of the XGBoost model. This study provides a reference for estimating crop biomass from MOD43A4 datasets. In addition, the research demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques to achieve a relatively accurate estimation of daily corn biomass at a large scale. © 2021 by the authors.

Nevertheless, the implementation of large datasets generated by high-throughput phenotyping tools such as hyperspectral reflectance in cultivar development programs is still challenging due to the essential need for intensive knowledge in computational and statistical analyses. In this study, the robustness of three common machine learning (ML) algorithms, multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF), were evaluated for predicting soybean (Glycine max) seed yield using hyperspectral reflectance. For this aim, the hyperspectral reflectance data for the whole spectra ranged from 395 to 1005 nm, which were collected at the R4 and R5 growth stages on 250 soybean genotypes grown in four environments. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) approach was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the hyperspectral reflectance data and select variables with the largest importance values. The results indicated that R5 is more informative stage for measuring hyperspectral reflectance to predict seed yields. The 395 nm reflectance band was also identified as the high ranked band in predicting the soybean seed yield. By considering either full or selected variables as the input variables, the ML algorithms were evaluated individually and combined-version using the ensemble–stacking (E–S) method to predict the soybean yield. The RF algorithm had the highest performance with a value of 84% yield classification accuracy among all the individual tested algorithms. Therefore, by selecting RF as the metaClassifier for E–S method, the prediction accuracy increased to 0.93, using all variables, and 0.87, using selected variables showing the success of using E–S as one of the ensemble techniques. This study demonstrated that soybean breeders could implement E–S algorithm using either the full or selected spectra reflectance to select the high-yielding soybean genotypes, among a large number of genotypes, at early growth stages. © Copyright © 2021 Yoosefzadeh-Najafabadi, Earl, Tulpan, Sulik and Eskandari.","artificial intelligence; data-driven model; ensemble methods; high-throughput phenotyping; random forest; recursive feature elimination",,Article,Scopus

Precisely predicting rice yields are of vital importance to ensure the food security in countries like China, where rice accounts for one-fifth of the total agricultural production. Previous studies found that the rice yields had been significantly impacted by climate change. In addition, phenological variables were found to be important factors concerning rice yields due to its fundamental role in carbon allocation between plant organs, but its impacts on rice yields were seldom evaluated. In this study, eleven combinations of phenology, climate and geography data were tested to predict the site-based rice yields using a traditional regression-based method (MLR, multiple linear regression), and more advanced three machine learning (ML) methods: backpropagation neural network (BP), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). The results showed that ML methods were more precise than MLR method. The combination using the integrated phenology, climate during growing season and geographical information was better for yields predictions than other combinations across the ML methods, e.g. the difference RMSE (R2) between prediction and observed rice yields were 800 (0.24), 737 (0.33), and 744 (0.31) kg/ha for BP, SVM and RF, respectively. The SVM had achieved the highest precisions in yield predictions and the phenological variables substantially improved the accuracy of yield predictions, and the relative importance of phenological variables were even similar as climatic variables. We highlight the phenology and climate need to be accurately represented in the crop models to improve the accuracy in rice yield prediction under climate change conditions using integrated ML methods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Early mature rice; Machine learning (ML) methods; Multiple linear regression (MLR); Phenology; Rice yield prediction","Agricultural robots; Backpropagation; Biology; Climate models; Crops; Decision trees; Food supply; Forecasting; Learning systems; Linear regression; Population statistics; Predictive analytics; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Agricultural productions; Back-propagation neural networks; Climatic variables; Geographical information; Global population; Machine learning methods; Multiple linear regressions; Rice (Oryza sativa L.); Climate change; biomass allocation; climate change; crop yield; food security; growing season; growth; machine learning; phenology; rice; China; Oryza sativa",Article,Scopus

In this study, we simulate US maize yield using process-based models, traditional regression model and a machine-learning algorithm, and importantly, identify the weakness and strength of each method in simulating the average, variability and extremes of maize yield across the country. We show that both regression and machine learning models can well reproduce the observed pattern of yield averages, while large bias is found for process-based crop models even fed with harmonized parameters. As for the probability distribution of yields, machine learning shows the best skill, followed by regression model and process-based models. For the country as a whole, machine learning can explain 93% of observed yield variability, followed by regression model (51%) and process-based models (42%). Based on the improved capability of the machine learning algorithm, we estimate that US maize yield is projected to decrease by 13.5% under the 2 C global warming scenario (by ∼2050 s). Yields less than or equal to the 10th percentile in the yield distribution for the baseline period are predicted to occur in 19% and 25% of years in 1.5 C (by ∼2040 s) and 2 C global warming scenarios, with potentially significant implications for food supply, prices and trade.

They are vital for identifying a person’s behaviour and mental condition. Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is extracting a speaker’s emotional state from their speech signal. SER is a growing discipline in human–computer interaction, and it has recently attracted more significant interest. This is because there are not so many universal emotions; therefore, any intelligent system with enough computational capacity can educate itself to recognise them. However, the issue is that human speech is immensely diverse, making it difficult to create a single, standardised recipe for detecting hidden emotions. This work attempted to solve this research difficulty by combining a multilingual emotional dataset with building a more generalised and effective model for recognising human emotions. A two-step process was used to develop the model. The first stage involved the extraction of features, and the second stage involved the classification of the features that were extracted. ZCR, RMSE, and the renowned MFC coefficients were retrieved as features. Two proposed models, 1D CNN combined with LSTM and attention and a proprietary 2D CNN architecture, were used for classification. The outcomes demonstrated that the suggested 1D CNN with LSTM and attention performed better than the 2D CNN. For the EMO-DB, SAVEE, ANAD, and BAVED datasets, the model’s accuracy was 96.72%, 97.13%, 96.72%, and 88.39%, respectively. The model beat several earlier efforts on the same datasets, demonstrating the generality and efficacy of recognising multiple emotions from various languages. © 2023 by the author.","1D and 2D Convolution Neural Networks (CNN); ANAD; BAVED datasets; EMO-DB; ensembling techniques; human–computer Interaction; LSTM; SAVEE; speech emotion recognition (SER)","Convolution; Emotion Recognition; Human computer interaction; Long short-term memory; Speech recognition; 1d and 2d convolution neural network; 2-D convolution; ANAD; BAVED dataset; Convolution neural network; EMO-DB; Ensembling technique; LSTM; SAVEE; Speech emotion recognition; Intelligent systems; attention; computer; emotion; human; speech; Attention; Computers; Emotions; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Speech",Article,Scopus

With the power of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), the world has become a global village, where every digital object that prevails in the world is connected to each other with the Internet of Things (IoT). The fast proliferation of IoT-based technology has revolutionized practically every sector, including agriculture, shifting the industry from statistical to quantitative techniques. Such profound transformations are reshaping traditional agricultural practices and generating new possibilities in the face of various challenges. With the opportunities created, farmers are now able to monitor the condition of crops in real time. With the automated IoT solutions, farmers can automate tasks in the farmland, as these solutions are capable of making precise decisions based on underlying challenges and executing actions to overcome such difficulties, alerting farmers in real-time, eventually leading to increased productivity and higher harvest. In this context, we present a cloud-enabled low-cost sensorized IoT platform for real-time monitoring and automating tasks dealing with a tomato plantation in an indoor environment, highlighting the necessity of smart agriculture.

Aiming at the damage identification of the SCR, the acceleration time series signals at multiple locations are taken as the damage characteristics. The damage characteristics include spatial information of the measurement point location and time information of the acquisition signal. Therefore, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed to obtain spatial information. Considering the variable period characteristics of the acceleration time series of the SCR, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network is utilized to study these characteristics. However, neither a single CNN nor GRU model can simultaneously obtain temporal and spatial data information. Therefore, by combining a CNN with a GRU, the CNN-GRU model is established. Moreover, the hyperparameters of deep learning models have a significant influence on their performance. Therefore, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied to solve the hyperparameter optimization problem of the CNN-GRU. Thus, the PSO-CNN-GRU (PCG) model is established. Subsequently, an SCR damage identification method based on the PCG model is presented to predict the damage location and degree by SCR acceleration time series. By analyzing the SCR acceleration data, the prediction performances of the PCG model and the PSO optimization capacity are verified. The experimental results indicate that the identification result of the proposed PCG model is better than that of several existing models (CNN, GRU, and CNN-GRU). © 2023 by the authors.","convolutional neural network; damage identification; gated recurrent unit; hyperparameters; particle swarm optimization; steel catenary riser",,Article,Scopus

However, strategies to estimate its yield are questionable given the characteristics of this crop; in this context, robust techniques, such as those based on machine learning, may be an alternative. Thus, the aim of the present study was to estimate the yield of a coffee crop using multispectral images and machine learning algorithms. Yield data from a same study area in 2017, 2018 and 2019, Sentinel 2 images, Random Forest (RF) algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN) and Linear Regression (LR) were used. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the absolute Pearson correlation and coefficient of determination values. The Sentinel 2 satellite images proved to be favorable in estimating coffee yield. Despite the low spatial resolution in estimating agricultural variables below the canopy, the presence of specific bands such as the red edge, mid infrared and the derived vegetation indices, act as a countermeasure. The results show that the blue band and green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) exhibit greater correlation with yield. The NN algorithm performed best and was capable of estimating yield with 23% RMSE, 20% MAPE and R² 0.82 using 85% of the training and 15% of the validation data of the algorithm.

We aim to design a series of forecasting models and find the factors that affect the incidence of TB, thereby improving the accuracy of the incidence prediction. Results: In this paper, we developed a new interpretable prediction system based on the multivariate multi-step Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method. Four accuracy measures are introduced into the system: Root Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Absolute Percentage Error, and symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error. The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and seasonal ARIMA model are established. The multi-step ARIMA–LSTM model is proposed for the first time to examine the performance of each model in the short, medium, and long term, respectively. Compared with the ARIMA model, each error of the multivariate 2-step LSTM model is reduced by 12.92%, 15.94%, 15.97%, and 14.81% in the short term. The 3-step ARIMA–LSTM model achieved excellent performance, with each error decreased to 15.19%, 33.14%, 36.79%, and 29.76% in the medium and long term. We provide the local and global explanation of the multivariate single-step LSTM model in the field of incidence prediction, pioneering. Conclusions: The multivariate 2-step LSTM model is suitable for short-term prediction and obtained a similar performance as previous studies. The 3-step ARIMA–LSTM model is appropriate for medium-to-long-term prediction and outperforms these models.

Based on the longwave TIR instrument (Hyper-CAM), this study designed two experiments to collect HTIR datasets, separate the temperature and emissivity of different vegetation of grassland, and analyze the relationship between the emissivity of vegetation and soil moisture content. First, we collected the HTIR remotely sensed dataset of different kinds of vegetation and used the temperature/emissivity separation algorithm to separate the temperature and emissivity of seven types of vegetation. The temperature and emissivity of these types of vegetation were separated. Then, the absorption characteristics of the emissivity spectral curves of each type of grass were analyzed. The distribution and differences of the temperature and specific emissivity in different parts of these seven grassland vegetation types were quantitatively analyzed, and the relationship between their changes and vegetation leaf moisture and vegetation health status was also analyzed. Second, to monitor the drought of grassland vegetation, a second experiment was designed to measure the changes in the emissivity under different soil water contents. This observation experiment took Artemisia frigida as the research object. From the results of the separation of the temperature and emissivity, we found that the emissivity of Artemisia frigida has significantly changed with the increase in the water content, and the emissivity showed an overall increasing trend. We also quantitatively analyzed the differences in the temperature and specific emissivity between Artemisia frigida and Artemisia subulata Nakai, both belonging to the genus Artemisia, under different water content conditions. The overall waveform characteristics and their similarities and differences at 850–1280 cm−1 were compared and analyzed. The experimental results shows that Hyper-CAM can effectively obtain the emissivity of various types of grassland vegetation as the absorption characteristics of grassland vegetation in the thermal infrared spectral region were quite notable, which shows the significant potential ability of identification and discrimination of different types of grassland vegetation. © 2022 by the authors.","drought monitoring; grassland remote sensing; soil moisture; spectral emissivity; temperature retrieval; water content","Drought; Electromagnetic wave emission; Infrared radiation; Separation; Soil moisture; Spectroscopy; Vegetation; Water content; Absorption characteristics; Drought monitoring; Grassland remote sensing; Grassland vegetation; HyperSpectral; Northwestern China; Remote-sensing; Spectral emissivity; Temperature retrieval; Thermal-infrared; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

In this study, an advanced biomass estimation approach for sugarcane fields is proposed based on multi-source remote sensing data. Since feature interpretability in agricultural data mining is significant, a feature extraction method of deep archetypal analysis (DAA) that has good model interpretability is introduced and aided by principal component analysis (PCA) for feature mining from the multi-mode multispectral and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing data pertaining to sugarcane. In addition, an integrated regression model integrating random forest regression, support vector regression, K-nearest neighbor regression and deep network regression is developed after feature extraction by DAA to precisely predict biomass of sugarcane. In this study, the biomass prediction performance achieved using the proposed integrated learning approach is found to be predominantly better than that achieved by using conventional linear methods in all the time periods of plant growth. Of more significance, according to model interpretability of DAA, only a small set of informative features maintaining their physical meanings (four informative spectral indices and four key LiDAR metrics) can be extracted which eliminates the redundancy of multi-mode data and plays a vital role in accurate biomass prediction. Therefore, the findings in this study provide hands-on experience to planters with indications of the key or informative spectral or LiDAR metrics relevant to the biomass to adjust the corresponding planting management design. © 2022 by the authors.","biomass prediction; deep archetypal analysis; integrated learning; multi-mode remote sensing data","Data mining; Decision trees; Deep learning; Extraction; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Nearest neighbor search; Optical radar; Principal component analysis; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Archetypal analysis; Biomass prediction; Deep archetypal analyse; Integrated learning; Interpretability; Light detection and ranging; Multi-mode remote sensing data; Multimodes; Plantings; Remote sensing data; Biomass",Article,Scopus

The plants are prone to infection at any growth stage, and there are no chemical or cultural controls. Thus, the development of resistant pea cultivars is important. Phenomics technologies to support the selection of resistant cultivars through phenotyping can be valuable. One such approach is to couple imaging technologies with deep learning algorithms that are considered efficient for the assessment of disease resistance across a large number of plant genotypes. In this study, the resistance to ARR was evaluated through a CNN-based assessment of pea root images. The proposed model, DeepARRNet, was designed to classify the pea root images into three classes based on ARR severity scores, namely, resistant, intermediate, and susceptible classes. The dataset consisted of 1581 pea root images with a skewed distribution. Hence, three effective data-balancing techniques were identified to solve the prevalent problem of unbalanced datasets. Random oversampling with image transformations, generative adversarial network (GAN)-based image synthesis, and loss function with class-weighted ratio were implemented during the training process. The result indicated that the classification F1-score was 0.92 ± 0.03 when GAN-synthesized images were added, 0.91 ± 0.04 for random resampling, and 0.88 ± 0.05 when class-weighted loss function was implemented, which was higher than when an unbalanced dataset without these techniques were used (0.83 ± 0.03). The systematic approaches evaluated in this study can be applied to other image-based phenotyping datasets, which can aid the development of deep-learning models with improved performance. © 2022 by the authors.","deep learning; disease identification; generative adversarial networks; plant breeding","Classification (of information); Deep learning; Image classification; Image enhancement; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Balancing techniques; Deep learning; Disease identification; Growth stages; Phenotyping; Pisum sativum L; Plant breeding; Root rot; Root rot resistance; Unbalanced datasets; Generative adversarial networks; Aphanomyces; disease resistance; genetics; genotype; pea; Aphanomyces; Disease Resistance; Genotype; Peas",Article,Scopus

The most frequent malaria detection method relies mainly on the specialists who examine the samples under a microscope. Therefore, a computerized malaria diagnosis system is required. In this article, malaria cell segmentation and classification methods are proposed. The malaria cells are segmented using a color-based k-mean clustering approach on the selected number of clusters. After segmentation, deep features are extracted using pre-trained models such as efficient-net-b0 and shuffle-net, and the best features are selected using the Manta-Ray Foraging Optimization (MRFO) method. Two experiments are performed for classification using 10-fold cross-validation, the first experiment is based on the best features selected from the pre-trained models individually, while the second experiment is performed based on the selection of best features from the fusion of extracted features using both pre-trained models. The proposed method provided an accuracy of 99.2% for classification using the linear kernel of the SVM classifier. An empirical study demonstrates that the fused features vector results are better as compared to the individual best-selected features vector and the existing latest methods published so far.

In this study, we propose to predict sugarcane biometric parameters by using machine learning (ML) algorithms and multitemporal data through the analysis of multispectral images from UAV onboard sensors. The research was conducted on five varieties of sugarcane, as a way to make a robust approach. Multispectral images were collected every 40 days and the evaluated biometric parameters were: number of tillers (NT), plant height (PH), and stalk diameter (SD). Two ML models were used: multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF). The results showed that models for predicting sugarcane NT, PH, and SD using time series and ML algorithms had accurate and precise predictions. Blue, Green, and NIR spectral bands provided the best performance in predicting sugarcane biometric attributes.

Hyperspectral imaging can be used to obtain the physiological and biochemical parameters of maize leaves with the advantages of being rapid, non-destructive, and high throughput. This study aims to estimate the multiple amino acid contents in maize leaves using hyperspectral imaging data. Two nitrogen (N) fertilizer experiments were carried out to obtain the hyperspectral images of fresh maize leaves. The partial least squares regression (PLSR) method was used to build the estimation models of various amino acid contents by using the reflectance of all bands, sensitive band range, and sensitive bands. The models were then validated with the independent dataset. The results showed that (1) the spectral reflectance of most amino acids was more sensitive in the range of 400–717.08 nm than other bands. The estimation accuracy was better by using the reflectance of the sensitive band range than that of all bands; (2) the sensitive bands of most amino acids were in the ranges of 505.39–605 nm and 651–714 nm; and (3) among the 24 amino acids, the estimation models of the β-aminobutyric acid, ornithine, citrulline, methionine, and histidine achieved higher accuracy than those of other amino acids, with the R2, relative root mean square error (RE), and relative percent deviation (RPD) of the measured and estimated value of testing samples in the range of 0.84–0.96, 8.79%–19.77%, and 2.58–5.18, respectively.

The conventional method for rice yield-related trait evaluation faces the problems of rice threshing difficulties, measurement process complexity, and low efficiency. To solve these problems, a novel intelligent system, which includes an integrated threshing unit, grain conveyor-imaging units, threshed panicle conveyor-imaging unit, and specialized image analysis software has been proposed to achieve rice yield trait evaluation with high throughput and high accuracy. To improve the threshed panicle detection accuracy, the Region of Interest Align, Convolution Batch normalization activation with Leaky Relu module, Squeeze-and-Excitation unit, and optimal anchor size have been adopted to optimize the Faster-RCNN architecture, termed ‘TPanicle-RCNN,’ and the new model achieved F1 score 0.929 with an increase of 0.044, which was robust to indica and japonica varieties. Additionally, AI cloud computing was adopted, which dramatically reduced the system cost and improved flexibility. To evaluate the system accuracy and efficiency, 504 panicle samples were tested, and the total spikelet measurement error decreased from 11.44 to 2.99% with threshed panicle compensation. The average measuring efficiency was approximately 40 s per sample, which was approximately twenty times more efficient than manual measurement.

The ideas of target attraction and obstacle rejection of the artificial potential field method are introduced into the distributed proximal policy optimization algorithm, and the APF-DPPO learning model is established. To solve the range repulsion problem of the artificial potential field method, which affects the optimal driving strategy, this paper proposes a directional penalty function method that combines collision penalty and yaw penalty to convert the range penalty of obstacles into a single directional penalty, and establishes the vehicle motion collision model. Finally, the APF-DPPO learning model is selected to train the driving strategy for the virtual vehicle, and the transfer learning method is selected to verify the comparison experiment. The simulation results show that the completion rate of the virtual vehicle in the obstacle environment that generates penalty feedback is as high as 96.3%, which is 3.8% higher than the completion rate in the environment that does not generate penalty feedback. Under different reward functions, the method in this paper obtains the highest cumulative reward value within 500 s, which improves 69 points compared with the reward function method based on the artificial potential field method, and has higher adaptability and robustness in different environments. The experimental results show that this method can effectively improve the efficiency of autonomous driving strategy learning and control the virtual vehicle for autonomous driving behavior decisions, and provide reliable theoretical and technical support for real vehicles in autonomous driving decision-making. © 2022 by the authors.

To investigate the effects of depth and input dimensions of the proposed model, careful validations are performed by extensive numerical simulation. The results give an optimal depth (19) and recommend a limited input dimension (under 200). Furthermore, compared with the baseline models, including support vector regression, decision tree regression, and residual regression, our proposed model with the optimal depth performs best.

Previous studies on guayule have shown a close association between morphological traits or biomass and rubber content. We collected multispectral and RGB-derived Struc-ture-from-motion (SfM) data using an unmanned aircraft system (UAS; drone) to determine if incorporating both high-resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; an indicator of plant health) and canopy height (CH) information could support model predictions of crop produc-tivity. Ground-truth resource allocation in guayule was measured at four elevations (i.e., tiers) along the crop’s vertical profile using both traditional biomass measurement techniques and a novel vol-umetric measurement technique. Multiple linear regression models estimating fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), fresh volume (FV), fresh-weight-density (FWD), and dry-weight-density (DWD) were developed and their performance compared. Of the crop productivity measures considered, a model predicting FWD (i.e., the fresh weight of plant material adjusted by its freshly harvested volume) and incorporating NDVI, CH, NDVI:CH interaction, and tier parameters reported the low-est mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between field measurements and predictions, ranging from 9 to 13%. A reduced FWD model incorporating only NDVI and tier parameters was developed to explore the scalability of model predictions to medium spatial resolutions with Sentinel-2 satellite data.

Primarily, how do we produce more, but in a way that is healthier for the animals, public, and the environment? Implementing a smart agri-systems approach, utilising multiplatform precision technologies, internet of things, data analytics, machine learning, digital twinning and other emerging technologies can support a more informed decision-making and forecasting position that will allow us to move towards greater sustainability in future. If we look to precision agronomy, there are a wide range of technologies available and examples of how digitalisation and integration of platform outputs can lead to advances in understanding the agricultural system and forecasting upcoming events and performance that have hitherto been impossible to achieve. There is much for the livestock sector and animal scientists to learn from the developments of precision technologies and smart agri-system approaches in the arable and horticultural contexts. However, there are several barriers the livestock sector must overcome: (i) the development and implementation of precision livestock farming technologies that can be easily integrated and analysed without the support of a dedicated data analyst in house; (ii) the lack of extensive validation of many developed and available precision livestock farming technologies means that reliability and accuracy are likely to be compromised when applied in commercial practice; (iii) the best smart agri-systems approaches are reliant on large quantities of data from across a wide variety of conditions, but at present the complications of data sharing, commercial sensitivities, data ownership, and permissions make it challenging to obtain or knit together data from different parts of the system into a comprehensive picture; and (iv) the high level of investment needed to develop and scale these technologies is substantial and represents significant risk for companies when a technology is emerging. Using a case study of the National Pig Centre (a flagship pig research facility in the UK) we discuss how a smart agri-systems approach can be applied in practice to investigate alternative future systems for production, and enable monitoring of these systems as a commercial demonstrator site for future pork production. © 2022 The Author(s)","Digital farming; Pork; Precision Livestock Farming; Production; Systems approach","agricultural land; agriculture; animal; livestock; meat; pig; reproducibility; Agriculture; Animals; Farms; Livestock; Meat; Reproducibility of Results; Swine",Article,Scopus

In this study, crop growth was non-destructively monitored based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology. Three irrigation levels (W1, W2 and W3) and four fertilization levels (F3, F2, F1 and F0) were set in this study, and drip irrigation fertilization treatments adopted a complete block design. A correlation analysis was conducted using UAV multispectral image data obtained from 2019 to 2021 and the field-measured leaf nitrogen content (LNC), leaf potassium content (LKC) and leaf phosphorus content (LPC) values; from the results, the vegetation indices (VIs) that were sensitive to LNC, LKC and LPC were determined. By combining spectral indices with partial least squares (PLS), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning machine (ELM) machine-learning algorithms, prediction models were established. Finally, the optimal combinations of spectral variables and machine learning models for predicting LNC, LPC and LKC in each grape growth period were determined. The results showed that: (1) there were high demands for nitrogen during the new shoot growth and flowering periods, potassium was the main nutrient absorbed in the fruit expansion period, and phosphorus was the main nutrient absorbed in the veraison and maturity periods; (2) combining multiple spectral variables with the RF, SVM and ELM models could result in improved LNC, LPC and LKC predictions. The optimal prediction model determination coefficient (R2) derived during the new shoot growth period was above 0.65, and that obtained during the other growth periods was above 0.75. The relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of the above models was below 0.20, and the Willmott consistency index (WIA) was above 0.88.

Solving these problems requires precise segmentation of the forest mask. Although forest mask extraction from satellite data has been considered previously, no open-access applications are able to provide the high-detailed forest mask. Detailed forest masks are usually obtained using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) that set particular limitations such as cost and inapplicability for vast territories.

This article aims to examine the role of soybean agroforestry to meet human protein needs and as an effort to mitigate climate change.In Indonesia, soybean development is constrained by people's views; soybean is not the main crop and the rate of land conversion. An effort to overcome the limitation of optimum land according to the growing season is the development of soybean cultivation under forest stands as an agroforestry system. In Indonesia, there are production forests, including teak, pine, sengon, and resin, especially in teak, pine, and sengon forests, soybean cultivation with agroforestry systems has developed. The main obstacle to cultivation in the agroforestry system is low light due to the shade of the tree canopy. It requires efforts: tree spacing, especially between rows, trimming the tree canopy when the canopy is getting tighter, and low light tolerant plant varieties. Soybeans are low-light tolerant plants. The national average soybean production of about 1.5 tons ha-1 can be achieved in teak-based agroforestry systems up to 3-4 years old tree, pine-based up to 3 years old, and sengon-based up to 5 years old.

Hence, it is necessary to monitor the condition of vibration signal series to avoid any catastrophic failure.

First, we add variational mode decomposition (VMD) to preprocess the data points listed in a time order into a subseries, namely intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then the framework of the hybrid prediction model, namely the autoregressive moving average (ARMA)-artificial neural network (ANN), is adopted to forecast the IMF series. Next, we select the sensitive modes that contain the prime information of the original signal and that can imply the condition of the machinery. Subsequently, we apply the support vector machine (SVM) classification model to identify the multiple condition patterns based on the multi-domain features extracted from sensitive modes. Finally, the vibration signals from the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) laboratory are utilized to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

A small plot field experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with winter oat (Avena sativa L.) varieties in Debrecen, Hungary in the 2020/2021 cropping year. Multiple field measurements and aerial surveys were carried out examining the response of oat on Silicon and Sulfur foliar fertilization treatments thereby monitoring their effects on the physiology, production and stress tolerance. Parallel application of in situ (elevation, soil pH, NDVI, SPAD, chlorophyll content) and aerial (NDVI, NDRE) surveys including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provided a diverse source of data for evaluation. Both the oat varieties (88.9%) and the foliar fertilization treatments (87.5%) were correctly classified and clearly separated with the discriminant analysis based on measured data. The Pearson correlation analysis showed a very strong positive connection (r = 0.895–1.00) between the NDVI values measured using a hand-held system and UAV-installed camera, except the third measurement time, where the correlation was weaker (r = 0.70).

However, there are few studies quantitatively predicting the internal thermal and moisture environment of duck houses. In this study, high-accuracy recurrent neural network (RNN) models were used to predict the internal air temperature and relative humidity of mechanically and naturally ventilated duck houses. The models were developed according to the type of duck houses, seasons, and environmental variables by learning the monitoring data of the internal and external environments. The optimal sequence length of learning data for the development of the RNN model was selected as 120 min. As a result of the validation, both air temperature and relative humidity could be accurately predicted within 1% error. In addition, simplified RNN models were additionally developed by learning only from the data of external air temperature, relative humidity, and duck weight, which are relatively easy to acquire at the farms. The accuracy of the simplified RNN models was similar to the basic model for predicting the internal air temperature and relative humidity of duck houses in real time. In the future, for the convergence of information and communications technologies (ICTs) and application of smart farms in duck houses, the RNN models of duck houses developed in this study can be applied to predict and control the internal environments of duck houses using the model predictive control (MPC) technique. © 2022 by the authors.

However, these methods are with heavy-weight architectures in nature, and hence require a higher storage and expensive training operations due to feeding a large number of training parameters. There is a necessity to explore lightweight deep learning models without compromising the classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a lightweight deep learning model using the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model and attention module. First, the convolution features are extracted to capture the high-level object-based information. Second, an attention module is used to capture the interesting semantic information. The convolution and attention modules are then combined together to fuse both the high-level object-based information and the interesting semantic information, which is followed by the fully connected layers and the softmax layer. Evaluation of our proposed method, which leverages transfer learning approach, on three public fruit-related benchmark datasets shows that our proposed method outperforms the four latest deep learning methods with a smaller number of trainable parameters and a superior classification accuracy. Our model has a great potential to be adopted by industries closely related to the fruit growing and retailing or processing chain for automatic fruit identification and classifications in the future.

Very-high-resolution remote sensing image sets collected repeatedly throughout a crop growing season are becoming increasingly common. Analytical methods able to learn from both spatial and time dimensions of the data may allow for an improved estimation of crop traits, as well as the effects of genetics and the environment on these traits. Multispectral and geometric time series imagery was collected by UAV on 11 dates, along with ground-truth data, in a field trial of 866 genetically diverse biomass sorghum accessions. We compared the performance of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architectures that used image data from single dates (two spatial dimensions, 2D) versus multiple dates (two spatial dimensions + temporal dimension, 3D) to estimate lodging detection and severity. Lodging was detected with 3D-CNN analysis of time series imagery with 0.88 accuracy, 0.92 precision, and 0.83 recall. This outperformed the best 2D-CNN on a single date with 0.85 accuracy, 0.84 precision, and 0.76 recall. The variation in lodging severity was estimated by the best 3D-CNN analysis with 9.4% mean absolute error (MAE), 11.9% root mean square error (RMSE), and goodness-of-fit (R2) of 0.76. This was a significant improvement over the best 2D-CNN analysis with 11.84% MAE, 14.91% RMSE, and 0.63 R2. The success of the improved 3D-CNN analysis approach depended on the inclusion of “before and after” data, i.e., images collected on dates before and after the lodging event. The integration of geometric and spectral features with 3D-CNN architecture was also key to the improved assessment of lodging severity, which is an important and difficult-to-assess phenomenon in bioenergy feedstocks such as biomass sorghum. This demonstrates that spatio-temporal CNN architectures based on UAV time series imagery have significant potential to enhance plant phenotyping capabilities in crop breeding and precision agriculture applications. © 2022 by the authors.

Plant diseases can have a devastating influence towards food safety and a considerable loss in the production of agricultural products. Disease identification on the plant is essential for long‐term agriculture sus-tainability. Manually monitoring plant diseases is difficult due to time limitations and the diversity of diseases. In the realm of agricultural inputs, automatic characterization of plant diseases is widely required. Based on performance out of all image‐processing methods, is better suited for solving this task. This work investigates plant diseases in grapevines. Leaf blight, Black rot, stable, and Black measles are the four types of diseases found in grape plants. Several earlier research proposals using machine learning algorithms were created to detect one or two diseases in grape plant leaves; no one offers a complete detection of all four diseases. The photos are taken from the plant village dataset in order to use transfer learning to retrain the EfficientNet B7 deep architecture. Following the transfer learning, the collected features are down‐sampled using a Logistic Regression tech-nique. Finally, the most discriminant traits are identified with the highest constant accuracy of 98.7% using state‐of‐the‐art classifiers after 92 epochs.

(commonly known as fennel) is used in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries. Fennel widely used as a digestive, carminative, galactagogue and diuretic and in treating gastrointestinal and respiratory disorders. Improving low heritability traits such as essential oil yield (EOY%) and trans-anethole yield (TAY%) of fennel by direct selection does not result in rapid gains of EOY% and TAY%. Identification of high-heritable traits and using efficient modeling methods can be a beneficial approach to overcome this limitation and help breeders select the most advantageous traits in medicinal plant breeding programs. The present study aims to compare the performance of the artificial neural network (ANN) and multilinear regression (MLR) to predict the EOY% and TAY% of fennel populations. Stepwise regression (SWR) was used to assess the effect of various input variables. Based on SWR, nine traits—number of days to 50% flowering (NDF50%), number of days to maturity (NDM), final plant height (FPH), number of internodes (NI), number of umbels (NU), seed yield per square meter (SY/m2), number of seeds per plant (NS/P), number of seeds per umbel (NS/U) and 1000-seed weight (TSW)—were chosen as input variables. The network with Sigmoid Axon transfer function and two hidden layers was selected as the final ANN model for the prediction of EOY%, and the TanhAxon function with one hidden layer was used for the prediction of TAY%. The results revealed that the ANN method could predict the EOY% and TAY% with more accuracy and efficiency (R2 of EOY% = 0.929, R2 of TAY% = 0.777, RMSE of EOY% = 0.544, RMSE of TAY% = 0.264, MAE of EOY% = 0.385 and MAE of TAY% = 0.352) compared with the MLR model (R2 of EOY% = 0.553, R2 of TAY% = 0.467, RMSE of EOY% = 0.819, RMSE of TAY% = 0.448, MAE of EOY% = 0.624 and MAE of TAY% = 0.452). Based on the sensitivity analysis, SY/m2, NDF50% and NS/P were the most important traits to predict EOY% as well as SY/m2, NS/U and NDM to predict of TAY%.

The proposed categorization method assesses urban space broadly on two dimensions—the states of urbanization and the architectural form of the units observed. This paper shows how the sixteen sub-categories can be used by state-of-the-art deep learning modules (fully convolutional network FCN-8, U-Net, and DeepLabv3+) to categorize formal and informal urban areas in seven urban cities in the developing world—-Dhaka, Nairobi, Jakarta, Guangzhou, Mumbai, Cairo, and Lima. Firstly, an expert visually annotated and categorized 50 × 50 km Google Earth images of the cities. Each urban space was divided into four socioeconomic categories: (1) highly informal area; (2) moderately informal area; (3) moderately formal area, and (4) highly formal area. Then, three models mentioned above were used to categorize urban spaces. Image encompassing 70% of the urban space was used to train the models, and the remaining 30% was used for testing and validation of each city. The DeepLabv3+ model can segment the test part with an average accuracy of 90.0% for Dhaka, 91.5% for Nairobi, 94.75% for Jakarta, 82.0% for Guangzhou city, 94.25% for Mumbai, 91.75% for Cairo, and 96.75% for Lima. These results are the best for the DeepLabv3+ model among all. Thus, DeepLabv3+ shows an overall high accuracy level for most of the measuring parameters for all cities, making it highly scalable, readily usable to understand the cities’ current conditions, forecast land use growth, and other computational modeling tasks. Therefore, the proposed categorization method is also suited for real-time socioeconomic comparative analysis among cities, making it an essential tool for the policymakers to plan future sustainable urban spaces. © 2021 by the authors.

The selection of suitable hybrids and fertilizers is among the methods that can directly influence sustainable agriculture and economic efficiency at the farm level, providing accurate site-specific nutrient management strategies for yield maximization. This experiment included two fertilizer sources in ten maize hybrids in four replications for three consecutive years (2018–2020). The experiment was carried out at the Látókép Crop Production Experimental Site of the University of Debrecen, Hungary. The results of the ANOVA showed that genotype, year, and fertilizer levels had various effects on grain yield, oil, protein, and starch content. FAO340 had maximum grain yield on different fertilizers (NPK and N), and FAO350 had maximum protein content. To gain the best performance and maximum yield of maize on protein and oil, FAO350 is recommended for protein and FAO340 for oil content. The parameters of grain yield, oil content, protein content, and starch content affected by NPK fertilizer provide the stability of grain yield parameters. FAO360, FAO420, and FAO320 hybrids had their maximum desirable N fertilizer doses and NPK fertilizer stability in this research. These results indicate that FAO360, FAO420, and FAO330 hybrids had their maximum potential yield in different fertilizer and environmental conditions.

Improving the reliability and accuracy of wind and solar energy predictions can enhance the power system stability. This study aims to contribute to the issues of wind and solar energy fluctuation and intermittence by proposing a high-quality prediction model based on neural networks (NNs). The most efficient technology for analyzing the future performance of wind speed and solar irradiance is recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Bidirectional RNNs (BRNNs) have the advantages of manipulating the information in two opposing directions and providing feedback to the same outputs via two different hidden layers. A BRNN’s output layer concurrently receives information from both the backward layers and the forward layers. The bidirectional long short-term memory (BI-LSTM) prediction model was designed to predict wind speed, solar irradiance, and ambient temperature for the next 169 h. The solar irradiance data include global horizontal irradiance (GHI), direct normal irradiance (DNI), and diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI). The historical data collected from Dumat al-Jandal City covers the period from 1 January 1985 to 26 June 2021, as hourly intervals. The findings demonstrate that the BI-LSTM model has promising performance in terms of evaluation, with considerable accuracy for all five types of historical data, particularly for wind speed and ambient temperature values.

The decrease in the value of the quality indices was manifested by the increase of the number of mistakes, either of the number of double planting holes (with at least two seeds), or of the number of missing planting holes. Both cases are unfavorable for the agricultural producer, generating production losses. This paper discusses the influence of the degree of soil grinding on sowing precision in operating conditions, by determining the spectrum of the vibrations induced in the mechanical structure of row units of a precision planter in contact with the soil of three different plots for three working speeds: 4, 6, and 8 km·h−1. Later, the vibrations were simulated under laboratory conditions, on the stand, by means of rubber hemispheres (with diameters between 30 and 100 mm, corresponding to soil fractions resulting from the determination of the degree of soil grinding) mounted on rubber bands, which actuated the seed meters, for testing under an accelerated regime, outside of the optimal agricultural periods (out of season: Beginning mid-May until the end of March), in order to obtain the accuracy of the precision planters. It was found that the sowing precision determined in stationary conditions on the stand, and on a plot with an appropriate degree of seedbed preparation, decreased between 2.92% (at 4 km·h−1) and 6.67% (at 8 km·h−1). The main objective of the tests was to reduce labor costs, which was necessary for the staff involved for determining the qualitative indices of work in real field operating conditions, eliminating fuel consumption, while reducing the duration of testing dependent on meteorological factors (season, temperatures, and precipitation, etc.). © 2021 by the authors.

The trials were performed in two years (Y) (Y1 = 2016 and Y2 = 2017) and in two locations (L) (L1 and L2) under four ecological conditions of the year-location interaction (E1-E4) and in two densities (D1 and D2) (50,000 and 65,000 plants ha−1). Prior to tasselling, the following five treatments of detasseling and defoliation (T) were applied: T1-control, no leaf removal only detasseling, T2-T5-removal of tassels and top leaves (from one to four top leaves). The defoliation treatments had the most pronounced effect on the yield reduction in G1 (T1-Tn+1… T5), p < 0.05.

We investigated how effective crop canopy properties, including leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content, and canopy height, are as predictors of winter wheat yield over various lead times. Models were calibrated and validated on fertiliser trials over two years in fields in the UK. Correlations of LAI and plant height with yield were stronger than for yield and chlorophyll con-tent. Yield prediction models calibrated in one year and tested on another suggested that LAI and height provided the most robust outcomes. Linear models had equal or smaller validation errors than machine learning. The information content of data for yield prediction degraded strongly with time before harvest, and in application to years not included in the calibration. Thus, impact of soil and weather variation between years on crop phenotypes was critical in changing the interactions between crop variables and yield (i.e., slopes and intercepts of regression models) and was a key contributor to predictive error. These results show that canopy property data provide valuable information on crop status for yield assessment, but with important limitations. © 2021 by the author.

It argues that while fully or partially automating discretionary EIA decisions is legally and technically problematic, there is significant potential for data-driven decision-making tools to provide superior analysis and predictions to better inform EIA processes. Discretionary decision-making is desirable for EIA decisions given the inherent complexity associated with environmental regulation and the prediction of future impacts. This article demonstrates that current ADM tools cannot adequately replicate human discretionary processes for EIAs—even if there is human oversight and review of automated outputs. Instead of fully or partially automating EIA decisions, data-driven decision-making can be more appropriately deployed to enhance data analysis and predictions to optimise EIA decision-making processes. This latter type of ADM can augment decision-making processes without displacing the critical role of human discretion in weighing the complex environmental, social and economic considerations inherent in EIA determinations. © The Author/s 2021","automated decision making; data-driven decision making; discretionary decisions; Environmental impact assessments",,Article,Scopus

This research proposes two machine learning models for the prediction of food production. The adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) methods are used to advance the prediction models. In the present study, two variables of livestock production and agricultural production were considered as the source of food production. Three variables were used to evaluate livestock production, namely livestock yield, live animals, and animal slaughtered, and two variables were used to assess agricultural production, namely agricultural production yields and losses. Iran was selected as the case study of the current study. Therefore, time-series data related to livestock and agricultural productions in Iran from 1961 to 2017 have been collected from the FAOSTAT database. First, 70% of this data was used to train ANFIS and MLP, and the remaining 30% of the data was used to test the models. The results disclosed that the ANFIS model with generalized bell-shaped (Gbell) built-in membership functions has the lowest error level in predicting food production. The findings of this study provide a suitable tool for policymakers who can use this model and predict the future of food production to provide a proper plan for the future of food security and food supply for the next generations. © 2021 by the authors.

In simple terms, it is a mood disturbance that can persist for an individual for more than a few weeks to months. In MDD, in most cases, the individuals do not consult a professional, and even if being consulted, the results are not significant as the individuals find it challenging to identify whether they are depressed or not. Depression, most of the time, cooccurs with anxiety and leads to suicide in few cases, among the employees, who are about to handle the pressure at work and home and mostly unnoticing such problems. This is why this work aims to analyze the IT employees who are mostly working with targets. The artificial neural network, which is modeled loosely like the brain, has proved in recent days that it can perform better than most of the classification algorithms. This study has implemented the multilayered neural perceptron and experimented with the backpropagation technique over the data samples collected from IT professionals. This study aims to develop a model that can classify depressed individuals from those who are not depressed effectively with the data collected from them manually and through sensors.

This study quantified the spatial patterns of variability in soil and crop properties to delineate MZs for site-specific soil fertility characterization of potato fields through proximal sensing of fields. Grid sampling strategy was adopted to collect soil and crop data from two potato fields in Prince Edward Island (PEI). DUALEM-2 sensor, Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR-300), GreenSeeker were used to collect soil ground conductivity parameter horizontal coplanar geometry (HCP), soil moisture content (θ), and normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI), respectively. Soil organic matter (SOM), soil pH, phosphorous (P), potash (K), iron (Fe), lime index (LI), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) were determined from soil samples collected from each grid. Stepwise regression shortlisted the major properties of soil and crop that explained 71 to 86% of within-field variability. The cluster analysis grouped the soil and crop data into three zones, termed as excellent, medium, and poor at a 40% similarity level. The coefficient of variation and the interpolated maps characterized least to moderate variability of soil fertility parameters, except for HCP and K that were highly variable. The results of multiple means comparison indicated that the tuber yield and HCP were significantly different in all MZs. The significant relationship between HCP and yield suggested that the ground conductivity data could be used to develop MZs for site-specific fertilization in potato fields similar to those used in this study. © 2020 by the authors.","Management zones; Precision agriculture; Proximal sensing; Soil health; Soil variability",,Article,Scopus

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of projected temperature and precipitation changes on crop yields in the Monocacy River Watershed in the Mid-Atlantic United States based on climate change scenarios. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to simulate watershed hydrology and crop yield. To evaluate the effect of future climate projections, four global climate models (GCMs) and three representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5, 6, and 8.5) were used in the SWAT model. According to all GCMs and RCPs, a warmer climate with a wetter Autumn and Spring and a drier late Summer season is anticipated by mid and late century in this region. To evaluate future management strategies, water budget and crop yields were assessed for two scenarios: current rainfed and adaptive irrigated conditions. Irrigation would improve corn yields during mid-century across all scenarios. However, prolonged irrigation would have a negative impact due to nutrients runoff on both corn and soybean yields compared to rainfed condition. Decision tree analysis indicated that corn and soybean yields are most influenced by soil moisture, temperature, and precipitation as well as the water management practice used (i.e., rainfed or irrigated). The computed values from the SWAT modeling can be used as guidelines for water resource managers in this watershed to plan for projected water shortages and manage crop yields based on projected climate change conditions. © 2020 by the authors.

Even though superior bias correction methods can correct the distribution of daily precipitation amounts, as well as the wet-day frequency, they usually fail to correct the temporal sequence or structure of precipitation occurrence. To solve this problem, we presented a hybrid bias correction method for simulating the temporal sequence of daily precipitation occurrence. We did this by combining a first-order two-state Markov chain with a quantile-mapping (QM) based bias correction method. Specifically, a QM-based method was used to correct the distributional attributes of daily precipitation amounts and the wet-day frequency simulated by climate models. Then, the sequence of precipitation occurrence was simulated using the first-order two-state Markov chain with its parameters adjusted based on linear relationships between QM-corrected mean monthly precipitation and the transition probabilities of precipitation occurrence. The proposed Markov chain-based bias correction (MCBC) method was compared with the QM-based method with respect to reproducing the temporal structure of precipitation occurrence over 10 meteorological stations across China. The results showed that the QM-based method was unable to correct the temporal sequence, with the cumulative frequency of wet-and dry-spell length being considerably underestimated for most stations. The MCBC method can could reproduce the temporal sequence of precipitation occurrence, with the generated cumulative frequency of wet-and dry-spell lengths fitting that of the observation well. The proposed method also performed reasonably well with respect to reproducing the mean, standard deviation, and the longest length of observed wet-and dry-spells. Overall, the MCBC method can simulate the temporal sequence of precipitation occurrence, along with correcting the distributional attributes of precipitation amounts. This method can be used with crop and hydrological models in climate change impact studies at the field and small watershed scales. © 2020 by the authors.

These types of data can be used for developing an array of precision agriculture applications. Three different farms located in various climate conditions have opted for this research. For each farm, ten reference points in each year were selected to estimate a maize nitrogen uptake predictive model and use for evaluation procedure (30% of field data was for accuracy assessment and the rest of them for model prediction). At peak greenness (peak biomass) date, eight spectral vegetation indices were used for determining maize nitrogen uptake.

When modeling yield, the difference between potential and actual yield consistently changes because of advances in technology. Considering historical yield potential would help determine spatiotemporal trends in agricultural development. Comparing current and historical yields in Denmark is possible because yield potential has been documented throughout history. However, the current national winter wheat yield map solely uses soil properties within the model. The aim of this study was to generate a new Danish winter wheat yield map and compare the results to historical yield potential. Utilizing random forest with soil, climate, and topography variables, a winter wheat yield map was generated from 876 field trials carried out from 1992 to 2018. The random forest model performed better than the model based only on soil. The updated national yield map was then compared to yield potential maps from 1688 and 1844. While historical time periods are characterized by numerous low yield potential areas and few highly productive areas, current yield is evenly distributed between low and high yields. Advances in technology and farm practices have exceeded historical yield predictions, mainly due to the use of fertilizer, irrigation, and drainage.

This study was conducted in Guangdong, China, based on soil nutrient contents and hyperspectral data. The prediction accuracies from a partial least squares regression (PLSR), BPNN and GA-BPNN were compared using field observations.

Additionally, climate extremes have recently highlighted the vulnerability of the agricultural system to climate variability. This study seeks to fill two important gaps in current knowledge: how irrigation impacts the large-scale response of crops to varying climate conditions and how we can explicitly account for uncertainty in yield response to climate. To address these, we developed a statistical model to quantitatively estimate historical and future impacts of climate change and irrigation on US county-level crop yields with uncertainty explicitly treated. Historical climate and crop yield data for 1970-2009 were used over different growing regions to fit the model, and five CMIP5 climate projections were applied to simulate future crop yield response to climate. Maize and spring wheat yields are projected to experience decreasing trends with all models in agreement. Winter wheat yields in the Northwest will see an increasing trend. Results for soybean and winter wheat in the South are more complicated, as irrigation can change the trend in projected yields. The comparison between projected crop yield time series for rainfed and irrigated cases indicates that irrigation can buffer against climate variability that could lead to negative yield anomalies. Through trend analysis of the predictors, the trend in crop yield is mainly driven by projected trends in temperature-related indices, and county-level trend analysis shows regional differences are negligible. This framework provides estimates of the impact of climate and irrigation on US crop yields for the 21st century that account for the full uncertainty of climate variables and the range of crop response. The results of this study can contribute to decision making about crop choice and water use in an uncertain future climate. © 2019 The Author(s).

DL comprises a wide variety of algorithms which depend on numerous hyperparameters. Careful optimization of hyperparameter values is critical to avoid overfitting. Among the DL architectures currently tested in genomic prediction, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) seem more promising than multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). A limitation of DL is in interpreting the results. This may not be relevant for genomic prediction in plant or animal breeding but can be critical when deciding the genetic risk to a disease.

In this paper, crop models are distilled by CNN to evaluate the ability of deep learning to identify the plant physiology knowledge behind such crop models simply by learning. Due to difficulty in collecting big data on crop growth, a crop model was used to generate datasets. The generated datasets were fed into CNN for distillation of the crop model. The models trained by CNN were evaluated by the visualization of saliency maps. In this study, three saliency maps were calculated using all datasets (case 1) and using datasets with spikelet sterility due to either high temperature at anthesis (case 2) or cool summer damage (case 3). The results of case 1 indicated that CNN determined the developmental index of paddy rice, which was implemented in the crop model, simply by learning. Moreover, CNN identified the important individual environmental factors affecting the grain yield. Although CNN had no prior knowledge of spikelet sterility, cases 2 and 3 indicated that CNN realized about paddy rice becoming sensitive to daily mean and maximum temperatures during specific periods. Such deep learning approaches can be used to accelerate the understanding of crop models and make the models more portable. Moreover, the results indicated that CNN can be used to develop new plant physiology theories simply by learning. © 2019 Kyosuke Yamamoto.

One of the concerns of policy-makers and sorghum growers is to cost-effectively predict biomass yields early during the cropping season to improve biomass and biofuel management. The objective of this study was to investigate if Sentinel-2 satellite images could be used to predict within-season biomass sorghum yields in the Mediterranean region. Thirteen machine learning algorithms were tested on fortnightly Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B estimates of the fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR) in combination with in situ aboveground biomass yields from demonstrative fields in Italy. A gradient boosting algorithm implementing the xgbtree method was the best predictive model as it was satisfactorily implemented anywhere from May to July. The best prediction time was the month of May followed by May–June and May–July. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first time Sentinel-2-derived fAPAR is used in sorghum biomass predictive modeling. The results from this study will help farmers improve their sorghum biomass business operations and policy-makers and extension services improve energy planning and avoid energy-related crises. © 2019 by the authors.","Big data technology; FAPAR; Machine learning; Prediction modeling; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2 satellite imagery; Sorghum biomass",,Article,Scopus

This study estimated the potential impacts of the projected precipitation and temperature based on the downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP-5) on hydrology and crop yield of a rural watershed in Oklahoma, USA. The Soil andWater Assessment Tool was used to model the watershed with 43 sub-basins and 15,217 combinations of land use, land cover, soil, and slope. The model was driven by the observed climate in the watershed and was first calibrated and validated against the monthly observed streamflow. Three statistical matrices, coefficient of determination (R 2 ), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and percentage bias (PB), were used to gauge the model performance with satisfactory values of R 2 = 0.64, NS = 0.61, and PB = +5% in the calibration period, and R 2 = 0.79, NSE = 0.62, and PB = -15% in the validation period for streamflow. The model parameterization for the yields of cotton (PB = -4.5%), grain sorghum (PB = -27.3%), and winter wheat (PB = -6.0%) resulted in an acceptable model performance. The CMIP-5 ensemble of three General Circulation Models under three Representative Concentration Pathways for the 2016-2040 period indicated an increase in both precipitation (+1.5%) and temperature (+1.8 °C) in the study area. This changed climate resulted in decreased evapotranspiration (-3.7%), increased water yield (23.9%), decreased wheat yield (-5.2%), decreased grain sorghum yield (-9.9%), and increased cotton yield (+54.2%) compared to the historical climate. The projected increase in water yield might provide opportunities for groundwater recharge and additional water to meet future water demand in the region. The projected decrease in winter wheat yield-the major crop in the state-due to climate change, may require attention for ways to mitigate these effects. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Crop yield; Global climate models; Southern Great Plains; Surface runoff; SWAT","Climate change; Cotton; Crops; Grain (agricultural product); Land use; Recharging (underground waters); Stream flow; Watersheds; Crop yield; Global climate model; Southern great plains; Surface runoffs; SWAT; Climate models; climate change; climate modeling; CMIP; cotton; crop yield; evapotranspiration; global climate; groundwater; precipitation (climatology); runoff; soil analysis; soil and water assessment tool; sorghum; streamflow; water demand; water yield; watershed; wheat; winter; Oklahoma [United States]; United States; Gossypium hirsutum; Sorghum bicolor bicolor; Triticum aestivum",Article,Scopus

This heterogeneity often arises from landscape elements like forests, hedges, or single trees and shrubs that cast shadows. Shading from forested areas or shrubs has effects on transpiration, temperature, and soil moisture, all of which affect the crop yield in the adjacent arable land. Transitional gradients of solar irradiance can be described as a function of the distance to the zero line (edge), the cardinal direction, and the height of trees. The magnitude of yield reduction in transition zones is highly influenced by solar irradiance—a factor that is not yet implemented in crop growth models on a landscape level. We present a spatially explicit model for shading caused by forested areas, in agricultural landscapes. With increasing distance to forest, solar irradiance and yield increase. Our model predicts that the shading effect from the forested areas occurs up to 15 m from the forest edge, for the simulated wheat yields, and up to 30 m, for simulated maize. Moreover, we estimated the spatial extent of transition zones, to calculate the regional yield reduction caused by shading of the forest edges, which amounted to 5% to 8% in an exemplary region. © 2019 by the authors.

Modeling the long-term hydrologic impacts of alternative crops can be a time-saving and cost-effective alternative to field-based experiments. A newly developed management allowed depletion (MAD) irrigation scheduling algorithm for Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used in this study. The impacts of irrigated farming, dryland farming, and continuous fallow on water conservation were evaluated. Results indicated that simulated irrigation, evapotranspiration, and crop yield were representative of the measured data. Approximately 19%, 21%, and 32% reductions in annual groundwater uses were associated with irrigated soybean, sunflower, and sorghum, respectively, as compared to irrigated corn. On average, annual soil water depletion was more than 52 mm for dryland farming scenarios. In contrast, only 18 mm of soil water was lost to evaporation annually, for the long-term continuous fallow simulation.

The ORF and ANDF models, which are fuzzy logic systems based on t-conorm and t-norm between temperature and moisture conditions, respectively, were developed to assess the quality of climate conditions for crops. The parameter values for both models were obtained from existing knowledge, e.g., the EcoCrop database. These models were then compared with the EcoCrop model, which is based on the t-norm. The ORF model explained greater variation (54%) in the yield of annual ryegrass at 84 site-years than the ANDF model (43%) and the EcoCrop model (5%). The climate suitability index of the ORF model had the greatest likelihood of occurrence of annual ryegrass compared to the other models.

The classification methodology is adapted in order to be trained with a limited number of extreme cases. Using four weather predictors—the average temperature in July and August, and the SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index) in June and July—71% of the extreme cases are well classified by this statistical model.

The dependence of two canopy traits, height and vigour, on fertilizer treatment was observed in a field trial comprised of ten varieties of spring wheat. A custom-built mobile ground platform (MGP) and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were deployed at the experimental site for standard red, green and blue (RGB) image collection on five occasions. Meanwhile, reference field measurements of canopy height and vigour were manually recorded during the growing season. Canopy level estimates of height and vigour for each variety and treatment were computed by image analysis. The agreement between estimates from each platform and reference measurements was statistically analysed. Estimates of canopy height derived from MGP imagery were more accurate (RMSE = 3.95 cm, R2 = 0.94) than estimates derived from UAV imagery (RMSE = 6.64 cm, R2 = 0.85). In contrast, vigour was better estimated using the UAV imagery (RMSE = 0.057, R2 = 0.57), compared to MGP imagery (RMSE = 0.063, R2 = 0.42), albeit with a significant fixed and proportional bias. The ability of the platforms to capture differential development of traits as a function of fertilizer treatment was also investigated. Both imaging methodologies observed a higher median canopy height of treated plots compared with untreated plots throughout the season, and a greater median vigour of treated plots compared with untreated plots exhibited in the early growth stages. While the UAV imaging provides a high-throughput method for canopy-level trait determination, the MGP imaging captures subtle canopy structures, potentially useful for fine-grained analyses of plants. © 2018 by the authors.","Canopy imaging; Canopy traits; Field phenotyping; Height; Mobile ground platform; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vigour; Wheat","Aerial photography; Fertilizers; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Canopy traits; Height; Mobile ground platform; Phenotyping; Vigour; Wheat; Antennas",Article,Scopus

An accurate estimation of PET requires many input climate variables which are, in most cases, not available prior to the 1960s for the UK, nor indeed most parts of the world. Therefore, when applying hydrological models to earlier periods, modellers have to rely on PET estimations derived from simplified methods. Given that only monthly observed temperature data is readily available for the late 19th and early 20th century at a national scale for the UK, the objective of this work was to derive the best possible UK-wide gridded PET dataset from the limited data available.To that end, firstly, a combination of (i) seven temperature-based PET equations, (ii) four different calibration approaches and (iii) seven input temperature data were evaluated. For this evaluation, a gridded daily PET product based on the physically based Penman-Monteith equation (the CHESS PET dataset) was used, the rationale being that this provides a reliable ""ground truth"" PET dataset for evaluation purposes, given that no directly observed, distributed PET datasets exist. The performance of the models was also compared to a ""naïve method"", which is defined as the simplest possible estimation of PET in the absence of any available climate data. The ""naïve method"" used in this study is the CHESS PET daily long-term average (the period from 1961 to 1990 was chosen), or CHESS-PET daily climatology.The analysis revealed that the type of calibration and the input temperature dataset had only a minor effect on the accuracy of the PET estimations at catchment scale. From the seven equations tested, only the calibrated version of the McGuinness-Bordne equation was able to outperform the ""naïve method"" and was therefore used to derive the gridded, reconstructed dataset. The equation was calibrated using 43 catchments across Great Britain.The dataset produced is a 5km gridded PET dataset for the period 1891 to 2015, using the Met Office 5km monthly gridded temperature data available for that time period as input data for the PET equation. The dataset includes daily and monthly PET grids and is complemented with a suite of mapped performance metrics to help users assess the quality of the data spatially.This dataset is expected to be particularly valuable as input to hydrological models for any catchment in the UK. © Author(s) 2018.",,,Article,Scopus

Most wheat production studies use the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to estimate the production and yield of wheat and other crops. On the one hand, few studies use the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) to determine crop yield and production on a regional level. This is possibly due to a lack of continuity of MERIS. On the other hand, the emergence of Sentinel 2 open new possibilities for the research and application of MTCI. This study has built two empirical models to estimate wheat production and yield in Andalusia. To this end, the study used the complete times series (weekly images from 2006–2011) of the MTCI vegetation index from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) sensor associated with the Andalusian yearbook for agricultural and fishing statistics (AEAP—Anuario de estadísticas agrarias y pesqueras de Andalucía). In order to build these models, the optimal development period for the plant needed to be identified, as did the time-based aggregation of MTCI values using said optimal period as a reference, and relation with the index, with direct observations of production and yield through spatial aggregation using coverage from the Geographic Information System for Agricultural Parcels (SIGPAC—Sistema de información geográfica de parcelas agrícolas) and requests for common agricultural policy (CAP) assistance.

However, the selection of the most accurate method to estimate MAP can be daunting because there are numerous methods to choose from (e.g., proximate gauge, direct weighted average, surface-fitting, and remotely sensed methods). Multiple methods (n = 19) were used to estimate MAP with precipitation data from 11 distributed monitoring sites, and 4 remotely sensed data sets. Each method was validated against the hydrologic model simulated stream flow using the Soil andWater Assessment Tool (SWAT). SWAT was validated using a split-site method and the observed stream flow data from five nested-scale gauging sites in a mixed-land-use watershed of the central USA. Cross-validation results showed the error associated with surface-fitting and remotely sensed methods ranging from -4.5% to -5.1%, and -9.8% to -14.7%, respectively. Split-site validation results showed the percent bias (PBIAS) values that ranged from -4.5% to -160%. Second order polynomial functions especially overestimated precipitation and subsequent stream flow simulations (PBIAS = -160) in the headwaters. The results indicated that using an inverse-distance weighted, linear polynomial interpolation or multiquadric function method to estimate MAP may improve SWAT model simulations. Collectively, the results highlight the importance of spatially distributed observed hydroclimate data for precipitation and subsequent steam flow estimations. The MAP methods demonstrated in the current work can be used to reduce hydrologic model uncertainty caused by watershed physiographic differences. © 2017 by the authors.","CHIRPS; MAP; Mixed-land-use hydrology; Precipitation; PRISM; SWAT; TRMM","Land use; Maps; Precipitation (chemical); Prisms; Remote sensing; Stream flow; Uncertainty analysis; Watersheds; CHIRPS; Distributed monitoring; Inverse distance weighted; Mixed land use; Multiquadric function; Second-order polynomial; SWAT; TRMM; Inverse problems; interpolation; land use change; performance assessment; precipitation intensity; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; TRMM; watershed; United States",Article,Scopus

Given the interconnectedness between freshwater availability and many ecosystem services, including food provisioning, it is important to evaluate the drought implications on freshwater provisioning and food provisioning services. Studies about drought implications on streamflow, nutrient loads, and crop yields have been increased and these variables are all process-based model outputs that could represent ecosystem functions that contribute to the ecosystem services. However, few studies evaluate drought effects on ecosystem services such as freshwater and food provisioning and quantify these services using an index-based ecosystem service approach. In this study, the drought implications on freshwater and food provisioning services were evaluated for 14 four-digit HUC (Hydrological Unit Codes) subbasins in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB), using three drought indices: standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized soil water content index (SSWI), and standardized streamflow index (SSI). The results showed that the seasonal freshwater provisioning was highly affected by the precipitation deficits and/or surpluses in summer and autumn. A greater importance of hydrological drought than meteorological drought implications on freshwater provisioning was evident for the majority of the subbasins, as evidenced by higher correlations between freshwater provisioning and SSI12 than SPI12. Food provisioning was substantially affected by the precipitation and soil water deficits during summer and early autumn, with relatively less effect observed in winter. A greater importance of agricultural drought effects on food provisioning was evident for most of the subbasins during crop reproductive stages. Results from this study may provide insights to help make effective land management decisions in responding to extreme climate conditions in order to protect and restore freshwater provisioning and food provisioning services in the UMRB. © 2017 by the authors.

The MOD09A1 data, which are eight-day interval surface reflectance data, were obtained from day of the year (DOY) 89 to 337 to calculate the leaf area index (LAI). The sum of the LAI from early in the season to a given date in the season (end of DOY (EOD)) was well fitted to a logistic function and represented seasonal changes in leaf area duration (LAD). A simple phenology model was derived to estimate the dates of emergence and maturity using the LAD-logistic function parameters b1 and b2, which represented the rate of increase in LAI and the date of maximum LAI, respectively. The phenology model predicted emergence and maturity dates fairly well, with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 6.3 and 4.9 days for the validation dataset, respectively. Two simple linear regression models (YP and YF) were established using LAD as the variable to predict corn yield. The yield model YP used LAD from predicted emergence to maturity, and the yield model Yf used LAD for a predetermined period from DOY 89 to a particular EOD. When state/province corn yields for the validation dataset were predicted at DOY 321, near completion of the corn harvest, the YP model, including the predicted phenology, performed much better than the Yf model, with RMSE values of 0.68 t/ha and 0.66 t/ha for Illinois and Heilongjiang, respectively. The Yp model showed similar or better performance, even for the much earlier pre-harvest yield prediction at DOY 257. In addition, the model performance showed no difference between the two study regions with very different climates and cultivation methods, including cultivar and irrigation management. These results suggested that the approach described in this paper has potential for application to relatively wide agroclimatic regions with different cultivation methods and for extension to the other crops.

The land surface scheme of RegCM4 was modified to incorporate an East-West reforested zone (15°N and 20°N). Two runs were performed using the standard version of RegCM4 and the modified one of the same model taking into account the incorporated forest. The reforestation significantly modifies rainfall signal over West Africa by increasing it over the reforested zone and the Fouta Jallon highlands (FJH). This rainfall increase is associated with a strengthening of the atmospheric moisture over the reforested area. This atmospheric moisture content increase associated with the wind dynamic may explain the spatiotemporal change of the rainfall and extreme precipitation events. The analysis of the impacts of the reforestation on some rainfall indices shows an increase of the 90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles over the reforested zone and off the FJH. This reforestation also causes an increase of the maximum length of the consecutive wet days over and off FJH and a decrease of the maximum length of the consecutive dry days over the northern Sahel and the reforested zone. © 2016 Ibrahima Diba et al.",,,Article,Scopus

Many studies have been devoted to addressing this issue. The similarity regionalization approach, a commonly used strategy, is usually limited by subjective selection of similarity measures. This paper presents an application of a partitioned update scheme based on the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to reduce the prediction uncertainties. This scheme performs real-time updating for states and parameters of a distributed hydrological model by assimilating gauged streamflow. The streamflow predictions are constrained by the physical rainfall-runoff processes defined in the distributed hydrological model and by the correlation information transferred from gauged to ungauged basins. This scheme is successfully demonstrated in a nested basin with real-world hydrological data where the subbasins have immediate upstream and downstream neighbours. The results suggest that the assimilated observed data from downstream neighbours have more important roles in reducing the streamflow prediction errors at ungauged locations. The real-time updated model parameters remain stable with reasonable spreads after short-period assimilation, while their estimation trajectories have slow variations, which may be attributable to climate and land surface changes. Although this real-time updating scheme is intended for streamflow predictions in nested basins, it can be a valuable tool in separate basins to improve hydrological predictions by assimilating multi-source data sets, including ground-based and remote-sensing observations. © 2014 Author(s).",,"Real-time updating; State parameter estimation; Streamflow prediction; data set; Kalman filter; parameterization; prediction; rainfall-runoff modeling; real time; streamflow",Article,Scopus

These “omics” approaches have provided plant researchers with precise tools to evaluate the important agronomic traits for larger-sized germplasm at a reduced time interval in the early growth stages.

Limited hydroclimate and yield data, however, hamper drought impact monitoring and assessment at the farm field scale. This study demonstrates the potential of using field-scale soil moisture simulations to support highresolution agricultural yield prediction and drought monitoring at the smallholder farm field scale. We present a multiscale modeling approach that combines HydroBlocks a physically based hyper-resolution land surface model (LSM) with machine learning. We used HydroBlocks to simulate root zone soil moisture and soil temperature in Zambia at 3 h 30 m resolution. These simulations, along with remotely sensed vegetation indices, meteorological data, and descriptors of the physical landscape (related to topography, land cover, and soils) were combined with district-level maize data to train a random forest (RF) model to predict maize yields at district and field scales (250 m). Our model predicted yields with an average testing coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.57 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 310 kgha-1 using year-based cross-validation. Our predicted maize losses due to the 2015 2016 El Niño drought agreed well with losses reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Our results reveal that soil moisture is the strongest and most reliable predictor of maize yield, driving its spatial and temporal variability. Soil moisture was also a more effective indicator of drought impacts on crops than precipitation, soil and air temperatures, and remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based drought indices.

In this study, we theoretically analyzed the different mechanisms of the different deep learning structures, including the commonly used convolutional neural network (CNN), the high-dimension CNN [three-dimensional (3-D) CNN], the recurrent neural network, and the newest vision transformer (ViT), with regard to learning and representing the temporal information for spatio-temporal data. The performance of the different models was comprehensively evaluated on large-scale Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series images covering the whole of Slovenia. First, the 3-D CNN, long short-term memory (LSTM), and ViT, which all have specific structures that preserve temporal information, can effectively extract the spatio-temporal information, with the 3-D CNN and ViT showing the best performance. Second, the performance of the 2-D CNN, in which the temporal information is collapsed, is lower than that of the 3-D CNN, LSTM, and ViT but outperforms the conventional methods. Thirdly,using both optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images performs almost the same as using only optical images, indicating that the information that can be extracted from optical images is sufficient for land-cover classification. However, when optical images are unavailable, SAR imagescan provide satisfactorily classification results.

In this work, the effect of four input variables including GABA concentration, pomegranate cultivars, days of treatment, and drought and salinity stress evaluated to predict and modeling of morphological traits using artificial neural network (ANN) models including multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF). Image processing technique was used to measure the LLI, LWI, and LAI parameters. Among the ANNs applied, the MLP algorithm was chosen as the best model based on the highest accuracy.

We develop a method for accurate, scalable field delineation in smallholder systems. Fields are delineated with state-of-the-art deep learning and watershed segmentation. What is the implication of the main finding? Transfer learning and weak supervision reduce training labels needed by 5× to 10× 10,000 new crop field boundaries are generated in India and publicly released. Crop field boundaries aid in mapping crop types, predicting yields, and delivering field-scale analytics to farmers. Recent years have seen the successful application of deep learning to delineating field boundaries in industrial agricultural systems, but field boundary datasets remain missing in smallholder systems due to (1) small fields that require high resolution satellite imagery to delineate and (2) a lack of ground labels for model training and validation. In this work, we use newly-accessible high-resolution satellite imagery and combine transfer learning with weak supervision to address these challenges in India. Our best model uses 1.5 m resolution Airbus SPOT imagery as input, pre-trains a state-of-the-art neural network on France field boundaries, and fine-tunes on India labels to achieve a median Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.85 in India. When we decouple field delineation from cropland classification, a model trained in France and applied as-is to India Airbus SPOT imagery delineates fields with a mIoU of 0.74. If using 4.8 m resolution PlanetScope imagery instead, high average performance (mIoU > 0.8) is only achievable for fields larger than 1 hectare. Experiments also show that pre-training in France reduces the number of India field labels needed to achieve a given performance level by as much as 10× when datasets are small. These findings suggest our method is a scalable approach for delineating crop fields in regions of the world that currently lack field boundary datasets. We publicly release 10,000 Indian field boundary labels and our delineation model to facilitate the creation of field boundary maps and new methods by the community. © 2022 by the authors.","agriculture; deep learning; field delineation; remote sensing; segmentation; smallholders; transfer learning; weak supervision","Crops; Deep learning; Learning systems; Satellite imagery; Transfer learning; Crop fields; Deep learning; Field boundaries; Field delineation; Remote-sensing; Segmentation; Smallholder; State of the art; Transfer learning; Weak supervision; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

First, we used above-ground biomass (AGB) data obtained from Brachiaria to evaluate the relationship between vegetation indices (VIs) with the dry matter (DM).

Lowering the groundwater in natural and man-made slopes can help to mitigate the hazards. Subsurface drainage systems equipped with pumps have traditionally been regarded as a temporary remedy for lowering the groundwater in geosystems, whereas long-term usage of pumping-based techniques is uncommon due to the associated high operational costs in labor and energy. This study investigates the intelligent control of groundwater in slopes enabled by deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a subfield of machine learning for automated decision-making. The purpose is to develop an autonomous geosystem that can minimize the operating cost and enhance the system’s safety without introducing human errors and interventions. To prove the concept, a seepage analysis model was implemented using a partial differential equation solver, FEniCS, to simulate the geosystem (i.e., a slope equipped with a pump and subjected to rainfall events). A Deep Q-Network (i.e., a DRL learning agent) was trained to learn the optimal control policy for regulating the pump’s flow rate. The objective is to enable intermittent control of the pump’s flow rate (i.e., 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the pumping capacity) to keep the groundwater close to the target level during rainfall events and consequently help to prevent slope failure. A comparison of the results with traditional proportional-integral-derivative-controlled and uncontrolled water tables showed that the geosystem integrated with DRL can dynamically adapt its response to diverse weather events by adjusting the pump’s flow rate and improve the adopted control policy by gaining more experience over time. In addition, it was observed that the DRL control helped to mitigate slope failure during rainfall events. © 2022 by the authors.","Deep Q-Network; deep reinforcement learning; intelligent control; landslide; seepage analysis; slope stability analysis","Decision making; Deep learning; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Pumps; Rain; Reinforcement learning; Seepage; Two term control systems; Deep Q-network; Deep reinforcement learning; Energy; Geosystems; Rainfall event; Reinforcement learnings; Seepage analysis; Slope failure; Slope stability analysis; Subsurface drainage system; Landslides; ground water; human; machine learning; Groundwater; Humans; Machine Learning",Article,Scopus

Since satellite images have a trade-off in spatial and temporal resolution, spatiotemporal image fusion (STIF) has been applied to construct time-series images at a consistent scale. With the increased availability of high spatial resolution images, it is necessary to develop a new STIF model that can effectively reflect the properties of high spatial resolution satellite images for small-scale crop field monitoring. This paper proposes an advanced STIF model using a single image pair, called high spatial resolution image fusion using object-based weighting (HIFOW), for blending high spatial resolution satellite images. The four-step weighted-function approach of HIFOW includes (1) temporal relationship modeling, (2) object extraction using image segmentation, (3) weighting based on object information, and (4) residual correction to quantify temporal variability between the base and prediction dates and also represent both spectral patterns at the prediction date and spatial details of fine-scale images. The specific procedures tailored for blending fine-scale images are the extraction of object-based change and structural information and their application to weight determination. The potential of HIFOW was evaluated from the experiments on agricultural sites using Sentinel-2 and RapidEye images. HIFOW was compared with three existing STIF models, including the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF), and Fit-FC. Experimental results revealed that the HIFOW prediction could restore detailed spatial patterns within crop fields and clear crop boundaries with less spectral distortion, which was not represented in the prediction results of the other three models. Consequently, HIFOW achieved the best prediction performance in terms of accuracy and structural similarity for all the spectral bands. Other than the reflectance prediction, HIFOW also yielded superior prediction performance for blending normalized difference vegetation index images. These findings indicate that HIFOW could be a potential solution for constructing high spatial resolution time-series images in small-scale croplands. © 2022 by the authors.","crop monitoring; image segmentation; multi-sensor images; resolution",,Article,Scopus

In today’s medical practices, skin cancer detection is a time-consuming procedure that may lead to a patient’s death in later stages. The diagnosis of skin cancer at an earlier stage is crucial for the success rate of complete cure. The efficient detection of skin cancer is a challenging task. Therefore, the numbers of skilful dermatologists around the globe are not enough to deal with today’s healthcare. The huge difference between data from various healthcare sector classes leads to data imbalance problems. Due to data imbalance issues, deep learning models are often trained on one class more than others. This study proposes a novel deep learning-based skin cancer detector using an imbalanced dataset. Data augmentation was used to balance various skin cancer classes to overcome the data imbalance. The Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 dataset was employed, which consists of seven classes of skin lesions. Deep learning models are widely used in disease diagnosis through images. Deep learning-based models (AlexNet, InceptionV3, and RegNetY-320) were employed to classify skin cancer. The proposed framework was also tuned with various combinations of hyperparameters. The results show that RegNetY-320 outperformed InceptionV3 and AlexNet in terms of the accuracy, F1-score, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve both on the imbalanced and balanced datasets. The performance of the proposed framework was better than that of conventional methods. The accuracy, F1-score, and ROC curve value obtained with the proposed framework were 91%, 88.1%, and 0.95, which were significantly better than those of the state-of-the-art method, which achieved 85%, 69.3%, and 0.90, respectively. Our proposed framework may assist in disease identification, which could save lives, reduce unnecessary biopsies, and reduce costs for patients, dermatologists, and healthcare professionals. © 2022 by the authors.","deep learning; disease diagnosis system; healthcare; medical imaging; skin cancer","Article; artificial neural network; cancer classification; classifier; deep learning; dermatologist; diagnostic imaging; human; pattern recognition; residual neural network; skin cancer",Article,Scopus

High spatial and temporal resolution spectral data acquired by multispectral and conventional cameras (or red, green, blue (RGB) sensors) onboard UAVs can be useful for plant water status determination and, as a consequence, for irrigation management. A study in a vineyard located in south-eastern Spain was carried out during the 2018, 2019, and 2020 seasons to assess the potential uses of these techniques. Different water qualities and irrigation application start throughout the growth cycle were imposed. Flights with RGB and multispectral cameras mounted on a UAV were performed throughout the growth cycle, and orthoimages were generated. These orthoimages were segmented to include only vegetation and calculate the green canopy cover (GCC). The stem water potential was measured, and the water stress integral (Sψ) was obtained during each irrigation season. Multiple linear regression techniques and artificial neural networks (ANNs) models with multispectral and RGB bands, as well as GCC, as inputs, were trained and tested to simulate the Sψ. The results showed that the information in the visible domain was highly related to the Sψ in the 2018 season. For all the other years and combinations of years, multispectral ANNs performed slightly better. Differences in the spatial resolution and radiometric quality of the RGB and multispectral geomatic products explain the good model performances with each type of data. Additionally, RGB cameras cost less and are easier to use than multispectral cameras, and RGB images are simpler to process than multispectral images. Therefore, RGB sensors are a good option for use in predicting entire vineyard water status. In any case, field punctual measurements are still required to generate a general model to estimate the water status in any season and vineyard. © 2022 by the authors.","ANN; machine learning; multispectral images; RGB images; UAV; vineyard; water stress",,Article,Scopus

In this study, we evaluated the role of Si in regulating the salt stress tolerance of cotton by analyzing the induced morpho-physiological changes. A hydroponic experiment was conducted by using contrasting salt-tolerant cotton genotypes (sensitive Z0102; tolerant Z9807) and four treatments (CK, control; CKSi, 0.4 mM Si; NaCl, 150 mM NaCl; NaClSi, 150 mM NaCl+0.4 mM Si). The results showed that Si significantly enhanced the net photosynthesis rate and improved the growth of cotton seedling under salt stress in both salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant genotypes. Exogenous Si significantly reduced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content in salt-stressed cotton. In addition, the application of Si up-regulated the expression of CAT1, SODCC and POD, and significantly enhanced the antioxidant enzymatic activities, such as catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD), of the salt-stressed cotton seedlings. Further, Si addition protected the integrity of the chloroplast ultrastructure, including key enzymes in photosynthesis such as ferredoxin-NADP reeducates (FNR), ATP synthase (Mg2+Ca2+-ATPase) and ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO), and the structure and function of the photosynthetic apparatus PSII from salt stress. Moreover, Si significantly increased the effective stomatal density and stomatal aperture in the salt-stressed cotton seedlings. Taken together, Si could likely ameliorate adverse effects of salt stress on cotton by improving the ROS scavenging ability and photosynthetic capacity. © 2022 by the authors.","antioxidant enzymes; chloroplast ultrastructure; photosynthetic performance; salinity; silicon",,Article,Scopus

In this study, we propose a novel data assimilation framework. Firstly, we construct the likelihood constraints for a process-based crop growth model based on the previous year’s statistical yield and the current year’s field observations. Then, we infer the posterior sets of model-simulated time-series LAI and the final yield of winter wheat with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for each meteorological data grid of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis (v5ERA5). Finally, we estimate the winter wheat yield at the spatial resolution of 10 m by combining Sentinel-2 LAI and the WOFOST model in Hengshui, the prefecture-level city of Hebei province of China. The results show that the proposed framework can estimate the winter wheat yield with a coefficient of determination R2 equal to 0.29 and mean absolute percentage error MAPE equal to 7.20% compared to within-field measurements.

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of an AquaCrop model for maize growth simulation under different soil conditions (humic acid (HA) and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)) and dosages and different levels of irrigation in the Shandong coastal saline–alkali area, China, and to optimize the amount of irrigation. Three years of experiments were carried out in the growing season of maize (Ludan 510) in 2019, 2020, and 2021. The dosages of HA were 5, 15, 25, and 35 g/m2, the dosages of CMC were 1, 2, 3, and 5 g/m2, and the levels of irrigation from 2019 to 2021 were all 120 mm. The model was calibrated with data from 2019, and the model was verified with data from 2020 to 2021, according to the recommended corn parameters in the AquaCrop model manual. The results showed that the model had a good simulation effect on canopy coverage, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of less than 15.2%, and the simulated aboveground biomass and yield were generally low. The simulated value of soil water content was generally high, with some treatments having errors of more than 15.0%. The simulation effect of irrigated maize from 2019 to 2020 was better than maize in 2021. The simulation effect of HA was better than that of CMC, while the simulation effect of a low-gradient modifier was better than that of high-gradient conditioner when compared with CMC. In conclusion, the AquaCrop model could be a viable method for predicting maize development under different soil conditioners in this area. The suitable levels of irrigation under HA and CMC treatments were 47.0–65.9 mm and 61.0–92.4 mm, respectively, according to the principle of high yield and water use efficiency. The results provided a reference for optimizing the drip irrigation of maize under the application of soil conditioners in coastal saline–alkali areas. © 2022 by the authors.

Finding rare diversity requires a deep understanding of biological interactions between the genetic makeup of one genotype and its environmental conditions. Most modern breeding programs still rely on linear regression models to solve this problem, generalizing the complex genotype by phenotype interactions through manually constructed linear features. However, the identification of positive alleles vs. background can be addressed using deep learning approaches that have the capacity to learn complex nonlinear functions for the inputs. Machine learning (ML) is an artificial intelligence (AI) approach involving a range of algorithms to learn from input data sets and predict outcomes in other related samples. This paper describes a variety of techniques that include supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms to improve our understanding of nonlinear interactions from plant breeding data sets. Feature selection (FS) methods are combined with linear and nonlinear predictors and compared to traditional prediction methods used in plant breeding. Recent advances in ML allowed the construction of complex models that have the capacity to better differentiate between positive alleles and the genetic background. Using real plant breeding program data, we show that ML methods have the ability to outperform current approaches, increase prediction accuracies, decrease the computing time drastically, and improve the detection of important alleles involved in qualitative or quantitative traits.

Few tools or soil tests exist to help managers guide N fertilizer decisions. Turf growth prediction models have the potential to be useful, but the lone turfgrass growth prediction model only takes into account temperature, limiting its accuracy. This study investigated the ability of a machine learning (ML)-based turf growth model using the random forest (RF) algorithm (ML-RF model) to improve creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) putting green management by estimating short-term clipping yield. This method was compared against three alternative N application strategies including (1) PACE Turf growth potential (GP) model, (2) an experience-based method for applying N fertilizer (experience-based method), and (3) the experience-based method guided by a vegetative index, normalized difference red edge (NDRE)-based method. The ML-RF model was built based on a set of variables including 7-day weather, evapotranspiration (ET), traffic intensity, soil moisture content, N fertilization rate, NDRE, and root zone type. The field experiment was conducted on two sand-based research greens in 2020 and 2021. The cumulative applied N fertilizer was 281 kg ha−1 for the PACE Turf GP model, 190 kg ha−1 for the experience-based method, 140 kg ha−1 for the ML-RF model, and around 75 kg ha−1 NDRE-based method. ML-RF model and NDRE-based method were able to provide customized N fertilization recommendations on different root zones. The methods resulted in different mean turfgrass qualities and NDRE. From highest to lowest, they were PACE Turf GP model, experience-based, ML-RF model, and NDRE-based method, and the first three methods produced turfgrass quality over 7 (on a scale from 1 to 9) and NDRE value over 0.30. N fertilization guided by the ML-RF model resulted in a moderate amount of fertilizer applied and acceptable turfgrass performance characteristics. This application strategy is based on the N cycle and has the potential to assist turfgrass managers in making N fertilization decisions for creeping bentgrass putting greens.

Here we assess the WUE of maize in the Hetao Irrigation District, which is a representative irrigation district in the arid region of Northwest China. Specifically, we firstly mapped the location of the maize field by using a remote sensing/phenological–based vegetation classifier and then quantified the maize water use and yield by using a dual-source remote-sensing evapotranspiration (ET) model and a crop water production function, respectively. Validation results show that the adopted phenological-based vegetation classifier performed well in mapping the spatial distributions and inter-annual variations of maize planting, with a kappa coefficient of 0.86. In addition, the ET model based on the hybrid dual-source scheme and trapezoid framework also obtained high accuracy in spatiotemporal ET mapping, with an RMSE of 0.52 mm/day at the site scale and 26.21 mm/year during the maize growing season (April–October) at the regional scale. Further, the adopted crop water production function showed high accuracy in estimating the maize yield, with a mean relative error of only 4.3%.

However, obtaining complete time-series remote sensing images during the growing season is challenging due to cloud contamination. Hence, given time-series multispectral data, it is important to impute missing data and accurately classify crops. A novel Imputation-BiLSTM model (Im-BiLSTM) was developed based on Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory network (BiLSTM) to jointly perform missing data imputation and crop classification. The Im-BiLSTM model regards missing data as network variables, which are efficiently updated during backpropagation. Im-BiLSTM treats the interaction between imputation and classification tasks, reducing the error and uncertainty caused by the separation operation of imputation to classification. Furthermore, we improved the interpretability of the Im-BiLSTM model by evaluating the importance of input features and visualizing hidden state units. In Shawan County, Xinjiang, China, we acquired a total of 10 Sentinel-2A images from April to October 2016, of which 3 images lost partial data due to cloud cover. The Im-BiLSTM model was applied to incomplete time-series data containing 10 time-steps for pixel-level crop classification, and the BiLSTM model was constructed based on cloud-free images for comparison. The performance of the proposed model was tested in four different cases of images missing and missing rates. The results showed that the classification of the Im-BiLSTM model outperformed the BiLSTM model, the overall accuracy was improved by a maximum of 4.2%, and the F1-scores of spring corn and tomato was improved by a maximum of 16.1% and 21.4%, respectively. Therefore, the Im-BiLSTM model can effectively improve classification performance by jointly imputing missing data. The imputation results (the coefficient of determination values range 0.4 ∼ 0.9) indicated that the bands with the larger contribution to the classification had higher imputation accuracy. Feature importance evaluation showed that the Im-BiLSTM model captured the key phenological periods and features from time-series input. The visualization of hidden units demonstrated that the Im-BiLSTM model accumulated useful information over time, and the learned high-level features made the crops more separable than the original inputs. © 2022 The Author(s)","Bidirectional LSTM; Crop classification; Data imputation; Interpretation; Joint learning; Multi-temporal","agricultural production; data interpretation; GIS; learning; satellite data; satellite imagery; temporal analysis; China; Xinjiang Uygur",Article,Scopus

The emergence of machine learning algorithms provides a potential to model complex systems and mine information from multi-source data without elucidating underlying mechanisms. Here, we utilized random forest and neural network algorithms to predict the grassland degradation represented by the net primary productivity (NPP) changing rate based on multi-source data including geographic, meteorological, plant traits, land use type and microbial variables in the Chinese Northern grassland.

Agroforestry systems such as alley cropping are gaining more and more attention as a practice to maintain and/or increase SOC in agroecosystems. The aim of this study was to add to the knowledge on SOC in alley cropping systems and to evaluate the contribution of introducing trees into agricultural landscapes by conducting a meta-analysis of the available data. The soil carbon (C) input will increase with time. Our findings suggest that a beneficial effect on SOC occurs after approximately a decade of alley cropping practice adoption. Furthermore, the effect of alley cropping is more beneficial in regions with lower initial SOC concentration compared to that in regions rich in SOC. Higher relative SOC is observed in the tropical region compared to that in the temperate climate zone.

Evapotranspiration (ET) by FAO-56 Penman-Monteith standard method is complex, especially for saline soils. Moreover, existing studies focus on the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning-enabled smart and precision irrigation water recommendation systems along with the ET estimation by limited parameters. The ETs for saline soils are also equally important for the reclamation of saline soils, which is ignored by the existing literature. The study proposed IoT and machine leaching-based architecture of context-aware monthly ETs estimations for saline soil reclamation with the effective leaching process. The IoT-enabled crop field contexts in terms of crop field temperature, soil salinity, and irrigation water salinity are used as input features to the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and ensembled LSTM models for monthly ETs predictions. The performance of the proposed solution is observed in terms of the accuracy of the machine learning models along with the comparison against the FAO-56 PM-based standard method. The implementation of the proposed solution reveals that the ensembled LSTM-based approach for ETs is more accurate as compared to the LSTM model with accuracies of 92 and 90% for the training and validation datasets, respectively. The predictions made by the ensembled LSTM are more in line with the FAO-56 PM-based method with a Pearson correlation of 0.916 as compared to LSTM models.

From the temporal perspective, water resource is related to precipitation, which varies with hydrometeorological events, while spatially, it is largely related to the land use or vegetation cover.

The input data for the model include climatic variables, soil properties, topography, and four periods of land use map. The runoff estimates of the SWAT were compared with the streamflow data from the National Data Bank of Surface Water. An elevated record of runoff of up to 30 Dam3 (cubic decameter) was observed in 1983 in the municipalities of Tangamandapio and Tangancicuaro, which was likely associated with forest clearing since the 1970s. A decrease of runoff to 10 Dam3 was also observed in 2000, likely reflecting the conservation practice of forest management.

Thus, accurate and timely information on wheat production can help mitigate food price fluctuations. Within the existing operational regional and global scale agricultural monitoring systems that provide information on global crop yield and area forecasts, there are still fundamental gaps: #1. Lack of quantitative Earth Observation (EO) derived crop information, #2. Lack of global but detailed (national or subnational level) and timely crop production forecasts and #3. Lack of information on forecast uncertainties. In this study we present the Agriculture Remotely-sensed Yield Algorithm (ARYA) an EO-based method, advancing the state of EO-data application and usage (addressing gap #1) to forecast wheat yield. The algorithm is based on the evolution of the Difference Vegetation Index (DVI) using MODIS data at 1 km resolution and the Growing Degree Days (GDD) from reanalysis data. Additionally, we explore how Land Surface Temperature (LST) can be included into the model and whether this parameter adds any value to the model performance when combined with the optical information. ARYA is implemented at the national and subnational level to forecast winter wheat yield in the main wheat exporting countries of US, Russia, Ukraine, France, Germany, Australia and Argentina from 2001 to 2019 (covering over 70% of wheat exports globally) in a timely manner by providing daily forecasts (addressing gap #2). The results show that ARYA provides yield estimations with RMSE's within 0.3 ± 0.1 t/ha at national level and 0.6 ± 0,1 t/ha at subnational level after Day Of the Year (DOY) 140 (mid May) in the Northern Hemisphere and DOY 280 (beginning of October) in the Southern Hemisphere. This means that ARYA can provide crop yield estimates of wheat yield with 5–15% error at national and 7–20% error at subnational level starting from 2 to 2.5 months prior to harvest. © 2021 The Author(s)","Agriculture; DVI; LST; MODIS; Wheat; Yield forecast","algorithm; crop production; crop yield; export; food market; forecasting method; MODIS; remote sensing; wheat",Article,Scopus

Accordingly, a great number of algorithms have been exploited for remote sensing image interpretation purposes. Thereinto, object recognition acts as an important ingredient to many applications. However, to achieve highly accurate object recognition is still challengeable caused by the orientation and size diversities, spatial distribution and density variations, shape and aspect ratio irregularities, occlusion and shadow impacts, as well as complex texture and surrounding environment changes. In this paper, a sparse anchoring guided high-resolution capsule network (SAHR-CapsNet) is proposed for geospatial object detection based on remote sensing images. First, formulated with the multibranch high-resolution capsule network architecture assisted by multiscale feature propagation and fusion, the SAHR-CapsNet can extract semantically strong and spatially accurate feature semantics at multiple scales. Second, integrated with the efficient capsule-based self-attention module, the SAHR-CapsNet functions promisingly to attend to target-specific spatial features and informative channel features. Finally, adopted with the capsule-based sparse anchoring network, the SAHR-CapsNet performs efficiently in generating a fixed number of lightweight, high-quality sparse region proposals. Quantitative assessments and comparative analyses on two challenging remote sensing image datasets demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the developed SAHR-CapsNet for geospatial object detection applications. © 2021 The Authors","Capsule attention; Capsule network; Object recognition; Region proposal; Remote sensing imagery; Sparse anchoring","algorithm; artificial neural network; GIS; pattern recognition; remote sensing; satellite imagery",Article,Scopus

This study applied the Soil and Water Assessment Tool and the threshold drainage area (TDA) technique to evaluate the impacts of watershed subdivision on hydrological simulations at a 5,913-km2 Arctic watershed, Målselv. The watershed was discretized according to four TDA scheme scales including 200, 2,000, 5,000, and 10,000 ha. The impacts of different TDA schemes on hydrological simulations in water balance components, snowmelt runoff, and stream-flow were investigated. The study revealed that the complexity of terrain and topographic attributes altered significantly in the coarse discretizations: (1) total stream length (47.2 to 74.6%); (2) average stream slope (68 to 83%); and (3) drainage density (24.2 to 51.5%). The spatial density of weather grid integration reduced from 5 to 33.33% in the coarse schemes. The annual mean potential evapo-transpiration, evapotranspiration, and lateral flow slightly decreased, while areal rainfall, surface runoff, and water yield slightly increased with the increases of TDAs. It was concluded that the fine TDAs produced finer and higher ranges of snowmelt runoff volume across the watershed. All TDAs had similar capacities to replicate the observed tendency of monthly mean streamflow hydrograph, except overestimated/underestimated peak flows. Spatial variation of streamflow was well analyzed in the fine schemes with high density of stream networks, while the coarse schemes simplified this. Watershed subdivisions affected model performances, in the way of decreasing the accuracy of monthly streamflow simulation, at 60% of investigated hydro-gauging stations (3/5 stations) and in the upstream. Furthermore, watershed subdivisions strongly affected the calibration process regarding the changes in sensitivity ranking of 18 calibrated model parameters and time it took to calibrate. © 2021 The Authors.","Arctic watershed Målselv; Hydrological simulations; Snowmelt runoff; SWAT; Threshold drainage area (TDA); Watershed subdivisions","Evapotranspiration; Rivers; Runoff; Snow melting systems; Stream flow; Arctic watershed malselv; Drainage area; Hydrological simulations; Norwegian Arctic; Snowmelt runoff; Spatial densities; SWAT; Threshold drainage area; Watershed subdivision; Weather inputs; Watersheds; drainage basin; hydrological modeling; quantitative analysis; runoff; snowmelt; soil and water assessment tool; spatial variation; watershed; weather; Arctic; Norway",Article,Scopus

For many of those applications, precise knowledge of the distribution of crop types is essential. Various machine and deep learning models have been used for automated crop classification using microwave remote sensing time series. However, the application of these approaches on a large spatial and temporal scale is barely investigated. In this study, the performance of two frequently used algorithms, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forest (RF), for crop classification based on Sentinel-1 time series and meteorological data on a large spatial and temporal scale is assessed. For data from Austria, the Netherlands, and France and the years 2015–2019, scenarios with different spatial and temporal scales were defined. To quantify the complexity of these scenarios, the Fisher Discriminant measurement F1 (FDR1) was used. The results demonstrate that both classifiers achieve similar results for simple classification tasks with low FDR1 values. With increasing FDR1 values, however, LSTM networks outperform RF. This suggests that the ability of LSTM networks to learn long-term dependencies and identify the relation between radar time series and meteorological data becomes increasingly important for more complex applications. Thus, the study underlines the importance of deep learning models, including LSTM networks, for large-scale applications. © 2021 by the authors.

First, ascertain the important variables that predict tomato yields from plant height (PH) and vegetation index (VI) maps. The maps were derived from images taken by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Second, examine the accuracy of predictions of tomato fresh shoot masses (SM), fruit weights (FW), and the number of fruits (FN) from multiple machine learning algorithms using selected variable sets. To realize our objective, ultra-high-resolution RGB and multispectral images were collected by a UAV on ten days in 2020’s tomato growing season. From these images, 756 total variables, including first- (e.g., average, standard deviation, skewness, range, and maximum) and second-order (e.g., gray-level co-occurrence matrix features and growth rates of PH and VIs) statistics for each plant, were extracted. Several selection algorithms (i.e., Boruta, DALEX, genetic algorithm, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and recursive feature elimination) were used to select the variable sets useful for predicting SM, FW, and FN. Random forests, ridge regressions, and support vector machines were used to predict the yield using the top five selected variable sets. Results: First-order statistics of PH and VIs collected during the early to mid-fruit formation periods, about one month prior to harvest, were important variables for predicting SM. Similar to the case for SM, variables collected approximately one month prior to harvest were important for predicting FW and FN. Furthermore, variables related to PH were unimportant for prediction. Compared with predictions obtained using only first-order statistics, those obtained using the second-order statistics of VIs were more accurate for FW and FN. The prediction accuracy of SM, FW, and FN by models constructed from all variables (rRMSE = 8.8–28.1%) was better than that from first-order statistics (rRMSE = 10.0–50.1%). Conclusions: In addition to basic statistics (e.g., average and standard deviation), we derived second-order statistics of PH and VIs at the plant level using the ultra-high resolution UAV images. Our findings indicated that our variable selection method reduced the number variables needed for tomato yield prediction, improving the efficiency of phenotypic data collection and assisting with the selection of high-yield lines within breeding programs. © 2021, The Author(s).","Gray-level co-occurrence matrix; Machine learning; Plant-level; Tomato yield prediction; Unmanned aerial vehicle",,Article,Scopus

A high-throughput phenotyping platform (HTPP) generates the data of the complete life cycle of a plant. However, the data are rarely used for yield prediction because of the lack of quality image analysis methods, yield data associated with HTPP, and the time-series analysis method for yield prediction. To overcome limitations, this study employed multiple deep learning (DL) networks to extract high-quality HTTP data, establish an association between HTTP data and the yield performance of crops, and select essential time intervals using machine learning (ML). The images of Arabidopsis were taken 12 times under environmentally controlled HTPP over 23 days after sowing (DAS). First, the features from images were extracted using DL network U-Net with SE-ResXt101 encoder and divided into early (15–21 DAS) and late (∼21–23 DAS) pre-flowering developmental stages using the physiological characteristics of the Arabidopsis plant. Second, the late pre-flowering stage at 23 DAS can be predicted using the ML algorithm XGBoost, based only on a portion of the early pre-flowering stage (17–21 DAS). This was confirmed using an additional biological experiment (P < 0.01). Finally, the projected area (PA) was estimated into fresh weight (FW), and the correlation coefficient between FW and predicted FW was calculated as 0.85. This was the first study that analyzed time-series data to predict the FW of related but different developmental stages and predict the PA. The results of this study were informative and enabled the understanding of the FW of Arabidopsis or yield of leafy plants and total biomass consumed in vertical farming. Moreover, this study highlighted the reduction of time-series data for examining interesting traits and future application of time-series analysis in various HTPPs.

The insufficient knowledge of the whole agricultural production system and conventional ways of irrigation have limited agricultural yields in the past. The remote sensing innovations recently implemented in agriculture have dramatically revolutionized production efficiency by offering unparalleled opportunities for convenient, versatile, and quick collection of land images to collect critical details on the crop’s conditions. These innovations have enabled automated data collection, simulation, and interpretation based on crop analytics facilitated by deep learning techniques. This paper aims to reveal the transformative patterns of old Chinese agrarian development and fruit production by focusing on the major crop production (from 1980 to 2050) taking into account various forms of data from fruit production (e.g., apples, bananas, citrus fruits, pears, and grapes). In this study, we used production data for different fruits grown in China to predict the future production of these fruits. The study employs deep neural networks to project future fruit production based on the statistics issued by China’s National Bureau of Statistics on the total fruit growth output for this period. The proposed method exhibits encouraging results with an accuracy of 95.56% calculating by accuracy formula based on fruit production variation. Authors further provide recommendations on the AGR-DL (agricultural deep learning) method being helpful for developing countries. The results suggest that the agricultural development in China is acceptable but demands more improvement and government needs to prioritize expanding the fruit production by establishing new strategies for cultivators to boost their performance. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we used a systematic quantitative approach to classify plant community types in the subtropical forests of Hubei Province (central China), and then quantified the relative contribution of drivers responsible for variation in species composition and diversity. We classified the subtropical forests in the study area into 12 community types. Of these, species diversity indices of three communities were significantly higher than those of others. In each community type, species richness, abundance, basal area and importance values of evergreen and deciduous species were different. In most community types, deciduous species richness was higher than that of evergreen species. Linear regression analysis showed that the dominant factors that affect species composition in each community type are elevation, slope, aspect, soil nitrogen content, and soil phosphorus content. Furthermore, structural equation modeling analysis showed that the majority of variance in species composition of plant communities can be explained by elevation, aspect, soil water content, litterfall, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus. Thus, the major factors that affect evergreen and deciduous species distribution across the 12 community types in subtropical evergreen-deciduous broadleaved mixed forests include elevation, slope and aspect, soil total nitrogen content, soil total phosphorus content, soil available nitrogen content and soil available phosphorus content. © 2021 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences","Detrended correspondence analysis; Environmental factors; Evergreen-deciduous broadleaved mixed forests; Northwestern of Hubei; Plant community; Two-way indicator species analysis",,Article,Scopus

This study investigates the use of Landsat NDVI sequences for estimating wheat yields in fields in Western Australia (WA). By fitting statistical crop growth curves, identifying the timing and intensity of phenological events, the best single integrated NDVI metric in any year was used to estimate yield. The hypotheses were that: (1) yield estimation could be improved by incorporating additional information about sowing date or break of season in statistical curve fitting for phenology detection; (2) the integrated NDVI metrics derived from phenology detection can estimate yield with greater accuracy than the observed NDVI values at one or two time points only. We tested the hypotheses using one field (~235 ha) in the WA grain belt for training and another field (~143 ha) for testing. Integrated NDVI metrics were obtained using: (1) traditional curve fitting (SPD); (2) curve fitting that incorporates sowing date information (+SD); and (3) curve fitting that incorporates rainfall-based break of season information (+BOS). Yield estimation accuracy using integrated NDVI metrics was further compared to the results using a scalable crop yield mapper (SCYM) model. We found that: (1) relationships between integrated NDVI metrics using the three curve fitting models and yield varied from year to year; (2) overall, +SD marginally improved yield estimation (r = 0.81, RMSE = 0.56 tonnes/ha compared to r = 0.80, RMSE = 0.61 tonnes/ha using SPD), but +BOS did not show obvious improvement (r = 0.80, RMSE = 0.60 tonnes/ha); (3) use of integrated NDVI metrics was more accurate than SCYM (r = 0.70, RMSE = 0.62 tonnes/ha) on average and had higher spatial and yearly consistency with actual yield than using SCYM model. We conclude that sequences of Landsat NDVI have the potential for estimation of wheat yield variation in fields in WA but they need to be combined with additional sources of data to distinguish different relationships between integrated NDVI metrics and yield in different years and locations. © 2021 by the authors.

It is therefore economically significant to specify the period as precisely as possible. The harvest maturity of silage corn is currently determined from the targeted sampling of plants cultivated over large areas. In this context, the paper presents an alternative, more detail-oriented approach for estimating the correct harvest time; the method focuses on the relationship between the ripeness data obtained via photogrammetry and the parameters produced by the chemical analysis of corn. The relevant imaging methodology utilizing a spectral camera-equipped unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) allows the user to acquire the spectral reflectance values and to compute the vegetation indices. Furthermore, the authors discuss the statistical data analysis centered on both the nutritional values found in the laboratory corn samples and on the information obtained from the multispectral images. This discussion is associated with a detailed insight into the computation of correlation coefficients. Statistically significant linear relationships between the vegetation indices, the normalized difference red edge index (NDRE) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in particular, and nutritional values such as dry matter, starch, and crude protein are evaluated to indicate different aspects of and paths toward predicting the optimum harvest time.

The regression models developed with six vegetation indices (green normalization difference vegetation index (GNDVI), normalization difference red-edge index (NDRE), chlorophyll index red edge (CIrededge), difference NIR/Green green difference vegetation index (GDVI), green-red NDVI (GRNDVI), and medium resolution imaging spectrometer terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI)), calculated from the spectral bands, were applied to single years (2018, 2019, and 2020) and multiple years (2018 + 2019, 2018 + 2020, 2019 + 2020, and all years). The regression models were cross-validated through mutual prediction against the vegetation indices in nonoverlapping years, and the prediction errors were evaluated via root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP). The ANN model was reproducible, with low and sustained prediction errors of 24.2 kg/1000 m2 ≤ RMSEP ≤ 59.1 kg/1000 m2 in rice yield and 0.14% ≤ RMSEP ≤ 0.28% in rice-protein content in all single-year and multiple-year analyses. When the importance of each vegetation index of the regression models was evaluated, only the ANN model showed the same ranking in the vegetation index of the first (MTCI in both rice yield and protein content) and second importance (CIrededge in rice yield and GRNDVI in rice-protein content). Overall, this means that the ANN model has the highest potential for developing a year-invariant model with stable RMSEP and consistent variable ranking. © 2021 by the authors.

The aim of this research was to explore machine learning use with hyperspectral datacubes over agricultural fields. Hyperspectral imagery was collected over a mature cotton crop, which had high spatial (~5.2 cm) and spectral (5 nm) resolution over the spectral range 475–925 nm that allowed discrimination of individual crop rows and field features as well as a continuous spectral range for calculating derivative spectra. The nominal reflectance and its derivatives clearly highlighted the different treatment blocks and were strongly related to N concentration in leaf and petiole samples, both in traditional vegetation indices (e.g., Vogelman 1, R2 = 0.8) and novel combinations of spectra (R2 = 0.85). The key hyperspectral bands identified were at the red-edge inflection point (695–715 nm). Satellite multispectral was compared against the UAV hyperspectral remote sensing’s performance by testing the ability of Sentinel MSI to predict N concentration using the bands in VIS-NIR spectral region. The Sentinel 2A Green band (B4; mid-point 559.8 nm) explained the same amount of variation in N as the hyperspectral data and more than the Sentinel Red Edge Point 1 (B5; mid-point 704.9 nm) with the lower 10 m resolution Green band reporting an R2 = 0.85, compared with the R2 = 0.78 of downscaled Sentinel Red Edge Point 1 at 5 m. The remaining Sentinel bands explained much lower variation (maximum was NIR at R2 = 0.48). Investigation of the red edge peak region in the first derivative showed strong promise with RIDAmid (R2 = 0.81) being the best index. The machine learning approach narrowed the range of bands required to investigate plant condition over this trial site, greatly improved processing time and reduced processing complexity. While Sentinel performed well in this comparison and would be useful in a broadacre crop production context, the impact of pixel boundaries relative to a region of interest and coarse spatial and temporal resolution impacts its utility in a research capacity. © 2021 by the authors.

However, many statistical prediction models using remote sensing data cannot extend to the regional scale without considering the regional climate. This paper first introduced the hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) method to solve maize-yield prediction problems over years and regions. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), calculated by the spectrum of the Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI), and meteorological data were introduced as input parameters in the maize-yield prediction model proposed in this paper. We built models using 100 samples from 10 areas, and used 101 other samples from 34 areas to evaluate the model’s performance in Jilin province. HLM provided higher accuracy with an adjusted determination coefficient equal to 0.75, root mean square error (RMSEV) equal to 0.94 t/ha, and normalized RMSEV equal to 9.79%. Results showed that the HLM approach outperformed linear regression (LR) and multiple LR (MLR) methods. The HLM method based on the Landsat 8 OLI NDVI and meteorological data could flexibly adjust in different regional climatic conditions. They had higher spatiotemporal expansibility than that of widely used yield estimation models (e.g., LR and MLR). This is helpful for the accurate management of maize fields. © 2021 by the authors.

Yet, on-board yield monitoring for sugarcane can be challenging. At the same time, orbital images have been widely used for indirect crop yield estimation for many crops like wheat, corn, and rice, but not for sugarcane. Due to this, the objective of this study is to explore the potential of multi-temporal imagery data as an alternative for sugarcane yield mapping. The study was based on developing predictive sugarcane yield models integrating time-series orbital imaging and a machine learning technique. A commercial sugarcane site was selected, and Sentinel-2 images were acquired from the beginning of the ratoon sprouting until harvesting of two consecutive cropping seasons. The predictive yield models RF (Random forest) and MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) were developed using orbital images and yield maps generated by a commercial sensor-system on harvesting. Original yield data were filtered and interpolated with the same spatial resolution of the orbital images. The entire dataset was divided into training and testing datasets. Spectral bands, especially the near-infrared at tillering crop stage showed greater contribution to predicting sugarcane yield than the use of derived spectral vegetation indices. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) obtained for the RF regression based on multiple spectral bands was 4.63 Mg ha−1 with an R2 of 0.70 for the testing dataset.

Hence, the purpose of the present study was to assess plant species composition and distribution in a freshwater wetland Mekeiman Marsh, Northeastern Algeria and to analyze the influence of environmental factors on local plant species. To explore the distribution of plant species in this Marsh and analyze their associations with edaphic soil factors, the mapping and types of plant species in this area were analyzed by MapInfo and principal component analysis (PCA) ordination. For this purpose, four stations were chosen according to a stratified sampling method and phytosociological surveys were carried out in 12 plots, which were sampled using the Braun-Blanquet method. Multivariate analyses were used to determine the relationship between plant species distribution and edaphic factors. The R i386 (version 4.0.3) software was used for data analysis. We have identified 48 plant species belonging to 21 families. Results of biological types in the study area revealed the dominance of hemicryptophytes and therophytes, which indicates the presence of therophytization in this Marsh. Spatial distribution maps showed that plant species were divided into two categories viz. sparse and scattered plants according to the humidity gradient. The most important edaphic factors associated with plant species in Mekeiman Marsh were Sodium, Phosphorus, active limestone, Magnesium, clay, organic matter, C/N and Azot. By combining mapping and influence of edaphic factors on the structure and distribution of plant species in this wetland, it was known that the plant assemblages of this Marsh make disproportionately important contributions to wetland-level diversity. © 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

It has been used in numerous fields such as numerical optimization, engineering problems, and machine learning. The different variants of GWO have been developed in the last five years for solving optimization problems in diverse fields. Like other metaheuristic algorithms, GWO also suffers from local optima and slow convergence problems, which result in degraded performance. An adequate equilibrium among exploration and exploitation is a key factor to the success of metaheuristic algorithms, especially for optimization tasks. In this paper, a new variant of GWO, called inertia motivated GWO (IMGWO), was proposed. The aim of IMGWO was to establish better balance between exploration and exploitation. Traditionally, artificial neural network (ANN) with backpropagation (BP) depends on initial values and in turn, attains poor convergence. The metaheuristic approaches are better alternatives instead of BP. The proposed IMGWO was used to train ANN to prove its competency in terms of prediction. The proposed IMGWO-ANN was applied for medical diagnosis tasks. Several benchmark medical datasets including heart disease, breast cancer, hepatitis, and Parkinson's diseases were used for assessing the performance of IMGWO-ANN. The performance measures were described in terms of mean squared errors, classification accuracies, sensitivities, specificities, the area under the curve, and receiver operating characteristic curve. It was found that IMGWO outperformed three popular metaheuristic approaches including GWO, genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization. Results confirmed the potency of IMGWO as a viable learning technique for an ANN. © 2021.

Agroforestry may improve food security by increasing soil fertility, crop production, and livelihoods. Agroforestry simulation models can be useful for predicting the effects of tree management on crop growth when designing modifications to these systems. The Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) agroforestry tree-proxy model was used to simulate the response of maize yield to N fertilizer applications and tree pruning practices in the parkland agroforestry system in the Central Rift Valley, Ethiopia. The model was parameterized and tested using data collected from an experiment conducted under trees and in crop-only plots during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons. The treatments contained three levels of tree pruning (100% pruned, 50% pruned, and unpruned) as the main plots, and N fertilizers were applied to maize at two rates (9 or 78 kg N ha−1) as sub-plots. Maize yield predictions across two years in response to tree pruning and N applications under tree canopies were satisfactorily simulated (NSE = 0.72, RSR = 0.51, R2 = 0.8). Virtual experiments for different rates of N, pruning levels, sowing dates, and cultivars suggest that maize yield could be improved by applying fertilizers (particularly on crop-only plots) and by at least 50% pruning of trees. Optimal maize yield can be obtained at a higher rate of fertilization under trees than away from them due to better water relations, and there is scope for improving the sowing date and cultivar. Across a 34-year range of recent climate, small increases in yields due to optimum N-fertilizing and pruning were probably limited by nutrient limitations other than N, but the highest yields were consistently in the 2–4 m zone under trees. These virtual experiments helped to form hypotheses regarding fertilizers, pruning, and the effects of trees on soil that warrant further field evaluation. © 2020 by the authors.

The purpose of this study was to reveal the dependence of fresh grapes taste scores (GS) and wine taste scores (WS) on the origin of the varieties and weather conditions of the harvest year in the northern zone of industrial viticulture in Russia. The material used in the study were taste scores of 232 grape varieties from the Don Ampelographic Collection (47°250 N 40°030 E) 1981-2019. The correlation analysis, ANOVA, and regression were used. It was shown that GS negatively correlated with productivity, and WS with the berry mass of variety. In recent decades, GS have increased in groups of varieties of various interspecies origin, and WS have not changed. Regression models revealed that the reason for GS improvement was in the growth of average temperature above 15 _C, while WS varied depending on the sum of precipitation for the period with temperatures above 20 °C, which did not have a reliable trend. Together with data on the growth of grape yield and sugar content, the results indicate that observed climate warming is favorable for grapevine cultivation in the northern zone of industrial viticulture in Russia. © 2020 by the authors.","Ampelographic collection; Climate change; Fresh grapes taste scores; Regression model; Wine taste scores",,Article,Scopus

In this paper, we present a high-throughput phenotyping approach for the estimation of Above-Ground Biomass Dynamics (AGBD) using an unmanned aerial system. Multispectral imagery was acquired and processed by using the proposed segmentation method called GFKuts, that optimally labels the plot canopy based on a Gaussian mixture model, a Montecarlo based K-means, and a guided image filtering. Accurate plot segmentation results enabled the extraction of several canopy features associated with biomass yield. Machine learning algorithms were trained to estimate the AGBD according to the growth stages of the crop and the physiological response of two rice genotypes under lowland and upland production systems. Results report AGBD estimation correlations with an average of r = 0.95 and R2 = 0.91 according to the experimental data. We compared our segmentation method against a traditional technique based on clustering.

Given the importance of soil moisture (SM) for crop development, the objective of this study was to investigate the use of passive microwave-derived estimates of surface SM obtained by the SM Ocean Salinity Mission (SMOS) satellite for forecasting canola yields across the Canadian Prairies within Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's (AAFC) Canadian Crop Yield Forecaster (CCYF) model. Weekly SMOS SM observations were combined with climate variables and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) platform and used as an input for forecasting canola yields at the township-scale across the Canadian Prairies from 2010 to 2016. Top predictors were identified, and regression models were built using a robust least angle regression (RLARS) and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) scheme. SM was found to provide a better descriptor of canola stress than the more widely utilized NDVI, being selected as a predictor in 74.2 % of developed ecodistrict models over the 7-year period, compared to just 41.2 % for NDVI. The difference between model R2 values (i.e. R2diff) when SMOS SM predictors were included and excluded from the forecast, respectively, revealed varying degrees of model improvements; however, the majority of ecodistricts under study (53.3 %) showed improved model fit (i.e. R2diff &gt; 0) with observed canola yields when SMOS SM indices were included as potential predictors within the CCYF. Overall, greater improvements in the CCYF performance were observed in Manitoba and Saskatchewan where meteorological stations are more sparsely distributed. However, performance for both sets of model inputs was relatively low with R2 values ranging from 0 to 0.74 (mean = 0.13) and from 0 to 0.52 (mean = 0.12) across the study area both when SM was included and excluded from the model, respectively. These findings suggest that while SMOS SM observations may provide a more effective indicator of canola yields, the CCYF's performance at the township-scale, where interannual yield variability is often quite high, is limited by the short temporal satellite record. © 2020","Canola; CCYF; Passive microwave; SMOS; Soil moisture; Yield forecast","AVHRR; crop yield; forecasting method; NDVI; satellite imagery; soil moisture; Canada; Manitoba; Prairie Provinces; Saskatchewan; Brassica napus var. napus; Indicator indicator",Article,Scopus

Our study focuses on quantifying the uncertainty due to ICV in projections of crop productions in Canada. We utilize climate scenarios from two large ensembles (LEs, CanESM2-LE and CanRCM4-LE with 25 members each) as inputs to the crop models in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer. We simulate crop yields for canola, maize and spring wheat under the future climates of four global warming levels. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the projected crop production across the LE members is used to quantify the uncertainty related to ICV and this is compared with the CVs generated using the 20 GCMs in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Crop production in Canada could increase with global warming, e.g. spring wheat production could increase by up to 21% at the warming level of 3.0 °C. The projections often produce larger uncertainty associated with the GCMs than from ICV at all warming levels above 2.0 °C. The results from an asymptotic test for the equality of CVs show a significant difference in CVs of projections of canola production between CanESM2-LE/CanRCM4-LE and CMIP5 for the warming level of 3.0 °C. However, the test results do not indicate a significant difference among the ensembles at all four warming levels for maize and spring wheat. The uncertainty due to ICV is often comparable to that associated with GCMs at the warming level of 1.5 °C, e.g. a CV of 6.0 and 6.4% for CanESM2-LE and CanRCM4-LE and 6.6% for CMIP5 in the projections of spring wheat production. We conclude there is a need to account for uncertainty related to ICV in projections of Canadian crop production, especially at lower warming levels. © 2020 Canadian Crown Copyright.

Our approach is applied to state-scale maize yield and meteorological data for the US Corn Belt from 1981 to 2014 as an exemplar, but would be readily transferable to other crops, locations and spatial scales. Experimentation with a number of models shows that maize growth rates can be characterised by a two-dimensional Gaussian function of temperature and precipitation with monthly contributions accumulated over the growing period. This approach accounts for non-linear growth responses to the individual meteorological variables, and allows for interactions between them. Our models correctly identify that temperature and precipitation have the largest impact on yield in the six months prior to the harvest, in agreement with the typical growing season for US maize (April to September). Maximal growth rates occur for monthly mean temperature 18 °C–19 °C, corresponding to a daily maximum temperature of 24 °C– 25 °C (in broad agreement with previous work) and monthly total precipitation 115 mm. Our approach also provides a self-consistent way of investigating climate change impacts on current US maize varieties in the absence of adaptation measures. Keeping precipitation and growing area fixed, a temperature increase of 2 °C, relative to 1981–2014, results in the mean yield decreasing by 8%, while the yield variance increases by a factor of around 3. We thus provide a flexible, data-driven framework for exploring the impacts of natural climate variability and climate change on globally significant crops based on their observed behaviour. In concert with other approaches, this can help inform the development of adaptation strategies that will ensure food security under a changing climate. © 2020 The Author(s).

Future stream-flow projections were modelled for three climate ensembles under three different representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for two land-use categories. New hydrological insights for the region: Initial results revealed that forest and topography played major role in water loss, whereas evapotranspiration and surface runoff were the dominant modulating processes.

Improving our understanding of their impacts on crop yields is crucial to enhance the resilience of the global food system. This study analyses, to our knowledge for the first time, the impacts of climate extremes on yield anomalies of maize, soybeans, rice and spring wheat at the global scale using sub-national yield data and applying a machine-learning algorithm. We find that growing season climate factors - including mean climate as well as climate extremes - explain 20%-49% of the variance of yield anomalies (the range describes the differences between crop types), with 18%-43% of the explained variance attributable to climate extremes, depending on crop type. Temperature-related extremes show a stronger association with yield anomalies than precipitation-related factors, while irrigation partly mitigates negative effects of high temperature extremes. We developed a composite indicator to identify hotspot regions that are critical for global production and particularly susceptible to the effects of climate extremes. These regions include North America for maize, spring wheat and soy production, Asia in the case of maize and rice production as well as Europe for spring wheat production. Our study highlights the importance of considering climate extremes for agricultural predictions and adaptation planning and provides an overview of critical regions that are most susceptible to variations in growing season climate and climate extremes. © 2019 The Author(s).

For large-scale watershed modeling, weather data are either generated by using interpolation methods or derived from assimilated datasets. In the present study, we compared model performances of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), as driven by interpolation weather data, and NASA North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase Two (NLDAS2) weather dataset in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). The SWAT model fed with different weather datasets were used to simulate monthly stream flow at 11 United States Geological Survey (USGS) monitoring stations in the UMRB. Model performances were evaluated based on three metrics: coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS), and percent bias (Pbias). The results show that, after calibration, the SWAT model compared well at all monitoring stations for monthly stream flow using different weather datasets indicating that the SWAT model can adequately produce long-term water yield in UMRB. The results also show that using NLDAS2 weather dataset can improve SWAT prediction of monthly stream flow with less prediction uncertainty in the UMRB. We concluded that NLDAS2 dataset could be used by the SWAT model for large-scale watersheds like UMRB as a surrogate of the interpolation weather data. Further analyses results show that NLDAS2 daily solar radiation data was about 2.5 MJ m-2 higher than the interpolation data. As such, the SWAT model driven by NLDAS2 dataset tended to underestimate stream flow in the UMRB due to the overestimation in evapotranspiration in uncalibrated conditions. Thus, the implication of overestimated solar radiation by NLDAS2 dataset should be considered before using NLDAS2 dataset to drive the hydrological model. © 2019 by the authors.","Reanalysis climate data; Stream flow; SWAT; Watershed modeling","Interpolation; Large dataset; Meteorology; NASA; Rivers; Solar radiation; Stream flow; Watersheds; Climate data; Coefficient of determination; Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient; North american land data assimilation systems; Soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; United states geological surveys; Watershed modeling; Digital storage; data set; evapotranspiration; hydrological modeling; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; water yield; watershed; Mississippi River; United States",Article,Scopus

Currently, a number of machine learning methods would resort to using averaged spectral information over wide bandwidths resulting in loss of crucial information available in those contiguous bands. The loss of information could mean a drop in the discriminative power when it comes to land cover classes with comparable spectral responses, as in the case of cultivated fields versus fallow lands. In this study, we proposed and tested three new optimized novel algorithms based on Moment Distance Index (MDI) that characterizes the whole shape of the spectral curve. The image classification tests conducted on two publicly available hyperspectral data sets (AVIRIS 1992 Indian Pine and HYDICE Washington DC Mall images) showed the robustness of the optimized algorithms in terms of classification accuracy. We achieved an overall accuracy of 98% and 99% for AVIRIS and HYDICE, respectively. The optimized indices were also time efficient as it avoided the process of band dimension reduction, such as those implemented by several well-known classifiers. Our results showed the potential of optimized shape indices, specifically the Moment Distance Ratio Right/Left (MDRRL), to discriminate between types of tillage (corn-min and corn-notill) and between grass/pasture and grass/trees, tree and grass under object-based random forest approach. © 2019 Salas, Subburayalu.

The use of remote sensing to measure crop production at high latitudes is hindered by intrinsic challenges, such as a low sun elevation angle and a coastal climate with high humidity, which influences the spectral signatures of the sampled vegetation. We used a portable spectrometer (ASD FieldSpec 3) to assess spectra of grass crops and found that when applying multivariate models to the hyperspectral datasets, results show significant predictability of yields (R2 &gt; 0.55, root mean squared error (RMSE) &lt; 180), even when captured under sub-optimal conditions. These results are consistent both in the full spectral range of the spectrometer (350-2500 nm) and in the 350-900 nm spectral range, which is a region more robust against air moisture. Sentinel-2A simulations resulted in moderately robust models that could be used in qualitative assessments of field productivity. In addition, simulation of the upcoming hyperspectral EnMap satellite bands showed its potential applicability to measure yields in northern latitudes both in the full spectral range of the satellite (420-2450 nm) with similar performance as the Sentinel-2A satellite and in the 420-900 nm range with a comparable reliability to the portable spectrometer. The combination of EnMap and Sentinel-2A to detect fields with low productivity and portable spectrometers to identify the fields or specific regions of fields with the lowest production can help optimize the management of fodder production in high latitudes. © 2019 by the authors.","Arctic agriculture; Crop; EnMap; Grass; Partial least squares (PLS); Remote sensing; Yield","Crops; Cultivation; Least squares approximations; Mean square error; Productivity; Satellites; Spectrometers; EnMap; Grass; Low growth temperature; Multivariate models; Partial least square (PLS); Qualitative assessments; Root mean squared errors; Yield; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

In this study, a high-resolution portable spectral sensor was used to investigate the feasibility of detecting multi-diseased tomato leaves in different stages, including early or asymptomatic stages. One healthy leaf and three diseased tomato leaves (late blight, target and bacterial spots) were defined into four stages (healthy, asymptomatic, early stage and late stage) and collected from a field. Fifty-seven spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) were calculated in accordance with methods published in previous studies and established in this study. Principal component analysis was conducted to evaluate SVIs. Results revealed six principal components (PCs) whose eigenvalues were greater than 1. SVIs with weight coefficients ranking from 1 to 30 in each selected PC were applied to a K-nearest neighbour for classification. Amongst the examined leaves, the healthy ones had the highest accuracy (100%) and the lowest error rate (0) because of their uniform tissues.

However, preprocessing of critical data such as soils information can be laborious and time-consuming. The objective of this work was to preprocess the Soil Landscapes of Canada (SLC) database to offer a country-level soils dataset in a format ready to be used in SWAT simulations. A twolevel screening process was used to identify critical information required by SWAT and to remove records with information that could not be calculated or estimated. Out of the 14 063 unique soil records in the SLC, 11 838 records with complete information were included in the dataset presented here. Important variables for SWAT simulations that are not reported in the SLC database (e.g., hydrologic soils groups (HSGs) and erodibility factor (K)) were calculated from information contained within the SLC database. These calculations, in fact, represent a major contribution to enabling the present dataset to be used for hydrological simulations in Canada using SWAT and other comparable models. Analysis of those variables indicated that 21.3 %, 24.6 %, 39.0 %, and 15.1% of the soil records in Canada belong to HSGs 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. This suggests that almost twothirds of the soil records have a high (i.e., HSG 4) or relatively high (i.e., HSG 3) runoff generation potential. A spatial analysis indicated that 20.0 %, 26.8 %, 36.7 %, and 16.5% of soil records belonged to HSG 1, HSG 2, HSG 3, and HSG 4, respectively. Erosion potential, which is inherently linked to the erodibility factor (K), was associated with runoff potential in important agricultural areas such as southern Ontario and Nova Scotia. However, contrary to initial expectations, low or moderate erosion potential was found in areas with high runoff potential, such as regions in southern Manitoba (e.g., Red River Valley) and British Columbia (e.g., Peace River watershed).

Native land cover based on soil characteristics was used to simulate pre-development loading regimes using The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Loading targets were calculated for each major element of a pre-development loading regime. Simulated pre-development conditions were associated with increased retention and decreased export of sediment and nutrients when compared to observed developed conditions. Differences between simulated pre-development and observed developed maximum daily yields (loads per unit area) of suspended sediment (SS), total phosphorus (TP), and total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) ranged from 35.7 to 59.6 Mg km-2 (SS); 23.3 to 52.5 kg km-2 (TP); and, 113.2 to 200.8 kg km-2 (TIN), respectively. Average annual maximum daily load was less during simulated pre-development conditions when compared to observed developed conditions by ranges of 1307 to 6452 Mg day-1 (SS), 0.8 to 5.4 kg day-1 (TP), and 4.9 to 26.9 kg day-1 (TIN), respectively. Hydrologic modeling results indicated that the differences in annual maximum daily load were causally linked to land use and land cover influence on sediment and nutrient loading. The differences between SWAT simulated pre-development and observed contemporary loading regimes from this study point to a need for practical loading targets that support contemporary management and integrated flow and pollutant loading regimes. © 2018 by the authors.","Ecohydrology; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Pre-settlement; Sediment; SWAT",,Article,Scopus

To get a better understanding of the distribution of plants in wetlands and analyze their associations with environmental soil factors, the structure and types of plant communities in the eastern shore area of Lake Taihu were analyzed by two-way indicator species analysis and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) ordination. The spatial distribution patterns of vegetation and the main factors affecting the distributions were investigated.Outcomes: Sixty-six sampling sites were selected to obtain vegetation species and soil environmental factor data. Results showed that 22 species from the 66 sites could be divided into seven communities: I: Arundo donax; II: A. donax + Phragmites australis; III: Zizania latifolia + Typha orientalis; IV: P. australis + Alternanthera philoxeroides + Polygonum hydropiper; V: P. australis; VI: P. australis + Humulus scandens; and VII: Erigeron acer + Ipomoea batatas + Rumex acetosa. Plant species and soil factors in the CCA analysis showed that I. batatas, E. acer, Chenopodium album, Polygonum lapathifolium, and Acalypha australis were mainly affected by pH, whereas Echinochloa crus-galli, Setaria viridis, and H. scandens were mainly affected by soil total phosphorus. Mentha canadensis and A. donax were mainly affected by soil conductivity, A. philoxeroides was mainly affected by soil organic matter and, Z. latifolia, Metaplexis japonica and P. hydropiper were mainly affected by available phosphorus.Conclusion:These results indicated that different plants adapted to different soil environmental factors and provided basic information on the diversity of Lake Taihu wetland vegetation. . © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

Both existing grasslands and marginal croplands have been suggested as targets for conversion to switchgrass, but the resulting production potentials and hydrologic impacts are not clear. The objectives of this study were to model switchgrass production on existing grasslands (scenario-I) and on marginal croplands that have severe to very severe limitations for crop production (scenario-II) and to evaluate the effects on evapotranspiration (ET) and streamflow. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to the 1063 km2 Skeleton Creek watershed in north-central Oklahoma, a watershed dominated by grasslands (35%) and winter wheat cropland (47%). The simulated average annual yield (2002–2011) for rainfed Alamo switchgrass for both scenarios was 12 Mg ha-1. Yield varied spatially under scenario-I from 6.1 to 15.3 Mg ha-1, while under scenario-II the range was from 8.2 to 13.8 Mg ha-1. Comparison of average annual ET and streamflow between the baseline simulation (existing land use) and scenario-I showed that scenario-I had 5.6% (37 mm) higher average annual ET and 27.7% lower streamflow, representing a 40.7 million m3 yr-1 streamflow reduction. Compared to the baseline, scenario-II had only 0.5% higher ET and 3.2% lower streamflow, but some monthly impacts were larger. In this watershed, the water yield reduction per ton of biomass production (i.e. hydrologic cost-effectiveness ratio) was more than 5X greater under scenario-I than under scenario-II. These results suggest that, from a hydrologic perspective, it may be preferable to convert marginal cropland to switchgrass production rather than converting existing grasslands. © 2017, Public Library of Science.

This attribute is particularly important as the region also plays a key role in the production of bioenergy feedstock. This study focuses on potential change in streamflow, sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus due to climate change and land management practices in the South Fork Iowa River (SFIR) watershed, Iowa. The watershed is covered primarily with annual crops (corn and soybeans). With cropland conversion to switchgrass, stover harvest, and implementation of best management practices (BMPs) (such as establishing riparian buffers and applying cover crops), significant reductions in nutrients were observed in the SFIR watershed under historical climate and future climate scenarios. Under a historical climate scenario, suspended sediment (SS), total nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) at the outlet point of the SFIR watershed could decrease by up to 56.7%, 32.0%, and 16.5%, respectively, compared with current land use when a portion of the cropland is converted to switchgrass and a cover crop is in place. Climate change could cause increases of 9.7% in SS, 4.1% in N, and 7.2% in P compared to current land use. Under future climate scenarios, nutrients including SS, N, and P were reduced through land management and practices and BMPs by up to 54.0% (SS), 30.4% (N), and 7.1% (P). Water footprint analysis further revealed changes in green water that are highly dependent on land management scenarios. The study highlights the versatile approaches in landscape management that are available to address climate change adaptation and acknowledged the complex nature of different perspectives in water sustainability. Further study involving implementing landscape design and management by using long-term monitoring data from field to watershed is necessary to verify the findings and move toward watershed-specific regional programs for climate adaptation. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","bioenergy production; BMPs; climate change; cover crops; land use and management; riparian buffer; switchgrass","Biomass; Crops; Forestry; Land use; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Plants (botany); Suspended sediments; Water quality; Watersheds; Bioenergy productions; BMPs; Cover crops; Land use and managements; Riparian buffers; Switchgrass; Climate change; adaptive management; basin management; biomass; buffer zone; climate change; cover crop; crop production; grass; land management; nitrogen; phosphorus; streamflow; suspended sediment; sustainability; water footprint; water quality; Corn Belt; Iowa; South Fork Iowa River; United States; Glycine max; Panicum virgatum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Agricultural researchers use ground-based observations to identify, select and develop crops with favourable genotypes and phenotypes; however, the ability to collect rapid, high quality and high volume phenotypic data in open fields is restricting this. This study develops and assesses a method for deriving crop height and growth rate rapidly from multi-temporal, very high spatial resolution (1 cm/pixel), 3D digital surface models of crop field trials produced via Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry using aerial imagery collected through repeated campaigns flying an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with a mounted Red Green Blue (RGB) camera. We compare UAV SfM modelled crop heights to those derived from terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) and to the standard field measurement of crop height conducted using a 2 m rule. The most accurate UAV-derived surface model and the TLS both achieve a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.03 m compared to the existing manual 2 m rule method. The optimised UAV method was then applied to the growing season of a winter wheat field phenotyping experiment containing 25 different varieties grown in 27 m2 plots and subject to four different nitrogen fertiliser treatments. Accuracy assessments at different stages of crop growth produced consistently low RMSE values (0.07, 0.02 and 0.03 m for May, June and July, respectively), enabling crop growth rate to be derived from differencing of the multi-temporal surface models. We find growth rates range from -13 mm/day to 17 mm/day. Our results clearly display the impact of variable nitrogen fertiliser rates on crop growth. Digital surface models produced provide a novel spatial mapping of crop height variation both at the field scale and also within individual plots. This study proves UAV based SfM has the potential to become a new standard for high-throughput phenotyping of in-field crop heights. © 2016 by the authors.","Crop height; Phenotyping; Photogrammetry; Structure from Motion; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","Aerial photography; Agriculture; Crashworthiness; Fertilizers; Growth rate; Mean square error; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Photogrammetry; Remote sensing; Surveying instruments; Throughput; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Crop height; Ground-based observations; High-throughput phenotyping; Phenotyping; Root mean squared errors; Structure from motion; Terrestrial laser scanners; Very high spatial resolutions; Crops",Article,Scopus

For the application of dynamic mapping of rice growth parameters, leaf area index (LAI) and aboveground biomass (AGB) were considered as plant growth indicators. The HJ-1 CCD-derived vegetation indices (VIs) showed robust relationships with rice growth parameters. Cumulative VIs showed strong performance for the estimation of total dry AGB. The cross-validation coefficient of determination (RCV2) was increased by using two machine learning methods, i.e., a back propagation neural network (BPNN) and a support vector machine (SVM) compared with traditional regression equations of LAI retrieval. The LAI inversion accuracy was further improved by dividing the rice growth period into before and after heading stages.

Projected climate is subject to uncertainties related to climate change scenarios and Global Circulation Models (GCMs). This paper discusses the consequences of climate change on discharge. Historical climatic and gauging data were collected from different stations within a watershed. Bias correction was performed on GCMs temperature and precipitation data. After successful development of the hydrological modeling system (SWAT) for the basin, streamflow was simulated for three future periods (2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100) and compared with the baseline data (1981-2010) to explore the changes in different flow indicators such as mean flow, low flow, median flow, high flow, flow duration curves, temporal shift in peaks, and temporal shifts in center-of-volume dates. From the results obtained, an overall increase in mean annual flow was projected in the basin under both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. Winter and spring showed a noticeable increase in streamflow, while summer and autumn showed a decrease in streamflow. High flows were predicted to increase, but median flow was projected to decrease in the future under both scenarios. Flow duration curves showed that the probability of occurrence of high flow is likely to be more in the future. It was also noted that peaks were predicted to shift from May to July in the future, and the center-of-volume date of the annual flow may vary from ??11 to 23 days in the basin, under both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. As a whole, the Mangla basin will face more floods and less droughts in the future due to the projected increase in high and low flows, decrease in median flows and greater temporal and magnitudinal variations in peak flows. These outcomes suggest that it is important to consider the influence of climate change on water resources to frame appropriate guidelines for planning and management. © 2016 by the authors.","Bias correction; Climate change; Discharge; GCMs; Precipitation; RCPs; SWAT; Temperature","Climate models; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Precipitation (chemical); Reservoirs (water); Stream flow; Temperature; Water resources; Bias correction; Climate change scenarios; GCMs; Global circulation model; Hydrological modeling; Probability of occurrence; RCPs; SWAT; Climate change; air temperature; baseline conditions; climate change; climate modeling; environmental assessment; historical record; hydrological modeling; inflow; precipitation (climatology); profitability; reservoir; streamflow; temporal variation; uncertainty analysis; water resource; Azad Kashmir; Mangla Dam; Pakistan",Article,Scopus

Passive optical remote sensing and active microwave remote sensing both play an important role in the monitoring of forest biomass. However, optical spectral reflectance is saturated in relatively dense vegetation areas, and microwave backscattering is significantly influenced by the underlying soil when the vegetation coverage is low. Both of these conditions decrease the estimation accuracy of forest biomass. A new optical and microwave integrated vegetation index (VI) was proposed based on observations from both field experiments and satellite (Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and RADARSAT-2) data. According to the difference in interaction between the multispectral reflectance and microwave backscattering signatures with biomass, the combined VI (COVI) was designed using the weighted optical optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) and microwave horizontally transmitted and vertically received signal (HV) to overcome the disadvantages of both data types. The performance of the COVI was evaluated by comparison with those of the sole optical data, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, and the simple combination of independent optical and SAR variables. The most accurate performance was obtained by the models based on the COVI and optical and microwave optimal variables excluding OSAVI and HV, in combination with a random forest algorithm and the largest number of reference samples. The results also revealed that the predictive accuracy depended highly on the statistical method and the number of sample units. The validation indicated that this integrated method of determining the new VI is a good synergistic way to combine both optical and microwave information for the accurate estimation of forest biomass. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Biomass estimation; Combined vegetation index; Landsat 8 OLI; Prediction method; RADARSAT-2; Sample size","Backscattering; Biomass; Carbon; Decision trees; Electromagnetic wave backscattering; Forestry; Microwaves; Reflection; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Biomass estimation; LANDSAT; Prediction methods; Radarsat-2; Sample sizes; Vegetation index; Space-based radar",Article,Scopus

These parameters can be derived from MODIS with high accuracy, but their temporal resolution is too low to obtain high-temporal-resolution SSR retrievals. In order to obtain hourly cloud parameters, an artificial neural network (ANN) is applied in this study to directly construct a functional relationship between MODIS cloud products and Multifunctional Transport Satellite (MTSAT) geostationary satellite signals. In addition, an efficient parameterization model for SSR retrieval is introduced and, when driven with MODIS atmospheric and land products, its root mean square error (RMSE) is about 100 W m-2 for 44 Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) stations. Once the estimated cloud parameters and other information (such as aerosol, precipitable water, ozone) are input to the model, we can derive SSR at high spatiotemporal resolution. The retrieved SSR is first evaluated against hourly radiation data at three experimental stations in the Haihe River basin of China. The mean bias error (MBE) and RMSE in hourly SSR estimate are 12.0 W m-2 (or 3.5 %) and 98.5 W m-2 (or 28.9 %), respectively.

The MBEs are 9.8 W m-2 (or 5.4 %); the RMSEs in daily and monthly mean SSR estimates are 34.2 W m-2 (or 19.1 %) and 22.1 W m-2 (or 12.3 %), respectively. The accuracy is comparable to or even higher than two other radiation products (GLASS and ISCCP-FD), and the present method is more computationally efficient and can produce hourly SSR data at a spatial resolution of 5 km. © Author(s) 2016.",,"accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; cloud; error analysis; MODIS; MTSAT; solar radiation; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Hai Basin",Article,Scopus

Development, control and maintenance of these strategies are highly dependent on temporally and spatially continuous information on crop status at the field scale. This paper introduces the application of a process-based, coupled hydro-agroecological model (PROMET) for the simulation of temporally and spatially dynamic crop growth on agriculturally managed fields. By assimilating optical remote sensing data into the model, the simulation of spatial crop dynamics is improved to a point where site-specific farming measures can be supported. Radiative transfer modeling (SLC) is used to provide maps of leaf area index from Earth Observation (EO). These maps are used in an assimilation scheme that selects closest matches between EO and PROMET ensemble runs. Validation is provided for winter wheat (years 2004, 2010 and 2011). Field samples validate the temporal dynamics of the simulations (avg. R2 = 0.93) and > 700 ha of calibrated combine harvester data are used for accuracy assessment of the spatial yield simulations (avg. RMSE = 1.15 t·ha-1).

However, many of them do not reproduce the small-scale spatial variability of precipitation exhibited by the observed meteorological data, which is an important factor for predicting hydrologic response to climatic forcing. In this study a new downscaling technique (Bias-Correction and Stochastic Analog method; BCSA) was developed to produce stochastic realizations of bias-corrected daily GCM precipitation fields that preserve both the spatial autocorrelation structure of observed daily precipitation sequences and the observed temporal frequency distribution of daily rainfall over space. We used the BCSA method to downscale 4 different daily GCM precipitation predictions from 1961 to 1999 over the state of Florida, and compared the skill of the method to results obtained with the commonly used bias-correction and spatial disaggregation (BCSD) approach, a modified version of BCSD which reverses the order of spatial disaggregation and bias-correction (SDBC), and the bias-correction and constructed analog (BCCA) method. Spatial and temporal statistics, transition probabilities, wet/dry spell lengths, spatial correlation indices, and variograms for wet (June through September) and dry (October through May) seasons were calculated for each method. Results showed that (1) BCCA underestimated mean daily precipitation for both wet and dry seasons while the BCSD, SDBC and BCSA methods accurately reproduced these characteristics, (2) the BCSD and BCCA methods underestimated temporal variability of daily precipitation and thus did not reproduce daily precipitation standard deviations, transition probabilities or wet/dry spell lengths as well as the SDBC and BCSA methods, and (3) the BCSD, BCCA and SDBC methods underestimated spatial variability in daily precipitation resulting in underprediction of spatial variance and overprediction of spatial correlation, whereas the new stochastic technique (BCSA) replicated observed spatial statistics for both the wet and dry seasons. This study underscores the need to carefully select a downscaling method that reproduces all precipitation characteristics important for the hydrologic system under consideration if local hydrologic impacts of climate variability and change are going to be reasonably predicted. For low-relief, rainfall-dominated watersheds, where reproducing small-scale spatiotemporal precipitation variability is important, the BCSA method is recommended for use over the BCSD, BCCA, or SDBC methods. © Author(s) 2013.

However, it is still challenging to model crop yields based on remotely sensed data due to the variation in radiation use efficiency (RUE) across crop types and the effects of spatial heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a production efficiency model-based method to estimate corn and soybean yields with MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data by explicitly handling the following two issues: (1) field-measured RUE values for corn and soybean are applied to relatively pure pixels instead of the biome-wide RUE value prescribed in the MODIS vegetation productivity product (MOD17); and (2) contributions to productivity from vegetation other than crops in mixed pixels are deducted at the level of MODIS resolution. Our estimated yields statistically correlate with the national survey data for rainfed counties in the Midwestern US with low errors for both corn (R2 = 0.77; RMSE = 0.89 MT/ha) and soybeans (R2 = 0.66; RMSE = 0.38 MT/ha). Because the proposed algorithm does not require any retrospective analysis that constructs empirical relationships between the reported yields and remotely sensed data, it could monitor crop yields over large areas. © 2013 by the authors.","Crop yield; Modis gpp; Radiation use efficiency; Remote sensing; Spatial heterogeneity","Crops; Efficiency; Pixels; Productivity; Radiation effects; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Vegetation; Crop yield; Empirical relationships; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer datum; Modis gpp; Radiation use efficiency; Remote sensing techniques; Spatial heterogeneity; Vegetation productivity; Data handling",Article,Scopus

Toward this end, we analyze and intercompare the performance of a set of four regional climate models (RCMs) driven by two global climate models (GCMs) (for a total of 4 different GCM-RCM pairs) in simulating present day and future climate over West Africa. The results show that the individual RCM members as well as their ensemble employing the same driving fields exhibit different biases and show mixed results in terms of outperforming the GCM simulation of seasonal temperature and precipitation, indicating a substantial sensitivity of RCMs to regional and local processes. These biases are reduced and GCM simulations improved upon by averaging all four RCM simulations, suggesting that multi-model RCM ensembles based on different driving GCMs help to compensate systematic errors from both the nested and the driving models. This confirms the importance of the multi-model approach for improving robustness of climate change projections. Illustrative examples of such ensemble reveal that the western Sahel undergoes substantial drying in future climate projections mostly due to a decrease in peak monsoon rainfall. Copyright © 2012 I.

A larger problem is that the level of use of digital technology varies from person to person. Therefore, a digital divide may even exist among elderly individuals. Considering the recent accelerating digital transformation in our society, it is highly likely that elderly individuals are experiencing many difficulties in their daily life. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly address and manage these difficulties. Research objective This study aims to predict the digital divide in the elderly population and provide essential insights into managing it. To this end, predictive analysis is performed using public data and machine learning techniques. Methods and materials This study used data from the ‘2020 Report on Digital Information Divide Survey’ published by the Korea National Information Society Agency. In establishing the prediction model, various independent variables were used. Ten variables with high importance for predicting the digital divide were identified and used as critical, independent variables to increase the convenience of analyzing the model. The data were divided into 70% for training and 30% for testing. The model was trained on the training set, and the model’s predictive accuracy was analyzed on the test set. The prediction accuracy was analyzed using logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). A convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to further improve the accuracy. In addition, the importance of variables was analyzed using data from 2019 before the COVID-19 outbreak, and the results were compared with the results from 2020. Results The study results showed that the variables with high importance in the 2020 data predicting the digital divide of elderly individuals were the demographic perspective, internet usage perspective, self-efficacy perspective, and social connectedness perspective. These variables, as well as the social support perspective, were highly important in 2019. The highest prediction accuracy was achieved using the CNN-based model (accuracy: 80.4%), followed by the XGBoost model (accuracy: 79%) and LR model (accuracy: 78.3%). The lowest accuracy (accuracy: 72.6%) was obtained using the DT model. Discussion The results of this analysis suggest that support that can strengthen the practical connection of elderly individuals through digital devices is becoming more critical than ever in a situation where digital transformation is accelerating in various fields. In addition, it is necessary to comprehensively use classification algorithms from various academic fields when constructing a classification model to obtain higher prediction accuracy. Conclusion The academic significance of this study is that the CNN, which is often employed in image and video processing, was extended and applied to a social science field using structured data to improve the accuracy of the prediction model. The practical significance of this study is that the prediction models and the analytical methodologies proposed in this article can be applied to classify elderly people affected by the digital divide, and the trained models can be used to predict the people of younger generations who may be affected by the digital divide. Another practical significance of this study is that, as a method for managing individuals who are affected by a digital divide, the self-efficacy perspective about acquiring and using ICTs and the socially connected perspective are suggested in addition to the demographic perspective and the internet usage perspective. © 2023 Park, Feng.

With the advent of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and advances in deep learning techniques, it has become possible to identify and classify weeds from crops at desired spatial and temporal resolution. In this research, a faster region based convolutional neural network was implemented for the automatic weed identification and classification using a mixed crop farmland as a case study. A DJI phantom 4 UAV was used to simultaneously collect about 254 image pairs of the study site. The images were annotated before transferring them into google colaboratory where they were trained over five epochs; 10,000, 20,000, 100,000, 200,000, and 242,000 with the aim of detecting the point when the model flattens out in the process of automatically identifying and classifying the weeds. The neural network identified and classified five classes which are; sugarcane, spinach, banana, pepper, and weeds. Finally, the accuracy of the automatic weed classification was evaluated with the aid of the recorded loss function and confusion matrix, and the result shows that the implemented model gave a classification accuracy of 52.5%, weed precision of 50%, weed recall of 7.7% and F1 score of 71.6% at 10,000 epochs, classification accuracy of 67.8%, weed precision of 67%, weed recall of 52.4% and a F1 score of 85.9% at 20,000 epochs, classification accuracy of 97.2%, weed precision of 96.2%, weed recall of 97.5% and a F1 score of 99% at 100,000 epochs, classification accuracy of 98.3%, weed precision of 98.1%, weed recall of 99.1% and a F1 score of 99.4% at 200,000 epochs, and classification accuracy of 97%, weed precision of 95%, weed recall of 99% and a F1 score of 99% at 242,000 epochs. It was observed that the model's performance improves significantly with increase in the number of epochs but got saturated at 242,000 epochs.

However, precise and continuous spectral signatures, important for large-area crop growth monitoring and early prediction of yield production with cutting-edge algorithms, can be only provided via hyperspectral imaging. Therefore, this article used new-generation Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) images to classify the main crop types (hybrid corn, soybean, sunflower, and winter wheat) in Mezőhegyes (southeastern Hungary). A Wavelet-attention convolutional neural network (WA-CNN), random forest and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms were utilized to automatically map the crops over the agricultural lands. The best accuracy was achieved with the WA-CNN, a feature-based deep learning algorithm and a combination of two images with overall accuracy (OA) value of 97.89% and the user's accuracy producer's accuracy was from 97% to 99%. To obtain this, first, factor analysis was introduced to decrease the size of the hyperspectral image data cube. A wavelet transform was applied to extract important features and combined with the spectral attention mechanism CNN to gain higher accuracy in mapping crop types. Followed by SVM algorithm reported OA of 87.79%, with the producer's and user's accuracies of its classes ranging from 79.62% to 96.48% and from 79.63% to 95.73%, respectively.

This experiment was conducted in the main cotton-producing area of Xinjiang, China. A hyperspectrometer was used to monitor the canopy spectral reflectance of cotton at different stages of growth. The results showed that the leaf area index (LAI) increased with the increase in the amount of nitrogen fertilizer added during the early full boll stage and decreased with the increase in nitrogen fertilization in the full and late boll stages. Insufficient or excessive fertilization led to a decrease in the LAI. The visible light band indicated that the canopy spectral reflectance decreased, and the amount of fertilizer increased in all the growth stages. The near-infrared band revealed that the canopy spectral reflectance increased with the amount of nitrogen applied during the bud stage, early boll stage, and the most vigorous period of boll growth. During the flowering period, the spectral reflectance followed the order N3 > N4 > N2 > N1 > N0. During the entire growth period of cotton, the values of the cotton LAI predicted using the ratio vegetation index (RVI) model were found to best fit the measured values. The LAI monitoring models of cotton in each growth stage were different. The TVI model is the best in the bud and early boll stages. The NDVI model is the best in the flowering stage, and the DVI model is the best in the full boll stage. This study provides a basis to accurately monitor the LAI in each growth period of cotton. © 2022 by the authors.","cotton canopy; growth period; leaf area index; monitoring model; sensitive band",,Article,Scopus

Therefore, timely monitoring of soybean breeding line maturity is crucial for soybean harvesting management and yield measurement. Currently, the widely used deep learning models focus more on extracting deep image features, whereas shallow image feature information is ignored. In this study, we designed a new convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, called DS-SoybeanNet, to improve the performance of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based soybean maturity information monitoring. DS-SoybeanNet can extract and utilize both shallow and deep image features. We used a high-definition digital camera on board a UAV to collect high-definition soybean canopy digital images. A total of 2662 soybean canopy digital images were obtained from two soybean breeding fields (fields F1 and F2). We compared the soybean maturity classification accuracies of (i) conventional machine learning methods (support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)), (ii) current deep learning methods (InceptionResNetV2, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50), and (iii) our proposed DS-SoybeanNet method.

The training stage was undertaken using 7458 plants aged three, six, and twelve months, reaching stability in the iterations between 3000 and 4000 it. Plant detection within twelve months was not possible due to crown unification. A counting accuracy of 86.5% was achieved with plants at three months of development. The plants’ characteristics at this age may have influenced the reduction in accuracy, and the low uniformity of the canopy may have made it challenging for the neural network to define a pattern.

Over the last few years, global potato production has been increasing. This growth has created many opportunities for developing a wide range of value-added products from these crops. However, this requires monitoring the quality components of the tubers, such as moisture content, starch content, and soluble solid content. In particular, moisture content is one of the key quality parameters important for ensuring quality control throughout the supply chain and processing for consumer consumption. Ideally, moisture content would be estimated at the field level; however, current methods used by the industry to assess moisture content are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and destructive. Hence, the purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of hyperspectral imaging to quantify the moisture content of unpeeled potatoes before they were subsequently stored and processed. Hyperspectral images are collected from 47 intact potato tubers, with partial least squares regression (PLSR) models developed to predict moisture content from these spectra. The models showed predictive abilities for moisture content with acceptable ratios of prediction to deviation (RPDs) when considering the complete wavelength range (R2 = 0.53, RPD = 1.46, root mean square error (RMSE) = 5.04%) or the β-coefficient wavelength selection technique (R2 = 0.53, RPD = 1.47, RMSE = 5.02%). Furthermore, the prediction ability increased by more than 10% when the model wavelength was narrowed down to 733–970 nm. This study demonstrates the potential of using hyperspectral imaging for the quality assessment of intact, unpeeled potatoes, although further work is required to improve the model quality and implement this approach using remote sensing imagery. © 2022 by the authors.","hyperspectral imaging; infield assessment; moisture content; post-harvest handling; potato",,Article,Scopus

To overcome this problem, the vegetation indices retrieved by remote sensing, can be used to get information about the hail damage. The aim of this work is the detection of medium-low damages (i.e., between 10 and 30% of the gross saleable production) using the much-used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in comparison with alternative vegetation indices (i.e., ARVI, MCARI, SAVI, MSAVI, MSAVI2) and their change from pre-event to post-event in five hailstorms in Lombardy in 2018. Seventy-four overlapping scenes (10% cloud cover) were collected from the Sentinel-2 in the spring-summer period of 2018 in the Brescia district (Lombardy). An unsupervised classification was carried out to automatically identify the maize fields (grain and silage), testing the change detection approach by searching for damage by hail and strong wind in the Lombardy plain of Brescia. A database of 125 field surveys (average size 4 Ha) after the hailstorm collected from the insurance service allowed for the selection of the dates on which the event occurred and provided a proxy of the extent of the damage (in % of the decrease of the yield). Hail and strong wind damages ranged from 5 to 70%, and they were used for comparison with the satellite image change detection. The differences in the vegetation indices obtained by Sentinel 2 before and after the hailstorm and the insurance assessments of damage after the events were compared to assess the degree of concordance. The modified soil-adjusted vegetation index outperformed other vegetation indices in detecting hail-related damages with the highest accuracy (73.3%).

Developments in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms and sensor technology help to estimate yields efficiency. Previous studies have been based on less cultivars (&lt;10) and ideal experimental environments, it is not available in practical production. Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate the yield parameters of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) under lodging conditions using RGB information. In this study, 17 time point data throughout the soybean growing season in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, China, were collected, and the vegetation index, texture information, canopy cover, and crop height were obtained by UAV-image processing. After that, partial least squares regression (PLSR), logistic regression (Logistic), random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine regression (SVM), and deep learning neural network (DNN) were used to estimate the yield parameters. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) The most suitable time point to estimate the yield was flowering stage (48 days), which was when most of the soybean cultivars flowered. (2) The multiple data fusion improved the accuracy of estimating the yield parameters, and the texture information has a high potential to contribute to the estimation of yields, and (3) The DNN model showed the best accuracy of training (R2=0.66 rRMSE=32.62%) and validation (R2=0.50, rRMSE=43.71%) datasets. In conclusion, these results provide insights into both best estimate period selection and early yield estimation under lodging condition when using remote sensing.

Strategies to advance the production of coffee grains involve better understanding its spatial variability along fields. The objectives of this study were to adjust yield-prediction models based on a time series of satellite images and high-density yield data, and to indicate the best phenological stage of coffee crop to obtain satellite images for this purpose. The study was conducted during three seasons (2019, 2020 and 2021) in a commercial area (10.24 ha), located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Data were obtained using a harvester equipped with a yield monitor that measures the volume of coffee harvested with 3.0 m of spatial resolution. Satellite images from the PlanetScope (PS) platform were used. Random forest (RF) regression and multiple linear regression (MLR) models were fitted to different datasets composed of coffee yield and time series of satellite-image data ((1) Spectral bands—red, green, blue and near-infrared; (2) Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); or (3) Green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI)). Whether using RF or MLR, the spectral bands, NDVI and GNDVI reproduced the spatial variability of yield maps one year before harvest. This information can be of critical importance for management decisions across the season. For yield quantification, the RF model using spectral bands showed the best results, reaching R2 of 0.93 for the validation set, and the lowest errors of prediction. The most appropriate phenological stage for satellite-image data acquisition was the dormancy phase, observed during the dry season months of July and August. These findings can help to monitor the spatial and temporal variability of the fields and guide management practices based on the premises of precision agriculture. © 2022 by the authors.","GNDVI; NDVI; precision agriculture; remote sensing",,Article,Scopus

In pistachio trees, as in other woody crops, the volume of the canopy is a key factor that affects the pistachio crop load, water requirements, and quality. However, canopy/crown monitoring is time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it is traditionally carried out by measuring tree dimensions in the field. Therefore, methods for rapid tree canopy characterization are needed for providing accurate information that can be used for management decisions. The present study focuses on developing a new, fast, and low-cost technique, based on two main steps, for estimating the canopy volume in pistachio trees. The first step is based on adequately planning the UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) flight according to light conditions and segmenting the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) imagery using machine learning methods. The second step is based on measuring vegetation planar area and ground shadows using two methodological approaches: a pixel-based classification approach and an OBIA (object-based image analysis) approach. The results show statistically significant linear relationships (p &lt; 0.05) between the ground-truth data and the estimated volume of pistachio tree crowns, with R2 &gt; 0.8 (pixel-based classification) and R2 &gt; 0.9 (OBIA). The proposed methodologies show potential benefits for accurately monitoring the vegetation of the trees. Moreover, the method is compatible with other remote sensing techniques, usually performed at solar noon, so UAV operators can plan a flexible working day. Further research is needed to verify whether these results can be extrapolated to other woody crops. © 2022 by the authors.","aerial; drone; image analysis; leaf area; machine learning; pistachio; precision agriculture; random forest; spatial variability","Agricultural robots; Antennas; Crops; Forestry; Image analysis; Machine learning; Pixels; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Vegetation mapping; Aerial vehicle; Image-analysis; Leaf area; Machine-learning; Pistachio; Precision Agriculture; Random forests; Red green blues; Spatial variability; Woody crop; Drones",Article,Scopus

Use of plant-derived microorganisms is a promising strategy to alleviate salt stress. In a previous study, the endophytic strain Bacillus altitudinis WR10 isolated from wheat roots showed high salt resistance. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of WR10 in improving the salt tolerance of wheat and its potential mechanisms using a hydroponic test. Under salt stress, WR10 inoculation significantly increased the lengths and dry weights of the roots and shoots, indicating that WR10 improves wheat salt tolerance at the seedling stage. WR10 inoculation significantly reduced Na+ accumulation and enhanced K+, P, and Ca2+ uptake in salt-stressed plants, which can be attributed to the upregulated gene expression of H+-ATPase as well as the P-solubilizing and biofilm-producing characteristics of WR10. At the transcriptional level, L-ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione (GSH) synthetase related to GSH biosynthesis, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis genes (CYP73A, 4CL, and CAD) were significantly upregulated, whereas those of GSH metabolism genes (glutathione S-transferase and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase) were significantly downregulated in WR10-applied wheat roots under salt stress. These changes increased the APX activity and GSH levels and resulted in a decrease in hydrogen peroxide levels. Additionally, a decrease in proline content was observed in WR10-inoculated plants under salt stress because of WR10-induced upregulation of proline dehydrogenase gene expression. These results provide supporting evidence that WR10 improves wheat salt tolerance via more than one mechanism and open a window of opportunity for WR10 application in salinized soil.

As a result, numerous estimation approaches for mineral resources have been developed. It was investigated in this study by using five machine learning algorithms to estimate highly skewed gold data in the vein-type at the Quartz Ridge region, including Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Ensemble (DTE), Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN), and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN). The accuracy of MLA is compared to that of geostatistical approaches, such as ordinary and indicator kriging. Significant improvements were made during data preprocessing and splitting, ensuring that MLA was estimated accurately. The data were preprocessed with two normalization methods (z-score and logarithmic) to enhance network training performance and minimize substantial differences in the dataset’s variable ranges on predictions. The samples were divided into two equal subsets using an integrated data segmentation approach based on the Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA). The ranking shows that the GPR with logarithmic normalization is the most efficient method for estimating gold grade, far outperforming kriging techniques. In this study, the key to producing a successful mineral estimate is more than just the technique. It also has to do with how the data are processed and split. © 2022 by the authors.","data segmentation; geostatistics; machine learning algorithms MLA–Marine Predators Algorithm MPA; vein-type deposit; z-score normalization–logarithmic normalizing",,Article,Scopus

Unfortunately, this type of application is characterized by datasets with a very limited number of samples (typically one sample per year). In general, statistical inference uses three datasets: the training dataset to optimize the model parameters, the validation dataset to select the best model, and the testing dataset to evaluate the model generalization ability. Splitting the overall database into three datasets is often impossible in crop yield modelling due to the limited number of samples. The leave-one-out cross-validation method, or simply leave one out (LOO), is often used to assess model performance or to select among competing models when the sample size is small. However, the model choice is typically made using only the testing dataset, which can be misleading by favouring unnecessarily complex models. The nested cross-validation approach was introduced in machine learning to avoid this problem by truly utilizing three datasets even with limited databases. In this study, we propose one particular implementation of the nested cross-validation, called the nested leave-two-out cross-validation method or simply the leave two out (LTO), to choose the best model with an optimal model selection (using the validation dataset) and estimate the true model quality (using the testing dataset). Two applications are considered: robusta coffee in Cu M'gar (Dak Lak, Vietnam) and grain maize over 96 French departments. In both cases, LOO is misleading by choosing models that are too complex; LTO indicates that simpler models actually perform better when a reliable generalization test is considered. The simple models obtained using the LTO approach have improved yield anomaly forecasting skills in both study crops. This LTO approach can also be used in seasonal forecasting applications. We suggest that the LTO method should become a standard procedure for statistical crop modelling.

Multimodel simulation results provided by the Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison (GGCMI) facilitate the evaluation of the grain production situation in China. With census crop yield data, the performance of nine global gridded crop models (GGCMs) in China was evaluated, and the yield gaps of four crops (maize, rice, soybean, and wheat) were estimated. The results showed that GGCMs better simulated maize yields than those of other crops in the northeast, north, northwest, east, and center. GEPIC (CLM-CROP) performed best in simulating maize (wheat) yield in the north, east, and northwest (southwest and south), due to reasonable parameter (cultivar and phenology parameters) settings. Because the rice phenology parameters were calibrated against phenological observation networks and a simple nitrogen limitation index was introduced, ORCHIDEE-CROP performed well in rice yield simulation and soybean yield simulation (center and southwest). Among four crops, wheat has the largest yield gap (7.3-14.1%), in which the poor soil of northwest (14.1%) exposes wheat to relatively high nutritional stress.

Numerous experiments have been conducted to assess the performance of CA under various local conditions, and meta-analysis has become a standard approach in agricultural sector for analysing and summarizing the experimental data. Meta-analysis provides valuable synthetic information based on mean effect size estimation. However, summarizing large amounts of information by way of a single mean effect value is not always satisfactory, especially when considering agricultural practices. Indeed, their impacts on crop yields are often non-linear, and vary widely depending on a number of factors, including soil properties and local climate conditions. To address this issue, here we present a machine learning approach to produce data-driven global maps describing the spatial distribution of the productivity of CA versus conventional tillage (CT). Our objective is to evaluate and compare several machine-learning models for their ability in estimating the productivity of CA systems, and to analyse uncertainty in the model outputs. We consider different usages, including classification, point regression and quantile regression. Our approach covers the comparison of 12 different machine learning algorithms, model training, tuning with cross-validation, testing, and global projection of results. The performances of these algorithms are compared based on a recent global dataset including more than 4,000 pairs of crop yield data for CA vs. CT. We show that random forest has the best performance in classification and regression, while quantile regression forest performs better than quantile neural networks in quantile regression. The best algorithms are used to map crop productivity of CA vs. CT at the global scale, and results reveal that the performance of CA vs. CT is characterized by a strong spatial variability, and that the probability of yield gain with CA is highly dependent on geographical locations. This result demonstrates that our approach is much more informative than simply presenting average effect sizes produced by standard meta-analyses, and paves the way for such probabilistic, spatially-explicit approaches in many other fields of research.

Previous published works have looked at statistical and machine learning methods to forecast the demand of agro-food such as ARIMA and SVM methods. However, ordinary least squares (OLS) and neural network (NN) methods have shown better results in modelling time series data. For that reason, the primary objective of this study is to model and forecast the consumption per capita (PCC) of several selected fresh agro-food commodities in Malaysia using the OLS and NN methods. The secondary objectives of the paper include investigating the performance of OLS against NNs with three different topologies, discussing the correlation between Malaysia GDP per capita and the agro-food commodity PCC, and finally assessing whether the PCC data are increasing over time or decreasing over time and whether the trend in either direction is statistically significant by using the Mann-Kendall statistical test. Based on the results of the agro-food consumption per capita (PCC) forecasting, several critical agro-food commodities are also identified in this work. The material of the study consists of the per capita consumption of thirty-three (33) agro-food items that can be categorized into rice, livestock, vegetables, fisheries, and fruits, total gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and the total population of Malaysia between 2010 and 2017. Based on the results obtained, the neural network (NNT1) model was found to produce the lowest total MSE of 17.95, for all 33 fresh agro-food investigated in this study. Several agro-food commodities have been identified as having significant positive (e.g., rice, spinach, cabbage, celery cabbage, eggplant, cucumber, poultry, lamb, squid, tuna, star fruit, jackfruit, durian, sweet corn, and coconut) or negative (e.g., pork, mackerel, papaya, guava, mangosteen, pineapple, banana, rambutan, and watermelon) trends using the Mann-Kendall trend test. This study also demonstrated that the production of critical agro-food commodities (e.g., rice, chili, cabbage, celery cabbage, poultry (chicken/duck), beef, lamb, crab, mango, and coconut) should be improved to ensure self-sufficiency ratios (SSRs) of more than 100% to accommodate the increased projected consumption in Malaysia by the year 2025. This paper concludes that neural network methods produce better prediction, and future works include forecasting agro-food demand based on other independent variables such as weather conditions, disease outbreak, and stock market trends. There is a need to explore further the capability of ensemble models or hybrid models based on deep learning methods using multi-source data, as these have been shown to improve the performance of the base model. With these ensemble models combined with multi-source data, a more comprehensive analysis of the PCC can be obtained. © 2022 Rayner Alfred et al.",,"Economics; Financial markets; Food supply; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Machine learning; Meats; Plants (botany); Shellfish; Time series; Agro foods; Food commodity; Gross domestic products; Malaysia; Neural network method; Ordinary least squares; Per capita; Percapita consumption; Performance; Square networks; Fruits",Article,Scopus

In the marrow of human bones, leukaemia is developed and is responsible for blood cell generation with leukocytes and WBC, and if any cell gets blasted, then it may become a cause of death. Therefore, the diagnosis of leukaemia in its early stages helps greatly in the treatment along with saving human lives. Subsequently, in terms of detection, image segmentation techniques play a vital role, and they turn out to be the important image processing steps for the extraction of feature patterns from the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) type of blood cancer. Moreover, the image segmentation technique focuses on the division of cells by segmenting a microscopic image into background and cancer blood cell nucleus, which is well-known as the Region Of Interest (ROI). As a result, in this article, we attempt to build a segmentation technique capable of solving blood cell nucleus segmentation issues using four distinct scenarios, including K-means, FCM (Fuzzy Cmeans), K-means with FFA (Firefly Algorithm), and FCM with FFA. Also, we determine the most effective method of blood cell nucleus segmentation, which we subsequently use for the Leukaemia classification model. Finally, using the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) as a classifier, we developed a leukaemia cancer classification model from the microscopic images. The proposed system's classification accuracy is tested using the CNN to test the model on the ALL-IDB dataset and equate it to the current state of the art. In terms of experimental analysis, we observed that the accuracy of the model is near to 99%, and it is far better than other existing models that are designed to segment and classify the types of leukaemia cancer in terms of ALL. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

The two-to-two model with the attention module achieved the best prediction accuracy for yield (R2 = 0:833) and GPC (R2 = 0:846). The temporal distribution of feature importance was visualized based on the attention feature values. Although the temporal patterns of structural traits and spectral traits were inconsistent, the overall importance of both structural traits and spectral traits at the postanthesis stage was more important than that at the preanthesis stage. This study provides new insights into the simultaneous prediction of yield and GPC using deep learning from time-series proximal sensing, which may contribute to the accurate and efficient predictions of agricultural production.

Artificial neural network (ANN) has advantage to not require priori assumptions about the relationships between inputs and the output allowing great flexibility to handle different types of complex non-additive effects, such as dominance and epistasis. Despite this advantage, the biological interpretability of ANNs is still limited. The aim of this research was to estimate the heritability and markers effects for two traits in Coffea canephora using an additive-dominance architecture ANN and to compare it with genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP). The data used consists of 51 clones of C. canephora varietal Conilon, 32 of varietal group Robusta and 82 intervarietal hybrids. From this, 165 phenotyped individuals were genotyped for 14,387 SNPs. Due to the high computational cost of ANNs, we used Bagging decision tree to reduce the dimensionality of the data, selecting the markers that accumulated 70% of the total importance. An ANN with three hidden layers was run, each varying from 1 to 40 neurons summing 64,000 neural networks. The network architectures with the best predictive ability were selected. The best architectures were composed by 4, 15, and 33 neurons in the first, second and third hidden layers, respectively, for yield, and by 13, 20, and 24 neurons, respectively for rust resistance. The predictive ability was greater when using ANN with three hidden layers than using one hidden layer and GBLUP, with 0.72 and 0.88 for yield and coffee leaf rust resistance, respectively. The concordance rate (CR) of the 10% larger markers effects among the methods varied between 10% and 13.8%, for additive effects and between 5.4% and 11.9% for dominance effects. The narrow-sense (h2 a) and dominance-only (h2 d) heritability estimates were 0.25 and 0.06, respectively, for yield, and 0.67 and 0.03, respectively for rust resistance. The ANN was able to estimate the heritabilities from an additive-dominance genomic architectures and the ANN with three hidden layers obtained best predictive ability when compared with those obtained from GBLUP and ANN with one hidden layer. © 2022 Public Library of Science.

We have proposed an algorithm and developed a system for obtaining a map of irrigation for maize in low latency mode. The system can be installed on a center pivot irrigation and consists of 8 IP cameras connected to a DVR connected to a laptop. The algorithm consists of three stages. Image preprocessing stage - applying an integrated excess green and excess red difference (ExGR) index. The classification stage is the application of the method that we choose depending on the system's operating conditions. At the final stage, a neural network trained using the Resilient Propagation method is used, which determines the rate of watering of plants in the current sector of the location of the sprinkler. The selected methods of pretreatment and classification made it possible to achieve an accuracy of plant identification up to 93%, growth stages - up to 92% (with unconsolidated maize sowing and good lighting). System performance up to 100 plants in one second, which exceeds the performance of similar systems. The neural network showed an accuracy of 92% on the training set and 87% on the test set. Dynamic analysis of spatial and temporal variability leads to an increase in productivity and efficiency of water use.

The new model has a similar model structure to the existing probability distributed rainfall runoff models (PDM), such as HyMOD. However, the model utilizes a new distribution function for soil water storage capacity, which leads to the SCS (Soil Conservation Service) curve number (CN) method when the initial soil water storage is set to zero. Therefore, the developed model is a unification of the PDM and CN methods and is called the PDM–CN model in this paper. Besides runoff modeling, the calculation of daily evaporation in the model is also dependent on the distribution function, since the spatial variability of soil water storage affects the catchment-scale evaporation. The generated runoff is partitioned into direct runoff and groundwater recharge, which are then routed through quick and slow storage tanks, respectively. Total discharge is the summation of quick flow from the quick storage tank and base flow from the slow storage tank. The new model with 5 parameters is applied to 92 catchments for simulating daily streamflow and evaporation and compared with AWMB, SACRAMENTO, and SIMHYD models. The performance of the model is slightly better than HyMOD but is not better compared with the 14-parameter model (SACRAMENTO) in the calibration, and does not perform as well in the validation period as the 7-parameter model (SIMHYD) in some areas, based on the NSE values. The linkage between the PDM–CN model and long-term water balance model is also presented, and a two-parameter mean annual water balance equation is derived from the proposed PDM–CN model. © 2022 by the authors.

The YOLOv4 model was used for rice ear quick detection of rice images captured by a UAV. The Kriging interpolation algorithm was used in ArcGIS to make rice density prescription maps. Mature rice images collected by a UAV were marked manually and used to build the training and testing datasets. The resolution of the images was 300 × 300 pixels. The batch size was 2, and the initial learning rate was 0.01, and the mean average precision (mAP) of the best trained model was 98.84%. Exceptionally, the network ability to detect rice in different health states was also studied with a mAP of 95.42% in the no infection rice images set, 98.84% in the mild infection rice images set, 94.35% in the moderate infection rice images set, and 93.36% in the severe infection rice images set.

In response, the agroforestry technology intercropping of Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.)) and Maize (Zea mays L.) was developed to complement conventional soil fertility management technologies. However, diversified information on the profitability of Gliricidia‐Maize intercropping system in dryland areas is scanty. Using data from the Gliricidia and maize models of the Next Generation version of the Agriculture Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM), this study estimates the profitability of the Gliricidia‐Maize system relative to an unfertilized sole maize system. Results show significant heterogeneity in profitability indicators both in absolute and relative economic terms. Aggregated over a 20‐year cycle, Gliricidia‐Maize intercropping exhibited a higher Net Present Value (NPV = Tsh 19,238,798.43) and Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR = 4.27) than the unfertilized sole maize system. The NPV and BCR of the latter were Tsh 10,934,669.90 and 3.59, respectively. Moreover, the returns to labour per person day in the Gliricidia‐Maize system was 1.5 times those of the unfertilized sole maize system. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the profitability of the Gliricidia‐Maize system is more negatively affected by the decrease in output prices than the increase in input prices. A 30% decrease in the former leads to a decrease in NPV and BCR by 38% and 30%, respectively. Despite the higher initial costs of the agroforestry establishment, the 30% increase in input prices affects more disproportionally unfertilized sole maize than the Gliricidia‐Maize system in absolute economic terms, i.e., 11.1% versus 8.8% decrease in NPV. In relative economic terms, an equal magnitude of change in input prices exerts the same effect on the unfertilized sole maize and the Gliricidia‐maize systems. This result implies that the monetary benefits accrued after the first year of agroforestry establishment offset the initial investment costs. The Gliricidia‐Maize intercropping technology therefore is profitable with time, and it can contribute to increased household income and food security. Helping farmers to overcome initial investment costs and manage agroforestry technologies well to generate additional benefits is critical for the successful scaling of the Gliricidia‐ Maize intercropping technology in dryland areas of Dodoma, Tanzania. : © 2021 by the authors.

Our objectives were to investigate the relationship between yield-related indices of winter wheat and the related climatic variables (selected using variance inflation factors) at the 20 sites of Xinjiang, China over 1981–2017. The background of climate and yield changes was analyzed from temporal and spatial respects. The number of independent climatic variables was selected with the variance inflation factor method to remove the multicollinear feature. The Pearson correlation was conducted between the first difference values of climatic variables and yield-related indices of winter wheat (namely plant height, growth period duration, 1000-kernel weight, kernel number per ear, biomass and yield) to find the key climatic variables that impacted winter wheat growth and yields. The multi-variate linear and nonlinear functions were established step by step using the selected key climatic variables. The best function was determined for each site (significant for p < 0.05). From the results, there were general wetter and warmer trends of the climatic variables. Corre-spondingly, shortened winter wheat phenology and increased growth and yields were observed for most sites. Still, the climatic trends had mixed effects on winter wheat yields. The effects of precip-itation, mean air temperature and relative humidity on plant height and growth period duration agreed well. Different sites had different major climatic drivers for winter wheat growth or yields, and the best functions of growth and yields could be linearly or nonlinearly, mostly described by multi-variate functions. The winter wheat growth or yield indices were also found to be closely connected with the soil water content status at the eight sites. The relationship between winter wheat growth or yield and climate provided useful references for forecasting crop production and for projecting the impact of future climate changes. © 2021 by the authors.

On-farm agroforestry systems can reduce dependency on off-farm fuel; however, the output of on-farm produced fuel is typically uncertain as production potentials are often not known. In this paper, we have developed allometric equations to model the above-ground woody biomass (AGWB) production from intercropped Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp (Gliricidia) shrubs and Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. (pigeon pea) plants. Methods: We used a destructive sampling approach, for measuring the dendrometric characteristics, such as the root collar diameter at a 20 cm stem height (RCD20) and the stem height to estimate the AGWB production. The models are based on 112 Gliricidia and 80 pigeon pea observations from annually pruned plants. Seven allometric equations were fitted to derive the best-fit models for the AGWB production. Results: We found that using a natural log-transformed linear model with RCD20 as a single predictor variable provides the highest explanatory value to estimate the AGWB production (Gliricidia: R2 = 95.7%, pigeon pea: R2 = 91.4%) while meeting Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimator requirements. Adding stem height as an additional variable to predict the AGWB production does not improve model accuracy enough to justify the extra work for including it. Conclusions: While on-farm pigeon pea plants produced a stable amount of woody biomass per annum, annual fuelwood production from Gliricidia shrubs increased over the years. Compared to the annual fuelwood consumption data from the literature, our results show that on-farm produced fuelwood can substantially offset the demand for off-farm fuel, potentially resulting in household fuelwood autarky. © 2021, The Author(s).","Agroforestry; Energy mix; Energy self-sufficiency; Food security; Intercropping; Smallholder farmer","Biomass; Deforestation; Fuels; Wood products; Above-ground woody biomass; Agroforestry; Biomass productions; Energy mix; Energy self-sufficiency; Food security; Fuelwood; Intercropping; Pigeon pea; Smallholder farmers; Food supply; allometry; crop production; estimation method; legume; semiarid region; shrub; spatiotemporal analysis; Tanzania; Cajanus cajan; Gliricidia; Gliricidia sepium",Article,Scopus

Drought can decrease the production of Chinese Brassica, whereas over-irrigation can waste water. It is desirable to schedule irrigation when the crop suffers from water stress. In this study, a random forest model was developed using sample data derived from meteorological measurements including air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS), and photosynthetic active radiation (Par) to predict the lower baseline (Twet) and upper baseline (Tdry) canopy temperatures for Chinese Brassica from 27 November to 31 December 2020 (E1) and from 25 May to 20 June 2021 (E2). Crop water stress index (CWSI) values were determined based on the predicted canopy temperature and used to assess the crop water status. The study demonstrated the viability of using a random forest model to forecast Twet and Tdry. The coefficients of determination (R2) in E1 were 0.90 and 0.88 for development and 0.80 and 0.77 for validation, respectively. The R2 values in E2 were 0.91 and 0.89 for development and 0.83 and 0.80 for validation, respectively. Our results reveal that the measured and predicted CWSI values had similar R2 values related to stomatal conductance (~0.5 in E1, ~0.6 in E2), whereas the CWSI showed a poor correlation with transpiration rate (~0.25 in E1, ~0.2 in E2). Finally, the methodology used to calculate the daily CWSI for Chinese Brassica in this study showed that both Twet and Tdry, which require frequent measuring and design experiment due to the trial site and condition changes, have the potential to simulate environmental parameters and can therefore be applied to conveniently calculate the CWSI. © 2021 by the authors.

The review and systematization of these methods in terms of the effectiveness of the obtained results and their accuracy allows for the planning towards further development in this area. The state of the art analysis concerns various methodological approaches, including selection of data in terms of spatial resolution, selection of algorithms, as well as external conditions related to arable land use, especially the structure of crops. The results achieved with use of various approaches and classifiers and subsequently reported in the literature vary depending on the crops and area of analysis and the sources of satellite data. Hence, their review and systematic conclusions are needed, especially in the context of the growing interest in automatic processes of identifying crops for statistical purposes or monitoring changes in arable land. The results of this study show no significant difference between the accuracy achieved from different machine learning algorithms, yet on average artificial neural network classifiers have results that are better by a few percent than others. For very fragmented regions, better results were achieved using Sentinel-2, SPOT-5 rather than Landsat images, but the level of accuracy can still be improved.

In most cases, spectral information derived from multispectral or hyperspectral images is used alone for yield estimation, while variables that contain spatial information such as textural measures were not considered. As UAV can acquire images with spatial resolution at centimeter-level, which contain rich spatial information of observed objects, the test of textural measures in improving yield estimation becomes possible. In this study, UAV-based hyperspectral images of rice in the east of China were acquired in 2017, 2018 and 2019 three consecutive year during rice growing seasons. Eight gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based texture measures were derived, and all two band combinations of these textural measures as well as spectral reflectance in three types (normalized type, differential type and simple ratio type) were calculated to developing textural and spectral index. Grain yield estimation models were established using spectral indices alone and spectral indices combining textural measures, respectively. The results show that models based on spectral indices combining textural measures all performed better than these using spectral indices alone, with coefficient of determination R2 of the best model greater than 0.8, RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 0.421 Mg ha−1 and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) of 4.66% for calibration results, and 0.521 Mg ha−1 and 6.63% for validation results. Meanwhile, spectral indices combining textural measures can adjust the problems of overestimation and underestimation in models developed with spectral indices alone. This kind of improvement is especially obvious when grain yield is below 5.0 Mg ha−1 or above 8.0 Mg ha−1. Besides, the estimation accuracy of the model based on spectral index combining textural measure at the booting stage was equivalent to the model based on spectral indices at the booting and heading stages, indicating that textural measures may be helpful in monitoring grain yield at an earlier stage. © 2021 The Authors","Grain yield; Rice; Spectral index; Textural measure; UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)","crop yield; multispectral image; rice; spectral analysis; unmanned vehicle",Article,Scopus

However, other similar agroecosystems with extensive data resources can be of use. We propose a new predictive modeling approach based upon the concept of transfer learning to solve the problem of data deficiency in predicting productivity of agroecosystems, where productivity is a nonlinear function of various interacting biotic and abiotic factors. We describe the process of building metamodels (machine learning models built and trained on simulation data) from simulations built for one agroecosystem (US wild blueberry) as the source domain, where the data resource is abundant. Metamodels are evaluated and the best metamodel representing the system dynamics is selected. The best metamodel is re-parameterized and calibrated to another agroecosystem (Northeast China bog blueberry) as the target domain where field collected data are lacking. Experimental results showed that our metamodel developed for wild blueberry achieved 78% accuracy in fruit-set prediction for bog blueberry. To demonstrate its usefulness, we applied this calibrated metamodel to investigate the response of bog blueberry to various weather conditions. We found that an 8% reduction in fruit-set of bog blueberry is likely to happen if weather becomes warmer and wetter as predicted by climate models. In addition, southern and eastern production regions will suffer more severe fruit-set decline than the other growing regions. Predictions also suggest that increasing commercially available honeybee densities to 18 bees/m2 /min, or bumble bee densities to 0.6 bees/m2 /min, is a viable way to compensate for the predicted 8% climate induced fruit-set decline in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

Such yield predictions typically are based on multi-parametric models and in-situ sampling. Here we investigate the extension of a greenhouse study, to low-altitude unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Our principal objective was to investigate snap bean crop (Phaseolus vulgaris) yield using imaging spectroscopy (hyperspectral imaging) in the visible to near-infrared (VNIR; 400–1000 nm) region via UAS. We aimed to solve the problem of crop yield modelling by identifying spectral features explaining yield and evaluating the best time period for accurate yield prediction, early in time. We introduced a Python library, named Jostar, for spectral feature selection. Embedded in Jostar, we proposed a new ranking method for selected features that reaches an agreement between multiple optimization models. Moreover, we implemented a well-known denoising algorithm for the spectral data used in this study. This study benefited from two years of remotely sensed data, captured at multiple instances over the summers of 2019 and 2020, with 24 plots and 18 plots, respectively. Two harvest stage models, early and late harvest, were assessed at two different locations in upstate New York, USA. Six varieties of snap bean were quantified using two components of yield, pod weight and seed length. We used two different vegetation detection algorithms. the Red-Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (RENDVI) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), to subset the fields into vegetation vs. non-vegetation pixels. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used as the regression model. Among nine different optimization models embedded in Jostar, we selected the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Simulated Annealing (SA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and their resulting joint ranking. The findings show that pod weight can be explained with a high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.78–0.93) and low root-mean-square error (RMSE = 940–1369 kg/ha) for two years of data. Seed length yield assessment resulted in higher accuracies (R2 = 0.83–0.98) and lower errors (RMSE = 4.245–6.018 mm). Among optimization models used, ACO and SA outperformed others and the SAM vegetation detection approach showed improved results when compared to the RENDVI approach when dense canopies were being examined. Wavelengths at 450, 500, 520, 650, 700, and 760 nm, were identified in almost all data sets and harvest stage models used. The period between 44–55 days after planting (DAP) the optimal time period for yield assessment. Future work should involve transferring the learned concepts to a multispectral system, for eventual operational use; further attention should also be paid to seed length as a ground truth data collection technique, since this yield indicator is far more rapid and straightforward. © 2021 by the authors.

However, collecting high-quality, large-scale samples takes high costs in some cases, making it difficult to build an accurate classification model. This study aimed to explore a rapid and accurate method for varieties classification of different crop seeds under the sample-limited condition based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and deep transfer learning. Three deep neural networks with typical structures were designed based on a sample-rich Pea dataset. Obtained the highest accuracy of 99.57%, VGG-MODEL was transferred to classify four target datasets (rice, oat, wheat, and cotton) with limited samples. Accuracies of the deep transferred model achieved 95, 99, 80.8, and 83.86% on the four datasets, respectively. Using training sets with different sizes, the deep transferred model could always obtain higher performance than other traditional methods. The visualization of the deep features and classification results confirmed the portability of the shared features of seed spectra, providing an interpreted method for rapid and accurate varieties classification of crop seeds. The overall results showed great superiority of HSI combined with deep transfer learning for seed detection under sample-limited condition.

In the last decade, precision agriculture technology has become affordable in many countries; Global Positioning Systems for automatic guidance instruments and proximal sensors can be used to guide the distribution of nutrients such as nitrogen (N) fertilization using real-time applications. A two-year field experiment (2017–2018) was carried out to quantify maize yield in response to variable rate (VR) N distribution, which was determined with a proximal vigour sensor, as an alternative to a fixed rate (FR) in a cereal-livestock farm located in the Po valley (northern Italy). The amount of N distributed for the FR (140 kg N ha−1) was calculated according to the crop requirement and the regional regulation: ±30% of the FR rate was applied in the VR treatment according to the Vigour S-index calculated on-the-go from the CropSpec sensor. The two treatments of N fertilization did not result in a significant difference in yield in both years. The findings suggest that the application of VR is more economically profitable than the FR application rate, especially under the hypothesis of VR application at a farm scale. The outcome of the experiment suggests that VR is a viable and profitable technique that can be easily applied at the farm level by adopting proximal sensors to detect the actual crop N requirement prior to stem elongation. Besides the economic benefits, the VR approach can be regarded as a sustainable practice that meets the current European Common Agricultural Policy. © 2021 by the authors.

Both environmental (climatic and edaphic) conditions and management factors affect the variabilities of crop yield. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive data-driven analysis in the U.S. Corn Belt to understand and model how rainfed corn yield is affected by climate variability and extremes, soil properties (soil available water capacity, soil organic matter), and management practices (planting date and fertilizer applications). Exploratory data analyses revealed that corn yield responds non-linearly to temperature, while the negative vapor pressure deficit (VPD) effect on corn yield is monotonic and more prominent. Higher mean yield and inter-annual yield variability are found associated with high soil available water capacity, while lower inter-annual yield variability is associated with high soil organic matter (SOM). We also identified region-dependent relationships between planting date and yield and a strong correlation between planting date and the April weather condition (temperature and rainfall). Next, we built machine learning models using the random forest and LASSO algorithms, respectively, to predict corn yield with all climatic, soil properties, and management factors. The random forest model achieved a high prediction accuracy for annual yield at county level as early as in July (R2 = 0.781) and outperformed LASSO. The gained insights from this study lead to improved understanding of how corn yield responds to climate variability and projected change in the U.S. Corn Belt and globally. © Copyright © 2021 Xu, Guan, Peng, Wei and Zhao.","corn yield; LASSO; machine learning; random forest; soil properties; US Corn Belt; vapor pressure deficit",,Article,Scopus

In particular, limited input data are the main obstacles to obtain reliable classification results for early crop mapping. This study investigates the potential of a hybrid classification approach, i.e., CNN-random forest (CNN-RF), in the context of early crop mapping, that combines the automatic feature extraction capability of CNN with the superior discrimination capability of an RF classifier. Two experiments on incremental crop classification with unmanned aerial vehicle images were conducted to compare the performance of CNN-RF with that of CNN and RF with respect to the length of the time-series and training data sizes. When sufficient time-series images and training data were used for the classification, the accuracy of CNN-RF was slightly higher or comparable with that of CNN. In contrast, when fewer images and the smallest training data were used at the early crop growth stage, CNN-RF was substantially beneficial and the overall accuracy increased by maximum 6.7%p and 4.6%p in the two study areas, respectively, compared to CNN. This is attributed to its ability to discriminate crops from features with insufficient information using a more sophisticated classifier. The experimental results demonstrate that CNN-RF is an effective classifier for early crop mapping when only limited input images and training samples are available. © 2021 by the authors.

A total of 10 VI were obtained from multispectral images by a camera attached to a rotary-wing RPA. The RGB orthomosaic was used to determine sampling points at the crop area, which were ranked by N levels in the plants as deficient, critical, or sufficient. The chemical analysis of N content in the coffee leaves, as well as the VI values in sample points, were used as input parameters for the image training and its classification by the RF. The suggested model has shown global accuracy and a kappa coefficient of up to 0.91 and 0.86, respectively. The best results were achieved using the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation (GNDVI) and Green Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (GOSAVI). In addition, the model enabled the evaluation of the spatial distribution of N in the coffee trees, as well as quantification of N deficiency in the crop for the whole area.

The data provided by the Sentinel 2 missions, together with the emergence of different scientific disciplines in artificial intelligence —especially machine learning— offer the perfect basis for identifying and classifying any crop and its phenological state.

Several models are considered to obtain the most suitable model for each element of the time series used; pixel-based classification is performed and finished with a statistical treatment.

We conducted a retrospective study using the wheat blast outbreaks in Bangladesh, which occurred for the first time in Asia in 2016, to study a what-if scenario that if there was seasonal disease risk prediction at that time, the epidemics could be prevented or reduced through prediction-based interventions. Two factors govern the answer: the seasonal disease risk prediction is accurate enough to use, and there are effective and realistic control measures to be used upon the prediction. In this study, we focused on the former. To simulate the wheat blast risk and wheat yield in the target region, a high-resolution climate reanalysis product and spatiotemporally downscaled seasonal climate forecasts from eight global climate models were used as inputs for both models. The calibrated wheat blast model successfully simulated the spatial pattern of disease epidemics during the 2014–2018 seasons and was subsequently used to generate seasonal wheat blast risk prediction before each winter season starts. The predictability of the resulting predictions was evaluated against observation-based model simulations. The potential value of utilizing the seasonal wheat blast risk prediction was examined by comparing actual yields resulting from the risk-averse (proactive) and risk-disregarding (conservative) decisions. Overall, our results from this retrospective study showed the feasibility of seasonal forecast-based early warning system for the pre-season strategic interventions of forecasted wheat blast in Bangladesh. © Copyright © 2020 Kim and Choi.","climate reanalysis; disease epidemiological model; early warning system; global crop calendar; seasonal disease risk; winter wheat",,Article,Scopus

An analysis of variance (ANOVA), linear mixed-effects model (LMM), and MP5 regression tree model were used to evaluate the grain yield response. All the methods identified fertilizer application and environmental factors as the main variables that explained 80% of the variance in grain yields. Mineral nitrogen fertilizer (NF) application was the major factor that influenced the grain yield in all methods. Farmyard manure slightly influenced the grain yield with no NF application in the ANOVA and M5P regression tree. While sources of environmental factors were unmeasured in the ANOVA test, they were quantified in detail in the LMM and M5P model. The LMM and M5P model identified the cumulative number of freezing days in December as the main climate-based determinant of the grain yield variation. Additionally, the temperature in October, the cumulative number of freezing days in February, the yield of the preceding crop, and the total nitrogen in the soil were determinants of the grain yield in both models. Apart from the common determinants that appeared in both models, the LMM additionally showed precipitation in June and the cumulative number of days in July with temperatures above 30◦C, while the M5P model showed soil organic carbon as an influencing factor of the grain yield. The ANOVA results provide only the main factors affecting the WW yield. The LMM had a better predictive performance compared to the M5P, with smaller root mean square and mean absolute errors. However, they were richer regressors than the ANOVA. The M5P model presented an intuitive visualization of important variables and their critical thresholds, and revealed other variables that were not captured by the LMM model.

An important outcome of this reality is the qualitative and quantitative degradation of groundwater, which clearly indicates the need to exploit surface runoff. This study presents an integrated Geographic Information System (GIS)-based methodological framework for revealing and selecting suitable locations to build small-scale reservoirs and exploit surface runoff. In this framework, the SWAT model was used to quantify surface runoff, followed by the simulation of reservoir scenarios through reservoir simulation software. Andros Island (located in Cyclades Prefecture), Greece was selected as the study area. The obtained results indicated the most suitable location for creating a reservoir for maximizing exploitation of surface runoff, based on the specific water demands of the nearby areas and the existing meteorological, hydrological, and geological background potential. Thus, two selected dam locations are analyzed by using the proposed framework. The findings showed that the first dam site is inappropriate for creating a reservoir, as it cannot meet the demand for large water extraction volumes. In addition, the outcomes confirmed the efficiency of the proposed methodology in optimum selection of locations to construct small-scale water exploitation works. This research presents a contemporary methodological framework that highlights the capability of GIS, SWAT modeling, and reservoir simulation coupling in detecting optimal locations for constructing small reservoirs. © 2020 by the authors.

There are growing interests to study the impacts of drought on crop. However, studies on the impacts of heat stress on crop photosynthesis and yield are still lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we used both statistical models and satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data to assess the impacts of heat stress on wheat yield in a major wheat growing region, the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), India. The statistical model showed that the relationships between different accumulated degree days (ADD) and reported wheat yield were significantly negative. The results confirmed that heat stress affected wheat yield across this region. Building on such information, satellite SIF observations were used to further explore the physiological basis of heat stress impacts on wheat yield. Our results showed that SIF had strong negative correlations with ADDs and was capable of monitoring heat stress. The SIF results also indicated that heat stress caused yield loss by directly impacting the photosynthetic capacity in wheat. Overall, our findings demonstrated that SIF as an effective proxy for photosynthetic activity would improve our understanding of the impacts of heat stress on wheat yield. © 2020 by the authors.

However, mapping of crop types at high spatial resolution requires high-quality crop type reference data typically collected from the ground-based surveys to create the maps and/or to assess the map accuracy. The availability of sufficient crop type reference data is limited over large geographic regions because of the time, effort, cost, and accessibility in different parts of the world. To generate large area crop type maps, any existing, but limited reference data must be spatially extended to other regions using appropriate and available non-ground-based sources. There is the potential to classify High Resolution Imagery (HRI) using a phenology-based approach as demonstrated in this paper to generate additional reference data within similar agriculture ecological zones (AEZs) based on the crop characteristics, their types, and their growing season. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate if existing, limited crop type reference data could be extended using this approach. Multi-date, high spatial resolution satellite images were used to spatially extend the limited crop type reference data from one region [called the training region (TR)] to another region [called the test region (TE)] within the same AEZ using a phenology-based Decision Tree (DT) classifier for three different field sizes. The results demonstrate that this phenology-based classification approach can efficiently and effectively extend the limited crop type reference data to other regions in same AEZ for different field sizes. © Copyright © 2020 Yadav and Congalton.","agriculture ecological zones (AEZs); crop mapping; decision tree (DT) classifier; high resolution imagery (HRI); phenology-based classification; reference data",,Article,Scopus

The Sentinel-3 OLCI Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (OTCI) is an indicator of canopy chlorophyll content and is intended to continue the legacy of the Envisat MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI). Despite spectral similarities, validation and verification of consistency is essential to inform the user community about the product's accuracy, uncertainty, and fitness for purpose. This paper aims to: (i) describe the theoretical basis of the Sentinel-3 OTCI and (ii) evaluate the spatiotemporal consistency between the Sentinel-3 OTCI and the Envisat MTCI. Two approaches were used to conduct the evaluation. Firstly, agreement between the Sentinel-3 OTCI and the Envisat MTCI archive was assessed over the Committee for Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Land Product Validation (LPV) core validation sites, enabling the temporal consistency of the two products to be investigated. Secondly, intercomparison of monthly Level-3 Sentinel-3 OTCI and Envisat MTCI composites was carried out to evaluate the spatial distribution of differences across the globe. In both cases, the agreement was quantified with statistical metrics (R2, NRMSD, bias) using an Envisat MTCI climatology based on the MERIS archive as the reference. Our results demonstrate strong agreement between the products. Specifically, high 1:1 correspondence (R2 >0.88), low global mean percentage difference (-1.86 to 0.61), low absolute bias (<0.1), and minimal error (NRMSD ~0.1) are observed. The temporal profiles reveal consistency in the expected range of values, amplitudes, and seasonal trajectories. Biases and discrepancies may be attributed to changes in land management practices, land cover change, and extreme climatic events occurred during the time gap between the missions; however, this requires further investigation. This research confirms that Sentinel-3 OTCI dataset can be used along with the Envisat MTCI to provide a data coverage over the last 20 years. © 2020 by the authors.","Envisat; Intercomparison; Land product; Meris; Mtci; Olci; Otci; Sentinel-3; Validation","Chlorophyll; Algorithm improvements; Earth observation satellites; Land management practices; Medium resolution imaging spectrometers; OLCI Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (OTCI); Optical characteristics; Spatio-temporal consistencies; Validation and verification; Geodetic satellites",Article,Scopus

A Region-Convolutional Neural Network was trained to detect and count the number of apple fruit on individual trees located on the orthomosaic built from images taken by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The results obtained with the proposed approach were compared with apple counts made in situ by an agrotechnician, and an R2 value of 0.86 was acquired (MAE: 10.35 and RMSE: 13.56). As only parts of the tree fruits were visible in the top-view images, linear regression was used to estimate the number of total apples on each tree.

In order to further improve the accuracy of estimating grain protein content (GPC) through remote sensing, this study analyzed the quantitative relationship between 14 remote sensing variables obtained from images of environment and disaster monitoring and forecasting small satellite constellation system equipped with wide-band CCD sensors (abbreviated as HJ-CCD) and field-grown winter wheat GPC. The 14 remote sensing variables were normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), nitrogen reflectance index (NRI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), structure intensive pigment index (SIPI), plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), difference vegetation index (DVI), ratio vegetation index (RVI), Rblue (reflectance at blue band), Rgreen (reflectance at green band), Rred (reflectance at red band) and Rnir (reflectance at near infrared band). The partial least square (PLS) algorithm was used to construct and validate the multivariate remote sensing model of predicting wheat GPC. The research showed a close relationship between wheat GPC and 12 remote sensing variables other than Rblue and Rgreen of the spectral reflectance bands. Among them, except PSRI and Rblue, Rgreen and Rred, other remote sensing vegetation indexes had significant multiple correlations. The optimal principal components of PLS model used to predict wheat GPC were: NDVI, SIPI, PSRI and EVI. All these were sensitive variables to predict wheat GPC. Through modeling set and verification set evaluation, GPC prediction models’ coefficients of determination (R2) were 0.84 and 0.8, respectively. The root mean square errors (RMSE) were 0.43% and 0.54%, respectively. It indicated that the PLS algorithm model predicted wheat GPC better than models for linear regression (LR) and principal components analysis (PCA) algorithms. The PLS algorithm model’s prediction accuracies were above 90%. The improvement was by more than 20% than the model for LR algorithm and more than 15% higher than the model for PCA algorithm.

Non-destructive methods, such as satellite and proximal sensing, are widely used to estimate crop yield and quality characteristics, and spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) are commonly used to present site specific information. The aim of this study was the assessment of SVIs derived from satellite and proximal sensing at different growth stages of table grapes from veraison to harvest. The study took place in a commercial table grape vineyard (Vitis vinifera cv. Thompson Seedless) during three successive cultivation years (2015–2017). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) were calculated by employing satellite imagery (Landsat 8) and proximal sensing (Crop Circle ACS 470) to assess the yield and quality characteristics of table grapes. The SVIs exhibited different degrees of correlations with different measurement dates and sensing methods. Satellite-based GNDVI at harvest presented higher correlations with crop quality characteristics (r = 0.522 for berry diameter, r = 0.537 for pH, r = 0.629 for berry deformation) compared with NDVI. Proximal-based GNDVI at the middle of veraison presented higher correlations compared with NDVI (r = –0.682 for berry diameter, r = –0.565 for berry deformation).

It is therefore common to correct (or adjust) those simulations before using them as inputs into impact models. However, most bias correction (BC) methods are univariate and so do not account for the statistical dependences linking the different locations and/or physical variables of interest. In addition, they are often deterministic, and stochasticity is frequently needed to investigate climate uncertainty and to add constrained randomness to climate simulations that do not possess a realistic variability. This study presents a multivariate method of rank resampling for distributions and dependences (R2D2) bias correction allowing one to adjust not only the univariate distributions but also their inter-variable and inter-site dependence structures. Moreover, the proposed R2D2 method provides some stochasticity since it can generate as many multivariate corrected outputs as the number of statistical dimensions (i.e., number of grid cell × number of climate variables) of the simulations to be corrected. It is based on an assumption of stability in time of the dependence structure - making it possible to deal with a high number of statistical dimensions - that lets the climate model drive the temporal properties and their changes in time. R2D2 is applied on temperature and precipitation reanalysis time series with respect to high-resolution reference data over the southeast of France (1506 grid cell). Bivariate, 1506-dimensional and 3012-dimensional versions of R2D2 are tested over a historical period and compared to a univariate BC. How the different BC methods behave in a climate change context is also illustrated with an application to regional climate simulations over the 2071-2100 period. The results indicate that the 1d-BC basically reproduces the climate model multivariate properties, 2d-R2D2 is only satisfying in the inter-variable context, 1506d-R2D2 strongly improves inter-site properties and 3012d-R2D2 is able to account for both. Applications of the proposed R2D2 method to various climate datasets are relevant for many impact studies. The perspectives of improvements are numerous, such as introducing stochasticity in the dependence itself, questioning its stability assumption, and accounting for temporal properties adjustment while including more physics in the adjustment procedures. © Author(s) 2018.",,"Climate change; Digital storage; Sampling; Dependence structures; Historical periods; Multivariate methods; Physical variables; Realistic variability; Regional climate simulation; Statistical dependence; Univariate distributions; Climate models; climate change; climate modeling; multivariate analysis; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; sampling; sampling bias; simulation; temperature effect; France",Article,Scopus

Here we provide an assessment of near-term climate change impacts on sorghum yields in West Africa and account for uncertainties both in future climate scenarios and in crop models. Towards this goal, we use simulations of nine bias-corrected CMIP5 climate models and two crop models (SARRA-H and APSIM) to evaluate the robustness of projected crop yield impacts in this area. In broad agreement with the full CMIP5 ensemble, our subset of bias-corrected climate models projects a mean warming of +2.8 °C in the decades of 2031-2060 compared to a baseline of 1961-1990 and a robust change in rainfall in West Africa with less rain in the Western part of the Sahel (Senegal, South-West Mali) and more rain in Central Sahel (Burkina Faso, South-West Niger). Projected rainfall deficits are concentrated in early monsoon season in the Western part of the Sahel while positive rainfall changes are found in late monsoon season all over the Sahel, suggesting a shift in the seasonality of the monsoon. In response to such climate change, but without accounting for direct crop responses to CO2, mean crop yield decreases by about 16-20% and year-to-year variability increases in the Western part of the Sahel, while the eastern domain sees much milder impacts. Such differences in climate and impacts projections between the Western and Eastern parts of the Sahel are highly consistent across the climate and crop models used in this study. We investigate the robustness of impacts for different choices of cultivars, nutrient treatments, and crop responses to CO2. Adverse impacts on mean yield and yield variability are lowest for modern cultivars, as their short and nearly fixed growth cycle appears to be more resilient to the seasonality shift of the monsoon, thus suggesting shorter season varieties could be considered a potential adaptation to ongoing climate changes. Easing nitrogen stress via increasing fertilizer inputs would increase absolute yields, but also make the crops more responsive to climate stresses, thus enhancing the negative impacts of climate change in a relative sense. Finally, CO2fertilization would significantly offset the negative climate impacts on sorghum yields by about 10%, with drier regions experiencing the largest benefits, though the net impacts of climate change remain negative even after accounting for CO2. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Africa; climate change; crop","Crops; Africa; Future climate; West Africa; Climate change; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate modeling; crop yield; cultivar; ecological modeling; numerical model; seasonality; sorghum; West Africa",Article,Scopus

To some extent, the prediction model for crop yields combining the crop mechanism model with statistical regression model (SRM) can improve the timeliness and robustness of the final yield prediction. In this study, the accumulated biomass (AB) simulated by the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model and multiple climate indices (e.g., climate suitability indices and extreme climate indices) were incorporated into SRM to predict the wheat yield in the North China Plain (NCP). The results showed that the prediction model based on the random forest (RF) algorithm outperformed the prediction models using other regression algorithms. The prediction for the wheat yield at SM (the period from the start of grain filling to the milky stage) based on RF can obtain a higher accuracy (r = 0.86, RMSE = 683 kg ha−1 and MAE = 498 kg ha−1). With the progression of wheat growth, the performances of yield prediction models improved gradually. The prediction of yield at FS (the period from flowering to the start of grain filling) can achieve higher precision and a longer lead time, which can be viewed as the optimum period providing the decent performance of the yield prediction and about one month’s lead time. In addition, the precision of the predicted yield for the irrigated sites was higher than that for the rainfed sites. The APSIM-simulated AB had an importance of above 30% for the last three prediction events, including FIF event (the period from floral initiation to flowering), FS event (the period from flowering to the start of grain filling) and SM event (the period from the start of grain filling to the milky stage), which ranked first in the prediction model. The climate suitability indices, with a higher rank for every prediction event, played an important role in the prediction model. The winter wheat yield in the NCP was seriously affected by the low temperature events before flowering, the high temperature events after flowering and water stress. We hope that the prediction model can be used to develop adaptation strategies to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on crop productivity and provide the data support for food security. © 2022 by the authors.","APSIM model; climate indices; machine learning; North China Plain; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

Its tremendous resistance to the environment, ease of propagation, and incredibly low infectious dosage make it an attractive organism for biowarfare. Current research on the classification of Coxiella and features influencing its presence in the soil is generally confined to statistical techniques. Machine learning other than traditional approaches can help us better predict epidemiological modeling for this soil-based pathogen of public significance. We developed a two-phase feature-ranking technique for the pathogen on a new soil feature dataset. The feature ranking applies methods such as ReliefF (RLF), OneR (ONR), and correlation (CR) for the first phase and a combination of techniques utilizing weighted scores to determine the final soil attribute ranks in the second phase. Different classification methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) have been utilized for the classification of soil attribute dataset for Coxiella positive and negative soils. The feature-ranking methods established that potassium, chromium, cadmium, nitrogen, organic matter, and soluble salts are the most significant attributes. At the same time, manganese, clay, phosphorous, copper, and lead are the least contributing soil features for the prevalence of the bacteria. However, potassium is the most influential feature, and manganese is the least significant soil feature. The attribute ranking using RLF generates the most promising results among the ranking methods by generating an accuracy of 80.85% for MLP, 79.79% for LR, and 79.8% for LDA. Overall, SVM and MLP are the best-performing classifiers, where SVM yields an accuracy of 82.98% and 81.91% for attribute ranking by CR and RLF; and MLP generates an accuracy of 76.60% for ONR. Thus, machine models can help us better understand the environment, assisting in the prevalence of bacteria and decreasing the chances of false classification. Subsequently, this can assist in controlling epidemics and alleviating the devastating effect on the socio-economics of society. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"manganese; Coxiella burnetii; human; machine learning; soil; support vector machine; Coxiella burnetii; Humans; Machine Learning; Manganese; Neural Networks, Computer; Soil; Support Vector Machine",Article,Scopus

Cd mobility shift is critical for the correct assessment of pollution vulnerability in different soil types. But the existing experimental methods and traditional quantitative prediction models are time-consuming and have a small scope of adaptation. In this paper, a coupling model of soil Cd adsorption and desorption was developed based on quantitative retention factors to explore the sensitivity of soil environmental factors for Cd pollution and quantify the spatial distribution pattern of Cd pollution vulnerability in highly heterogeneous soils in China. Results showed that: (1) The type of background electrolyte affected Cd adsorption and desorption capacity in soil solution. The performances of the single background electrolyte models (NaNO3, CaCl2, NaCl, KNO3) are better than the mixed background electrolyte model. (2) The contribution values of adsorption and desorption models were compared by sensitivity analysis.

For this purpose, the WP and economic water productivity (WPe) were estimated using agronomic technologies. The impact of agronomic technologies on WP and WPe was carried out in two parts of field monitoring and modeling using novel intelligent approaches. Extreme learning machine (ELM), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and artificial neural network (ANN) methods were used to model WP and WPe. A dataset including 200 field data was collected from five treatment and control sections in the Malekan region, located in the southeast of Lake Urmia, Iran, for the crop year 2020–2021. Six different input combinations were introduced to estimate WP and WPe. The models used were evaluated using mean squared error (RMSE), relative mean squared error (RRMSE), and efficiency measures (NSE). Field monitoring results showed that in the treatment fields, with the application of agronomic technologies, the crop yield, WP, and WPe increased by 17.9%, 30.1%, and 19.9%, respectively. The results explained that irrigation water in farms W1, W2, W3, W4, and W5 decreased by 23.9%, 21.3%, 29.5%, 16.5%, and 2.7%, respectively. The modeling results indicated that the ANFIS model with values of RMSE = 0.016, RRMSE = 0.018, and NSE = 0.960 performed better in estimating WP and WPe than ANN and ELM models.

In this paper, an automated detection method is proposed to extract Pedicularis and reveal the spatial distribution. Based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images, this paper adopts logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest classifiers for multi-class classification. One-class SVM (OCSVM), isolation forest, and positive and unlabeled learning (PUL) algorithms are used for one-class classification. The results are as follows: (1) The accuracy of multi-class classifiers is better than that of one-class classifiers, but it requires all classes that occur in the image to be exhaustively assigned labels. Among the one-class classifiers that only need to label positive or positive and labeled data, the PUL has the highest F score of 0.9878. (2) PUL performs the most robustly to change features in one-class classifiers. All one-class classifiers prove that the green band is essential for extracting Pedicularis. (3) The parameters of the PUL are easy to tune, and the training time is easy to control. Therefore, PUL is a promising one-class classification method for Pedicularis extraction, which can accurately identify the distribution range of Pedicularis to promote grassland administration. © 2022 by the authors.","one-class classification; Pedicularis; positive and unlabeled learning (PUL); semi-supervised learning (SSL); unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); vegetation extraction",,Article,Scopus

Affordable, rapid, and accurate methods of analyses of various chemical components present in animal manure, therefore, are valuable in managing soil and mitigating water pollution.

Simulations of future crop production show that climate change is likely to reduce the yields of the major grain crops around the world, but the impacts on potato production have yet to be determined. A model ensemble consisting of five process-based and one statistical model was used to estimate the impact of climate change on fully irrigated, well-fertilized potato crop across the USA under the RCP 8.5 scenario of high emissions. Results indicate that increasing temperature will reduce potato yields, but this will be mostly compensated by elevated atmospheric CO2. Yields are predicted to decline with climate change in the current highest-yielding areas, which might experience the highest rises in growing season temperature during short hot summers. Simulated yields increase slightly elsewhere in the southern regions of the USA. Planting potatoes earlier as adaptation to avoid hot summers might improve yields in most regions. Water use by the potato crop is predicted to decline despite higher temperatures, due to a shorter growing season and increased water use efficiency under elevated atmospheric CO2. With higher yields in many regions, crop uptake for (nitrogen + phosphorus + potassium) NPK fertilizer will increase, despite the reduced concentration of nutrients in potatoes due to a growth stimulus from elevated atmospheric CO2. With earlier planting, by 2050 water use will decline by 11.7%, NPK fertilizer uptake will increase by 10.4%, and yields of slightly less nutritious potatoes will increase by 14.9% nationally. © 2022 The Author(s).

The temporal variability of crop biochemical properties and canopy structure across different growth stages has great impacts on wheat LCC estimation, known as growth stage effects. It will result in the heterogeneity of crop canopy at different growth stages, which would mask subtle spectral response of biochemistry variations. This study aims to explore spectral responses on the growth stage effects and establish LCC models suited for different growth stages. A total number of 864 pairwise samples of wheat canopy spectra and LCC values with 216 observations of each stage were sampled at the tillering, jointing, booting and heading stages in 2021. Firstly, statistical analysis of LCC and spectral response presented different distribution traits and typical spectral variations peak at 470, 520 and 680 nm. Correlation analysis between LCC and reflectance showed typical red edge shifts. Secondly, the testing model of partial least square (PLS) established by the entire datasets to validate the predictive performance at each stage yielded poor LCC estimation accuracy. The spectral wavelengths of red edge (RE) and blue edge (BE) shifts and the poor estimation capability motivated us to further explore the growth stage effects by establishing LCC models at respective growth periods. Finally, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling PLS (CARS-PLS), decision tree (DT) and random forest (RF) were used to select sensitive bands and establish LCC models at specific stages. Bayes optimisation was used to tune the hyperparameters of DT and RF regression. The modelling results indicated that CARS-PLS and DT did not extract specific wavelengths that could decrease the influences of growth stage effects. From the RF out-of-bag (OOB) evaluation, the sensitive wavelengths displayed consistent spectral shifts from BE to GP and from RE to RV from tillering to heading stages.

Deep learning has been used to identify crop diseases at the initial stages of disease development in an effort to create effective disease management systems. However, the use of deep learning and unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery to track the spread of diseases, identify diseased regions within cornfields, and notify users with actionable information remains a research gap. Therefore, in this study, high-resolution, UAS-acquired, real-time kinematic (RTK) geotagged, RGB imagery at an altitude of 12 m above ground level (AGL) was used to develop the Geo Disease Location System (GeoDLS), a deep learning-based system for tracking diseased regions in corn fields. UAS images (resolution 8192 × 5460 pixels) were acquired in cornfields located at Purdue University’s Agronomy Center for Research and Education (ACRE), using a DJI Matrice 300 RTK UAS mounted with a 45-megapixel DJI Zenmuse P1 camera during corn stages V14 to R4. A dataset of 5076 images was created by splitting the UAS-acquired images using tile and simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) segmentation. For tile segmentation, the images were split into tiles of sizes 250 × 250 pixels, 500 × 500 pixels, and 1000 × 1000 pixels, resulting in 1804, 1112, and 570 image tiles, respectively. For SLIC segmentation, 865 and 725 superpixel images were obtained using compactness (m) values of 5 and 10, respectively. Five deep neural network architectures, VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet169, and Xception, were trained to identify diseased, healthy, and background regions in corn fields. DenseNet169 identified diseased, healthy, and background regions with the highest testing accuracy of 100.00% when trained on images of tile size 1000 × 1000 pixels. Using a sliding window approach, the trained DenseNet169 model was then used to calculate the percentage of diseased regions present within each UAS image. Finally, the RTK geolocation information for each image was used to update users with the location of diseased regions with an accuracy of within 2 cm through a web application, a smartphone application, and email notifications. The GeoDLS could be a potential tool for an automated disease management system to track the spread of crop diseases, identify diseased regions, and provide actionable information to the users. © 2022 by the authors.","deep learning; disease identification; image classification; SLIC segmentation; smartphone application; UAS; web application","Antennas; Deep neural networks; Diseases; Image classification; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Location; Network architecture; Smartphones; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Clustering segmentation; Deep learning; Disease identification; Images classification; Iterative clustering; Simple linear iterative clustering segmentation; Simplest linear; Smart-phone applications; Unmanned aerial systems; WEB application; Web applications; Pixels",Article,Scopus

This study used different vegetation indices and red-edge parameters calculated based on the canopy reflectance obtained from near-surface hyperspectral data and UAV hyperspectral data and used the partial least squares regression (PLSR) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods to estimate the yield of winter wheat at different growth stages. Verification was performed based on these two types of hyperspectral remote sensing data and the yield was estimated using vegetation indices and a combination of vegetation indices and red-edge parameters as the modeling independent variables, respectively, using PLSR and ANN regression, respectively. The results showed that, for the same data source, the optimal vegetation index for estimating the yield was the same in all of the studied growth stages; however, the optimal red-edge parameters were different for different growth stages. Compared with using only the vegetation indices as the modeling factor to estimate yield, the combination of the vegetation indices and red-edge parameters obtained superior estimation results. Additionally, the accuracy of yield estimation was shown to be improved by using the PLSR and ANN methods, with the yield estimation model constructed using the PLSR method having a better prediction effect. Moreover, the yield prediction model obtained using the near-surface hyperspectral sensors had a higher fitting and accuracy than the model obtained using the UAV hyperspectral remote sensing data (the results were based on the specific growth stressors, N and water supply). This study shows that the use of a combination of vegetation indices and red-edge parameters achieved an improved yield estimation compared to the use of vegetation indices alone. In the future, the selection of suitable sensors and methods needs to be considered when constructing models to estimate crop yield. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial neural network; near-surface hyperspectral; partial least squares regression; red-edge parameters; UAV hyperspectral; vegetation indices; yield","Crops; Food supply; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Parameter estimation; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Water supply; HyperSpectral; Near surfaces; Near-surface hyperspectral; Partial least square regression; Red edge parameters; UAV hyperspectral; Vegetation index; Yield; Yield estimation; Neural networks",Article,Scopus

In this study, nitrogen fertilization experiments were conducted to monitor GPC for high-quality Indica rice varieties Meixiangzhan 2 (V1) and Wufengyou 615 (V2) in 2019 and 2020. Three types of parameters, including photosynthetic sensitive vegetation indices (VIs), canopy leaf area index (LAI), and crop plant nitrogen accumulation (PNA), obtained from UAV hyperspectral images were used to estimate rice GPC. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional GPC indices were constructed by combining any two of the three types of parameters and all three, respectively, based on the Euclidean distance method.

Quantifying the damage to crops caused by high temperatures can lead to more accurate estimates of crop yields. The remote sensing technique evaluates crop conditions indirectly but provides information related to crop physiology, growth, and yield. In this study, we aim to assess the crop damage caused by heat stress in paddy rice examined under elevated air temperatures in a temperature gradient field chamber from 2016 to 2019, using remote-sensed vegetation indices. A leaf-spectrometer, field-spectrometers, and a multi-spectral camera were used to monitor the conditions of paddy rice. Although, in the leaf- and canopy-scales, the values of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and photochemical reflectance index (PRI) decreased after the heading of rice under normal conditions, the decreasing sensitivity of NDVI and PRI was different depending on the degree of physiological heat stress by high temperature conditions. The NDVI after the heading under extremely high air temperature was not dropped and remained the value before heading. The PRI decreased at all air temperature conditions after the heading; the PRI of the plot exposed to the elevated air temperature was higher than that under ambient air temperature. Further, the relative change in NDVI and PRI after the heading exhibited a strong relationship with the ripening ratio of paddy rice, which is the variable related to crop yield. These remote-sensing results aid in evaluating the crop damage caused by heat stress using vegetation indices. © 2022 by the authors.","crop stress; heat stress; ripening ratio; temperature gradient field chamber; vegetation index",,Article,Scopus

Although they are more accurate than forecasted wind fields, reanalysis wind fields tend to have time latencies because they can only be released after the observations are obtained. In order to produce accurate estimates of wind fields in a more timely manner, we develop an adversarial learning approach to correcting forecasted wind fields to be close to reanalysis wind fields. The adversarial learning approach is conducted by an adversarial ConvLSTM network (ACLN) framework that consists of a corrector and a discriminator. The corrector aims at comprehensively capturing both spatial and temporal characteristics of a sequence of forecasted wind fields and producing a corrected forecast wind field for the final field in the sequence. The discriminator tries to distinguish corrected forecast wind field from its corresponding reanalysis wind field. The training of ACLN is alternate between the corrector and the discriminator in an adversarial fashion. The adversarial training mechanism enhances the corrector's representational power. Additionally, the corrector exploits a residual learning architecture that effectively learns the differences between forecasted wind fields and the corresponding reanalysis wind fields. In this scenario, the well trained corrector requires neither reanalysis wind fields nor observations such that it can correct forecasted wind fields in a timely manner. Furthermore, corrected forecast wind fields are employed for oil spill drift prediction. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed ACLN framework in forecasted wind field correction along with oil spill drift prediction. Compared with ECMWF numerical forecasts, the ACLN achieves an average reduction of 6.2%, 6.9%, and 10.6% in RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, respectively. Compared with a basic drift prediction method, the ACLN based prediction method reduces the error by about 5000 m in the Sanchi oil spill accident.

The main aim of this work was to develop a method of detection of Xcc infection on broccoli leaves. Such method is based on the use of imaging sensors that capture information about the optical properties of leaves and provide data that can be implemented on machine learning algorithms capable of learning patterns. Based on this knowledge, the algorithms are able to classify plants into categories (healthy and infected). To ensure the robustness of the detection method upon future alterations in climate conditions, the response of broccoli plants to Xcc infection was analyzed under a range of growing environments, taking current climate conditions as reference. Two projections for years 2081–2100 were selected, according to the Assessment Report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Thus, the response of broccoli plants to Xcc infection and climate conditions has been monitored using leaf temperature and five conventional vegetation indices (VIs) derived from hyperspectral reflectance. In addition, three novel VIs, named diseased broccoli indices (DBI1-DBI3), were defined based on the spectral reflectance signature of broccoli leaves upon Xcc infection. Finally, the nine parameters were implemented on several classifying algorithms. The detection method offering the best performance of classification was a multilayer perceptron-based artificial neural network. This model identified infected plants with accuracies of 88.1, 76.9, and 83.3%, depending on the growing conditions. In this model, the three Vis described in this work proved to be very informative parameters for the disease detection. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that future climate conditions have been taken into account to develop a robust detection model using classifying algorithms.

The time series of maize yield is generally non-stationary and contains different frequency components, such as long-and short-term oscillations. Nevertheless, there is no adequate understanding of the relative importance of climate change. In addition, human activities on maize yield at multiple timescales remain unclear, which help in further improving maize yield prediction. Based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition method (EEMD), the method of dependent variable variance decomposition (DVVD) and the Sen-slope method, the effect of climate change including growing-season precipitation and temperature (i.e., GSP, GEP, CDD, GST, GSMAT, and GSMT) and human activities including effective irrigation area (EIA) and the consumption of chemical fertilizers (CCF) on maize yield were explored at multiple timescales during 1979–2015. The Heilongjiang Province, a highly important maize production area in China, was selected as a case study. The results of this work indicate the following: (1) The original maize yield series was divided into 3.1-, 7.4-, 18.5-, and 37-year timescale oscillations and a residual series with an increasing trend, where the 3.1-year timescale (IMF1), the 18.5-year timescale (IMF3), and the increasing trend (R) were dominant; (2) the original sequence was mainly affected by human activities; (3) climate change and human activities had different effects on maize yield at different timescales: The short-term oscillation (IMF1) of maize yield was primarily affected by climate change. However, human activities dominated the mid-and long-term oscillations (IMF3 and R) of maize yield.

At present, farmers often over-apply N fertilizer in some locations or at certain times because they do not have high-resolution crop N status data. N-use efficiency can be low, with the remaining N lost to the environment, resulting in higher production costs and environmental pollution. Accurate and timely estimation of N status in crops is crucial to improving cropping systems’ economic and environmental sustainability. Destructive approaches based on plant tissue analysis are time consuming and impractical over large fields. Recent advances in remote sensing and deep learning have shown promise in addressing the aforementioned challenges in a non-destructive way. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning framework: a self-supervised spectral–spatial attention-based vision transformer (SSVT). The proposed SSVT introduces a Spectral Attention Block (SAB) and a Spatial Interaction Block (SIB), which allows for simultaneous learning of both spatial and spectral features from UAV digital aerial imagery, for accurate N status prediction in wheat fields. Moreover, the proposed framework introduces local-to-global self-supervised learning to help train the model from unlabelled data. The proposed SSVT has been compared with five state-of-the-art models including: ResNet, RegNet, EfficientNet, EfficientNetV2, and the original vision transformer on both testing and independent datasets.

A number of previous studies that analyzed changes in precipitation across the Great Lakes and Midwest for a variety of time periods and using a range of quality-control standards and methods observed increased precipitation rates and totals, although there was considerable site-to-site variability, even for sites in close physical proximity. Biases and discontinuities in precipitation observations may contribute to this variability. This study identifies and examines changes in precipitation utilizing a unique approach to observation series screening over a region encompassing the Great Lakes and broader Midwestern region of the United States for the period 1951–2019. A multiple tier procedure was utilized to identify high quality input data series from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset. Annual and seasonal time series of precipitation indicators were calculated and subjected to breakpoint analysis as further quality control. Trends were analyzed across a broad range of related indicators, from totals and frequencies of threshold events to event duration and potential linkages with total precipitable water. Results indicate that annual precipitation has generally increased across the region in terms of totals, although there is substantial variation across the study domain in the significance and magnitude of annual trends by indicator. Annual trends were spatially most consistent across eastern areas of the study domain while relatively greater station-to-station variability in trend significance and magnitude was observed across northern and western portions. Significant trends were generally fewer in number for seasonal precipitation indicators and less spatially coherent. The greatest number of significant trends occurred in fall with the fewest in spring. Correlation of indicator trends with trends of mean total precipitable water suggests weak correlations annually and moderate correlations at the seasonal scale. The trends of the precipitation indicators in our study exhibited more coherent spatial patterns when compared with studies with different quality control criteria, illustrating the importance of quality control of observations in climatic studies and highlighting the complexity of the changing character of precipitation.

Low-cost genotyping technologies that support genome-assisted breeding have already been established. However, efficient collection of large amounts of high-quality phenotypic data is essential for the success of such breeding. Most of the fruit quality traits have been sensorily and visually evaluated by professional breeders. However, the fruit morphological features that serve as the basis for such sensory and visual judgments are unclear. This makes it difficult to collect efficient phenotypic data on fruit quality traits using image analysis. In this study, we developed a method to automatically measure the morphological features of citrus fruits by the image analysis of cross-sectional images of citrus fruits. We applied explainable machine learning methods and Bayesian networks to determine the relationship between fruit morphological features and two sensorily evaluated fruit quality traits: easiness of peeling (Peeling) and fruit hardness (FruH). In each of all the methods applied in this study, the degradation area of the central core of the fruit was significantly and directly associated with both Peeling and FruH, while the seed area was significantly and directly related to FruH alone. The degradation area of albedo and the area of flavedo were also significantly and directly related to Peeling and FruH, respectively, except in one or two methods. These results suggest that an approach that combines explainable machine learning methods, Bayesian networks, and image analysis can be effective in dissecting the experienced sense of a breeder. In breeding programs, collecting fruit images and efficiently measuring and documenting fruit morphological features that are related to fruit quality traits may increase the size of data for the analysis and improvement of the accuracy of GWAS and GS on the quality traits of the citrus fruits.

The paper proposed a county-scale cotton mapping method by using random forest (RF) feature selection algorithm and classifier based on selecting multi-features, including spectral, vegetation indices, and texture features. The contribution of texture features to cotton classification accuracy was also explored in addition to spectral features and vegetation index. In addition, the optimal classification time, feature importance, and the best classifier on the cotton extraction accuracy were evaluated. The results showed that the texture feature named the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is effective for improving classification accuracy, ranking second in contribution among all studied spectral, VI, and texture features. Among the three classifiers, the RF showed higher accuracy and better stability than support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The average overall accuracy (OA) of the classification combining multiple features was 93.36%, 7.33% higher than the average OA of the single-time spectrum, and 2.05% higher than the average OA of the multi-time spectrum. The classification accuracy after feature selection by RF can still reach 92.12%, showing high accuracy and efficiency. Combining multiple features and random forest methods may be a promising county-scale cotton classification method. © 2022 by the authors.

Fast growth in precision agriculture helps farmers to increase their yields by extending the era of machine-learning techniques. However, in organic and inorganic farming, predicting yield is an open issue that dominantly depends on the presence of soil nutrients. The lack of knowledge about the richness of land nutrients deals with the crop selection problem. Therefore, the proposed work extended the idea of a dynamic ensemble model for imbalanced multi-class nutrient data. In this work, an attempt is being made to include a novel customized voting strategy for deciding the final class output from the ensemble model. As an initial step, a well-known ranking technique, VIKOR, is applied over land nutrients to extract the most informative land samples. The rationale is to reduce the complexity of the ensemble model by determining only informative land samples for further classification. Furthermore, the meta-learning approach of dynamic ensemble selection accounts for multi-criterion-based competent classifier selection as meta-classifiers. These meta-classifiers decide on ensemble formation with the customized voting strategy to classify the right crop for the test land. To investigate nutrient richness, real-time soil and water nutrient data are collected from the soil testing laboratory, which covers different spatial data. Our experiments on six popular DES algorithms over nutrient data reveal the proposed algorithm’s outperformance in specificity, sensitivity, BCA, Multi-Area under Curve, and precision. Moreover, the lesser computational time of the proposed work indicates the model’s efficiency toward suitable crop selection. © 2022 The Author(s).

The termination of the hepatitis B virus is mandatory and can be done by taking precautions as well as a suitable cure in its introductory stage; otherwise, it will become a severe problem and make a human liver suffer from the most dangerous diseases, such as liver cancer. In this paper, two medical diagnostic systems are developed for the diagnosis of this life-threatening virus. The methodologies used to develop these models are fuzzy logic and the neuro-fuzzy technique. The diverse parameters that assist in the evaluation of performance are also determined by using the observed values from the proposed system for both developed models. The classification accuracy of a multilayered fuzzy inference system is 94%. The accuracy with which the developed medical diagnostic system by using Adaptive Network based Fuzzy Interference System (ANFIS) classifies the result corresponding to the given input is 95.55%. The comparison of both developed models on the basis of their performance parameters has been made. It is observed that the neuro-fuzzy technique-based diagnostic system has better accuracy in classifying the infected and non-infected patients as compared to the fuzzy diagnostic system. Furthermore, the performance evaluation concluded that the outcome given by the developed medical diagnostic system by using ANFIS is accurate and correct as compared to the developed fuzzy inference system and also can be used in hospitals for the diagnosis of Hepatitis B disease. In other words, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system has more capability to classify the provided inputs adequately than the fuzzy inference system. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Fusarium head blight is associated with trichothecene mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON), which contaminates grains, making them unfit for malting or animal feed industries. While genetically resistant cultivars offer the best economic and environmentally responsible means to mitigate disease, parent lines with adequate resistance are limited in barley. Resistance breeding based upon quantitative genetic gains has been slow to date, due to intensive labor requirements of disease nurseries. The production of a high-throughput genome-wide molecular marker assembly for barley permits use in development of genomic prediction models for traits of economic importance to this crop. A diverse panel consisting of 400 two-row spring barley lines was assembled to focus on Canadian barley breeding programs. The panel was evaluated for FHB and DON content in three environments and over 2 years. Moreover, it was genotyped using an Illumina Infinium High-Throughput Screening (HTS) iSelect custom beadchip array of single nucleotide polymorphic molecular markers (50 K SNP), where over 23 K molecular markers were polymorphic. Genomic prediction has been demonstrated to successfully reduce FHB and DON content in cereals using various statistical models. Herein, we have studied an alternative method based on machine learning and compare it with a statistical approach. The bi-allelic SNPs represented pairs of alleles and were encoded in two ways: as categorical (–1, 0, 1) or using Hardy-Weinberg probability frequencies. This was followed by selecting essential genomic markers for phenotype prediction. Subsequently, a Transformer-based deep learning algorithm was applied to predict FHB and DON. Apart from the Transformer method, a Residual Fully Connected Neural Network (RFCNN) was also applied. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to compare true vs. predicted outputs. Models which included all markers generally showed marginal improvement in prediction. Hardy-Weinberg encoding generally improved correlation for FHB (6.9%) and DON (9.6%) for the Transformer network. This study suggests the potential of the Transformer based method as an alternative to the popular BLUP model for genomic prediction of complex traits such as FHB or DON, having performed equally or better than existing machine learning and statistical methods.

We have used a computational model to infer coconut tree density from satellite images before and after the typhoon’s passage, and in this way estimate the number of damaged trees. Our area of study around the typhoon’s path covers 15.7 Mha, and includes 47 of the 87 provinces in the Philippines. In validation areas our model predicts coconut tree density with a Mean Absolute Error of 5.9 Trees/ha. In Camarines Sur we estimated that 3.5 M of the 4.6 M existing coconut trees were damaged by the typhoon. Overall we estimated that 14.1 M coconut trees were affected by the typhoon inside our area of study. Our validation images confirm that trees are rarely uprooted and damages are largely due to reduced canopy cover of standing trees. On validation areas, our model was able to detect affected coconut trees with 88.6% accuracy, 75% precision and 90% recall. Our method delivers spatially fine-grained change maps for coconut plantations in the area of study, including unchanged, damaged and new trees.

Accurate knowledge and management of soil nitrogen is crucial for food security in rural communities, especially for smallholder maize farms. However, less research has been done on generating digital soil nitrogen maps for these farmers. This study examines the utility of Sentinel-2 satellite data and environmental variables to map soil nitrogen at smallholder maize farms. Three machine learning algorithms—random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and extreme gradient boosting (XG) were investigated for this purpose. The findings indicate that the RF (R2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.0076%) model performs slightly better than the GB (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 0.0083%) and XG (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.0077%) models. Furthermore, the variable importance measure showed that the Sentinel-2 bands, particularly the red and red-edge bands, have a superior performance in comparison to the environmental variables and soil indices. The digital maps generated in this study show the high capability of Sentinel-2 satellite data to generate accurate nitrogen content maps with the application of machine learning. The developed framework can be implemented to map the spatial pattern of soil nitrogen. This will also contribute to soil fertility interventions and nitrogen fertilization management to improve food security in rural communities.

Accurately predicting preharvest apple fruit yields is critical for planting policy making and agricultural management. This study attempted to explore an effective approach for predicting apple fruit yields based on time-series remote sensing data. In this study, time-series vegetation indices (VIs) were derived from Planet images and analyzed to further construct an accumulated VI (∑ VIs)-based random forest (RF∑ VI) model and a Carnegie–Ames–Stanford approach (CASA) model for predicting apple fruit yields. The results showed that (1) ∑ NDVI was the optimal predictor to construct an RF model for apple fruit yield, and the R2, RMSE, and RPD values of the RF∑ NDVI model reached 0.71, 16.40 kg/tree, and 1.83, respectively. (2) The maximum light use efficiency was determined to be 0.499 g C/MJ, and the CASASR model (R2 = 0.57, RMSE = 19.61 kg/tree, and RPD = 1.53) performed better than the CASANDVI model and the CASAAverage model (R2, RMSE, and RPD = 0.56, 24.47 kg/tree, 1.22 and 0.57, 20.82 kg/tree, 1.44, respectively).

This study aimed to use bulk soil and rhizosphere microbial composition and structure to evaluate the potential effect of a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens inoculant (strain QST713) on potatoes and to explore its relationship with crop yield. We implemented next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics approaches to assess the bacterial and fungal biodiversity in 185 soil samples, distributed over four different time points—from planting to harvest—from three different geographical locations in the United States. In addition to location and sampling time (which includes the difference between bulk soil and rhizosphere) as the main variables defining the microbiome composition, the microbial inoculant applied as a treatment also had a small but significant effect in fungal communities and a marginally significant effect bacterial communities. However, treatment preserved the native communities without causing a detectable long-lasting effect on the alpha and beta-diversity patterns after harvest. Using information about the application of the microbial inoculant and considering microbiome composition and structure data, we were able to train a Random Forest model to estimate if a bulk soil or rhizosphere sample came from a low or highyield block with relatively high accuracy (84.6%), concluding that the structure of fungal communities gives us more information as an estimator of potato yield than the structure of bacterial communities. IMPORTANCE Our results reinforce the notion that each cultivar on each location recruits a unique microbial community and that these communities are modulated by the vegetative growth stage of the plant. Moreover, inoculation of a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain QST713-based product on potatoes also changed the abundance of specific taxonomic groups and the structure of local networks in those locations where the product caused an increase in the yield. The data obtained, from in-field assays, allowed training a predictive model to estimate the yield of a certain block, identifying microbiome related to microbial community structure—even with a higher predictive power than the geographical location of the block (that is, the principal determinant of microbial beta-diversity).

Both leaf/canopy level nitrogen content and accumulation are valuable for crop nutrient diagnosis. However, previous studies mainly focused on leaf nitrogen content (LNC) estimation. The effects of growth stages on the modeling accuracy have not been widely discussed. This study aimed to estimate different paddy rice N traits—LNC, plant nitrogen content (PNC), leaf nitrogen accumulation (LNA) and plant nitrogen accumulation (PNA)—from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based hyperspectral images. Additionally, the effects of the growth stage were evaluated. Univariate regression models on vegetation indices (VIs), the traditional multi-variate calibration method, partial least squares regression (PLSR) and modern machine learning (ML) methods, including artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM), were evaluated both over the whole growing season and in each single growth stage (including the tillering, jointing, booting and heading growth stages). The results indicate that the correlation between the four nitrogen traits and the other three biochemical traits—leaf chlorophyll content, canopy chlorophyll content and aboveground biomass—are affected by the growth stage. Within a single growth stage, the performance of selected VIs is relatively constant. For the full-growth-stage models, the performance of the VI-based models is more diverse. For the full-growth-stage models, the transformed chlorophyll absorption in the reflectance index/optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (TCARI/OSAVI) performs best for LNC, PNC and PNA estimation, while the three band vegetation index (TBVITian ) performs best for LNA estimation. There are no obvious patterns regarding which method performs the best of the PLSR, ANN, RF and SVM in either the growth-stage-specific or full-growth-stage models. For the growth-stage-specific models, a lower mean relative error (MRE) and higher R2 can be acquired at the tillering and jointing growth stages. The PLSR and ML methods yield obviously better estimation accuracy for the full-growth-stage models than the VI-based models. For the growth-stage-specific models, the performance of VI-based models seems optimal and cannot be obviously surpassed. These results suggest that building linear regression models on VIs for paddy rice nitrogen traits estimation is still a reasonable choice when only a single growth stage is involved. However, when multiple growth stages are involved or missing the phenology information, using PLSR or ML methods is a better option. © 2021 by the authors.

The trial was arranged in six small plots, one half of which was sown by the Khorasan wheat variety and the other half of which was sown by the Kabot wheat variety. Three soil tillage methods were used for each cultivar: conventional tillage (CT) (20–25 cm), minimum tillage (MTC) with a coulter cultivator (15 cm), and minimization tillage (MTD) with a disc cultivator (12 cm). The soil surface of all of the variants were leveled after tillage (harrows & levelling bars). An unmanned aerial vehicle with multispectral and thermal cameras was used to monitor growth during the vegetation season. The flight missions were supplemented by measurements using the GreenSeeker hand-held sensor and plant and soil analysis. The results showed that the Khorasan ancient wheat was better suited the conditions of conventional tillage, with low values of bulk density and highvalues of total soil porosity, which generally increased the nutritional value of the yield in this experimental plot. At the same time, it was found that this ancient wheat does not deplete the soil. The results also showed that the trend of developmental growing curves derived from different sensors was very similar regardless of measurement method. The sensors used in this study can be good indicators of micronutrient content in the plant as well as in the grains. A low-cost RGB camera can provide relevant results, especially in cases where equipment that is more accurate is not available. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, a set of 100 advanced breeding maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids were planted at optimal (OHOT trial) and delayed planting dates (DHOT trial). Twelve UAS surveys were conducted over the trials throughout the growing season. Fifteen vegetative indices (VIs) and the 99th percentile canopy height measurement (CHMs) were extracted from processed UAS imagery (orthomosaics and point clouds) which were used to predict plot-level grain yield, days to anthesis (DTA), and silking (DTS). A novel statistical approach utilizing a nested design was fit to predict temporal best linear unbiased predictors (TBLUP) for the combined temporal UAS data. Our results demonstrated machine learning-based regressions (ridge, lasso, and elastic net) had from 4-to 9-fold increases in the prediction accuracies and from 13-to 73-fold reductions in root mean squared error (RMSE) compared to classical linear regression in prediction of grain yield or flowering time. Ridge regression performed best in predicting grain yield (prediction accuracy = ~0.6), while lasso and elastic net regressions performed best in predicting DTA and DTS (prediction accuracy = ~0.8) consistently in both trials. We demonstrated that predictor variable importance descended towards the terminal stages of growth, signifying the importance of phenotype collection beyond classical terminal growth stages. This study is among the first to demonstrate an ability to predict yield in elite hybrid maize breeding trials using temporal UAS image-based phenotypes and supports the potential benefit of phenomic selection approaches in estimating breeding values before harvest. © 2021 by the authors.

The ability of UAV-based sensing technologies to provide high spatial (<1 m) and temporal (on-demand) resolution data facilitates monitoring of individual plants over time and can provide essential information about health, yield, and growth in a timely and quantifiable manner. Such applications would be beneficial for cropped banana plants due to their distinctive growth characteristics. Limited studies have employed UAV data for mapping banana crops and to our knowledge only one other investigation features multi-temporal detection of banana crowns. The purpose of this study was to determine the suitability of multiple-date UAV-captured multi-spectral data for the automated detection of individual plants using convolutional neural network (CNN), template matching (TM), and local maximum filter (LMF) methods in a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) software framework coupled with basic classification refinement. The results indicate that CNN returns the highest plant detection accuracies, with the developed rule set and model providing greater transferability between dates (F-score ranging between 0.93 and 0.85) than TM (0.86–0.74) and LMF (0.86–0.73) approaches.

Although long yield time series are available in Europe, few studies have been conducted to analyze them in order to investigate the impact of adverse climate events on yield shocks under current and future climate conditions. Here we designated the lowest 10th percentile of the relative yield anomaly as yield shock and analyzed subnational wheat yield shocks across Europe during the last four decades. We applied a data-driven attribution framework to quantify primary climate drivers of wheat yield shock probability based on machine learning and game theory, and used this framework to infer the most critical climate variables that will contribute to yield shocks in the future, under two climate change scenarios. During the period 1980–2018, our attribution analysis showed that 32% of the observed wheat yield shocks were primarily driven by water limitation, making it the leading climate driver. Projection to future climate scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 suggested an increased risk of yield shock and a paradigm shift from water limitation dominated yield shock to extreme warming induced shocks over 2070–2099: 46% and 54% of areas were primarily driven by extreme warming under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. A similar analysis conducted on yields simulated by an ensemble of crop models showed that models can capture the negative impact of low water supply but missed the impact of excess water. These discrepancies between observed and simulated yield data call for improvement in crop models. © 2021. The Authors.

Although several efficient deep learning techniques have emerged in the field of multispectral imagery analysis, the crop classification problem still needs more accurate solutions. This work introduces a competitive methodology for crop classification from multispectral satellite imagery mainly using an enhanced 2D convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) designed at a smaller-scale architecture, as well as a novel post-processing step. The proposed methodology contains four steps: image stacking, patch extraction, classification model design (based on a 2D-CNN architecture), and post-processing. First, the images are stacked to increase the number of features. Second, the input images are split into patches and fed into the 2D-CNN model. Then, the 2D-CNN model is constructed within a small-scale framework, and properly trained to recognize 10 different types of crops. Finally, a post-processing step is performed in order to reduce the classification error caused by lower-spatial-resolution images. Experiments were carried over the so-named Campo Verde database, which consists of a set of satellite images captured by Landsat and Sentinel satellites from the municipality of Campo Verde, Brazil. In contrast to the maximum accuracy values reached by remarkable works reported in the literature (amounting to an overall accuracy of about 81%, a f1 score of 75.89%, and average accuracy of 73.35%), the proposed methodology achieves a competitive overall accuracy of 81.20%, a f1 score of 75.89%, and an average accuracy of 88.72% when classifying 10 different crops, while ensuring an adequate trade-off between the number of multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) and accuracy. Furthermore, given its ability to effectively classify patches from two image sequences, this methodology may result appealing for other real-world applications, such as the classification of urban materials. © 2021 by the authors.

The objective was to describe, through land use/land cover change (LUCC), the natural physical processes under current conditions and to project them to 2029. Moreover, temperature and precipitation forecasts were estimated to detail possible effects of climate change. Using remote sensing techniques, satellite images were processed to prepare a projection to 2029. Water recharge was estimated considering the effects of slope, groundcover, and soil texture. Flash floods were estimated using lumped models, concatenating the information to HEC RAS. Water availability was estimated with a semi-distributed hydrological model (SWAT). Precipitation and temperature data were forecasted using autoregressive and exponential smoothing models. Under the forecast, forest and shrub covers show a growth of 6.6%, water recharge projects an increase of 7.16%. Flood flows suffer a reduction of up to 16.54%, and the flow regime with a 90% of probability of exceedance is 1.85% (7.72 l/s) higher for 2029 than for the 2019 scenario, so an improvement in flow regulation is evident. Forecasts show an increase in average temperature of 0.11◦C and 15.63% in extreme rainfall by 2029.

The current study evaluated the impacts of major hydrological interventions of the Zhikong and Pangduo hydropower dams on the Lhasa River, which was exposed in the form of break and change points during the double-mass curve analysis. The coefficient of variability (CV) for the hydro-meteorological variables revealed an enhanced climate change phenomena in the Lhasa River Basin (LRB), where the Lhasa River (LR) discharge varied at a stupendous magnitude from 2000 to 2016. The Mann-Kendall trend and Sen’s slope estimator supported aggravated hydro-meteorological changes in LRB, as the rainfall and LR discharge were found to have been significantly decreasing while temperature was increasing from 2000 to 2016. The Sen’s slope had a largest decrease for LR discharge in relation to the rainfall and temperature, revealing that along with climatic phenomena, additional phenomena are controlling the hydrological regime of the LR. Reservoir functioning in the LR is altering the LR discharge. The Soil andWater Assessment Tool (SWAT) modeling of LR discharge under the reservoir’s influence performed well in terms of coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE), and percent bias (PBIAS). Thus, simulation-based LR discharge could substitute observed LR discharge to help with hydrological data scarcity stress in the LRB. The simulated-observed approach was used to predict future LR discharge for the time span of 2017-2025 using a seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The predicted simulation-based and observation-based discharge were closely correlated and found to decrease from 2017 to 2025.

While developed countries have led the innovation and adoption of digital agriculture, the potential impact in developing countries— including in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region—is massive. This article synthesizes existing evidence to review the potential and current contribution of digital technologies to the agrifood sectors in MENA. Digital agriculture shows promise in addressing the key challenges facing the agri-food sector across MENA countries. Improvements in primary production, supply chain and logistics performance, and optimized use of scarce natural resources (notably agricultural water) could be notable, if digital technologies can be implemented as envisioned. Available evidence shows that adoption of digital agriculture is at early stages, generally led by high-value agricultural production targeting domestic markets in Gulf countries and export markets in Mashreq countries. Economic sustainability appears the strongest force for current adoption, with less focus on social or environmental sustainability. Public policies should not only foster the adoption of digital technologies in MENA but also ensure equity of access, transparency of use, data protections, and labor protections.

Whilst index insurance can help farmers cope with the financial consequences of extreme weather, a major challenge for index insurance is basis risk, where insurance payouts cor-relate poorly with actual crop losses. We analyse to what extent the use of crop simulation models and crop phenology monitoring can reduce basis risk in index insurance. Using a biophysical pro-cess-based crop model (Agricultural Production System sIMulator (APSIM)) applied for rice pro-ducers in Odisha, India, we simulate a synthetic yield dataset to train non-parametric statistical models to predict rice yields as a function of meteorological and phenological conditions. We find that the performance of statistical yield models depends on whether meteorological or phenological conditions are used as predictors and whether one aggregates these predictors by season or crop growth stage. Validating the preferred statistical model with observed yield data, we find that the model explains around 54% of the variance in rice yields at the village cluster (Gram Panchayat) level, outperforming vegetation index-based models that were trained directly on the observed yield data. Our methods and findings can guide efforts to design smart phenology-based index insurance and target yield monitoring resources in smallholder farming environments. © 2021 by the authors.

The Upper Mississippi River Basin was selected to evaluate the effects of subbasin and/or hydrologic response unit (HRU) delineations and the density of climate dataset on the simulated streamflow and water balance components using the Hydrologic and Water Quality System (HAWQS) platform. Five scenarios were examined with the same parameter set, including 8- and 12-digit hydrologic unit codes, two levels of HRU thresholds and two climate data densities. Results showed that statistic evaluations of monthly streamflow from 1983 to 2005 were satisfactory at some gauge sites but were relatively worse at others when shifting from 8-digit to 12-digit subbasins, revealing that the hydrologic response to delineation schemes can vary across a large basin. Average channel slope and drainage density increased significantly from 8-digit to 12-digit subbasins. This resulted in higher lateral flow and groundwater flow estimates, especially for the lateral flow. Moreover, a finer HRU delineation tends to generate more runoff because it captures a refined level of watershed spatial variability.

This study explored the suitability of high spatio-temporal resolution Sentinel-2 imagery and the applicability of advanced machine learning techniques for estimating aboveground biomass at the paddock level in five dairy farms across northern Tasmania, Australia.

Linear least-squares regression was employed for evaluating the results for model calibration and validation. Optimal model performance was realised with an R2 of ≈0.6, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of ≈356 kg dry matter (DM)/ha and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 262 kg DM/ha. These performance markers indicated the results were within the variability of the pasture biomass measured in the field, and therefore represent a relatively high prediction accuracy. Sensitivity analysis further revealed what impact each farm’s in situ measurement, pasture management and grazing practices have on the model’s predictions. The study demonstrated the potential benefits and feasibility of improving biomass estimation in a cheap and rapid manner over traditional field measurement and commonly used remote-sensing methods.

Above all, the container terminal logistics tactical operational complexity is discussed by computational logistics, and the liner handling volume (LHV) has important influences on a series of terminal scheduling decision problems. Subsequently, a feature-extraction-based lightweight convolutional and recurrent neural network adaptive computing model (FEB-LCR-ACM) is presented initially to predict the LHV by the fusion of multiple deep learning algorithms and mechanisms, especially for the specific feature extraction package of tsfresh. Consequently, the container-terminal-oriented logistics service scheduling decision support design paradigm is put forward tentatively by FEB-LCR-ACM. Finally, a typical large-scale container terminal of China is chosen to implement, execute, and evaluate the FEB-LCR-ACM based on the terminal running log around the indicator of LHV. In the case of severe vibration of LHV between 2 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) and 4215 TEUs, while forecasting the LHV of 300 liners by the log of five years, the forecasting error within 100 TEUs almost accounts for 80%. When predicting the operation of 350 ships by the log of six years, the forecasting deviation within 100 TEUs reaches up to nearly 90%. The abovementioned two deep learning experimental performances with FEB-LCR-ACM are so far ahead of the forecasting results by the classical machine learning algorithm that is similar to Gaussian support vector machine. Consequently, the FEB-LCR-ACM achieves sufficiently good performance for the LHV prediction with a lightweight deep learning architecture based on the typical small datasets, and then it is supposed to overcome the operational nonlinearity, dynamics, coupling, and complexity of CTHS partially. © 2021 Bin Li and Yuqing He.",,,Article,Scopus

Several active canopy sensors (ACS) with two or three spectral wavebands have been used for this purpose. The Crop Circle Phenom sensor is a new integrated multi-parameter proximal ACS system for in-field plant phenomics with the capability to measure reflectance, structural, and climatic attributes. The objective of this study was to evaluate this multi-parameter Crop Circle Phenom sensing system for in-season diagnosis of corn (Zea mays L.) N status across different soil drainage and tillage systems under variable N supply conditions. The four plant metrics used to approximate in-season N status consist of aboveground biomass (AGB), plant N concentration (PNC), plant N uptake (PNU), and N nutrition index (NNI). A field experiment was conducted in Wells, Minnesota during the 2018 and the 2019 growing seasons with a split-split plot design replicated four times with soil drainage (drained and undrained) as main block, tillage (conventional, no-till, and strip-till) as split plot, and pre-plant N (PPN) rate (0 to 225 in 45 kg ha−1 increment) as the split-split plot. Crop Circle Phenom measurements alongside destructive whole plant samples were collected at V8 +/−1 growth stage. Proximal sensor metrics were used to construct regression models to estimate N status indicators using simple regression (SR) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) models. The sensor derived indices tested included normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference red edge (NDRE), estimated canopy chlorophyll content (eCCC), estimated leaf area index (eLAI), ratio vegetation index (RVI), canopy chlorophyll content index (CCCI), fractional photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), and canopy and air temperature difference (∆Temp). Management practices such as drainage, tillage, and PPN rate were also included to determine the potential improvement in corn N status diagnosis. Three of the four replicated drained and undrained blocks were randomly selected as training data, and the remaining drained and undrained blocks were used as testing data. The results indicated that SR modeling using NDVI would be sufficient for estimating AGB compared to more complex machine learning methods. Conversely, PNC, PNU, and NNI all benefitted from XGB modeling based on multiple inputs. Among different approaches of XGB modeling, combining management information and Crop Circle Phenom measurements together increased model performance for predicting each of the four plant N metrics compared with solely using sensing data. The PPN rate was the most important management metric for all models compared to drainage and tillage information. Combining Crop Circle Phenom sensor parameters and management information is a promising strategy for in-season diagnosis of corn N status.

Soil extracellular enzymes are one of the most active organic components in soil ecosystem, which is involved in almost all the biochemical reactions. Determining the importance of potential influencing factors of soil extracellular enzymes and thus estimating their activities are important for clarifying the biological mechanism of soil carbon and nitrogen cycling. In this study, the multiple linear regressions (MLR) and random forest (RF) models were conducted to estimate the activities of soil amylase and urease activities using covariates, such as soil water content (SWC), electrical conductivity (EC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and soil organic carbon (SOC) as well as the soil bulk density (BD) and pH. The results reveals that the amylase activity of fishpond was significantly higher than that of other land use types, while the urease activity of rape land, broad bean land, and fishpond were notably higher than that of bare flat, Spartina alterniflora, and uncultivated land. The RF model indicated that the SWC and TN is the main variable affecting amylase and urease activity, respectively. The RF model performed much better than MLR model in estimating the soil amylase and urease activity as it revealed much lower error indices (MAE and RMSE) and higher R2 value. The superiority of RF model in estimating amylase and urease activity is due to its advantages to handle the nonlinear and hierarchical relationships between enzyme activities and covariates, and insensitivity to overfitting and the presence of noise in the data. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coastal reclamation; Multiple linear regression; Random forest model; Soil extracellular enzyme","Decision trees; Fish ponds; Land reclamation; Land use; Linear regression; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Physicochemical properties; Random forests; Soil moisture; Biochemical reactions; Biological mechanisms; Electrical conductivity; Extracellular enzyme activity; Multiple linear regression models; Multiple linear regressions; Soil physico-chemical properties; Spartina alterniflora; Amylases; algorithm; bare soil; comparative study; enzyme; enzyme activity; estimation method; land reclamation; model; multiple regression; physicochemical property; soil ecosystem; soil nutrient; Spartina alterniflora; Vicia faba",Article,Scopus

In this study, we analyze the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) and, in particular, local convolutional neural networks (LCNN) for genomic prediction, as a region-specific filter corresponds much better with our prior genetic knowledge on the genetic architecture of traits than traditional convolutional neural networks. Model performances are evaluated on a simulated maize data panel (n = 10,000; p = 34,595) and real Arabidopsis data (n = 2,039; p = 180,000) for a variety of traits based on their predictive ability. The baseline LCNN, containing one local convolutional layer (kernel size: 10) and two fully connected layers with 64 nodes each, is outperforming commonly proposed ANNs (multi layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks) for basically all considered traits. For traits with high heritability and large training population as present in the simulated data, LCNN are even outperforming state-of-the-art methods like genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), Bayesian models and extended GBLUP, indicated by an increase in predictive ability of up to 24%. However, for small training populations, these state-of-the-art methods outperform all considered ANNs. Nevertheless, the LCNN still outperforms all other considered ANNs by around 10%. Minor improvements to the tested baseline network architecture of the LCNN were obtained by increasing the kernel size and of reducing the stride, whereas the number of subsequent fully connected layers and their node sizes had neglectable impact. Although gains in predictive ability were obtained for large scale data sets by using LCNNs, the practical use of ANNs comes with additional problems, such as the need of genotyping all considered individuals, the lack of estimation of heritability and reliability. Furthermore, breeding values are additive by design, whereas ANN-based estimates are not. However, ANNs also comes with new opportunities, as networks can easily be extended to account for additional inputs (omics, weather etc.) and outputs (multi-trait models), and computing time increases linearly with the number of individuals. With advances in high-throughput phenotyping and cheaper genotyping, ANNs can become a valid alternative for genomic prediction. © Copyright © 2020 Pook, Freudenthal, Korte and Simianer.","breeding; deep learning; genomic selection; Keras; machine learning; phenotype prediction; selection","Arabidopsis; Article; artificial neural network; convolutional neural network; gene frequency; genetic trait; genotype; maize; nonhuman; population size; quality control; simulation; single nucleotide polymorphism; whole genome sequencing",Article,Scopus

In the current research, the weighted additive soil quality index (SQIw), factor analysis (FA), and multiple linear regression (MLR) are used to assess the soil quality of rainfed winter wheat fields with two soil orders on 53.20 km2 of agricultural land in western Iran. A total of 18 soil quality indicators were determined for 100 soil samples (0–20 cm depth) from two soil orders (Inceptisols and Entisols). The soil properties measured were: PH, soil texture, organic carbon (OC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), electrical conductivity (EC), soil microbial respiration (SMR), carbonate calcium equivalent (CCE), soil porosity (SP), bulk density (BD), exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), mean weight diameter (MWD), available potassium (AK), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), available Fe (AFe), available Zn (AZn), available Mn (AMn), and available Cu (ACu). Wheat grain yield for all of the 100 sampling sites was also gathered. The SQIw was calculated using two weighting methods (FA and MLR) and maps were created using a digital soil mapping framework. The soil indicators determined for the minimum data set (MDS) were AK, clay, CEC, AP, SMR, and sand. The correlation between the MLR weighting technique (SQIw-M) and the rainfed wheat yield (r = 0.62) was slightly larger than that the correlation of yield with the FA weighted technique (SQIw-F) (r = 0.58). Results showed that the means of both SQIw-M and SQIw-F and rainfed wheat yield for Inceptisols were higher than for Entisols, although these differences were not statistically significant. Both SQIw-M and SQIw-F showed that areas with Entisols had lower proportions of good soil quality grades (Grades I and II), and higher proportions of poor soil quality grades (Grades IV and V) compared to Inceptisols. Based on these results, soil type must be considered for soil quality assessment in future studies to maintain and enhance soil quality and sustainable production. The overall soil quality of the study region was of poor and moderate grades. To improve soil quality, it is therefore recommended that effective practices such as the implementation of scientifically integrated nutrient management involving the combined use of organic and inorganic fertilizers in rainfed wheat fields should be promoted. © 2020 by the authors.","Big data; Data science; Digital soil mapping; Internet of things (IoT); Machine learning; Multiple linear regression; Principal component analysis; Smart agriculture; Soil quality index; Susceptibility; Sustainable food production; Wheat production",,Article,Scopus

Due to the lack of a high-resolution cropland dataset, impacts of land use change (LUC) on the LMAV ecosystem services have not been fully understood. In this study, we developed a novel framework by integrating the machine learning algorithm, county-level agricultural census, and satellite-based cropland products to reconstruct the LMAV cropland distribution during 1850–2018 at a 30-m resolution. Results showed that the LMAV cropland area increased from 0.78 × 104 km2 in 1850 to 6.64 × 104 km2 in 1980 and then decreased to 6.16 × 104 km2 in 2018. Cropland expansion rate was the largest in the 1960s (749 km2 yr−1) but decreased rapidly thereafter, whereas cropland abandonment rate increased substantially in recent decades with the largest rate of 514 km2 yr−1 in the 2010s. Our dataset has three notable features: (1) the depiction of fine spatial details, (2) the integration of the county-level census, and (3) the inclusion of a machine-learning algorithm trained by satellite-based land cover product. Most importantly, our dataset well captured the continuous increasing trend in cropland area from 1930–1960, which was misrepresented by other cropland datasets reconstructed from the state-level census. Our dataset would be important to accurately evaluate the impacts of historical deforestation and recent afforestation efforts on regional ecosystem services, attribute the observed hydrological changes to anthropogenic and natural driving factors, and investigate how the socioeconomic factors control regional LUC pattern.

Due to a lack of information about crop distribution over large agricultural areas, as well as the crop separation problem (based on remote sensing data) caused by the similarity of phenological cycles, a question arises regarding the relevance of using data obtained from the arable land mask of the region to predict the yield of individual crops. This study aimed to develop a regression model for soybean crop yield monitoring in municipalities and was conducted in the Khabarovsk Territory, located in the Russian Far East. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, an arable land mask, the meteorological characteristics obtained using the VEGA-Science web service, and crop yield data for 2010-2019 were used. The structure of crop distribution in the Khabarovsk District was reproduced in experimental fields, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) seasonal variation approximating functions were constructed (both for total district sown area and different crops). It was found that the approximating function graph for the experimental fields corresponds to a similar graph for arable land. The maximum NDVI forecast error on the 30th week in 2019 using the approximation parameters according to 2014-2018 did not exceed 0.5%. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 0.054. The maximum value of the NDVI, as well as the indicators characterizing the temperature regime, soil moisture, and photosynthetically active radiation in the region during the period from the 1st to the 30th calendar weeks of the year, were previously considered as parameters of the regression model for predicting soybean yield. As a result of the experiments, the NDVI and the duration of the growing season were included in the regression model as independent variables. According to 2010-2018, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the regression model was 6.2%, and the soybean yield prediction absolute percentage error (APE) for 2019 was 6.3%, while RMSE was 0.13 t/ha. This approach was evaluated with a leave-one-year-out cross-validation procedure. When the calculated maximum NDVI value was used in the regression equation for early forecasting, MAPE in the 28th-30th weeks was less than 10%. © 2020 by the authors.","Approximation; Arable land mask; NDVI; Remote sensing; Soybean crop yield","Agricultural robots; Crops; Electromagnetic wave emission; Errors; Food supply; Forecasting; Land use; Logistic regression; Mean square error; Radiometers; Soil moisture; Web services; Independent variables; Mean absolute percentage error; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer datum; Normalized difference vegetation index; Phenological cycles; Photosynthetically active radiation; Root mean square errors; Separation problems; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

In this study, pond-induced impacts on soil erosion and sediment transport were investigated at the scale of the French Claise basin. In order to determine erosion and sediment transport patterns of the Claise, the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) erosion and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models were used. The impact of ponds on the studied processes was revealed by means of land cover change scenarios, using ponded versus pondless inputs. Results show that under current conditions (pond presence), 12.48% of the basin corresponds to no-erosion risk zones (attributed to the dense pond network), while 65.66% corresponds to low-erosion risk, 21.68% to moderate-erosion risk, and only 0.18% to high-erosion risk zones. The SWAT model revealed that ponded sub-basins correspond to low sediment yields areas, in contrast to the pondless sub-basins, which yield appreciably higher erosion rates. Under the alternative pondless scenario, erosion risks shifted to 1.12%, 0.52%, 76.8%, and 21.56% for no, low, moderate, and high-erosion risks, respectively, while the sediment transport pattern completely shifted to higher sediment yield zones.

Previous studies have revealed the close correlation between SIF and terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP), and have used SIF to estimate vegetation GPP. This study investigated the relationship between the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) SIF products at two retrieval bands (SIF757, SIF771) and the autumn crop production in China during the summer of 2015 on different timescales. Subsequently, we evaluated the performance to estimate the autumn crop production of 2016 by using the optimal model developed in 2015. In addition, the OCO-2 SIF was compared with the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation indices (VIs) (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI; enhanced vegetation index, EVI) for predicting the crop production. All the remotely sensed products exhibited the strongest correlation with autumn crop production in July. The OCO-2 SIF757 estimated autumn crop production best (R2 = 0.678, p &lt; 0.01; RMSE = 748.901 ten kilotons; MAE = 567.629 ten kilotons). SIF monitored the crop dynamics better than VIs, although the performances of VIs were similar to SIF. The estimation accuracy was limited by the spatial resolution and discreteness of the OCO-2 SIF products. Our findings demonstrate that SIF is a feasible approach for the crop production estimation and is not inferior to VIs, and suggest that accurate autumn crop production forecasts while using the SIF-based model can be obtained one to two months before the harvest. Furthermore, the proposed method can be widely applied with the development of satellite-based SIF observation technology. © 2019 by the authors.","Crop production; EVI; NDVI; OCO-2; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence","Chlorophyll; Cultivation; Fluorescence; Forecasting; Orbits; Photosynthesis; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Crop production; Enhanced vegetation index; Gross primary productivity; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; NDVI; Normalized difference vegetation index; OCO-2; Crops",Article,Scopus

Irrigation scheduling has the potential to incorporate real-time feedback from soil moisture and climatic sensors. However, for robust closed-loop decision support, models of the soil moisture dynamics are essential in order to predict crop water needs while adapting to external perturbation and disturbances. This paper presents a Dynamic Neural Network approach for modelling of the temporal soil moisture fluxes. The models are trained to generate a one-day-ahead prediction of the volumetric soil moisture content based on past soil moisture, precipitation, and climatic measurements. Using field data from three sites, a R2 value above 0.94 was obtained during model evaluation in all sites. The models were also able to generate robust soil moisture predictions for independent sites which were not used in training the models. The application of the Dynamic Neural Network models in a predictive irrigation scheduling system was demonstrated using AQUACROP simulations of the potato-growing season. The predictive irrigation scheduling system was evaluated against a rule-based system that applies irrigation based on predefined thresholds. Results indicate that the predictive system achieves a water saving ranging between 20 and 46% while realizing a yield and water use efficiency similar to that of the rule-based system. © 2018 by the authors.

We applied a scaling approach to capture changes in climate extremes with increase in global mean temperature in several subregions within the WAF domain: Western Sahel, Central Sahel, Eastern Sahel, Guinea Coast and Central Africa including Congo Basin. While there are several uncertainties and large ensemble spread in the projections of temperature and precipitation indices, most models show high-impact changes in climate extremes at subregional scale. At these smaller scales, temperature increases within the WAF domain are projected to be higher than the global mean temperature increase (at 1.5 °C and at 2 °C) and heat waves are expected to be more frequent and of longer duration. The most intense warming is observed over the drier regions of the Sahel, in the central Sahel and particularly in the eastern Sahel, where the precipitation and the soil moisture anomalies have the highest probability of projected increase at a global warming of 1.5 °C. Over the wetter regions of the Guinea Coast and Central Africa, models project a weak change in total precipitation and a decrease of the length of wet spells, while these two regions have the highest increase of heavy rainfall in the WAF domain at a global warming of 1.5 °C. Western Sahel is projected by 80% of the models to experience the strongest drying with a significant increase in the length of dry spells and a decrease in the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index.

A multiobjective calibration was applied to each algorithm and optimized parameter sets were validated over an excluded period, as well as in a transfer experiment to a nearby catchment to explore parameter robustness. Algorithm performance showed consistent decreases when parameter sets were applied to periods with greatly differing SSL variability relative to the calibration period. Of interest was a joint calibration of all sediment algorithm and streamflow parameters simultaneously, from which trade-offs between streamflow performance and partitioning of runoff and base flow to optimize SSL timing were noted, decreasing the flexibility and robustness of the streamflow to adapt to different time periods. Parameter transferability to another catchment was most successful in more process-oriented algorithms, the HSPF and the DHSVM. This first-of-its-kind multialgorithm sediment scheme offers a unique capability to portray acute episodic loading while quantifying trade-offs and uncertainties across a range of algorithm structures. © 2017.

However, a shift in land use from cotton to perennial grasses and a change in land management such as the harvesting of mesquite for biofuel production can significantly affect regional hydrology and water quality. In this study, APEX and SWAT models were integrated to assess the impacts of replacing cotton with Alamo switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and Miscanthus × giganteus in the upstream subwatershed and harvesting mesquite in the downstream subwatershed on water and nitrogen balances in the Double Mountain Fork Brazos watershed in the SHP and TRP regions. Simulated average (1994–2009) annual surface runoff from the baseline cotton areas decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) by 88%, and percolation increased by 28% under the perennial grasses scenario compared to the baseline cotton scenario. The soil water content enhanced significantly under the irrigated switchgrass scenario compared to the baseline irrigated cotton scenario from January to April and August to October. However, the soil water content was depleted significantly under the dryland Miscanthus scenario from April to July relative to the baseline dryland cotton scenario. The nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and organic-N loads in surface runoff and NO3-N leaching to groundwater reduced significantly by 86%, 98%, and 100%, respectively, under the perennial grasses scenario. Similarly, surface runoff, and NO3-N and organic-N loads through surface runoff reduced significantly by 98.9%, 99.9%, and 99.5%, respectively, under the post-mesquite-harvest scenario. Perennial grasses exhibited superior ethanol production potential compared to mesquite. However, mesquite is an appropriate supplementary bioenergy source in the TRP region because of its standing biomass and rapid regrowth characteristics. © 2017 The Authors.

Climate change is likely to have an impact on the availability of water and therefore on sediment yield in catchments. In this context, quantifying the sediment response to an increased atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate change is of utmost importance to the proper management of rural catchments. However, quantitative assessment of climate change impact remains a complex task. In this study, the potential medium (2031-2060) and long-term (2069-2098) impacts of projected changes of temperature, rainfall and CO2 concentration on sediment yield in a small rural catchment located in NW Spain were evaluated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Climate change scenarios were created using future climate data projected by regional climate models from the ENSEMBLES project and two CO2 concentration scenarios (550 and 660 ppm). The results showed that climate change would have a noticeable impact on suspended sediment if the forecast temperature, rainfall and CO2 concentration changes included in this study were met. Overall, suspended sediment is expected to decrease (2031-2060: -11%, 2069-2098: -8%) compared to the baseline period (1981-2010), mainly due to decreased streamflow. However, an increase in sediment transport in winter is predicted, possibly associated with increased erosion in cultivated areas (11%-17%), suggesting that, at this time of the year, the effect of soil detachment prevails over sediment transport capacity. Consequently, management practices aimed at reducing soil erosion in cultivated areas should be carried out, because these are the main source of sediment in the study area. © 2016 by the authors.","Climate change; Rural catchment; Suspended sediment; SWAT model","Atmospheric composition; Carbon dioxide; Catchments; Climate models; Erosion; Rain; Runoff; Rural areas; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Sediments; Soils; Suspended sediments; Climate change scenarios; Quantitative assessments; Regional climate models; Rural catchments; Sediment transport capacity; Soil and water assessment tool; Suspended sediment yields; SWAT model; Climate change; carbon dioxide; catchment; climate change; concentration (composition); quantitative analysis; sediment transport; sediment yield; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; suspended sediment; water availability; Corbeira Stream; Galicia [Spain]; La Coruna [Galicia]; Spain",Article,Scopus

The method devises a multivariate statistical model to compute bias and uncertainty in forecasted yield at the Census of Agricultural Region (CAR) scale across the Canadian Prairies. The method uses robust variable-selection to select the best predictors within spatial subregions. Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and random forest-tree machine learning techniques are then integrated to generate sequential forecasts through the growing season. Cross-validation of the model was performed by hindcasting/backcasting and comparing forecasts against available historical data (1987-2011) for spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The model was also validated for the 2012 growing season by comparing forecast skill at the CAR, provincial and Canadian Prairie region scales against available statistical survey data. Mean percent departures between wheat yield forecasted were under-estimated by 1-4% in mid-season and over-estimated by 1% at the end of the growing season. This integrated methodology offers a consistent, generalizable approach for sequentially forecasting crop yield at the regional-scale. It provides a statistically robust, yet flexible way to concurrently adjust to data-rich and data-sparse situations, adaptively select different predictors of yield to changing levels of environmental uncertainty, and to update forecasts sequentially so as to incorporate new data as it becomes available. This integrated method also provides additional statistical support for assessing the accuracy and reliability of model-based crop yield forecasts in time and space. © 2014 Newlands, Zamar, Kouadio, Zhang, Chipanshi, Potgieter, Toure and Hill.","Agriculture; Bayesian; Climate; Crop yield; Forecasting; Regional; Uncertainty",,Article,Scopus

In the Midwestern United States, urban area, farmland, and dedicated energy crop (e.g., switchgrass) cultivation are predicted to expand in the coming decades, which will lead to changes in hydrological processes. This study is designed to (1) project the land use and land cover (LULC) by mid-century using the FORecasting SCEnarios of future land-use (FORE-SCE) model under the A1B greenhouse gas emission scenario (future condition) and (2) assess its potential impacts on the water cycle and water quality against the 2001 baseline condition in the Cedar River Basin using the physically based soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). We compared the baseline LULC (National Land Cover data 2001) and 2050 projection, indicating substantial expansions of urban area and pastureland (including the cultivation of bioenergy crops) and a decrease in rangeland. We then used the above two LULC maps as the input data to drive the SWAT model, keeping other input data (e.g., climate) unchanged to isolate the LULC change impacts. The modeling results indicate that quick-response surface runoff would increase significantly (about 10.5%) due to the projected urban expansion (i.e., increase in impervious areas), and the baseflow would decrease substantially (about 7.3%) because of the reduced infiltration. Although the net effect may cause an increase in water yield, the increased variability may impede its use for public supply. Additionally, the cultivation of bioenergy crops such as switchgrass in the newly added pasture lands may further reduce the soil water content and lead to an increase in nitrogen loading (about 2.5% increase) due to intensified fertilizer application. These study results will be informative to decision makers for sustainable water resource management when facing LULC change and an increasing demand for biofuel production in this area. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.","biofuel production; hydrological process; land cover change; SWAT; water quantity and quality","Biofuels; Climate models; Crops; Digital storage; Earth (planet); Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Input output programs; Land use; Plants (botany); Rain; Soil moisture; Water conservation; Water management; Water quality; Watersheds; Biofuel production; Hydrological process; Land-cover change; SWAT; Water quantities; Climate change; atmospheric forcing; biofuel; cultivation; energy crop; environmental impact; fertilizer application; human activity; infiltration; land cover; land use change; numerical model; oil production; pasture; rangeland; runoff; water management; water resource; Cedar Basin; United States; Panicum virgatum",Article,Scopus

Since impact models are highly sensitive to input climate data, GCM skill is crucial for getting better short-, medium- and long-term outlooks for agricultural production and food security. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) phase 5 ensemble is likely to underpin the majority of climate impact assessments over the next few years. We assess 24 CMIP3 and 26 CMIP5 simulations of present climate against climate observations for five tropical regions, as well as regional improvements in model skill and, through literature review, the sensitivities of impact estimates to model error. Climatological means of seasonal mean temperatures depict mean errors between 1 and 18 ° C (2-130% with respect to mean), whereas seasonal precipitation and wet-day frequency depict larger errors, often offsetting observed means and variability beyond 100%. Simulated interannual climate variability in GCMs warrants particular attention, given that no single GCM matches observations in more than 30% of the areas for monthly precipitation and wet-day frequency, 50% for diurnal range and 70% for mean temperatures. We report improvements in mean climate skill of 5-15% for climatological mean temperatures, 3-5% for diurnal range and 1-2% in precipitation. At these improvement rates, we estimate that at least 5-30 years of CMIP work is required to improve regional temperature simulations and at least 30-50 years for precipitation simulations, for these to be directly input into impact models.

The aim of Smart Farming is to provide tools for various agricultural and farming operations to improve yield by reducing cost, waste, and required manpower. SF is a data-driven approach that can mitigate losses that occur due to extreme weather conditions and calamities. The influx of data from various sensors, and the introduction of information communication technologies (ICTs) in the field of farming has accelerated the implementation of disruptive technologies (DTs) such as machine learning and big data. Application of these predictive and innovative tools in agriculture is crucial for handling unprecedented conditions such as climate change and the increasing global population. In this study, we review the recent advancements in the field of Smart Farming, which include novel use cases and projects around the globe. An overview of the challenges associated with the adoption of such technologies in their respective regions is also provided. A brief analysis of the general sentiment towards Smart Farming technologies is also performed by manually annotating YouTube comments and making use of the pattern library. Preliminary findings of our study indicate that, though there are several barriers to the implementation of SF tools, further research and innovation can alleviate such risks and ensure sustainability of the food supply.

As a result, many laboratories have developed high-throughput SNP assays and built high-density genetic maps. However, the number of markers may, by orders of magnitude, exceed the resolution of recombination for a given population size so that only a minority of markers can accurately be ordered. Another issue attached to the so-called ‘large p, small n’ problem is that high-density genetic maps inevitably result in many markers clustering at the same position (cosegregating markers). While there are a number of related papers, none have addressed the impact of co-segregating markers on genetic maps. In the present study, we investigated the effects of co-segregating markers on high-density genetic map length and marker order using empirical data from two populations of wheat, Mohawk × Cocorit (durum wheat) and Norstar × Cappelle Desprez (bread wheat). The maps of both populations consisted of 85% co-segregating markers. Our study clearly showed that excess of co-segregating markers can lead to map expansion, but has little effect on markers order. To estimate the inflation factor (IF), we generated a total of 24,473 linkage maps (8,203 maps for Mohawk × Cocorit and 16,270 maps for Norstar × Cappelle Desprez). Using seven machine learning algorithms, we were able to predict with an accuracy of 0.7 the map expansion due to the proportion of co-segregating markers. For example in Mohawk × Cocorit, with 10 and 80% co-segregating markers the length of the map inflated by 4.5 and 16.6%, respectively. Similarly, the map of Norstar × Cappelle Desprez expanded by 3.8 and 11.7% with 10 and 80% co-segregating markers. With the increasing number of markers on SNP-chips, the proportion of co-segregating markers in high-density maps will continue to increase making map expansion unavoidable. Therefore, we suggest developers improve linkage mapping algorithms for efficient analysis of high-throughput data. This study outlines a practical strategy to estimate the IF due to the proportion of co-segregating markers and outlines a method to scale the length of the map accordingly. © 2017 N’Diaye, Haile, Fowler, Ammar and Pozniak.","Genetic map; High-density; Inflation factor; Machine learning; Map expansion; Prediction; Single nucleotide polymorphism; Wheat",,Article,Scopus

They constitute primary staple crops in drylands, where their production is known to date back over 5000 years ago. Compared to other crops, millets and sorghum have received less attention until very recently, and their production has been progressively reduced in the last 50 years. Here, we present new models that focus on the ecological factors driving finger millet, pearl millet and sorghum traditional cultivation, with a global perspective. The interaction between environment and traditional agrosystems was investigated by Redundancy Analysis of published literature and tested against novel ethnographic data. Contrary to earlier beliefs, our models show that the total annual precipitation is not the most determinant factor in shaping millet and sorghum agriculture. Instead, our results point to the importance of other variables such as the duration of the plant growing cycle, soil water-holding capacity or soil nutrient availability. This highlights the potential of finger millet, pearl millet and sorghum traditional cultivation practices as a response to recent increase of aridity levels worldwide.

RGB (Red-Green-Blue) based canopy height measurement (CHM) and vegetation indices (VIs) were estimated from a UAS platform. Time series and cumulative VIs, by both summation (ΣVI-SUMs) and area under the curve (ΣVI-AUCs), were fit via machine learning regression modeling (random forest, linear, ridge, lasso, elastic net regressions) to estimate grain yield. VIs were more valuable predictors of yield to combine different environments than CHM. Time series VIs and CHM produced high accuracies (~68-72%), but inconsistent models. A little sacrifice in accuracy (~60-65%) produced consistent models using ΣVI-SUMs and CHM during pre-reproductive vegetative growth. Absence of VIs produced poorer accuracies (by about ~5-10%). Normalized difference type VIs produced maximum accuracies, and flowering times were the best times for UAS data acquisition. This study suggests that the best yielding varieties can be accurately predicted in new environments at or before flowering when combining multiple temporal flights and predictors.

A fast and reliable estimation of SOM is important to predict the soil carbon stock in cropland. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential of combining multitemporal Sentinel-2A imagery and random forest (RF) to improve the accuracy of SOM estimates in the plough layer for cultivated land at a regional scale. The field data of SOM content were utilized along with multitemporal Sentinel-2A images acquired over three years during the bare soil period to develop spectral indices. The best bands and spectral indices were selected as prediction variables by using the RF algorithm. Partial least squares (PLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR), and RF were employed to calibrate spectral indices for the SOM content, and the optimal calibration model was used for the mapping of the SOM content in arable land at a regional scale. The results showed the following. (1) The multitemporal image estimation model outperformed the single-temporal image estimation model. The estimation model that utilized the optimal bands and spectral indices as prediction variables usually had better accuracy than the models based on full spectral data. (2) For the SOM content estimates, the performance was better with RF than with PLS and GWR in almost all cases. (3) The most accurate SOM estimation in the case area was achieved by using multitemporal images from 2018 and the RF calibration model based on the optimal bands and spectral indices as prediction variables, with R2val (coefficient of determination of the validation data set) = 0.67, RMSEval (root mean square error of the validation dataset) = 2.05, and RPIQval (ratio of performance to interquartile range of the validation dataset) = 3.36. (4) The estimated SOM content in the plough layer for cultivated land throughout the study area ranged from 16.17 to 36.98 g kg−1 and exhibited an increasing trend from north to south. In the current study, we developed a framework that combines multitemporal remote sensing imagery and RF for the SOM estimation, which can improve the accuracy of quantitative SOM estimations, provide a dynamic, rapid, and low-cost technique for understanding soil fertility, and offer an early warning of changes in soil quality. © 2022 by the authors.","cultivated land; random forest; Sentinel-2A; soil organic matter; spectral indices",,Article,Scopus

Methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC) was employed as a frother for generating MNBs through hydrodynamic cavitation. The significance of the operating variables, including impeller speed, air flow rate, together with the bubble size, and particle size on the flotation recovery was assessed using historical data (HD) design and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The correlation between the flotation parameters and process response in the presence and absence of MNBs was modeled using hybrid convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as the deep learning (DL) frameworks to automatically extract features from input data using a CNN as the base layer. The ANOVA results indicated that all variables affect process responses statistically and meaningfully. Significant interactions were found between air flow rate and particle size as well as impeller speed and MNB size. It was found that a CNN-RNN model could finally be used to model the process based on the intelligent simulation results.

The causing parasites are affixed to the skin through defiled water and enter the human body. Failure to diagnose Schistosomiasis can result in various medical complications, such as ascites, portal hypertension, esophageal varices, splenomegaly, and growth retardation. Early prediction and identification of risk factors may aid in treating disease before it becomes incurable. We aimed to create a framework by incorporating the most significant features to predict Schistosomiasis using machine learning techniques. A dataset of advanced Schistosomiasis has been employed containing recovery and death cases. A total data of 4316 individuals containing recovery and death cases were included in this research. The dataset contains demographics, socioeconomic, and clinical factors with lab reports. Data preprocessing techniques (missing values imputation, outlier removal, data normalisation, and data transformation) have also been employed for better results. Feature selection techniques, including correlation-based feature selection, Information gain, gain ratio, ReliefF, and OneR, have been utilised to minimise a large number of features. Data resampling algorithms, including Random undersampling, Random oversampling, Cluster Centroid, Near miss, and SMOTE, are applied to address the data imbalance problem. We applied four machine learning algorithms to construct the model: Gradient Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting and CatBoost. The performance of the proposed framework has been evaluated based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-Score. The results of our proposed framework stated that the CatBoost model showed the best performance with the highest accuracy of (87.1%) compared with Gradient Boosting (86%), Light Gradient Boosting (86.7%) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (86.9%).

This study explored the potential of a consumer-grade DJI Phantom 4 Multispectral (P4M) camera for yield or NUE assessment in winter wheat by using the universal vegetation indices independent of growth period. Three vegetation indices having a strong correlation with yield or NUE during the entire growth season were determined through Pearson’s correlational analysis, while multiple linear regression (MLR), stepwise MLR (SMLR), and partial least-squares regression (PLSR) methods based on the aforementioned vegetation indices were adopted during different growth periods. The cumulative results showed that the reciprocal ratio vegetation index (repRVI) had a high potential for yield assessment throughout the growing season, and the late grain-filling stage was deemed as the optimal single stage with R2, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.85, 793.96 kg/ha, and 656.31 kg/ha, respectively. MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI) performed better in the vegetative period and provided the best prediction results for the N partial factor productivity (NPFP) at the jointing stage, with R2, RMSE, and MAE of 0.65, 10.53 kg yield/kg N, and 8.90 kg yield/kg N, respectively. At the same time, the modified normalized difference blue index (mNDblue) was more accurate during the reproductive period, providing the best accuracy for agronomical NUE (aNUE) assessment at the late grain-filling stage, with R2, RMSE, and MAE of 0.61, 7.48 kg yield/kg N, and 6.05 kg yield/kg N, respectively. Furthermore, the findings indicated that model accuracy cannot be improved by increasing the number of input features. Overall, these results indicate that the consumer-grade P4M camera is suitable for early and efficient monitoring of important crop traits, providing a cost-effective choice for the development of the precision agricultural system.

However, the contributions of proximal sensing data characteristics (spectral, temporal, and spatial) to yield estimation have not been systematically evaluated. We collected long-term, hyper-temporal, and large-volume light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and multispectral data to (i) identify the best machine learning method and prediction stage for wheat yield estimation, (ii) characterize the contribution of multisource data fusion and the dynamic importance of structural and spectral traits to yield estimation, and (iii) elucidate the contribution of time-series data fusion and 3D spatial information to yield estimation. Wheat yield could be accurately (R2 = 0.891) and timely (approximately-two months before harvest) estimated from fused LiDAR and multispectral data. The artificial neural network model and the flowering stage were always the best method and prediction stage, respectively. Spectral traits (such as CIgreen) dominated yield estimation, especially in the early stage, whereas the contribution of structural traits (such as height) was more stable in the late stage. Fusing spectral and structural traits increased estimation accuracy at all growth stages. Better yield estimation was realized from traits derived from complete 3D points than from canopy surface points and from integrated multi-stage (especially from jointing to heading and flowering stages) data than from single-stage data. We suggest that this study offers a novel perspective on deciphering the contributions of spectral, structural, and time-series information to wheat yield estimation and can guide accurate, efficient, and timely estimation of wheat yield. © 2022 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS","Hyper-temporal; LiDAR; Multispectral; Phenotype; Yield",,Article,Scopus

To date, very little attention has been paid to mapping the seasonal leaf C, N, and P of mangrove forests with remote sensing techniques. Based on Sentinel-2 images taken in spring, summer, and winter, this study aimed to compare three machine learning models (XGBoost, extreme gradient boosting; RF, random forest; LightGBM, light gradient boosting machine) in estimating the three leaf nutrients and further to apply the best-performing model to map the leaf nutrients of 15 seasons from 2017 to 2021. The results showed that there were significant differences in leaf nutrients (p &lt; 0.05) across the three seasons. Among the three machine learning models, XGBoost with sensitive spectral features of Sentinel-2 images was optimal for estimating the leaf C (R2 = 0.655, 0.799, and 0.829 in spring, summer, and winter, respectively), N (R2 = 0.668, 0.743, and 0.704) and P (R2 = 0.539, 0.622, and 0.596) over the three seasons. Moreover, the red-edge (especially B6) and near-infrared bands (B8 and B8a) of Sentinel-2 images were efficient estimators of mangrove leaf nutrients. The information of species, elevation, and canopy structure (leaf area index [LAI] and canopy height) would be incorporated into the present model to improve the model accuracy and transferability in future studies. © 2022 by the authors.","mangrove; red edge; seasonal leaf nutrients; Sentinel-2 image; XGBoost","Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Infrared devices; Machine learning; Nutrients; Remote sensing; C sequestration; Gradient boosting; Leaf nutrients; Machine learning models; Mangrove; Mangrove forest; Red edge; Seasonal leaf nutrient; Sentinel-2 image; Xgboost; Mapping",Article,Scopus

Nowadays, satellite remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) can enable the estimation of these crop production parameters over large geographic areas. The present work aims to estimate the wheat (Triticum aestivum) acreage and yield of Maharajganj, Uttar Pradesh, India, using satellite-based data products and the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model. Uttar Pradesh is the largest wheat-producing state in India, and this district is well known for its quality organic wheat. India is the leader in wheat grain export, and, hence, its monitoring of growth and yield is one of the top economic priorities of the country. For the calculation of wheat acreage, we performed supervised classification using the Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine classifiers and compared their classification accuracy based on ground-truthing. We found that RF performed a significantly accurate acreage assessment (kappa coefficient 0.84) compared to SVM (0.68). The CASA model was then used to calculate the winter crop (Rabi, winter-sown, and summer harvested) wheat net primary productivity (NPP) in the study area for the 2020–2021 growth season using the RF-based acreage product. The model used for wheat NPP-yield conversion (CASA) showed 3100.27 to 5000.44 kg/ha over 148,866 ha of the total wheat area. The results showed that in the 2020–2021 growing season, all the districts of Uttar Pradesh had similar wheat growth trends. A total of 30 observational data points were used to verify the CASA model-based estimates of wheat yield. Field-based verification shows that the estimated yield correlates well with the observed yield (R2 = 0.554, RMSE = 3.36 Q/ha, MAE −0.56 t ha−1, and MRE = −4.61%). Such an accuracy for assessing regional wheat yield can prove to be one of the promising methods for calculating the whole region’s agricultural yield. The study concludes that RF classifier-based yield estimation has shown more accurate results and can meet the requirements of a regional-scale wheat grain yield estimation and, thus, can prove highly beneficial in policy and decision making. © 2022 by the authors.

Auto-Irr generally performed better than Well-Irr in simulating groundwater irrigation volume (reducing the mean bias from 86 to −30%) and groundwater level (reducing the normalized root-mean-square-error from 13.55 to 12.47%) across the NHP, as well as streamflow interannual variations at two stations (increasing NSE from 0.51, 0.51 to 0.55, 0.53). We also examined the effects of groundwater irrigation on the water cycle. Based on simulation results from Auto-Irr, historical irrigation led to significant recharge along the Elkhorn and Platte rivers. On average over the entire NHP, irrigation increased surface runoff, evapotranspiration, soil moisture and groundwater recharge by 21.3%, 4.0%, 2.5% and 1.5%, respectively.

Glass-fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars are a durable alternative to conventional steel rebars; however, they are susceptible to degradation in a harsh alkaline concrete environment. This study aims to develop three soft computing techniques, namely minimax probability machine regression (MPMR), deep neural network (DNN), and integrated adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system with genetic algorithm (ANFIS-GA), to estimate accurate tensile strength retention (TSR) of conditioned GFRP rebars in the aggressive alkaline concrete environment. The sensitivity of production parameters of GFRP rebars and environmental factors in estimating TSR is also discussed. Statistical analyses, e.g. root mean square error (RMSE) and determination coefficient (R2), are used to assess the proposed models' accuracy. The predictions from the developed models manifested a reliable agreement to the experimental results. In comparison, the developed DNN and hybrid ANFIS-GA algorithms outperformed MPMR. The RMSE and R2 are (8.16% and 78.22), (7.42% and 76.04), and (7.53% and 75.00) for the ANFIS-GA, DNN, and MPMR, respectively. The DNN and ANFIS-GA were also compared with the previous approaches developed in the literature. The superior performance of DNN and ANFIS-GA was observed with a maximum model error approach of 10.71%. Furthermore, the sensitivity of temperature and pH of the conditioning environment significantly affect the TSR of GFRP bars.

The present study attempts to understand the consequences of existing changing patterns of climate and LULC on the hydrology of the Usri watershed. Different water balance components were simulated using a semi-distributed Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Sixteen scenarios were generated using combinations of four periods of climatic data (1974–84; 1985–1995; 1996–2006 and 2007–2016) and four sets of land use maps (1976; 1989; 2000 and 2014). The SWAT model performed well for monthly stream flows during calibration and validation. The study finds that the individual impact of LULC change contributes to increase in the streamflow and decrease in evapotranspiration (ET) primarily due to increase in urbanization and decrease in water bodies, forest cover and barren land of Usri watershed. The combined impact of climatic variations and land use change reveals complex interactions. The study provides insight into hydrological response to variations in climate and land use changes in Usri watershed in recent decades.

To address these issues, we develop a multilevel LC contextual (MLCC) framework that can adaptively integrate the effective global context with the local context for LC classification. The MLCC framework comprises two modules: a DCNN-based LC classification network (DLCN) and a multilevel context integration module (MCIM). By a well-defined deep network, DLCN could enhance the effective global context feature while weakening the ambiguous representation. Besides, MCIM enables adaptive combinate the global and local context under the guidance of uncertainty map in an efficient way. This collaboratively global–local contextual information further boosts the discriminate feature representation for effective and efficient LC classification. The experiments on LC datasets demonstrate that the proposed MLCC has superior capability in capturing contextual features and thus outperforms the existing methods. © 2022","Contextual information; Deep convolutional neural networks(DCNNs); Feature fusion; Land cover(LC) classification","artificial neural network; image processing; land classification; land cover; remote sensing",Article,Scopus

Added water also cools crop plants through transpiration; irrigation might thus play an important role in a warmer climate by simultaneously moderating water and high temperature stresses. Here we used satellite-derived evapotranspiration estimates, land surface temperature (LST) measurements, and crop phenological stage information from Nebraska maize to quantify how irrigation relieves both water and temperature stresses. Unlike air temperature metrics, satellite-derived LST revealed a significant irrigation-induced cooling effect, especially during the grain filling period (GFP) of crop growth. This cooling appeared to extend the maize growing season, especially for GFP, likely due to the stronger temperature sensitivity of phenological development during this stage. Our analysis also revealed that irrigation not only reduced water and temperature stress but also weakened the response of yield to these stresses. Specifically, temperature stress was significantly weakened for reproductive processes in irrigated maize. Attribution analysis further suggested that water and high temperature stress alleviation was responsible for 65±10% and 35±5.3% of the irrigation yield benefit, respectively. Our study underlines the relative importance of high temperature stress alleviation in yield improvement and the necessity of simulating crop surface temperature to better quantify heat stress effects in crop yield models. Finally, considering the potentially strong interaction between water and heat stress, future research on irrigation benefits should explore the interaction effects between heat and drought alleviation. © 2022 The Author(s).",,"Atmospheric temperature; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Satellites; Surface properties; Thermal stress; Water supply; Yield stress; Grain-filling periods; Heat stress; High temperature stress; Irrigation effects; Land surface temperature; Satellite data; Stress alleviation; Temperature stress; Water stress; Water temperatures; Crops; air temperature; climate change; crop yield; drought; evapotranspiration; food production; irrigation; land surface; maize; satellite data; stress analysis; surface temperature; water demand; Nebraska; United States",Article,Scopus

In each phenological period, the vegetation indices and meteorological factors were optimized. Then the accuracy and spatiotemporal transferability of the phenological piecewise modelling was compared with that of the whole-season modelling based on four regression methods (i.e. multiple linear regression, artificial neural network, support vector regression and random forest). The results showed that the optimal combinations of variables for the whole-season modelling and the phenological piecewise modelling were different.

Several analytical models using artificial intelligence (AI) have been developed to resolve challenges facing the banana supply chain. The number of publications in this field has steadily increased each year. However, a literature review regarding the trends of recent AI developments is not available. Thus, this study reviews the current scenario of scientific research involving AI in the stages of the banana supply chain (pre-harvest, harvest, post-harvest, processing and retail). This review covers literature published between 2015 and 2020 from online databases. Fifty-two relevant studies were retrieved from 23 countries. Consequently, we propose an AI-performance framework based on real applications implemented for bananas: the application domain, learning algorithms, performance metrics, and reported impacts. This paper discovers 11 AI-application areas for bananas, such as ripeness, leaf diseases, quality grading, crop type, crop yield, and soil control. Moreover, this review summarizes the main functionality of learning algorithms found in the literature (ANN, CNN, SVM, and K-NN). Finally, the future challenges are discussed. This comprehensive review will help researchers understand AI applications in the banana sector and analyze the knowledge gap for future studies. © 2022.

The purpose of this study was to generate and compare management zones (MZ) based on the Sentinel-2 satellite data for variable rate application of mineral nitrogen in wheat production, calculated using different remote sensing (RS)-based models under varied soil, yield and crop data availability. Three models were applied, including (1) a modified “RS- and threshold-based clustering”, (2) a “hybrid-based, unsupervised clustering”, in which data from different sources were combined for MZ delineation, and (3) a “RS-based, unsupervised clustering”. Various data processing methods including machine learning were used in the model development. Statistical tests such as the Paired Sample T-test, Kruskal-Wallis H-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were applied to evaluate the final delineated MZ maps. Additionally, a procedure for improving models based on information about phenological phases and the occurrence of agricultural drought was implemented. The results showed that information on agronomy and climate enables improving and optimizing MZ delineation. The integration of prior knowledge on new climate conditions (drought) in image selection was tested for effective use of the models. Lack of this information led to the infeasibility of obtaining optimal results. Models that solely rely on remote sensing information are comparatively less expensive than hybrid models. Additionally, remote sensing-based models enable delineating MZ for fertilizer recommendations that are temporally closer to fertilization times. © 2021 by the authors.","Clustering; Digital agriculture; Drought; Management zones; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Winter wheat",,Article,Scopus

Here, we first analyzed the spectral differences between MDMV-infected red leaves and healthy leaves and constructed a sensitive index (SI) for measurements. Next, based on the characteristic bands (Rλ) associated with leaf an-thocyanins (Anth), we determined vegetation indices (VIs) commonly used in plant physiological and biochemical parameter inversion and established a vegetation index (VIc) by utilizing the combination of two arbitrary bands following the construction principles of NDVI, DVI, RVI, and SAVI. Furthermore, we developed classification models based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) in order to distinguish the red leaves from healthy leaves. Finally, we performed UR, MLR, PLSR, PCR, and SVM simulations on Anth based on Rλ, VIs, VIc, and Rλ + VIs + VIc and indirectly estimated the severity of MDMV infection based on the relationship between the reflection spectra and Anth. Distinct from those of the normal leaves, the spectra of red leaves showed strong reflectance characteristics at 640 nm, and SI increased with increasing Anth. Moreover, the accuracy of the two VIc-based classification models was 100%, which is significantly higher than that of the VIs and Rλ-based models. Among the Anth regression models, the accuracy of the MLR model based on Rλ + VIs + VIc was the highest (R2c = 0.85; R2v = 0.74). The developed models could accurately identify MDMV and estimate the severity of its in-fection, laying the theoretical foundation for large-scale remote sensing-based monitoring of this virus in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

A wide range of input data are often needed to forecast crop yield in a region where sophisticated approaches such as machine learning and process-based models are used. This requires considerable effort for data preparation in addition to identifying data sources. Here, we propose a simpler approach called the Analogy Based Crop-yield (ABC) forecast scheme to make timely and accurate prediction of regional crop yield using a minimum set of inputs. In the ABC method, a growing season from a prior long-term period, e.g., 10 years, is first identified as analogous to the current season by the use of a similarity index based on the time series leaf area index (LAI) patterns. Crop yield in the given growing season is then forecasted using the weighted yield average reported in the analogous seasons for the area of interest. The ABC approach was used to predict corn and soybean yields in the Midwestern U.S. at the county level for the period of 2017–2019. The MOD15A2H, which is a satellite data product for LAI, was used to compile inputs. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of crop yield forecasts was <10% for corn and soybean in each growing season when the time series of LAI from the day of year 89 to 209 was used as inputs to the ABC approach. The prediction error for the ABC approach was comparable to results from a deep neural network model that relied on soil and weather data as well as satellite data in a previous study. These results indicate that the ABC approach allowed for crop yield forecast with a lead-time of at least two months before harvest. In particular, the ABC scheme would be useful for regions where crop yield forecasts are limited by availability of reliable environmental data. © 2021 by the authors.

The number of PAs has increased remarkably over the last few decades. Yet, biodiversity is still being lost at alarming rates, even within many of those PAs. Understanding the factors that influence the levels of human pressure within PAs remains a key objective. In this study, we examined the factors associated with the human settlements' levels within the world's PAs. Using the random forests technique, an ensemble machine learning method, and a vast number of PAs (81 100-137 523), we assessed the importance of nine factors, including the PAs' management objective as reflected by their International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Category. The IUCN classifies PAs into six categories ranging from strict nature reserves to areas in which multiple human uses are permitted. The prevalent but untested assumption is that human settlements' levels within PAs vary according to their management objective, with less strict PAs having higher levels. Our results, however, show that the differences between the categories were for the most part minor. The most important predictor of human settlements was accessibility measured as the time required to reach the PA from the nearest major city. These findings were consistent across all of the world's subregions. Other less important factors included the extent of croplands within PAs, elevation, and slope. Our findings suggest that PAs nearer urban centers tend to have higher human settlements' levels regardless of their other characteristics, such as management objective and year of establishment. Managing those PAs successfully will be necessary to achieve the post-2020 global biodiversity targets and will require conservation strategies that acknowledge and engage the local communities. © 2021 The Author(s).","Aichi Target 11; Convention on biological diversity; COP-15; Global biodiversity targets; Post-2020 global biodiversity framework; Protected planet","Biodiversity; Conservation; Decision trees; Environmental protection; Biodiversity loss; Conservation strategies; Global patterns; Human pressures; Human settlements; Machine learning methods; Management objectives; Nature reserves; Learning systems; biodiversity; conservation; conservation management; conservation planning; human activity; human settlement; protected area; strategic approach",Article,Scopus

Few studies have comprehensively evaluated plant traits from multispectral cameras onboard UAV platforms. Additionally, machine learning algorithms tend to over-or underfit data and limited attention has been paid to optimizing their performance through an ensemble learning approach. This study aims to (1) comprehensively evaluate twelve rice plant traits estimated from aerial unmanned vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral images and (2) introduce Random Forest AdaBoost (RFA) algorithms as an optimization approach for estimating plant traits. The approach was tested based on a farmer’s field in Terengganu, Malaysia, for the off-season from February to June 2018, involving five rice cultivars and three nitrogen (N) rates. Four bands, thirteen indices and Random Forest-AdaBoost (RFA) regression models were evaluated against the twelve plant traits according to the growth stages. Among the plant traits, plant height, green leaf and storage organ biomass, and foliar nitrogen (N) content were estimated well, with a coefficient of determination (R2 ) above 0.80. In comparing the bands and indices, red, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), Red-Edge Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (REWDRVI) and Red-Edge Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (RESAVI) were remarkable in estimating all plant traits at tillering, booting and milking stages with R2 values ranging from 0.80–0.99 and root mean square error (RMSE) values ranging from 0.04–0.22. Milking was found to be the best growth stage to conduct estimations of plant traits. In summary, our findings demonstrate that an ensemble learning approach can improve the accuracy as well as reduce under/overfitting in plant phenotyping algorithms. © 2021 by the authors.

However, there remain challenges for predicting soil phosphorus (P) content and availability, which requires a reliable model applicable for different land-use systems to upscale. Recently, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) corresponding to the spectral information of soil was developed to considerably improve the accuracy of soil property predictions. The present study investigated the predictive ability of a 1D-CNN model to estimate soil available P (oxalate-extractable P; Pox) content in soils by comparing it with partial least squares (PLS) and random forest (RF) regressions using soil samples (n = 318) collected from natural (forest and non-forest) and cultivated (upland and flooded rice fields) systems in Madagascar. Overall, the 1D-CNN model showed the best predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.878) with a highly accurate prediction ability (ratio of performance to the interquartile range = 2.492). Compared to the PLS model, the RF and 1D-CNN models indicated 4.37% and 23.77% relative improvement in root mean squared error values, respectively. Based on a sensitivity analysis, the important wavebands for predicting soil Pox were associated with iron (Fe) oxide, organic matter (OM), and water absorption, which were previously known wavelength regions for estimating P in soil. These results suggest that 1D-CNN corresponding spectral signatures can be expected to significantly improve the predictive ability for estimating soil available P (Pox) from Vis-NIR spectral data. Rapid and accurate estimation of available P content in soils using our results can be expected to contribute to effective fertilizer management in agriculture and the sustainable management of ecosystems. However, the 1D-CNN model will require a large dataset to extend its applicability to other regions of Madagascar. Thus, further updates should be tested in future studies using larger datasets from a wide range of ecosystems in the tropics. © 2021 by the authors.

Remote and proximal sensing offer the possibility to cut crop monitoring costs traditionally associated with surveys and censuses. Fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), chlorophyll concentration (CI) and normalized difference vegetation (NDVI) indices were used in crop monitoring, but their comparative performances in sorghum monitoring is lacking. This work aimed therefore at closing this gap by evaluating the performance of machine learning modelling of in-season sorghum biomass yields based on Sentinel-2-derived fAPAR and simpler high-throughput optical handheld meters-derived NDVI and CI calculated from sorghum plants reflectance. Bayesian ridge regression showed good cross-validated performance, and high reliability (R2 = 35%) and low bias (mean absolute prediction error, MAPE = 0.4%) during the validation step. Hand-held optical meter-derived CI and Sentinel-2- derived fAPAR showed comparable effects on machine learning performance, but CI outperformed NDVI and was therefore considered as a good alternative to Sentinel-2's fAPAR. The best times to sample the vegetation indices were the months of June (second half) and July.

The data can support to undertake life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) of food commodities in a “cradle to grave” approach. An integrated F&V supply chain LCA model is constructed, which combined three components of the supply chain: farming system, post-harvest system (processing until the consumption) and bio-waste handling system. We have used numbers of crop models to calculate the crop yields, crop nutrient uptake, and irrigation water requirements, which are largely influenced by the local agro-climatic parameters of the selected crop reporting districts (CRDs) of the United States. For the farming system, LCI information, as shown in the data are averaged from the respective CRDs. LCI data for the post-harvest stages are based on available information from the relevant processing plants and the engineering estimates. The article also briefly presents the assumptions made for evaluating future crop production scenarios. Future scenarios integrate the impact of climate change on the future productivity and evaluate the effect of adaptation measures and technological advancement on the crop yield. The provided data are important to understand the characteristics of the food supply chain, and their relationships with the life cycle environmental impacts. The data can also support to formulate potential environmental mitigation and adaptation measures in the food supply chain mainly to cope with the adverse impact of climate change. © 2020","Fruits and vegetables; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle inventory; Processed products; Sustainability",,Data Paper,Scopus

Climatic projections for three climate models ranging from the driest to wettest conditions were obtained from the Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) dataset. Then, the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model was used to model hydrological responses of the selected future climates. Changes in regional hydroclimatic conditions of NFs and NGs were assessed by the magnitude and direction of movements in the Budyko space. The Fu’s equation was applied to estimate changes in basin characteristics. The results indicate that NFs and NGs are likely to experience larger changes in basin characteristics compared to the average of the United States. In general, across the conterminous US, the NFs in mountainous regions are likely to have larger changes in hydroclimatic variables than NFs with lower elevation and NGs. Comparing Forest Service regions, Pacific Northwest, Intermountain, and Northern regions may have a less arid climate with lower freshwater availability. The Southwestern, Northern, Intermountain, and Rocky Mountain regions are likely to experience higher shifts in their basin characteristics.

Such a case is the Pinios River delta plain located in central Greece, which also constitutes a significant ecosystem. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and SEAWAT models were combined in order to simulate the impact of current water resources management practices in main groundwater budget components and groundwater salinization of the shallow aquifer developed in the area. Moreover, potential climate change impact was investigated using climate data from Regional Climate Model for two projected periods (2021–2050 and 2071–2100) and two sea level rise scenarios (increase by 0.5 and 1 m). Modeling results are providing significant insight: although the contribution of the river to groundwater inflows is significant, direct groundwater recharge from precipitation was found to be higher, while capillary rise constitutes a major part of groundwater outflows from the aquifer. Moreover, during the simulation period, groundwater flow from the aquifer to the sea were found to be higher than the inflows of seawater to the aquifer. Regarding climate change impact assessment, the results indicate that the variability in groundwater recharge posed by the high variability of precipitation during the projected periods is increasing the aquifer’s deterioration potential of both its quantity and quality status, the latter expressed by the increased groundwater Cl− concentration. This evidence becomes more significant because of the limited groundwater storage capacity of the aquifer.

Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid, as one of the main causes of charcoal rot disease, suppresses the plant productivity significantly. Charcoal rot disease is one of the most severe threats to soybean productivity. Prediction of this disease in soybeans is very tedious and non-practical using traditional approaches. Machine learning (ML) techniques have recently gained substantial traction across numerous domains. ML methods can be applied to detect plant diseases, prior to the full appearance of symptoms. In this paper, several ML techniques were developed and examined for prediction of charcoal rot disease in soybean for a cohort of 2,000 healthy and infected plants. A hybrid set of physiological and morphological features were suggested as inputs to the ML models. All developed ML models were performed better than 90% in terms of accuracy. Gradient Tree Boosting (GBT) was the best performing classifier which obtained 96.25% and 97.33% in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Our findings supported the applicability of ML especially GBT for charcoal rot disease prediction in a real environment. Moreover, our analysis demonstrated the importance of including physiological featured in the learning.

Using LiDAR and imaging sensors mounted on multirotor UAVs, we can observe fine-scale crop variations that can help improve fertilizer management and maximize yields. In this study we used UAV mounted LiDAR and multispectral imaging sensors to monitor two sugarcane field trials with variable nitrogen (N) fertilization inputs in the Wet Tropics region of Australia. From six surveys performed at 42-day intervals, we monitored crop growth in terms of height, density and vegetation indices. In each survey period, we estimated a set of models to predict at-harvest biomass at fine scale (2m×2m plots). We compared the predictive performance of models based on multispectral predictors only, LiDAR predictors only, a fusion of multispectral and LiDAR predictors, and a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) benchmark. We found that predictive performance peaked early in the season, at 100–142 days after the previous harvest (DAH), and declined closer to the harvest date. At peak performance (i.e. 142 DAH), the multispectral model performed slightly better (R¯2=0.57) than the LiDAR model (R¯2=0.52), with both outperforming NDVI benchmark (R¯2=0.34). This, however, flipped later in the season, with LiDAR performing slightly better than the multispectral imaging and NDVI benchmark. Interestingly, the fusion model did not perform significantly better than the multispectral model at 100–142 DAH, nor better than LiDAR in subsequent periods. We also estimated a model to predict contemporaneous leaf N content (%) using multispectral imagery, which demonstrated an R¯2 of 0.57. Our results are of particular interest to nutrient management programs aiming to deliver N fertilizer guidelines for sustainable sugarcane production, as both fine-scale biomass and leaf N content predictions are feasible when management interventions are still possible (i.e. as early as at 100 DAH). © 2020 The Authors","Biomass; Drone; Fertilizer; Fusion; LiDAR; Multispectral; NDVI; Nitrogen; PCA; Sugarcane; UAV; Yield","biomass; crop yield; fertilizer; leaf; lidar; multispectral image; NDVI; nitrogen; prediction; principal component analysis; sugar cane; unmanned vehicle; Australia; Varanidae",Article,Scopus

Data-driven methods are widely used for remote sensing of leaf EWT and LMA because of their simplicity, satisfactory accuracy, and computation efficiency, such as the vegetation indices (VI)-based and machine learning (ML)-based methods. However, most of the data-driven methods are utilized at the canopy level, comparison of the performances of the data-driven methods at the leaf level has not been well documented. Moreover, the ML-based data-driven methods generally adopt leaf optical properties directly as their inputs, which may subsequently decrease their ability in remote sensing of leaf biochemical constituents. Performances of the ML-based methods cooperating with VI are rarely evaluated. Using the independent LOPEX and ANGERS datasets, we compared the performances of three data-driven methods: VI-based, ML-reflectance-based, and ML-VI-based methods, for the estimation of leaf EWT and LMA. Three sampling strategies were also utilized for evaluation of the generalization of these data-driven methods. Our results evidenced that ML-VI-based methods were the most accurate among these data-driven methods. Compared to the ML-reflectance-based and VI-based methods, the ML-VI-based model with support vector regression overall reduced errors by 5.7% (41.5%) and 1.8% (12.4%) for the estimation of leaf EWT (LMA), respectively. The ML-VI-based model inherits advantages of vegetation indices and ML techniques, which made it sensitive to changes of leaf biochemical constituents and capable of solving nonlinear tasks. It is thus recommended for the estimation of EWT and LMA at the leaf level. Moreover, its performance can further be enhanced by improving its generalization ability, such as adopting techniques on the selection of better wavelengths and definition of new vegetation indices. These results thus provided a prior knowledge of the data-driven methods and can be helpful for future studies on the remote sensing of leaf biochemical constituents. © 2020 by the authors.

This research project evaluated the performance of the combination of three Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) approaches in the forecasting of the monthly rainfall anomalies for Southwestern Colombia. For this purpose, we applied the Non-linear Principal Component Analysis (NLPCA) approach to get the main modes, a Neural Network Autoregressive Moving Average with eXogenous variables (NNARMAX) as a model, and an Inverse NLPCA approach for reconstructing the monthly rainfall anomalies forecasting in the Andean Region (AR) and the Pacific Region (PR) of Southwestern Colombia, respectively. For the model, we used monthly rainfall lagged values of the eight large-scale climate indices linked to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon as exogenous variables. They were cross-correlated with the main modes of the rainfall variability of AR and PR obtained using NLPCA. Subsequently, both NNARMAX models were trained from 1983 to 2014 and tested for two years (2015–2016). Finally, the reconstructed outputs from the NNARMAX models were used as inputs for the Inverse NLPCA approach. The performance of the ANN approaches was measured using three different performance metrics: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Pearson’s correlation (r). The results showed suitable forecasting performance for AR and PR, and the combination of these ANN approaches demonstrated the possibility of rainfall forecasting in these sub-regions five months in advance and provided useful information for the decision-makers in Southwestern Colombia. © 2020 by the authors.

Higher temperatures and changes in rainfall induced by global warming are threatening rainfed agriculture in this region while the population is expected to increase approximately three-fold until 2050. Our study quantifies the impact of climate change on food security by combining climate modelling (16 models from CMIP5), crop yield (simulated by agronomic model, SARRA-O) and demographic evolution (provided by UN projection) under two future climatic scenarios. We simulate yield for the main crops in five countries inWest Africa and estimate the population pressure on crop production to assess the number of available cereal production per capita. We found that, although uncertain, the African monsoon evolution leads to an increase of rainfall in Eastern Sahel and a decrease inWestern Sahel under the RCP8.5 (Representative Concentration Pathway) scenario from IPCC, leading to the higher temperature increase by the end of the 21st century. With regard to the abundance of food for the inhabitants, all the scenarios in each country show that in 2050, local agricultural production will be below 50 kg per capita.

This is critical as population, food demand, and background tropospheric ozone are projected to increase over the next several decades. Visual scores of common ozone damage have been used to identify ozone-stress in bio-indicator plants. This paper evaluates the use of a visual scoring metric of ozone damage applied to soybeans. The scoring of the leaves is then combinedwith hyperspectral data to identify spectral indices specific to ozone damage. Two genotypes of soybean, Dwight and Pana, that have shown different sensitivities to ozone, were grown and visually scored for ozone-specific damage on multiple dates throughout the growing season. Leaf reflectance, foliar biophysical properties, and yield data were collected. Additionally, ozone bio-indicator plants, snap beans, and common milkweed, were investigated with visual scores and hyperspectral leaf data for comparison. The normalized difference spectral index (NDSI) was used to identify the significant bands in the visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR) that best correlated with visual damage score when used in the index. Results were then compared to multiple well-established indices. Indices were also evaluated for correlation with seed and pod weight. The ozone damage scoring metric for soybeans evaluated in August had a coefficient of determination of 0.60 with end-of-season pod weight and a Pearson correlation coefficient greater than 0.6 for photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration. NDSI [R558, R563] correlated best with visual scores of ozone damage in soybeans when evaluating data from all observation dates. These wavelengths were similar to those identified as most sensitive to visual damage in August when used in NDSI (560 nm, 563 nm). NDSI [R560, R563] in August had the highest coefficient of determination for individual pod weight (R2 = 0.64) and seed weight (R2 = 0.54) when compared against 21 well-established indices used for identification of pigment or photosynthetic stress in plants. When evaluating use of spectral bands in NDSI, longer wavelengths in SWIR were identified as more sensitive to ozone visual damage. Trends in the bands and biophysical properties of the soybeans combined with evaluation of ozone data indicate likely timing of significant ozone damage as after late-July for this season. This work has implications for better spectral detection of ozone stress in crops and could help with efforts to identify ozone tolerant varieties to increase future yield. © 2019 by the authors.","Ambient ozone; Hyperspectral data; Soybean; Visual damage scoring","Correlation methods; Crops; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Plants (botany); Seed; Ambient ozones; Biophysical properties; Coefficient of determination; Hyperspectral Data; Normalized differences; Pearson correlation coefficients; Soybean; Visual damage scoring; Ozone",Article,Scopus

Designed system explores integrated application of remote sensing (RS) sciences and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology. Terra MODIS 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maximum value composite (MVC) image product MOD13A1 of 500 m spatial resolution covering Bangladesh have been utilized for a period 2011–2017. Hence the district-wise sum of NDVI on pixel-by-pixel has been calculated from Jan–April during 2011–2017. Regression analysis between district-based pixel-wise summation of MODIS-NDVI and district-wise BBS (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics) estimated Boro production revealed strong correlation (R2 = 0.57–0.85) where in March most of the regression coefficient shows significant correlation due to maximize photosynthetic activities. Therefore, the highest regression coefficient value from derived set of coefficient value (BCP-Boro Crop Production Model 2) has been utilized to obtain year-wise rice productions for all the years (2011–2017). Global Positioning System (GPS)-based field verification, accuracy assessment and validation operation have been carried out at randomly selected geographical positions over the country using various statistical tools. The results demonstrate good agreement between estimated and predicted yearly Boro rice production during 2011–2017 time period with Mean Bias Error (MBE) = −29,881 to 19,431 M.Ton; Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 5238 to 11,852 M.Ton; Model Efficiency (ME) = (0.86–0.94); Correlation Coefficients = 0.65 to 0.87.

In this study, we used remote sensing data to calibrate a regional crop model (MCWLA-Rice) for yield simulation in a double-rice crop rotation system in counties of Hunan province dominated by three landforms (plain, hill, and mountain). The calibration scheme with coarse remote sensing data (Global LAnd Surface Satellite, GLASS) greatly improved model accuracy for the double-rice system and is a promising method for yield estimation in large areas. The average improvement in relative root mean square error (RRMSE) was at most 48.00% for early rice and 41.25% for late rice. The average improvement in coefficient of determination (R2) value was at most 0.54 for early rice and 0.19 for late rice. Estimation of yield in counties dominated by different landform types indicated that: (1) MCWLA-Rice tended to be unstable in areas of complex topography and resulted in unbalanced proportions of overestimations and underestimations. (2) Differences in yield simulation between early rice and late rice varied among counties; yield estimates were highest in predominantly hilly counties, followed by counties dominated by plains, and lowest in predominantly mountainous counties. The results indicated that the topography might harm the accuracy of crop model simulations. Integration of topographic factors into crop models may enable yield estimation with enhanced accuracy to promote social development. © 2019 by the authors.","Crop model; Double rice; Landform; MCWLA; Remote sensing; Topography","Chemical contamination; Crops; Food supply; Landforms; Mean square error; Topography; Calibration schemes; Coefficient of determination; Complex topographies; Crop model; Double rice; Global land surface; MCWLA; Root mean square errors; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

However, as soil is characterized by substantial spatial variability and temporal dynamics, its contribution to the spectral reflectance of crops will also vary. The aim of the research was to determine the impact of soil background on spectral reflectance of crop canopy in visible and near-infrared parts of the spectrum at different stages of crop development and how the soil type factor and the dynamics of soil surface affect vegetation indices calculated for crop assessment. The study was conducted on three test plots with winter wheat located in the Tula region of Russia and occupied by three contrasting types of soil. During field trips, information was collected on the spectral reflectance of winter wheat crop canopy, winter wheat leaves, weeds and open soil surface for three phenological phases (tillering, shooting stage, milky ripeness). The assessment of the soil contribution to the spectral reflectance of winter wheat crop canopy was based on a linear spectral mixture model constructed from field data. This showed that the soil background effect is most pronounced in the regions of 350-500 nm and 620-690 nm. In the shooting stage, the contribution of the soil prevails in the 620-690 nm range of the spectrum and the phase of milky ripeness in the region of 350-500 nm. The minimum contribution at all stages of winter wheat development was observed at wavelengths longer than 750 nm. The degree of soil influence varies with soil type. Analysis of variance showed that normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was least affected by soil type factor, the influence of which was about 30%-50%, depending on the stage of winter wheat development. The influence of soil type on soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) was approximately equal and varied from 60% (shooting phase) to 80% (tillering phase). According to the discriminant analysis, the ability of vegetation indices calculated for winter wheat crop canopy to distinguish between winter wheat crops growing on different soil types changed from the classification accuracy of 94.1% (EVI2) in the tillering stage to 75% (EVI2 and SAVI) in the shooting stage to 82.6% in the milky ripeness stage (EVI2, SAVI, NDVI). The range of the sensitivity of the vegetation indices to the soil background depended on soil type. The indices showed the greatest sensitivity on gray forest soil when the wheat was in the phase of milky ripeness, and on leached chernozem when the wheat was in the tillering phase. The observed patterns can be used to develop vegetation indices, invariant to second-type soil variations caused by soil type factor, which can be applied for the remote assessment of the state of winter wheat crops. © 2019 by the authors.","Arable soils; EVI2; NDVI; SAVI; Spectral reflectance; Triticum aestivum; Winter wheat","Crops; Discriminant analysis; Infrared devices; Mixtures; Reflection; Vegetation; Arable soils; EVI2; NDVI; SAVI; Spectral reflectances; Triticum aestivum; Winter wheat; Soils",Article,Scopus

Irrigated stream-aquifer systems present a unique challenge in this effort, due to complex groundwater-surface water interactions and the high level of human intervention in managing irrigation practices. This paper has two objectives: first, to detail a method for constructing and applying a coupled SWAT-MODFLOW to irrigated stream-aquifer systems; and second, to use the model to quantify the effects of decreasing irrigation on hydrological responses and crop yield. The method is applied to a 734 km2 study region in the Lower Arkansas River Valley, an alluvial valley in Colorado, USA, which has been intensively irrigated for over 100 years and is threatened by shallow water tables. Therefore, a reduction in applied irrigation amounts has the double benefit of conserving water and decreasing waterlogging, given that crop yield can be maintained for food production. The results indicate that an approximate 10% decrease in total applied irrigation water results in decreases of 6% in surface runoff, 8% in evapotranspiration, and 4% in recharge water. It also results in an increase of 4% in groundwater return flow to the Arkansas River, and an actual increase in groundwater levels due to the decrease in groundwater pumping, pointing to the need for targeted irrigation reduction strategies to decrease waterlogging occurrence. The irrigation reduction yields an average 9% decrease in corn and alfalfa yield.

Therefore, optimum rates and timing of resource applications, such as nutrients and irrigation water, may vary as well. It remains a challenge to quantify the spatial variability of a field and to identify effective ways to manage fields in a site-specific manner. The objective of this study was to delineate management zones within a farmer’s field based on relatively easily obtainable information that is statistically integrated. Moreover, soil water temporal dynamics should be evaluated regarding their spatial differences in different zones. The set of direct and indirect observations included clay and silt content, apparent electrical conductivity, soil chemical properties (pH; organic matter; and total N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Zn), satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and lidar-based topographic variables in a western Kentucky field. Several key variables and their capability to describe spatial crop yield variability were identified by using principal component analysis: soil clay content, slope, soil organic matter content, topographic wetness index, and NDVI. Two types of cluster analysis were applied to delineate management zones. The cluster analyses revealed that two to three zones was the optimal number of classes based on different criteria. Delineated zones were evaluated and revealed significant differences in corn (Zea mays L.) yield and temporally different soil moisture dynamics.

A simulation at 50 km grid spacing is performed with the standard version of the RegCM4.5 model (control run), followed by three vegetation change experiments at the Sahel-Sahara interface (15° N and 20° N): forest, tall grass, and short grass savanna. The impacts of land cover change are assessed by analyzing the difference between the altered runs and the control one in different sub-domains (western Sahel, central Sahel, eastern Sahel, and Guinea). Results show that the presence of forest, tall grass, and short grass savanna at the Sahel-Sahara interface tends to decrease the mean summer surface temperature in the whole domain. Nevertheless, this decrease is more pronounced over the Central Sahel when considering the forest experiment. This temperature decrease is associated with a weakening (strengthening) of the sensible (latent) heat flux in the whole domain. An analysis of the radiation field is performed to better explain the changes noted in the latent heat flux, the sensible heat flux, and the surface temperature. When considering the rainfall signal, the analysis shows that the afforestation options tend to alter the precipitation in the considered sub-domains substantially by increasing it in the whole Sahel region, with strong interannual variability. This rainfall increase is associated with an increase of the atmospheric moisture. Finally, we investigated the impacts of the afforestation options on some features of the rainfall events, and on the atmospheric dynamics during wet and dry years. All afforestation options tend to increase the frequency of the number of rainy days in regions located south of 18° N during both periods. Nevertheless, this increase is stronger over the Central and Eastern Sahel during wet years in the forest case. All afforestation experiments induce an increase (decrease) of the low-levels monsoon flux in the Eastern Sahel (western Sahel) during both periods. At the mid-levels, the three afforestation options tend to move northward and to decrease the intensity of the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) south of 13° N during wet and dry years.The intensity of the AEJ is weaker during the wet period. The vegetation change experiments also affect the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ), especially during wet years, by increasing its intensity over the southern Sahel. The analysis of the activity of African EasterlyWaves (AEWs) patterns exhibits a decrease of the intensity of these disturbances over the Sahel during both periods. This may be due to the weakening of the meridional temperature contrast between the continent and the Gulf of Guinea due to the Sahel-Sahara surface temperature cooling induced by the afforestation. In summary, this study shows that during both periods, the increase of the atmospheric moisture due to the afforestation is associated with favorable AEJ/TEJ configurations (weaker and northward position of the AEJ; stronger TEJ) which in turn may create a stronger convection and then, an increase in the Sahel rainfall. This Sahel rainfall increase is associated with a strengthening of the intense and heavy rainfall events which may impact diversely local populations. © 2018 by the authors.","Interannual variability; Rainfall; Reforestation; RegCM4; Temperature; West Africa; Wind dynamics",,Article,Scopus

This study reports on mathematical modeling and testing of growth status for Chinese cabbage and white radish using unmanned aerial vehicle-red, green and blue (UAV-RGB) imagery for measurement of their biophysical properties. Chinese cabbage seedlings and white radish seeds were planted at 7-10-day intervals to provide a wide range of growth rates. Remotely sensed digital imagery data were collected for test fields at approximately one-week intervals using a UAV platform equipped with an RGB digital camera flying at 2 m/s at 20 m above ground. Radiometric calibrations for the RGB band sensors were performed on every UAV flight using standard calibration panels to minimize the effect of ever-changing light conditions on the RGB images. Vegetation fractions (VFs) of crops in each region of interest from the mosaicked ortho-images were calculated as the ratio of pixels classified as crops segmented using the Otsu threshold method and a vegetation index of excess green (ExG). Plant heights (PHs) were estimated using the structure from motion (SfM) algorithm to create 3D surface models from crop canopy data. Multiple linear regression equations consisting of three predictor variables (VF, PH, and VF × PH) and four different response variables (fresh weight, leaf length, leaf width, and leaf count) provided good fits with coefficients of determination (R2) ranging from 0.66 to 0.90. The validation results using a dataset of crop growth obtained in a different year also showed strong linear relationships (R2 &gt; 0.76) between the developed regression models and standard methods, confirming that the models make it possible to use UAV-RGB images for quantifying spatial and temporal variability in biophysical properties of Chinese cabbage and white radish over the growing season. © 2018 by the authors.","Crop surface model; Plant height; RGB; Structure from motion; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vegetation fraction","Antennas; Crops; Image segmentation; Linear regression; Seed; Three dimensional computer graphics; Vegetation; Multiple linear regression equations; Plant height; Radiometric calibrations; Spatial and temporal variability; Structure from motion; Structure from motion algorithm; Surface modeling; Vegetation fractions; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)",Article,Scopus

The uncertainty is quantified using the Cramer-von Mises score (CvM) to measure the ""distance"" between the simulated and observed CDFs. The ability of the three RCMs and CDF-t to simulate the ""climate"" variability is quantified with the explained variance, variance ratio and extreme occurrence. The study shows that despite their differences, the three RCMs display very similar performance. In terms of global distributions (i.e. CvM), all models perform better than ERA-40 for both seasons and variables. However, looking at variance criteria, RCMs are not always much better than ERA-40 reanalyses, whereas CDF-t produces accurate results when applied to ERA-40. In a second step, a combined statistical/dynamical downscaling approach has been used, consisting in applying CDF-t to the RCM outputs. It shows that CDF-t applied to the RCM outputs does not necessarily produce better results than those from CDF-t directly applied to ERA-40. It also shows that CDF-t applied to RCMs generally improves the downscaled CDFs and that the ""additional"" added value of CDF-t applied to the RCMs is independent of the performance of the RCMs in terms of CvM, explained variance, variance ratio and extreme occurrence. © 2012 Author(s).",,"assessment method; climate modeling; downscaling; rainfall; regional climate; statistical analysis; temperature effect; wind forcing; Mediterranean Sea",Article,Scopus

Big data and data analysis methods and models are important tools in food security (FS) studies for gap analysis and preparation of appropriate analytical frameworks. These innovations necessitate the development of novel methods for collecting, storing, processing, and extracting data. Methodology. The primary goal of this study was to conduct a critical review of agricultural big data and methods and models used for FS studies published in peer-reviewed journals since 2010. Approximately 130 articles were selected for full content review after the pre-screening process. Results. There are different sources of data collection, including but not limited to online databases, the internet, omics, Internet of Things, social media, survey rounds, remote sensing, and the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database. The collected data require analysis (i.e., mining, neural networks, Bayesian networks, and other ML algorithms) before data visualization using Python, R, Circos, Gephi, Tableau, or Cytoscape. Approximately 122 models, all of which were used in FS studies worldwide, were selected from 130 articles. However, most of these models addressed only one or two dimensions of FS (i.e., availability and access) and ignored the other dimensions (i.e., stability and utilization), creating a gap in the global context. Conclusions. There are certain FS gaps both worldwide and in the United Arab Emirates that need to be addressed by scientists and policymakers. Following the identification of the drivers, policies, and indicators, the findings of this review could be used to develop an appropriate analytical framework for FS and nutrition.

Identifying phenological events assists growers in determining plant maturity, and harvest timing and guides the application of time-specific crop inputs. Currently, phenological monitoring requires repeated manual observations of individual plants’ growth stages, which is highly laborious, time-inefficient, and requires the handling and integration of large field-based data sets. The ability of growers to accurately forecast yield is also compounded by the asynchronous growth of banana plants. Satellite remote sensing has proved effective in monitoring spatial and temporal crop phenology in many broadacre crops. However, for banana crops, very high spatial and temporal resolution imagery is required to enable individual plant level monitoring. Unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV)-based sensing technologies provide a cost-effective solution, with the potential to derive information on health, yield, and growth in a timely, consistent, and quantifiable manner. Our research explores the ability of UAV-derived data to track temporal phenological changes of individual banana plants from follower establishment to harvest. Individual plant crowns were delineated using object-based image analysis, with calculations of canopy height and canopy area producing strong correlations against corresponding ground-based measures of these parameters (R2 of 0.77 and 0.69 respectively). A temporal profile of canopy reflectance and plant morphology for 15 selected banana plants were derived from UAV-captured multispectral data over 21 UAV campaigns. The temporal profile was validated against ground-based determinations of key phenological growth stages. Derived measures of minimum plant height provided the strongest correlations to plant establishment and harvest, whilst interpolated maxima of normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) best indicated flower emergence. For pre-harvest yield forecasting, the Enhanced Vegetation Index 2 provided the strongest relationship (R2 = 0.77) from imagery captured near flower emergence. These findings demonstrate that UAV-based multitemporal crop monitoring of individual banana plants can be used to determine key growing stages of banana plants and offer pre-harvest yield forecasts. © 2023 by the authors.","banana plant; geographic object-based image analysis; multispectral; multitemporal; phenology; UAV; unoccupied aerial vehicle; yield","Antennas; Cost effectiveness; Forecasting; Fruits; Harvesting; Image analysis; Image enhancement; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation mapping; Aerial vehicle; Banana plant; Geographic object-based image analysis; Multi-spectral; Multi-temporal; Phenology; Unoccupied aerial vehicle; Yield; Crops",Article,Scopus

Thus, the mapping of cropland irrigation plays a significant role in agricultural water management and estimating food production. However, current spaceborne irrigated cropland mapping is highly reliant upon its spectral behavior, which often has high uncertainty and lacks information about the method of irrigation. Deep learning (DL) allows for the classification of irrigated cropland according to unique spatial patterns, such as the central pivot irrigation system (CPIS). But convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are usually biased toward color and texture features, a spatial transferable and accurate CPIS identification model is lacking owing to previous model seldom involves the round shapes of CPIS, which is usually key to distinguishing CPIS. To address this lack, we proposed a shape attention neural network by integrating spatial-attention gate, residual block, and multi-task learning, Pivot-Net, to incorporate shape information identify CPIS in satellite imagery. Specifically, we employed CPIS in Kansas to train our model using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical images. We found that Pivot-Net is superior to seven state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models on second-stage validation. We also evaluated the performance of Pivot-Net at three validation sites, which had an average F1-score and mean IOU of 90.68% and 90.45%, respectively, which further demonstrated the high accuracy of the proposed model. Moreover, to show that the proposed Pivot-Net can map CPIS at the country scale, we generated the first CPIS map at 30 m for the contiguous US using a cloud computing platform and our Pivot-Net model. The total CPIS area for the contiguous US was 61,094 km2 in 2018, which comprised 26.22% of all irrigated lands. Our results can be accessed at https://tianfyou.users.earthengine.app/view/cpisus. Therefore, the proposed shape-attention Pivot-Net demonstrates the ability to classify CPIS at large spatial scales and are feasible to map CPIS at national scales. © 2023 The Author(s).

Traditional landform modeling approaches are labor-intensive and time-consuming. In recent years, landform mapping has increasingly been digitized. This study conducted an in-depth analysis of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in combination with geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA), for mapping volcanic and glacial landforms. Sentinel-2 image, as well as predisposing variables (DEM and its derivatives, e.g., slope, aspect, curvature and flow accumulation), were segmented using a multi-resolution segmentation algorithm, and relevant features were selected to define segmentation scales for each landform category. A set of object-based features was developed based on spectral (e.g., brightness), geometrical (e.g., shape index), and textural (grey level co-occurrence matrix) information. The landform modelling networks were then trained and tested based on labelled objects generated using GEOBIA and ground control points. Our results show that an integrated approach of GEOBIA and CNN achieved an ACC of 0.9685, 0.9780, 0.9614, 0.9767, 0.9675, 0.9718, 0.9600, and 0.9778 for dacite lava, caldera, andesite lava, volcanic cone, volcanic tuff, glacial circus, glacial valley, and suspended valley, respectively. The quantitative evaluation shows the highest performance (Accuracy > 0.9600 and cross-validation accuracy > 0.9400) for volcanic and glacial landforms and; therefore, is recommended for regional and large-scale landform mapping.

The increasing interest in this crop requires accelerated selection and the development of new screening techniques. New analytical methods that are more accurate and less labor-intensive are needed to better characterize the effects of genetics and the environment on key traits under field conditions. We used persistent multispectral and photogrammetric UAV time-series imagery collected 10 times over the season, together with ground-truth data for thousands of Miscanthus genotypes, to determine the flowering time, culm length, and biomass yield traits. We compared the performance of convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures that used image data from single dates (2D-spatial) versus the integration of multiple dates by 3D-spatiotemporal architectures. The ability of UAV-based remote sensing to rapidly and non-destructively assess large-scale genetic variation in flowering time, height, and biomass production was improved through the use of 3D-spatiotemporal CNN architectures versus 2D-spatial CNN architectures. The performance gains of the best 3D-spatiotemporal analyses compared to the best 2D-spatial architectures manifested in up to 23% improvements in R2, 17% reductions in RMSE, and 20% reductions in MAE. The integration of photogrammetric and spectral features with 3D architectures was crucial to the improved assessment of all traits. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the integration of high-spatiotemporal-resolution UAV imagery with 3D-CNNs enables more accurate monitoring of the dynamics of key phenological and yield-related crop traits.

Previous research has indicated that in situ fluorescence sensor measurements can be used as a proxy for nitrogen (N) status in plants in greenhouse conditions employing static sensor measurements. Practitioners of precision N management require determination of in-season plant N status in real-time in the field to enable the most efficient N fertilizer management system. The objective of this study was to assess if mobile in-field fluorescence sensor measurements can accurately quantify the variability of nitrogen indicators in maize canopy early in the crop growing season. A Multiplex®3 fluorescence sensor was used to collect crop canopy data at the V6 and V9 maize growth stages. Multiplex fluorescence indices were successful in discriminating variability among N treatments with moderate accuracies at V6, and higher at the V9 stage. Fluorescence-based indices were further utilized with a machine learning (ML) model to estimate canopy nitrogen indicators i.e., N concentration and above-ground biomass at the V6 and V9 growth stages independently. Parameter estimation using the Support Vector Regression (SVR)-based ML mode indicated a promising accuracy in estimation of N concentration and above-ground biomass at the V6 stage of maize with the moderate range of correlation coefficient (r = 0.72 ± 0.03) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The retrieval accuracies (r = 0.90 ± 0.06) at the V9 stage were better than those of the V6 growth stage with a reasonable range of error estimates and yielding the lowest RMSE (0.23 (%N) and 12.37 g (biomass)) for all canopy N indicators. Mobile fluorescence sensing can be used with reasonable accuracies for determining canopy N variability at early growth stages of maize, which would help farmers in optimal management of nitrogen. © 2022 by the authors.","fluorescence sensor; nitrogen management; precision agriculture; vegetation indices","Biomass; Crops; Cultivation; Fluorescence; Precision agriculture; Aboveground biomass; Fluorescence sensing; Fluorescence sensors; Greenhouse conditions; Growth stages; Nitrogen management; Precision Agriculture; Root mean square errors; Sensor measurements; Vegetation index; Mean square error",Article,Scopus

Feature selection based on UAV image reflectance, vegetation indices, and texture was conducted using the competitive adaptive reweighted sampling, and the random forest machine learning method was used to construct the prediction model with the optimized features. Results showed that model performance increased with decreasing image spatial resolution with a R2, a RMSE, a MAE and a RPD of 0.84, 4.57 g m−2, 2.50 g m−2 and 2.34 (0.01 m spatial resolution image), 0.86, 4.15 g m−2, 2.82 g m−2 and 2.65 (0.02 m), and 0.92, 3.17 g m−2, 2.45 g m−2 and 2.86 (0.05 m), respectively. Further, the transferability of models differed when applied to images with coarser (upscaling) or finer (downscaling) resolutions. For upscaling, the model established with the 0.01 m images had a R2 of 0.84 and 0.89 when applied to images with 0.02 m and 0.05 m resolutions, respectively. For downscaling, the model established with the 0.05 m image features had a R2 of 0.86 and 0.83 when applied to images of 0.01 m and 0.02 m resolutions. Though the image spatial resolution affects image texture features more than the spectral features and the effects of image spatial resolution on model performance and transferability decrease with increasing plant wetness under irrigation treatment, it can be concluded that all the UAV images acquired in this study with different resolutions could achieve good predictions and transferability of the nitrogen content of winter wheat plants. © 2022 by the authors.","model transferability; nitrogen content; random forest; spectral features; texture features; UAV",,Article,Scopus

Moreover, the SHapley Additive exPlanation method results indicate that the important predictors are mainly from the Southern Hemisphere, Eurasia, and western Pacific, and most show nonlinear relationships with the predictands.

The monitoring and mapping of the burned area by traditional and common methods are time-consuming and challenging while is vital to propose an advanced burned area detection framework for achieving reliable results. To this end, this study proposed a novel End-to-End framework based on deep learning and post-fire Sentinel-2 imagery. The proposed framework known as Burnt-Net combines quadratic morphological operators and standard convolution layers. The multi-patch multi-level residual morphological (MP-MRM) blocks are the main part of the decoder part of the Burnt-Net while the encoder part uses the multi-level residual morphological and transpose convolution layers. To evaluate the efficiency of Burnt-Net the post-fire Sentinel-2 for the latest wildfires over different countries was collected and then, the model was trained and evaluated based on them. Furthermore, the most common deep learning-based model implemented for comparing the result of burned areas by the proposed Burnt-Net. The results of burned areas mapping show the Burnt-Net is robust in the detection of burned areas and provides a mean accuracy of more than 97% by overall accuracy (OA). Furthermore, the Burnt-Net is fast and can provide the burned area map in the near real-time. © 2022","Burned area; Deep learning; Morphological operator; Semantic segmentation; Sentinel-2","Deep learning; Fires; Mapping; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Burned areas; Burned-area mapping; Deep learning; Fire management; Morphological neural networks; Morphological operator; Multilevels; Post-fire; Semantic segmentation; Sentinel-2; Convolution; artificial neural network; mapping; semantic standardization; Sentinel; wildfire",Article,Scopus

To obtain grants, farmers have to apply every year according to the national/regional procedure that, presently, relies on the Geo‐Spatial Aid Application (GSAA). To ensure the properness of applications, national/regional payment agencies (PA) operate random controls through in‐field surveys. EU regulation n. 809/2014 has introduced a new approach to CAP controls based on Copernicus Sentinel‐2 (S2) data. These are expected to better address PA checks on the field, suggesting eventual inconsistencies between satellite‐based deductions and farmers’ declarations. Within this framework, this work proposed a hierarchical (HI) approach to the classification of crops (soya, corn, wheat, rice, and meadow) explicitly aimed at supporting CAP controls in agriculture, with special concerns about the Piemonte Region (NW Italy) agricultural situation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a comparison is made between HI and other, more ordinary approaches. In particular, two algorithms were considered as references: the minimum distance (MD) and the random forest (RF). Tests were operated in a study area located in the southern part of the Vercelli province (Piemonte), which is mainly devoted to agriculture. Training and validation steps were performed for all the classification approaches (HI, MD, RF) using the same ground data. MD and RF were based on S2‐derived NDVI image time series (TS) for the 2020 year. Differently, HI was built according to a rule‐based approach developing according to the following steps: (a) TS standard deviation analysis in the time domain for meadows mapping; (b) MD classification of winter part of TS in the time domain for wheat detection; (c) MD classification of summer part of TS in the time domain for corn classification; (d) selection of a proper summer multi‐spectral image (SMSI) useful for separating rice from soya with MD operated in the spectral domain. To separate crops of interest from other classes, MD‐based classifications belonging to HI were thresholded by Otsu’s method. Overall accuracy for MD, RF, and HI were found to be 63%, 80%, and 89%, respectively. It is worth remarking that thanks to the SMSI‐based approach of HI, a significant improvement was obtained in soya and rice classification. © 2022 by the authors.

Sentinel-2 images were acquired in this study at six key phenological stages (rejuvenation stage, rising stage, jointing stage, heading stage, filling stage, filling-maturity stage) of winter wheat growth, and various vegetation indexes (VIs) at different fertility stages were calculated. Based on the characteristics of yield data continuity, the RReliefF algorithm was introduced to filter the optimal vegetation index combinations suitable for the yield estimation of winter wheat for all fertility stages. The Absolutely Objective Improved Analytic Hierarchy Process (AOIAHP) was innovatively proposed to determine the proportional contribution of crop growth to yield formation in six different phenological stages. The selected VIs consisting of MTCI(RE2), EVI, REP, MTCI(RE1), RECI(RE1), NDVI(RE1), NDVI(RE3), NDVI(RE2), NDVI, and MSAVI were then fused with the weights of different fertility periods to obtain time-series weighted data. For the characteristics of short time length and a small number of sequences of RS time-series data in yield estimation, this study applied the multiplexed delayed embedding transformation (MDT) technique to realize the data augmentation of the original short time series. Tucker decomposition was performed on the block Hankel tensor (BHT) obtained after MDT enhancement, and the core tensor was extracted while preserving the intrinsic connection of the time-series data. Finally, the resulting multidimensional core tensor was trained with the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to obtain the BHT-ARIMA model for wheat yield estimation. Compared to the performance of the BHT-ARIMA model with unweighted time-series data as input, the weighted time-series input significantly improves yield estimation accuracy. The coefficients of determination (R2) were improved from 0.325 to 0.583. The root mean square error (RMSE) decreased from 492.990 to 323.637 kg/ha, the mean absolute error (MAE) dropped from 350.625 to 255.954, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) decreased from 4.332% to 3.186%. Besides, BHT-ARMA and BHT-CNN models were also used to compare with BHT-ARIMA. The results indicated that the BHT-ARIMA model still had the best yield prediction accuracy.

However, early mapping of winter wheat using remotely sensed data is challenging because remote sensing observations can only be used for a part of the growth period. In this study, a framework was proposed for early season mapping of winter wheat using spectral and temporal information of Sentinel-2 images. First, time series of temporal and spectral features were derived using Whittaker smoothing. Subsequently, sensitivities of different parameters (i.e. input features, time interval, and length of time-series data) to early mapping were analyzed. Finally, early maps of winter wheat were generated based on optimal parameters. Results show that the earliest identifiable timing was delayed as the time interval of the time series increased. Winter wheat can be mapped in the early overwintering period (5 months before harvest) with an overall accuracy of 0.91, which is comparable to that of post-season mapping (0.94). In addition, the misclassification in early mapping was caused by uneven sample spatial patterns, natural conditions, and planting management; however, most errors can be gradually amended during the green-up and jointing periods, and the overall accuracy remained stable after the jointing stage. This study demonstrates that it is feasible to implement large-scale early mapping of winter wheat using satellite observations. The proposed approach potentially provides a reference for early mapping of other crop types in agricultural regions worldwide. © 2022 The Author(s).

This study aimed to provide an effective, fast, and non-destructive monitoring method of soil plant analysis development (SPAD) values, which can represent leaf chlorophyll contents, for late-sown winter wheat variety screening. This study acquired multispectral images using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) at the overwintering stage of winter wheat growth, and further processed these images to extract reflectance of five single spectral bands and calculated 26 spectral vegetation indices. Based on these 31 variables, this study combined three variable selection methods (i.e., recursive feature elimination (RFE), random forest (RF), and Pearson correlation coefficient (r)) with four machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forest regression (RFR), linear kernel-based support vector regression (SVR), radial basis function (RBF) kernel-based SVR, and sigmoid kernel-based SVR), resulted in seven SVR models (i.e., RFE-SVR_linear, RF-SVR_linear, RF-SVR_RBF, RF-SVR_sigmoid, r-SVR_linear, r-SVR_RBF, and r-SVR_sigmoid) and three RFR models (i.e., RFE-RFR, RF-RFR, and r-RFR). The performances of the 10 machine learning models were evaluated and compared with each other according to the achieved coefficient of determination (R2), residual prediction deviation (RPD), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative RMSE (RRMSE) in SPAD estimation. Of the 10 models, the best one was the RF-SVR_sigmoid model, which was the combination of the RF variable selection method and the sigmoid kernel-based SVR algorithm. It achieved high accuracy in estimating SPAD values of the wheat canopy (R2 = 0.754, RPD = 2.017, RMSE = 1.716 and RRMSE = 4.504%).

Subsequently, the N estimation was scaled up to the plant-level based on HSL point clouds. Biomass, extracted with structural proxies, was utilized to exhibit its supplemental effect on N concentration. The results show that HSL has the ability to extract N concentrations at both the leaf-level and the canopy-level, and PLSR showed better performance (R2 &gt; 0.6) than the single spectral index (R2 &gt; 0.4). In comparison to the stem height and maximum canopy width, the plant height had the strongest ability (R2 = 0.88) to estimate biomass.

Producing these maps at detailed scales requires exhaustive field surveys that can be laborious, time-consuming, and expensive to replicate. With a growing archive of remote sensing data, there are enormous opportunities to exploit dense satellite image time series (SITS), temporal sequences of images over the same area. Generally, crop type mapping relies on single-sensor inputs and is solved with the help of traditional learning algorithms such as random forests or support vector machines. Nowadays, deep learning techniques have brought significant improvements by leveraging information in both spatial and temporal dimensions, which are relevant in crop studies. The concurrent availability of Sentinel-1 (synthetic aperture radar) and Sentinel-2 (optical) data offers a great opportunity to utilize them jointly; however, optimizing their synergy has been understudied with deep learning techniques. In this work, we analyze and compare three fusion strategies (input, layer, and decision levels) to identify the best strategy that optimizes optical-radar classification performance. They are applied to a recent architecture, notably, the pixel-set encoder–temporal attention encoder (PSE-TAE) developed specifically for object-based classification of SITS and based on self-attention mechanisms. Experiments are carried out in Brittany, in the northwest of France, with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series. Input and layer-level fusion competitively achieved the best overall F-score surpassing decision-level fusion by 2%. On a per-class basis, decision-level fusion increased the accuracy of dominant classes, whereas layer-level fusion improves up to 13% for minority classes. Against single-sensor baseline, multi-sensor fusion strategies identified crop types more accurately: for example, input-level outperformed Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 by 3% and 9% in F-score, respectively. We have also conducted experiments that showed the importance of fusion for early time series classification and under high cloud cover condition. © 2021 by the authors.

The underpinnings are long-established probability surveys reliant on farmers’ feedback in parallel with biophysical measurements. Over the last decade though, satellite imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has been used to corroborate the survey information. This is facilitated through the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies/Global Agricultural Monitoring system, which provides open access to pertinent real-time normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Hence, two relatively straightforward MODIS-based modeling methods are employed operationally. The first model constitutes mid-season timing based on the maximum peak NDVI value, while the second is reflective of late-season timing by integrating accumulated NDVI over a threshold value. Corn model results nationally show the peak NDVI method provides a R2 of 0.88 and a coefficient of variation (CV) of 3.5%. The accumulated method, using an optimally derived 0.58 NDVI threshold, improves the performance to 0.93 and 2.7%, respectively. Both these models outperform simple trend analysis, which is 0.48 and 7.4%, correspondingly. For soybeans the R2 results of the peak NDVI model are 0.62, and 0.73 for the accumulated using a 0.56 threshold. CVs are 6.8% and 5.7%, respectively. Spring wheat’s R2 performance with the accumulated NDVI model is 0.60 but just 0.40 with peak NDVI. The soybean and spring wheat models perform similarly to trend analysis. Winter wheat and upland cotton show poor model performance, regardless of method.

At present, 87% of the catchment area is arable land, 5% is used as pasture, 6% is forested and 2% is paved. The calibration approach involves a sequential calibration of the model starting from surface runoff, and groundwater flow, followed by crop yields and then soil moisture, and finally total streamflow and sediment yields. Calibration and validation are carried out using the r-package SWATplusR. The impact of each calibration step on sediment yields and total streamflow is evaluated. The results of this approach are compared with those of the conventional model calibration approach, where all the parameters governing various hydrological processes are calibrated simultaneously. Results showed that the model was capable of successfully predicting surface runoff, groundwater flow, soil profile water content, total streamflow and sediment yields with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of greater than 0.75. Crop yields were also well simulated with a percent bias (PBIAS) ranging from −17% to 14%. Surface runoff calibration had the highest impact on streamflow output, improving NSE from 0.39 to 0.77. The step-wise calibration approach performed better for streamflow prediction than the simultaneous calibration approach.

Several studies have demonstrated the excellent capability of radar and optical imagery for crop mapping and biophysical parameter estimation. This paper aims at modeling the crop biophysical parameters, e.g., Leaf Area Index (LAI) and biomass, using a combination of radar and optical Earth observations. We extracted several radar features from polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and Vegetation Indices (VIs) from optical images to model crops’ LAI and dry biomass. Then, the mutual correlations between these features and Random Forest feature importance were calculated. We considered two scenarios to estimate crop parameters. First, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, e.g., Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), were utilized to estimate two crop biophysical parameters. To this end, crops’ dry biomass and LAI were estimated using three input data; (1) SAR polarimetric features; (2) spectral VIs; (3) integrating both SAR and optical features. Second, a deep artificial neural network was created. These input data were fed to the mentioned algorithms and evaluated using the in-situ measurements. These observations of three cash crops, including soybean, corn, and canola, have been collected over Manitoba, Canada, during the Soil Moisture Active Validation Experimental 2012 (SMAPVEX-12) campaign. The results showed that GB and XGB have great potential in parameter estimation and remarkably improved accuracy. Our results also demonstrated a significant improvement in the dry biomass and LAI estimation compared to the previous studies. For LAI, the validation Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was reported as 0.557 m2 /m2 for canola using GB, and 0.298 m2 /m2 for corn using GB, 0.233 m2 /m2 for soybean using XGB. RMSE was reported for dry biomass as 26.29 g/m2 for canola utilizing SVR, 57.97 g/m2 for corn using RF, and 5.00 g/m2 for soybean using GB.

We used a 50-50 train-test split on pad-dock-years where 50% of paddock-year combinations were randomly selected and used to train each model and the remaining 50% of paddock-years were used to assess the model accuracy. Using only phenological metrics, accuracy was highest using a linear mixed model with a random effect that allowed the relationship between integrated NDVI and yield to vary by year (R = 0.67, MAE = 0.25 t ha−1, RMSE = 0.33 t ha−1, NRMSE = 0.25). We quantified the improvements in accuracy when seasonal climate metrics were also used as predictors. We identified two optimal models using the combined phenological and seasonal climate metrics: support vector regression and deep learning models (R = 0.68, MAE = 0.25 t ha−1, RMSE = 0.32 t ha−1, NRMSE = 0.25). While the linear mixed model using only phenological metrics performed similarly to the nonlinear models that are also seasonal climate metrics, the nonlinear models can be more easily generalised to estimate yield in years for which training data are unavailable. We conclude that long-term hindcasts of wheat yield in fields, at 30 m spatial resolution, can be produced using remotely sensed phenology from Landsat NDVI, climate data and machine learning. © 2021 by the authors.

Population growth and the increasing demand of resources will exacerbate these impacts. Focusing on rainfed maize production, we evaluate the socio-ecological risk that municipalities currently face and how climate change could modify it. Municipalities were classified based on their biophysical and socioeconomic traits like temperature, precipitation, population, gross domestic product, marginalization, and agricultural subsidies. The study identifies municipalities that would face higher risk under climate change conditions, and it evaluates whether increases in agricultural subsidies could be effective for reducing the farmers' future risk. Our results show that during the 2010's, 36.8% of the municipalities and 15% of the population were at very high and high risk, respectively. By 2070, under a high-warming scenario these figures increase to 56.5 and 18.5%. We find that a generalized augment in agricultural subsidies is not enough to compensate for the effects of climate change on the socio-ecological risk of rainfed maize producers. We suggest that transformative adaptation is required for managing the agricultural risk that socio-ecological systems experience under climate change conditions. Such adaptation strategies should include poverty alleviation, promotion of resistant and native varieties of crops, capacity building to improve management and water use, sustainable technification, and soil restoration.

The field is of great significance from economic, food safety and public health points of views. The paper focuses on effective food production, food maintenance energy management and food retail packaging labeling control, using recent advances in machine learning. Appropriate deep neural architectures are adopted and used for this purpose, including Fully Convolutional Networks, Long Short-Term Memories and Recurrent Neural Networks, Auto-Encoders and Attention mechanisms, Latent Variable extraction and clustering, as well as Domain Adaptation. Three experimental studies are presented, illustrating the ability of these AI methodologies to produce state-of-the-art performance in the whole food supply chain. In particular, these concern: (i) predicting plant growth and tomato yield in greenhouses, thus matching food production to market needs and reducing food waste or food unavailability; (ii) optimizing energy consumption across large networks of food retail refrigeration systems, through optimal selection of systems that can be shut-down and through prediction of the respective food de-freezing times, during peaks of power demand load; (iii) optical recognition and verification of food consumption expiry date in automatic inspection of retail packaged food, thus ensuring safety of food and people’s health. © 2021 by the authors.

The results of this study are applicable to other arid areas. Study focus: This study aims to improve the prediction of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) to enhance the efficacy of drainage system design in data-poor areas. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were developed to estimate Ksat and compared with empirical regression-type Pedotransfer Function (PTF) equations. Subsequently, the ANNs and PTFs estimated Ksat values were used in EnDrain software to design subsurface drainage systems which were evaluated against designs using measured Ksat values. New hydrological insights: Results showed that ANNs more accurately predicted Ksat than PTFs. Drainage design based on PTFs predictions (1) result in a deeper water-level and (2) higher drainage density, increasing costs. Drainage designs based on ANNs predictions gave drain spacing and water table depth equivalent to those predicted using measured data. The results of this study indicate that ANNs can be developed using existing and under-utilised data sets and applied successfully to data-poor areas. As Ksat is time-consuming to measure, basing drainage designs on ANN predictions generated from alternative datasets will reduce the overall cost of drainage designs making them more accessible to farmers, planners, and decision-makers in least developed countries. © 2021 The Authors","Agricultural drainage design; Arid areas; Artificial neural networks; Pedotransfer functions; Saturated hydraulic conductivity; Sub-surface drainage",,Article,Scopus

This study therefore introduces a novel two-staged model combining artificial neural networks and random forests to reveal the importance of internal and external factors influencing firms´ innovation performance in the case of 3,361 firms from six catching-up CEE countries (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), by using the World Banks´ Enterprise Survey data from 2019. We confirm the hypothesis that innovators in the catching-up CEE countries depend more on internal knowledge sources and, moreover, that participation in the firms groups represents an important factor of firms´ innovation.

The present study investigated important predictors in determining the satisfaction of undergraduate students (N = 425) from multiple departments in using ERL at a self-funded university in Hong Kong while Moodle and Microsoft Team are the key learning tools. By comparing the predictive accuracy between multiple regression and machine learning models before and after the use of random forest recursive feature elimination, all multiple regression, and machine learning models showed improved accuracy while the most accurate model was the elastic net regression with 65.2% explained variance. The results show only neutral (4.11 on a 7-point Likert scale) regarding the overall satisfaction score on ERL. Even majority of students are competent in technology and have no obvious issue in accessing learning devices or Wi-Fi, face-to-face learning is more preferable compared to ERL and this is found to be the most important predictor. Besides, the level of efforts made by instructors, the agreement on the appropriateness of the adjusted assessment methods, and the perception of online learning being well delivered are shown to be highly important in determining the satisfaction scores.

Big Data and Machine Learning (ML) have emerged as high-performance computing technologies to create new opportunities to unravel, quantify and understand agricultural processes through data. However, there are many challenges to achieve the integration of these technologies. It implies making some adaptations to ML for using it with Big Data. These adaptations must consider the increasing volume of data, its variety and the transmission speed issues.

To forecast global horizontal irradiance based on a multivariate meteorological data; this study first evaluates five standalone models, including recurrent deterministic policy gradient (RDPG), long short term memory (LSTM) neural network, extreme gradient boosting (XGB), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and support vector regression (SVR). The RDPG model outperforms the standalone counterparts by demonstrating 2.485 W/m2, 20.591 W/m2, 18.316 W/m2, and 23.176 W/m2 reductions in RMSE compared to the LSTM, XGB, GPR, and SVR models. Afterward, the performance of the RDPG model is further enhanced, by developing two-stage hybrid models, including improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with additive noise-RDPG (ICEEMDAN-RDPG) and variational mode decomposition-RDPG (VMD-RDPG). The subsequent construction of the hybrid model ICEEMDAN-SE-VMD-RDPG (ISVR) results in the further improvement of the two-stage hybrid models.

However, although gas exchange between croplands and the atmosphere is measurable in the field, it is difficult to quantify at the plot scale over relatively large areas because of the heterogeneous character of landscapes and differences in crop management. However, assessing accurate carbon and water budgets over croplands is essential to promote sustainable agronomic practices and reduce the water demand and the climatic impacts of croplands while maintaining sufficient yields. From this perspective, we developed a crop model, SAFYE-CO2, that assimilates high spatial- and temporal-resolution (HSTR) remote sensing products to estimate daily crop biomass, water and CO2 fluxes, annual yields, and carbon budgets at the parcel level over large areas. This modeling approach was evaluated for sunflower against two in situ datasets. First, the model's output was compared to data acquired during two cropping seasons at the Auradé integrated carbon observation system (ICOS) instrumented site in southwestern France. The model accurately simulated the daily net CO2 flux (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.97 gC·m-2·d-1 and determination coefficient (R2) = 0.83) and water flux (RMSE = 0.68 mm·d-1 and R2 = 0.79). The model's performance was then evaluated against biomass and yield data collected from 80 plots located in southwestern France. The model was able to satisfactorily estimate biomass dynamics and yield (RMSE = 66 and 54 g·m-2, respectively). To investigate the potential application of the proposed approach at a large scale, given that soil properties are important factors affecting the model, a sensitivity analysis of two existing soil products (GlobalSoilMap and SoilGrids) was carried out. Our results show that these products are not sufficiently accurate for inclusion as inputs to the model, which requires more accurate information on soil water retention capacity to assess water fluxes. Additionally, we argue that no water stress should be considered in the crop growth computation since this stress is already present because of remote sensing information in the proposed approach. This study should be considered a first step to fulfill the existing gap in quantifying carbon budgets at the plot scale over large areas and to accurately estimate the effects of management practices, such as the use of cover crops or specific crop rotations on cropland C and water budgets. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon budget; Crop modeling; Remote sensing; Soil properties; Water budget","Biogeochemistry; Biomass; Budget control; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Crops; Ecology; Mean square error; Plants (botany); Sensitivity analysis; Soil moisture; Determination coefficients; High resolution remote sensing; Management practices; Remote sensing information; Root mean square errors; Soil water retention; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Water budget components; Remote sensing",Article,Scopus

The performance of each vegetation index to a certain condition is different and needs to be interpreted, correspondingly. This study aimed to assess the most suitable vegetation index to identify the crop response against elevated air temperatures, heat stress, and herbicide damage. The spectral reflectance, yield components, and growth parameters such as plant height, leaf area index (LAI), and above-ground dry matter of paddy rice, which was cultivated in a temperature gradient field chamber to simulate global warming conditions, were observed from 2016 to 2018. The relationships between the vegetation indices and the crop parameters were assessed considering stress conditions. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) represented the changes in plant height (R-square = 0.93) and the LAI (R-square = 0.901) before the heading stage. Furthermore, the NDVI and the cumulative growing degree days had a Sigmoid curve and an R-square value of 0.937 under the normal growth case, but it decreased significantly in the herbicide damage case. This characteristic was useful for detecting the damaged crop growth condition. Additionally, to estimate the grain yield of paddy rice, the medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS) terrestrial chlorophyll index was better: R-square = 0.912; root mean square error = 95.69 g/m2. Photochemical reflectance index was sensitive to physiological stress caused by the heatwave, and it decreased in response to extremely high air temperatures.

Up to now, this technology has been limited to the control of weeds and pests, whereas the second generation of GM crops is expected to assist farmers in abiotic stress tolerance or improved nutritional features. Aiming to analyze this subject holistically, in this presentation we address an advanced technology for drought-tolerant GM crops, upscaling from molecular details obtained in the laboratory to an extensive network of field trials as well as the impact of the introduction of this innovation into the market. Sunflower has divergent transcription factors, which could be key actors in the drought response orchestrating several signal transduction pathways, generating an improved performance to deal with water deficit. One of such factors, HaHB4, belongs to the homeodomain-leucine zipper family and was first introduced in Arabidopsis. Transformed plants had improved tolerance to water deficits, through the inhibition of ethylene sensitivity and not by stomata closure. Wheat and soybean plants expressing the HaHB4 gene were obtained and cropped across a wide range of growing conditions exhibiting enhanced adaptation to drought-prone environments, the most important constraint affecting crop yield worldwide. The performance of wheat and soybean, however, differed slightly across mentioned environments; whereas the improved behavior of GM wheat respect to controls was less dependent on the temperature regime (cool or warm), differences between GM and wild-type soybeans were remarkably larger in warmer compared to cooler conditions. In both species, these GM crops are good candidates to become market products in the near future. In anticipation of consumers’ and other stakeholders’ interest, spectral analyses of field crops have been conducted to differentiate these GM crops from wild type and commercial cultivars. In this paper, the potential impact of the release of such market products is discussed, considering the perspectives of different stakeholders. © Copyright © 2020 González, Rigalli, Miranda, Romagnoli, Ribichich, Trucco, Portapila, Otegui and Chan.","drought tolerance; grain yield determination; HaHB4; sunflower transcription factor; transgenic soybean; transgenic wheat",,Article,Scopus

This work aimed to interpret the feasibility of several machine learning approaches to assess the spatial distribution of solar radiation on Earth based on the Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) Meteorological Imager (MI) geostationary satellite. Four data-driven models were selected (artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and DNN), to compare their accuracy and spatial estimating performance. Moreover, we used a physical model to probe the ability of data-driven methods, implementing hold-out and k-fold cross-validation approaches based on pyranometers located in South Korea. The results of analysis showed the RF had the highest accuracy in predicting performance, although the difference between RF and the second-best technique (DNN) was insignificant. Temporal variations in root mean square error (RMSE) were dependent on the number of data samples, while the physical model showed relatively less sensitivity. Nevertheless, DNN and RF showed less variability in RMSE than the others. To examine spatial estimation performance, we mapped solar radiation over South Korea for each model. The data-driven models accurately simulated the observed cloud pattern spatially, whereas the physical model failed to do because of cloud mask errors. These exhibited different spatial retrieval performances according to their own training approaches. Overall analysis showed that deeper layers of networks approaches (RF and DNN), could best simulate the challenging spatial pattern of thin clouds when using satellite multispectral data. © 2019 by the authors.","Artificial neural network; COMS MI; Deep neural network; Random forest; Solar radiation; Support vector machine","Decision trees; Geostationary satellites; Machine learning; Mean square error; Network layers; Neural networks; Sensitivity analysis; Solar radiation; Support vector machines; K fold cross validations; Machine learning approaches; Random forests; Retrieval performance; Root mean square errors; Satellite multispectral data; Spatial characteristics; Support vector regression (SVR); Deep neural networks",Article,Scopus

Ten calibration and validation experiments using the MOCOM-UA optimization algorithm coupled with the MGB-SED model were carried out, which, over the same period of time, resulted in 37 calibration and 111 validation tests. The experiments were performed by modifying metrics, spatial discretization, observed data and parameters of the MOCOM-UA algorithm. Results generally demonstrated that the values of correlation presented slight variations and were superior in the calibration step.

The location and quantity of BMPs were obtained from the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service National Conservation Planning (NCP) database. A Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was built and calibrated for this predominantly agricultural Eagle Creek watershed, incorporating NCP BMPs and monitoring data at the watershed outlet, an edge-of-field (EOF), and tile monitoring sites. Input air temperature modifications were required to induce simulated tile flow to match monitoring data. Calibration heavily incorporated tile monitoring data to correctly proportion surface and subsurface flow, but calibration statistics were unsatisfactory at the EOF and tile monitoring sites. At the watershed outlet, satisfactory to very good calibration statistics were achieved over a 2-year calibration period, and satisfactory statistics were found in the 2-year validation period. SWAT fixes parameters controlling nutrients primarily at the watershed level; a refinement of these parameters at a smaller-scale could improve field-level calibration. Field-scale modeling results indicate that filter strips (FS) are the most effective single BMPs at reducing dissolved reactive phosphorus, and FS typically decreased sediment and nutrient yields when added to any other BMP or BMP combination. Cover crops were the most effective single, in-field practice by reducing nutrient loads over winter months. Watershed-scale results indicate BMPs can reduce sediment and nutrients, but reductions due to NCP BMPs in the Eagle Creek watershed for all water-quality constituents were less than 10%. Hypothetical scenarios simulated with increased BMP acreages indicate larger investments of the appropriate BMP or BMP combination can decrease watershed level loads. © 2018 by the authors.","Best management practices (BMPs); Edge-of-field (EOF); Field-scale; Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI); Nutrients; Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT); Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB)","Agriculture; Calibration; Conservation; Lakes; Monitoring; Nutrients; Restoration; Water quality; Best management practice (BMPs); Edge-of-field (EOF); Field scale; Great lakes; Lake Erie; Soil and water assessment tool; Watersheds",Article,Scopus

The performances of the crop model for two different assimilation methods were compared by employing particle filters (PF) and the proper orthogonal decomposition-based ensemble four-dimensional variational (POD4DVar) strategies. The uncertainties of wheat yield estimates due to different assimilation temporal scales (phenological stages and temporal frequencies) and spatial scale were also analyzed. The results showed that, compared with the crop model without assimilation and with PF-based assimilation, a better yield estimate performance resulted when the POD4DVar-based strategy was used at the field scale. When using this strategy, root mean square errors (RMSE) of 523 kg·ha-1, 543 kg·ha-1 and 172 kg·ha-1 and relative errors (RE) of 5.65%, 5.91% and 7.77% were obtained at the field plot scale, a pixel scale of 1 km and the county scale, respectively. Although the best yield estimates were obtained when all of the observed LAIs were assimilated into the crop model, an acceptable estimate of crop yield could also be achieved by assimilating fewer observations between jointing and anthesis periods of the crop growth season. With decreasing assimilation frequency and pixel resolution, the accuracy of the crop yield estimates decreased; however, the computation time decreased. Thus, it is important to consider reasonable spatio-temporal scales to obtain tradeoffs between accuracy and effectiveness in regional wheat estimates. © 2017 by the authors.","Assimilation; Crop model; Four-dimensional variational; Leaf area index; Particle filter; Spatio-temporal; Uncertainties","Agriculture; Distributed computer systems; Mean square error; Monte Carlo methods; Pixels; Principal component analysis; Target tracking; Uncertainty analysis; Assimilation; Crop model; Four dimensional variational; Leaf Area Index; Particle filter; Spatio temporal; Uncertainties; Crops",Article,Scopus

In this work, we analyze if and to what extent the bias in the simulated crop yield can be reduced by using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model to downscale ERA-Interim (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis) rainfall and radiation data. Then, we evaluate the uncertainties resulting from both the choice of the physical parameterizations of the WRF model and its internal variability. Impact assessments were performed at two sites in Sub-Saharan Africa and by using two crop models to simulate Niger pearl millet and Benin maize yields. We find that the use of the WRF model to downscale ERA-Interim climate data generally reduces the bias in the simulated crop yield, yet this reduction in bias strongly depends on the choices in the model setup. Among the physical parameterizations considered, we show that the choice of the land surface model (LSM) is of primary importance. When there is no coupling with a LSM, or when the LSM is too simplistic, the simulated precipitation and then the simulated yield are null, or respectively very low; therefore, coupling with a LSM is necessary. The convective scheme is the second most influential scheme for yield simulation, followed by the shortwave radiation scheme. The uncertainties related to the internal variability of the WRF model are also significant and reach up to 30% of the simulated yields. These results suggest that regional models need to be used more carefully in order to improve the reliability of impact assessments. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.","crop model; EPIC; regional climate model; SARRA-H; West Africa; WRF","Agriculture; Climate change; Crops; Weather forecasting; Crop model; EPIC; Regional climate modeling; SARRA-H; West Africa; WRF; Climate models; assessment method; climate effect; climate modeling; crop yield; error analysis; regional climate; uncertainty analysis; weather forecasting; West Africa; Pennisetum glaucum; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

Further, we study the impact of these data issues on various machine learning approaches within the context of agriculture. Finally, we identify some of the common pitfalls in the machine learning and agriculture research including the misapplication of machine learning evaluation techniques.

Environmental data collected at the field level, such as soil and climatic information, can be relevant to improve predictive ability in genomic prediction models by describing more precisely genotype-by-environment interactions, which represent a key component of the phenotypic response for complex crop agronomic traits. Modern predictive modeling approaches can efficiently handle various data types and are able to capture complex nonlinear relationships in large datasets. In particular, machine learning techniques have gained substantial interest in recent years. Here we examined the predictive ability of machine learning-based models for two phenotypic traits in maize using data collected by the Maize Genomes to Fields (G2F) Initiative. The data we analyzed consisted of multi-environment trials (METs) dispersed across the United States and Canada from 2014 to 2017. An assortment of soil- and weather-related variables was derived and used in prediction models alongside genotypic data. Linear random effects models were compared to a linear regularized regression method (elastic net) and to two nonlinear gradient boosting methods based on decision tree algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM). These models were evaluated under four prediction problems: (1) tested and new genotypes in a new year; (2) only unobserved genotypes in a new year; (3) tested and new genotypes in a new site; (4) only unobserved genotypes in a new site. Accuracy in forecasting grain yield performance of new genotypes in a new year was improved by up to 20% over the baseline model by including environmental predictors with gradient boosting methods. For plant height, an enhancement of predictive ability could neither be observed by using machine learning-based methods nor by using detailed environmental information. An investigation of key environmental factors using gradient boosting frameworks also revealed that temperature at flowering stage, frequency and amount of water received during the vegetative and grain filling stage, and soil organic matter content appeared as important predictors for grain yield in our panel of environments.

An experimental trial was conducted in 2020 and 2021, involving two fertility conditions and five japonica rice cultivars (Aichinokaori, Asahi, Hatsushimo, Nakate Shinsenbon, and Nikomaru). Multi-temporal VIs were used to estimate AGB and LAI throughout the growth period with the extreme gradient boosting model and Gompertz model. The optimum time windows for predicting yield for each cultivar were determined using a single-day linear regression model. The results show that AGB and LAI could be estimated from VIs (R2: 0.56–0.83 and 0.57–0.73), and the optimum time window for UAV flights differed between cultivars, ranging from 4 to 31 days between the tillering stage and the initial heading stage.

In the case of agriculture, forecasting is an essential element of effective and efficient farm management. Factors affecting crop yields, such as soil, weather, and farm management, are complex and investigations into the relation between these variables are crucial for agricultural studies and decision-making related to crop monitoring, with special emphasis for climate change. Because of this, the aim of this study was to create a spring barley yield prediction model, as a part of the Advisory Support platform in the form of application for Polish agriculture under a moderate input management system. As a representative sample, 20 barley varieties, evaluated under 13 environments representative for Polish conditions, were used. To create yield potential model data for the genotype (G), environment (E), and management (M) were collected over 3 years. The model developed using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) simulated barley yields with high goodness of fit to the measured data across three years of evaluation. On average, the precision of the cultivar yielding forecast (expressed as a percentage), based on the independent traits, was 78.60% (Model F-statistic: 102.55***) and the range, depending of the variety, was 89.10% (Model F-statistic: 19.26***)–74.60% (Model F-statistic: 6.88***). The model developed using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) simulated barley yields with high goodness of fit to the measured data across three years of evaluation. It was possible to observe a large differentiation for the response to agroclimatic or soil factors. Under Polish conditions, ten traits have a similar effect (in the prediction model, they have the same sign: + or -) on the yield of almost all varieties (from 17 to 20). Traits that negatively affected final yield were: lodging tendency for 18 varieties (18-), sum of rainfall in January for 19 varieties (19-), and April for 17 varieties (17-). However, the sum of rainfall in February positively affected the final yield for 20 varieties (20+). Average monthly ground temperature in March positively affected final yield for 17 varieties (17+). The average air temperature in March negatively affected final yield for 18 varieties (18-) and for 17 varieties in June (17-). In total, the level of N + P + K fertilization negatively affected the final yield for 15 varieties (15-), but N sum fertilization significantly positively affected final yield for 15 varieties (15+). Soil complex positively influenced the final yield of this crop. In the group of diseases, resistance to powdery mildew and rhynchosporium significantly decreased the final yield. For Polish conditions, it is a complex model for prediction of variety in the yield, including its genetic potential. © 2022 by the authors.","barley; data analysis; decision-making; moderate input management system; precision farming; predictive analytics; spring barley; yield potential",,Article,Scopus

We evaluated the potential of the new PRISMA hyperspectral sensor for mapping soil organic matter (SOM), available soil phosphorus (P2O5), and potassium (K2O) content over a cultivated area in Khouribga, northern Morocco. These soil nutrients were estimated using (i) the random forest (RF) algorithm based on feature selection methods, including feature subset evaluation and feature ranking methods belonging to three categories (i.e., filter, wrapper, and embedded techniques), and (ii) 107 soil samples taken from the study area. The results show that the RF-embedded method produced better predictive accuracy compared with the filter and wrapper methods.

The distribution of total phosphorus concentrations (Pt) in relation to environmental attributes (terrain slope, soil class, and land use) and stream flow was assessed with the help of SWAT, the well-known Soil and Water Assessment Tool, coupled with box-plot and cluster analyses. The Pt were obtained from 33 sampling points monitored on a weekly basis. Mean values varied from 0.02 to 1.1 mg/L and maximum from 0.2 to 15.9 mg/L across the basin. The modeling results exposed an impact on the quality of Paraopeba River water in a stretch extending 8.8–155.3 km from the B1 dam, related with the rupture. In this sector, if the contribution from the rupture could be isolated from the other sources, the average Pt would be 0.1 mg/L. The highest Pt (15.9 mg/L) was directly proportional to the urban area of a sub-basin intersecting the limits of Betim town and Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Region. In general, urban sprawl as well as forest-agriculture and forest-mining conversions showed a close relationship with increased Pt, as did sub-basins with a predominance of argisols and an accentuated slope (>20%). There were various moments presenting Pt above legal thresholds (e.g., >0.15 mg/L), mainly in the rainy season. © 2022 by the authors.

We demonstrate the design and deployment of a 23-node WUSN installed at an agricultural field site that covers an area with a 530 m radius. The WUSN has continuously operated since September 2019, enabling real-time monitoring of soil volumetric water content (VWC), soil temperature (ST), and soil electrical conductivity. Secondly, we present data collected over a nine-month period across three seasons. We evaluate the performance of a deep learning algorithm in predicting soil VWC using various combinations of the received signal strength (RSSI) from each buried wireless node, aboveground pathloss, the distance between wireless node and receive antenna (D), ST, air temperature (AT), relative humidity (RH), and precipitation as input parameters to the model.

The objective is to estimate the optimal economic gain while preserving water resources on irrigation by considering various related factors such as climatic conditions, crop management practices, soil characteristics, and crop yield. The case study focuses on olive tree farms located on the Hellenic Island of Crete. Real data from the farms and the weather in the area will be used. The target is to build a framework that will preprocess input data, compare the results among a group of Machine Learning algorithms and propose the best-predicted value of economic profit. Various aspects during this process will be thoroughly examined such as the bias-variance tradeoff and the problem of overfitting, data transforms, feature engineering and selection, ensemble methods as well as pursuing optimal resampling towards better model accuracy.

(1) Background: Tree-ring width chronologies have been successfully applied for crops yield reconstruction models. We propose application of separated earlywood and latewood width chronologies as possible pre-dictors improving the fitness of reconstruction models. (2) Methods: The generalized yield series of main crops (spring wheat, spring barley, oats) were investigated in rain-fed and irrigated areas in semiarid steppes of South Siberia. Chronologies of earlywood, latewood, and total ring width of Siberian larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.) growing in forest-steppe in the middle of the study area were tested as predictors of yield reconstruction models. (3) Results: In the rain-fed territory, separation of earlywood and latewood allowed increasing variation of yield explained by reconstruction model from 17.4 to 20.5%, whereas total climatic-driven component of variation was 41.5%. However, both tree-ring based models explained only 7.7% of yield variation in the irrigated territory (climate inclusion increased it to 34.8%). Low temperature sensitivity of larch growth was the main limitation of the model. A 240-year (1780–2019) history of crop failures and yield variation dynamics were estimated from the actual data and the best reconstruction model. (4) Conclusions: Presently in the study region, breeding of the environment-resistant crops varieties compensates the increase of temperature in the yield dynamics, preventing severe harvest losses. Tree-ring based reconstructions may help to understand and forecast response of the crops to the climatic variability, and also the probability of crop failures, particularly in the rain-fed territories. © 2021 by the authors.

However, existing models are very complex and require hundreds of variables to perform accurately. Due to these shortcomings, large-scale applications of crop models are limited. In order to address these limitations, reliable crop models were developed using a deep neural network (DNN) – a new approach for predicting crop yields. In addition, the number of required input variables was reduced using three common variable selection techniques: namely Bayesian variable selection, Spearman's rank correlation, and Principal Component Analysis Feature Extraction. The reduced-variable DNN models were capable of estimating future crop yields for 10,000,000 different weather and irrigation scenarios while maintaining comparable accuracy levels to the original model that used all input variables. To establish clear superiority of the methodology, the results were also compared with a very recent feature selection algorithm called min-redundancy max-relevance (mRMR). The results of this study showed that the Bayesian variable selection was the best method for achieving the aforementioned goals. Specifically, the final Bayesian-based DNN model with a structure of 10 neurons in 5 layers performed very similarly (78.6% accuracy) to the original DNN crop model with 400 neurons in 10 layers, even though the size of the neural network was reduced by 80-fold.

For large-scale applications, FCC is usually estimated from remotely sensed data by inverting radiative transfer models (RTMs) or using data-driven regressions. In this article, we proposed a hybrid model, which combines a 3-D RTM and transfer learning-based convolutional neural network (T-CNN), to estimate FCC from very high-resolution satellite images (e.g., Chinese GaoFen-2, 1 m resolution with 4 bands). Unlike common hybrid models that are purely trained with simulation data, T-CNN combines simulation data-based pre-training and actual data-based transfer learning, which is a widely used technique in artificial intelligence for fine-tuning models. The performance of T-CNN was compared with a random forest (RF) model and two general CNN models, including CNN trained with actual dataset only (data-CNN) and CNN trained with RTM simulation data only (RTM-CNN). Results on the independent validation dataset (not used in training stage) showed that T-CNN had higher accuracy (RMSE = 0.121, R2 = 0.83), compared with RF (RMSE = 0.26, R2 = 0.61), Data-CNN (RMSE = 0.142, R2 = 0.81), and RTM-CNN (RMSE = 0.144, R2 = 0.73), which indicates that T-CNN has a strong transferability. Tests on different training sizes showed that T-CNN (0.084 < RMSE < 0.108) provided constantly better performances than RF (0.116 < RMSE < 0.122) and data-CNN (0.103 < RMSE < 0.128), which demonstrates the potential of T-CNN as an alternative to RTM-based inversion and data-driven regressions to estimate FCC, especially when training data is imbalanced and inadequate. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","convolutional neural network (CNN); forest canopy cover (FCC); Three-dimensional (3-D) radiative transfer model; transfer learning","Biological systems; Convolution; Decision trees; Forestry; Neural networks; Radiative transfer; Three dimensional computer graphics; Timber; 3d radiative transfer model; Biological system modeling; Canopy cover; Convolutional neural network; Forest canopies; Forest canopy cover; Radiative transfer modelling; Solid modelling; Three-dimensional display; Transfer learning; Three dimensional displays; accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; data set; forest canopy; forest cover; model validation; radiative transfer; regression analysis; satellite imagery; three-dimensional modeling",Article,Scopus

However, little is known about interconnections between EMF and taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities of rare and abundant bacteria. Using MiSeq sequencing and multiple statistical analyses, we evaluated the maintenance of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities of rare and abundant bacteria and their contributions to EMF in salinized agricultural soils (0.09 to 19.91 dS/m). Rare bacteria exhibited closer phylogenetic clustering and broader environmental breadths than abundant ones, while abundant bacteria showed higher functional redundancies and stronger phylogenetic signals of ecological preferences than rare ones. Variable selection (86.7%) dominated rare bacterial community assembly, and dispersal limitation (54.7%) and variable selection (24.5%) determined abundant bacterial community assembly. Salinity played a decisive role in mediating the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes and showed significant effects on functions and diversities of both rare and abundant bacteria. Rare bacterial taxonomic a-diversity and abundant bacterial phylogenetic a-diversity contributed significantly to EMF, while abundant bacterial taxonomic a-diversity and rare bacterial phylogenetic a-diversity did not. Additionally, abundant rather than rare bacterial community function had a significant effect on soil EMF. These findings extend our knowledge of environmental adaptation of rare and abundant bacteria and highlight different contributions of taxonomic and phylogenetic a-diversities of rare and abundant bacteria to soil EMF. IMPORTANCE Soil salinization is a worldwide environmental problem and threatens plant productivity and microbial diversity. Understanding the generation and maintenance of microbial diversity is essential to estimate soil tillage potential via investigating ecosystem multifunctionality. Our sequence-based data showed differences in environmental adaptations of rare and abundant bacteria at taxonomic and phylogenetic levels, which led to different contributions of taxonomic and phylogenetic a-diversities of rare and abundant bacteria to soil EMF. Studying the diversity of rare and abundant bacteria and their contributions to EMF in salinized soils is critical for guiding soil restoration.

The number of sensors and data acquisition methods have been increasing, and their evaluation is becoming a necessity. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of two remote sensing data for describing the variations of biometric and physiological parameters of durum wheat grown under different water regimes (rainfed, 50% and 100% of irrigation requirements). The experimentation was carried out in Policoro (Southern Italy) for two growing seasons. The Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images and radiometric ground-based data were acquired regularly during the growing season with plant biometric (leaf area index and dry aboveground biomass) and physiological (stomatal conductance, net assimilation, and transpiration rate) parameters. Water deficit index was closely related to plant water status and crop physiological parameters. The enhanced vegetation index showed slightly better performance than the normalized difference vegetation index when plotted against the leaf area index with R2 = 0.73. The overall results indicated that the ground-based vegetation indices were in good agreement with the satellite-based indices. The main constraint for effective application of satellite-based indices remains the presence of clouds during the acquisition time, which is particularly relevant for winter-spring crops. Therefore, the integration of remote sensing and field data might be needed to optimize plant response under specific growing conditions and to enhance agricultural production. © 2020 by the authors.","Enhanced vegetation index; Irrigation; Vegetation indices; Water deficit index","Agricultural robots; Biometrics; Crops; Data acquisition; Parameter estimation; Physiological models; Physiology; Satellites; Vegetation; Above ground biomass; Agricultural productions; Enhanced vegetation index; Irrigation requirements; Normalized difference vegetation index; Physiological parameters; Remote sensing technology; Satellite remote sensing; Remote sensing; data acquisition; growing season; irrigation system; Landsat; leaf area index; NDVI; optimization; physiological response; remote sensing; transpiration; Italy; Triticum aestivum; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum",Article,Scopus

To date, very few radiation products provide estimates of Rdif, and systematic validation and evaluation are even more scare. In this study, Rdif estimates from Reanalysis Fifth Generation (ERA5) of European Center for Medium-RangeWeather Forecasts and satellite-based retrieval (called JiEA) are evaluated over East Asia using ground measurements at 39 stations fromWorld Radiation Data Center (WRDC) and China Meteorological Administration (CMA). The results show that JiEA agrees well with measurements, while ERA5 underestimates Rdif significantly. Both datasets perform better at monthly mean scale than at daily mean and hourly scale. The mean bias error and root-mean-square error of daily mean estimates are-1.21 W/m2 and 20.06 W/m2 for JiEA and-17.18 W/m2 and 32.42 W/m2 for ERA5, respectively. Regardless of over-or underestimation, correlations of estimated time series of ERA5 and JiEA show high similarity. JiEA reveals a slight decreasing trend at regional scale, but ERA5 shows no significant trend, and neither of them reproduces temporal variability of ground measurements. Data accuracy of ERA5 is more robust than JiEA in time but less in space. Latitudinal dependency is noted for ERA5 while not for JiEA. In addition, spatial distributions of Rdif from ERA5 and JiEA show pronounced discrepancy. Neglect of adjacency effects caused by horizontal photon transport is the main cause for Rdif underestimation of ERA5. Spatial analysis calls for improvements to the representation of clouds, aerosols and water vapor for reproducing fine spatial distribution and seasonal variations of Rdif. © 2020 by the authors.","Atmospheric factor; Spatial pattern; Surface diffuse solar radiation; Temporal trend","Energy utilization; Mean square error; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Adjacency effect; Diffuse solar radiations; Ground measurements; Mean bias errors; Plant productivity; Root mean square errors; Seasonal variation; Temporal variability; Spatial distribution",Article,Scopus

Designing and deploying a WSN is a challenging and multivariate task, dependent on the considered environment. For example, a need for network synchronization arises in such networks to correlate acquired measurements. This work focuses on the design and installation of a WSN that is capable of facilitating the sensing aspects of smart and precision agriculture applications.

This is the first approach to evaluate macro-and micronutrient content with both machine learning and reflectance/first-derivative data. For this, citrus-leaves collected at a Valencia-orange orchard were used. Their spectral data was measured with a Fieldspec ASD FieldSpec® HandHeld 2 spectroradiometer and the surface reflectance and first-derivative spectra from the spectral range of 380 to 1020 nm (640 spectral bands) was evaluated. A total of 320 spectral signatures were collected, and the leaf-nutrient content (N, P, K, Mg, S, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn) was associated with them. For this, 204,800 (320 x 640) combinations were used. The following machine learning algorithms were used in this framework: k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF). The training methods were assessed based on Cross-Validation and Leave-One-Out. The Relief-F metric of the algorithms' prediction was used to determine the most contributive wavelength or spectral region associated with each nutrient. This approach was able to return, with high predictions (R2), nutrients like N (0.912), Mg (0.832), Cu (0.861), Mn (0.898), and Zn (0.855), and, to a lesser extent, P (0.771), K (0.763), and S (0.727). These accuracies were obtained with different algorithms, but RF was the most suitable to model most of them.

Statistical or process-based crop models can be used to quantify how yields will respond to these events and future climate change. However, the accuracy of weather-yield relationships derived from crop models, whether statistical or process-based, is dependent on the quality of the underlying input data used to run these models. In this context, a major challenge in many developing countries is the lack of accessible and reliable meteorological datasets. Gridded weather datasets, derived from combinations of in situ gauges, remote sensing, and climate models, provide a solution to fill this gap, and have been widely used to evaluate climate impacts on agriculture in data-scarce regions worldwide. However, these reference datasets are also known to contain important biases and uncertainties. To date, there has been little research to assess how the choice of reference datasets influences projected sensitivity of crop yields to weather. We compare multiple freely available gridded datasets that provide daily weather data over the Indian sub-continent over the period 1983-2005, and explore their implications for estimates of yield responses to weather variability for key crops grown in the region (wheat and rice). Our results show that individual gridded weather datasets vary in their representation of historic spatial and temporal temperature and precipitation patterns across India. We show that these differences create large uncertainties in estimated crop yield responses and exposure to variability in growing season weather, which in turn, highlights the need for improved consideration of input data uncertainty in statistical studies that explore impacts of climate variability and change on agriculture. © 2019 The Author(s).

The emergence of high-resolution images, such as Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, enables the identification of corn at the field scale, and these images can be applied on a large scale with the support of cloud computing technology. Hebei Province is the major production area of corn in China, and faces serious groundwater overexploitation due to irrigation. Corn was mapped using multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. A total of 1712 scenes of Sentinel-2 data and 206 scenes of Sentinel-1 data acquired from June to October 2017 were processed to composite image metrics as input to a random forest (RF) classifier. To avoid speckle noise in the classification results, the pixel-based classification result was integrated with the object segmentation boundary completed in eCognition software to generate an object-based corn map according to crop intensity. The results indicated that the approach using multitemporal SAR and optical images in the GEE cloud platform is reliable for corn mapping. The corn map had a high F1-Score of 90.08% and overall accuracy of 89.89% according to the test dataset, which was not involved in model training. The corn area estimated from optical and SAR images was well correlated with the census data, with an R2 = 0.91 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 470.90 km2.

Low tropics lands cattle, face the challenge to adapt the production systems to the climate change consequences, wich has generated longer dry seasons and more food shortage for the animals during these periods. Objective. The objective of this literature review was to collect and analyze research results on shrubs forage species Tithonia diverfisolia, Gliricidia sepium, Cratylia argentea, and Crescentia cujete as a strategy to improve the nutritional offer in livestock in the low tropics. Development. In Colombia, beef cattle production is mainly located in the low tropics, and usually have feeding problems due to poor grasses quality and low availability in drought period. Silvopastoral systems (SSP) contribute to improve the productive and reproductive performance of cattle, since they integrate trees and/or shrubs, and grasses, combining diverse forage strata, with a greater nutritional and forage offer than conventional systems. The shrubs T. diverfisolia, G. sepium, C. argentea, y C. cujete due to their multipurpose characteristics, biomass production, and adaptation to diverse climatic and edaphic conditions, have been used in grazing, fodder banks, live fences and forage conservation, e.g. silage. Conclusion. Due to their characteristics, uses, biomass production, and nutritional profile, it would be pertinent to evaluate the behavior of these species in feeding strategies in cattle farms under tropics conditions. © 2019 Universidad de Costa Rica.

Therefore, we gathered and accumulated 26 to 63 ground survey sample fields, accounting for about 0.05% of the total cultivated areas, as the training samples for our regression models. To demonstrate whether the spatial autocorrelation or spatial heterogeneity exists and dominates the estimation, global models including the ordinary least squares (OLS), support vector regression (SVR), and the local model geographically weighted regression (GWR) were used to build the yield estimation models. We obtained the representative independent variables, including 4 original bands, 11 vegetation indices, and 32 texture indices, from SPOT-7 multispectral satellite imagery. To determine the optimal variable combination, feature selection based on the Pearson correlation was used for all of the regression models. The case study in Central Taiwan rendered that the error rate was between 0.06% and 13.22%. Through feature selection, the GWR model's performance was more relatively stable than the OLS model and nonlinear SVR model for yield estimation. Where the GWR model considers the spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity of the relationships between the yield and the independent variables, the OLS and nonlinear SVR models lack this feature; this led to the rice yield estimation of GWR in this study be more stable than those of the other two models. © 2019 by the authors.","Geographically weighted regression; Grey-level co-occurrence matrix; Support vector regression; Vegetation indices; Yield estimation","Autocorrelation; Feature extraction; Food supply; Satellite imagery; Textures; Vegetation; Geographically weighted regression; Grey level co-occurrence matrixes; Support vector regression (SVR); Vegetation index; Yield estimation; Regression analysis",Article,Scopus

Evaluation of hydrological responses and biofuel production potential of hypothetical land use change from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) to cellulosic bioenergy crops enables better understanding of the associated key agroecosystem processes and provides for the feasibility assessment of the targeted land use change in the SHP. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to assess the impacts of replacing cotton with perennial Alamo switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), Miscanthus × giganteus (Miscanthus sinensis Anderss. [Poaceae]), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and annual biomass sorghum on water balances, water use efficiency and biofuel production potential in the Double Mountain Fork Brazos watershed. Under perennial grass scenarios, the average (1994–2009) annual surface runoff from the entire watershed decreased by 6–8% relative to the baseline cotton scenario. In contrast, surface runoff increased by about 5% under the biomass sorghum scenario. Perennial grass land use change scenarios suggested an increase in average annual percolation within a range of 3–22% and maintenance of a higher soil water content during August to April compared to the baseline cotton scenario. About 19.1, 11.1, 3.2 and 8.8 Mg ha−1 of biomass could potentially be produced if cotton area in the watershed would hypothetically be replaced by Miscanthus, switchgrass, big bluestem and biomass sorghum, respectively. Finally, Miscanthus and switchgrass were found to be ideal bioenergy crops for the dryland and irrigated systems, respectively, in the study watershed due to their higher water use efficiency, better water conservation effects, greater biomass and biofuel production potential, and minimum crop management requirements. © 2015 The Authors.

However, plant stress may also be profitable since it behaves hormetically; at low doses, it stimulates positive traits in crops, such as the synthesis of specialized metabolites and additional stress tolerance. The controlled exposure of crops to low doses of stressors is therefore called hormesis management, and it is a promising method to increase crop productivity and quality. Nevertheless, hormesis management has severe limitations derived from the complexity of plant physiological responses to stress. Many technological advances assist plant stress science in overcoming such limitations, which results in extensive datasets originating from the multiple layers of the plant defensive response. For that reason, artificial intelligence tools, particularly Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), have become crucial for processing and interpreting data to accurately model plant stress responses such as genomic variation, gene and protein expression, and metabolite biosynthesis. In this review, we discuss the most recent ML and DL applications in plant stress science, focusing on their potential for improving the development of hormesis management protocols. © 2022 by the authors.

Field-scale models have increased our understanding of rice yield and its estimation under theoretical environmental conditions. However, they offer little information on spatial variability effects on farm-scale yield. Remote Sensing (RS) is a useful tool to upscale yield estimates from farm scales to regional levels. Much research used RS with rice models for reliable yield estimation. As several countries start to operationalize rice monitoring systems, it is needed to synthesize current literature to identify knowledge gaps, to improve estimation accuracies, and to optimize processing. This paper critically reviewed significant developments in using geospatial methods, imagery, and quantitative models to estimate rice yield. First, essential characteristics of rice were discussed as detected by optical and radar sensors, band selection, sensor configuration, spatial resolution, mapping methods, and biophysical variables of rice derivable from RS data. Second, various empirical, process-based, and semi-empirical models that used RS data for spatial estimation of yield were critically assessed–discussing how major types of models, RS platforms, data assimilation algorithms, canopy state variables, and RS variables can be integrated for yield estimation. Lastly, to overcome current constraints and to improve accuracies, several possibilities were suggested–adding new modeling modules, using alternative canopy variables, and adopting novel modeling approaches. As rice yields are expected to decrease due to global warming, geospatial rice yield estimation techniques are indispensable tools for climate change assessments. Future studies should focus on resolving the current limitations of estimation by precise delineation of rice cultivars, by incorporating dynamic harvesting indices based on climatic drivers, using innovative modeling approaches with machine learning. © 2021 Wuhan University.

Recent advances in big data analytics and computing power have popularized the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms to upscale site measurements of ecosystem processes, and in some cases forecast the response of these processes to climate change. Due to data limitations, however, ML model predictions of these processes are almost never validated with independent datasets. To better understand and characterize the limitations of these methods, we develop an approach to independently evaluate ML upscaling and forecasting. We mimic data-driven upscaling and forecasting efforts by applying ML algorithms to different subsets of regional process-model simulation gridcells, and then test ML performance using the remaining gridcells. In this study, we simulate C fluxes and environmental data across Alaska using ecosys, a process-rich terrestrial ecosystem model, and then apply boosted regression tree ML algorithms to training data configurations that mirror and expand upon existing AmeriFLUX eddy-covariance data availability. We first show that a ML model trained using ecosys outputs from currently-available Alaska AmeriFLUX sites incorrectly predicts that Alaska is presently a modeled net C source. Increased spatial coverage of the training dataset improves ML predictions, halving the bias when 240 modeled sites are used instead of 15. However, even this more accurate ML model incorrectly predicts Alaska C fluxes under 21st century climate change because of changes in atmospheric CO2, litter inputs, and vegetation composition that have impacts on C fluxes which cannot be inferred from the training data. Our results provide key insights to future C flux upscaling efforts and expose the potential for inaccurate ML upscaling and forecasting of high-latitude C cycle dynamics. © 2023 The Author(s).

We described different types of models available in the field of modeling groundwater nitrate contamination, the models used, the input requirements of different models, and the evaluation metrics used. Out of all the models reviewed, stand-alone process-based models are predominantly used for modeling nitrate contamination, followed by integrated models, with HYDRUS and LEACHM models being the two most commonly used process-based models worldwide. Most models are evaluated using the statistical metric Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) followed by the correlation coefficient (r).

The development of salt-tolerant genotypes is critical for mitigating yield losses, and this journey begins with the identification of sensitive and tolerant plants. Numerous physiologic and molecular markers for detecting salt-tolerant wheat genotypes have been developed. One of them is proline, which has been used for a long time but has received little information about proline-related genes in wheat genotypes. In this study, proline content and the expression levels of proline-related genes (TaPTF1, TaDHN, TaSRG, TaSC, TaPIMP1, TaMIP, TaHKT1;4, TaGSK, TaP5CS, and TaMYB) were examined in sensitive, moderate, and tolerant genotypes under salt stress (0, 50, 150, and 250 mM NaCl) for 0, 12, and 24 h. Our results show that salt stress increased the proline content in all genotypes, but it was found higher in salt-tolerant genotypes than in moderate and sensitive genotypes. The salinity stress increased gene expression levels in salt-tolerant and moderate genotypes. While salt-stress exposure for 12 and 24 h had a substantial effect on gene expression in wheat, TaPTF1, TaPIMP1, TaMIP, TaHKT1;4, and TaMYB genes were considerably upregulated in 24 h. The salt-tolerant genotypes showed a higher positive interaction than a negative interaction. The TaPTF1, TaP5CS, TaGSK1, and TaSRG genes were found to be more selective than the other analyzed genes under salt-stress conditions. Despite each gene’s specific function, increasing proline biosynthesis functioned as a common mechanism for separating salt tolerance from sensitivity. © 2022 by the authors.","correlation network analysis; gene expression; proline-related genes; qRT-PCR; salt stress",,Article,Scopus

Landsat 9, the latest launched Landsat satellite, is the successor and continuation of Landsat 8, providing a highly promising data resource for land cover change, forest surveys, and terrestrial ecosystem monitoring. Regression kriging was developed in the study to improve the AGB estimation and mapping using the Landsat 9 image in Wangyedian forest farm, northern China. Multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine (SVM), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and random forest (RF) were used as the original models to predict the AGB trends, and the optimal model was used to overlay the results of kriging interpolation based on the residuals to obtain the new AGB predictions. In addition, Landsat 8 images in Wangyedian were used for comparison and verification with Landsat 9. The results showed that all bands of Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 maintained a high degree of uniformity, with positive correlation coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.89 (p &lt; 0.01).

Further, the R2 and the lowest RMSE for Landsat 8 were 0.88 and 16.83 t/ha, while, for Landsat 9, they were 0.87 and 17.91 t/ha.

With the increasing demand for food and forage, intensive agricultural practices have been adopted in the maize production systems. In this direction, considerable research efforts have been made to examine the effects of different types of cover crops as a green manure on maize productivity; however, no consistent conclusions have been reached so far. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to examine the possibility of predicting the effects of winter cover crops (CC) integrated with different management practices on the morphological traits, yield, and yield components of maize. The experiment was carried out on chernozem soil from 2016 to 2020 as a randomized complete block design arranged as a split-split-plot with three replicates. The pea as a sole crop (P) and the mixture of pea and triticale (PT) are sown as winter CC with the following subplots: (i) CC used as green manure, and (ii) CC used as forage and removed before maize sowing. The artificial neural network is used for exploring nonlinear functions of the tested parameters and 13 categorical input variables for modeling according to the following factors: CC, way of using CC, N fertilization, and year. The computed maximums of plant height, number of leaves, number of internodes, plant density, number of ears, grain yield, 1000-grain weight, hectolitre weight, dry matter harvest residue, harvest index, leaves percentage, stems percentage, and ears percentage are as follows: 232.3 cm; 9.7; 10.2; 54,340 plants ha−1; 0.9; 9.8 t ha−1; 272.4 g; 67.0 kg HL−1; 9.2 t ha−1; 0.52; 18.9%; 36.0%, and 45.1%, respectively. The optimal result is obtained with peas used as green manure, with 50 kg N ha−1 and in the climatic conditions of 2018.

In the reviewed papers, machine learning models (also called data-driven models) are used to improve the prediction or speed process of existing numerical modelling. When long runtimes inhibit the use of numerical models, machine learning models can be a valid alternative, capable of reducing the time for model development and calibration without sacrificing accuracy of detail in groundwater level forecasting. The results of this review highlight that machine learning models do not offer a complete representation of the physical system, such as flux estimates or total water balance and, thus, cannot be used to substitute numerical models in large study areas; however, they are affordable tools to improve predictions at specific observation wells. Numerical and machine learning models can be successfully used as complementary to each other as a powerful groundwater management tool. The machine learning techniques can be used to improve calibration of numerical models, whereas results of numerical models allow us to understand the physical system and select proper input variables for machine learning models. Machine learning models can be integrated in decision-making processes when rapid and effective solutions for groundwater management need to be considered.

These indicators are used to validate the spatial impacts of climate change on grain production. Air pollution data are used as instrumental variables to address the causality between climate and grain production. The regression results show that: First, climatic variables all have a non-linear “increasing then decreasing” effect on food production. Second, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5 have a negative impact on grain production.

We sought to develop an ML-based risk stratification model built on clinical, anatomical, and procedural features to predict all-cause mortality following contemporary bifurcation PCI. Multiple ML models to predict all-cause mortality were tested on a cohort of 2393 patients (training, n = 1795; internal validation, n = 598) undergoing bifurcation PCI with contemporary stents from the real-world RAIN registry. Twenty-five commonly available patient-/lesion-related features were selected to train ML models. The best model was validated in an external cohort of 1701 patients undergoing bifurcation PCI from the DUTCH PEERS and BIO-RESORT trial cohorts. At ROC curves, the AUC for the prediction of 2-year mortality was 0.79 (0.74–0.83) in the overall population, 0.74 (0.62–0.85) at internal validation and 0.71 (0.62–0.79) at external validation. Performance at risk ranking analysis, k-center cross-validation, and continual learning confirmed the generalizability of the models, also available as an online interface.

However, due to several constraints, achieving an effective vision-driven hand gesture recognition system in real time has remained a challenge. This paper aims to uncover the limitations faced in image acquisition through the use of cameras, image segmentation and tracking, feature extraction, and gesture classification stages of vision-driven hand gesture recognition in various camera orientations. This paper looked at research on vision-based hand gesture recognition systems from 2012 to 2022. Its goal is to find areas that are getting better and those that need more work. We used specific keywords to find 108 articles in well-known online databases. In this article, we put together a collection of the most notable research works related to gesture recognition. We suggest different categories for gesture recognition-related research with subcategories to create a valuable resource in this domain. We summarize and analyze the methodologies in tabular form. After comparing similar types of methodologies in the gesture recognition field, we have drawn conclusions based on our findings. Our research also looked at how well the vision-based system recognized hand gestures in terms of recognition accuracy. There is a wide variation in identification accuracy, from 68% to 97%, with the average being 86.6 percent.

Such predictions are difficult to achieve in regions that lack extensive observational records. Herein, we demonstrate how a number of basic or readily available input data can be used to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to provide months-ahead predictions of cotton yield for a case study in Menemen Plain, Turkey. We use limited reported yield (13 years) along cumulative precipitation, cumulative heat units, two meteorologically-based drought indices (Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)), and three remotely-sensed vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI)) as ANN inputs. Results indicate that, when EVI is combined with the preceding 12-month SPEI, it has better sensitivity to cotton yield than other indicators. The ANN model predicted cotton yield four months before harvest with R2 &gt;0.80, showing potential as a yield prediction tool. We discuss the effects of different combinations of input data (explanatory variables), dataset size, and selection of training data to inform future applications of ANN for early prediction of cotton yield in data-scarce regions. © 2022 by the authors.

The increasing temperatures and decreasing precipitation in many parts of the world have enhanced the frequency and severity of drought events. Therefore, a detailed analysis is required in order to determine the drought frequency and take the necessary precautions. In this study, the climatic conditions in the agricultural region of Çukurova (Turkey) were analysed. Meteorological data for the three provinces of Adana, Mersin, and Osmaniye were used. The aim was to calculate the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for each of the three provinces analysed, and to use these values to detect drought during the different growth periods of maize. We also investigated whether the SPI values for the last 30 years differ significantly between the provinces. Furthermore, indicators such as the duration, magnitude, severity, recurrence, and drought frequency were also calculated. Using linear regression analysis, we determined whether there were trends in the multi-year data for the total precipitation and mean temperature. In addition, the water deficiency was determined by examining the amount of water required by maize and the adequacy of the precipitation in each development period. As a result, it was found that the Çukurova region is prone to droughts, but they follow a mild course in most cases. However, no statistically significant differences were observed between the SPI values in the three provinces. The calculated average approximate drought recurrences (Tr) and expected intensities (Iave) were Tr ~ 1.036 years and Iave ~ 5.634 mm year−1 in 3 years for Adana, Tr ~ 1.031 years and Iave ~ −0.312 mm year−1 in 3 years for Mersin, and Tr ~ 1.052 years and Iave ~ −0.084 mm year−1 in 3 years Osmaniye. The research carried out in this paper confirmed that maize cultivation in the Çukurova region is vulnerable to drought, and adaptation actions should be taken immediately. © 2022 by the authors.

Specifically, in the field of computer vision, DNNs are becoming a core element in developing many image and video classification and recognition applications. However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, in which, given a well-trained image classification model, a malicious input can be crafted by adding mere perturbations to misclassify the image. This phenomena raise many security concerns in utilizing DNNs in critical life applications which attracts the attention of academic and industry researchers. As a result, multiple studies have proposed discussing novel attacks that can compromise the integrity of state-of-the-art image classification neural networks. The raise of these attacks urges the research community to explore countermeasure methods to mitigate these attacks and increase the reliability of adapting DDNs in different major applications. Hence, various defense strategies have been proposed to protect DNNs against adversarial attacks.

However, more recent studies have demonstrated promising PV solar power output forecasting performances by the decision tree (DT), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms. Therefore, the present study aims to address a research gap in this field by determining the best performer among these 5 algorithms. A data set from the United States’ National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) consisting of weather parameters and solar power output data for a monocrystalline silicon PV module in Cocoa, Florida was utilized. Comparisons of forecasting scores show that the ANN algorithm is superior as the ANN16 model produces the best mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R 2) with values of 0.4693, 0.8816 W, and 0.9988, respectively.

The traditional methods of yield assessment are costly, inefficient, and considered a bottleneck in modern precision agriculture. Recent advances in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and development of sensors have opened a new avenue for data acquisition cost-effectively and rapidly. We evaluated UAV-based multispectral and thermal images for in-season GY prediction using 30 winter wheat genotypes under 3 water treatments. For this, multispectral vegetation indices (VIs) and normalized relative canopy temperature (NRCT) were calculated and selected by the gray relational analysis (GRA) at each growth stage, i.e., jointing, booting, heading, flowering, grain filling, and maturity to reduce the data dimension. The elastic net regression (ENR) was developed by using selected features as input variables for yield prediction, whereas the entropy weight fusion (EWF) method was used to combine the predicted GY values from multiple growth stages. In our results, the fusion of dual-sensor data showed high yield prediction accuracy [coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.527–0.667] compared to using a single multispectral sensor (R2 = 0.130–0.461). Results showed that the grain filling stage was the optimal stage to predict GY with R2 = 0.667, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.881 t ha–1, relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) = 15.2%, and mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.721 t ha–1. The EWF model outperformed at all the individual growth stages with R2 varying from 0.677 to 0.729. The best prediction result (R2 = 0.729, RMSE = 0.831 t ha–1, RRMSE = 14.3%, and MAE = 0.684 t ha–1) was achieved through combining the predicted values of all growth stages. This study suggests that the fusion of UAV-based multispectral and thermal IR data within an ENR-EWF framework can provide a precise and robust prediction of wheat yield.

However, the adaptability of existing hybrids to a changing climate has not been systematically investigated. Therefore, little is known about the appropriate timing of hybrid adaptation. Here, using a novel hybrid model which coupled CERES-Maize with machine learning, we critically investigated the impacts of climate change on maize productivity with an ensemble of hybrid-specific estimations in China. We determined when and where current hybrids would become unviable and hybrid adaptation need be implemented, as well as which hybrid traits would be desirable. Climate change would have mostly negative impacts on maize productivity, and the magnitudes of yield reductions would highly depend on the growth cycle of the hybrids. Hybrid replacement could partially, but not completely, offset the yield loss caused by projected climate change. Without adaptation, approximately 53% of the cultivation areas would require hybrid renewal before 2050 under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios. The medium-maturing hybrids with a long grain-filling duration and a high light use efficiency would be promising, although the ideotypic traits could be different for a specific environment. The findings highlight the necessity and urgency of breeding climate resilient hybrids, providing policy-makers and crop breeders with the early signals of when, where and what hybrids will be required, which stimulate proactive investment to facilitate breeding. The proposed crop modelling approach is scalable, largely data-driven and can be used to tackle the longstanding problem of predicting hybrids' future performance to accelerate development of new crop hybrids. © 2021 The Author(s).

Despite the fact that deep neural network (DNN) models are increasingly applied across a wide range of fields, there are very few attempts to predict leaf photosynthetic capacity (indicated by maximum carboxylation rate, Vcmax, and maximum electron transport rate, Jmax) from reflected information. In this study, we have built a DNN model that uses leaf reflected spectra, alone or together with other leaf traits, for the reliable estimation of photosynthetic capacity, accounting for leaf types and growing periods in cool–temperate deciduous forests. Our results demonstrate that even though DNN models using only the reflectance spectra are capable of estimating both Vcmax and Jmax acceptably, their performance could nevertheless be improved by including information about other leaf biophysical/biochemical traits. The results highlight the fact that leaf spectra and leaf biophysical/biochemical traits are closely linked with leaf photosynthetic capacity, providing a practical and feasible approach to tracing functional traits. However, the DNN models developed in this study should undergo more extensive validation and training before being applied in other regions, and further refinements in future studies using larger datasets from a wide range of ecosystems are also necessary. © 2021 by the authors.

For this purpose, a rain shelter experiment (Exp. 1) with four irrigation quantities (0, 120, 240, 360 mm) and two nitrogen levels (75 and 255 kg N/ha), and field experiments (Exps. 2–3) with the same irrigation and rainfall water levels (360 mm) but different nitrogen levels (varying from 75 to 255 kg N/ha) were conducted in the North China Plain. The canopy reflectance was measured for all plots at 30 m using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted multispectral camera. Destructive sampling was conducted immediately after the UAV flights to measure total fresh and dry weight. Deep Neural Network (DNN) is a special type of neural network, which has shown performance in regression analysis is compared with other machine learning (ML) models. A feature selection (FS) algorithm named the decision tree (DT) was used as the automatic relevance determination method to obtain the relative relevance of 5 out of 67 vegetation indices (Vis), which were used for estimating EWT. The selected VIs were used to estimate EWT using multiple linear regression (MLR), deep neural network multilayer perceptron (DNN-MLP), artificial neural networks multilayer perceptron (ANN-MLP), boosted tree regression (BRT), and support vector machines (SVMs). The results show that the DNN-MLP with R2 = 0.934, NSE = 0.933, RMSE = 0.028 g/cm2, and MAE of 0.017 g/cm2 outperformed other ML algorithms (ANN-MPL, BRT, and SVM-Polynomial) owing to its high capacity for estimating EWT as compared to other ML methods. Our findings support the conclusion that ML can potentially be applied in combination with VIs for retrieving EWT. Despite the complexity of the ML models, the EWT map should help farmers by improving the real-time irrigation efficiency of wheat by quantifying field water content and addressing variability. © 2021 by the authors.

The CALCINEURIN B-LIKE PROTEIN (CBL) is a vital family of plant calcium sensor proteins that can transmit Ca2+ signals triggered by environmental stimuli including salt stress. Therefore, assessing the potential of NtCBL for genetic improvement of salt stress is valuable. In our studies on NtCBL members, constitutive overexpression of NtCBL5A was found to cause salt supersensitivity with necrotic lesions on leaves. NtCBL5A-overexpressing (OE) leaves tended to curl and accumulated high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under salt stress. The supersensitivity of NtCBL5A-OE leaves was specifically induced by Na+, but not by Cl−, osmotic stress, or drought stress. Ion content measurements indicated that NtCBL5A-OE leaves showed sensitivity to the Na+ accumulation levels that wild-type leaves could tolerate. Furthermore, transcriptome profiling showed that many immune response-related genes are significantly upregulated and photosynthetic machinery-related genes are significantly downregulated in salt-stressed NtCBL5A-OE leaves. In addition, the expression of several cation homeostasis-related genes was also affected in salt-stressed NtCBL5A-OE leaves. In conclusion, the constitutive overexpression of NtCBL5A interferes with the normal salt stress response of tobacco plants and leads to Na+-dependent leaf necrosis by enhancing the sensitivity of transgenic leaves to Na+. This Na+ sensitivity of NtCBL5A-OE leaves might result from the abnormal Na+ compartmentalization, plant photosynthesis, and plant immune response triggered by the constitutive overexpression of NtCBL5A. Identifying genes and pathways involved in this unusual salt stress response can provide new insights into the salt stress response of tobacco plants. © Copyright © 2021 Mao, Yuan, Mo, An, Shi, Visser, Bai, Sun, Liu, Liu, Wang and van der Linden.","CBL PROTEIN; immune response; Na+; necrotic lesions; photosystem; reactive oxygen species; salt stress; tobacco",,Article,Scopus

The effect of distance to trees in alley cropping AFS on yield‐related crop parameters has predominantly been studied using point data from transects. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a novel possibility to map plant traits with high spatial resolution and coverage. In the present study, UAV‐borne red, green, blue (RGB) and multispectral imagery was utilized for the prediction of whole crop dry biomass yield (DM) and leaf area index (LAI) of barley at three different conventionally managed silvoarable alley cropping agroforestry sites located in Germany. DM and LAI were modelled using random forest regression models with good accuracies (DM: R² 0.62, nRMSEp 14.9%, LAI: R² 0.92, nRMSEp 7.1%). Important variables for prediction included normalized reflectance, vegetation indices, texture and plant height. Maps were produced from model predictions for spatial analysis, showing significant effects of distance to trees on DM and LAI. Spatial patterns differed greatly between the sampled sites and suggested management and soil effects overriding tree effects across large portions of 96 m wide crop alleys, thus questioning alleged impacts of AFS tree rows on yield distribution in in-tensively managed barley populations. Models based on UAV‐borne imagery proved to be a valu-able novel tool for prediction of DM and LAI at high accuracies, revealing spatial variability in AFS with high spatial resolution and coverage. © 2021 by the authors.

The assessed bone age indicates the actual level of growth, whereby a large discrepancy between the assessed and chronological age might point to a growth disorder. Hence, skeletal bone age assessment is used to screen the possibility of growth abnormalities, genetic problems, and endocrine disorders. Usually, the manual screening is assessed through X-ray images of the non-dominant hand using the Greulich–Pyle (GP) or Tanner– Whitehouse (TW) approach. The GP uses a standard hand atlas, which will be the reference point to predict the bone age of a patient, while the TW uses a scoring mechanism to assess the bone age using several regions of interest information. However, both approaches are heavily dependent on individual domain knowledge and expertise, which is prone to high bias in inter and intra-observer results. Hence, an automated bone age assessment system, which is referred to as Attention-Xception Network (AXNet) is proposed to automatically predict the bone age accurately. The proposed AXNet consists of two parts, which are image normalization and bone age regression modules. The image normalization module will transform each X-ray image into a standardized form so that the regressor network can be trained using better input images. This module will first extract the hand region from the background, which is then rotated to an upright position using the angle calculated from the four key-points of interest. Then, the masked and rotated hand image will be aligned such that it will be positioned in the middle of the image. Both of the masked and rotated images will be obtained through existing state-of-the-art deep learning methods. The last module will then predict the bone age through the Attention-Xception network that incorporates multiple layers of spatialattention mechanism to emphasize the important features for more accurate bone age prediction. From the experimental results, the proposed AXNet achieves the lowest mean absolute error and mean squared error of 7.699 months and 108.869 months2, respectively. Therefore, the proposed AXNet has demonstrated its potential for practical clinical use with an error of less than one year to assist the experts or radiologists in evaluating the bone age objectively. © 2021 by the authors.

However, due to its long-term nature and heterogeneity across farms and landscapes, it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate its contribution in building the resilience of farming systems to climate change over large areas. In this study, we developed an approach to simulate and emulate the shading, micro-climate regulation and biomass effects of multi-purpose trees agroforestry system on maize yields using APSIM, taking Ethiopia as a case study. Applying the model to simulate climate change impacts showed that at national level, maize yield will increase by 7.5 and 3.1 % by 2050 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively. This projected increase in national-level maize yield is driven by maize yield increases in six administrative zones whereas yield losses are expected in other five zones (mean of −6.8% for RCP2.6 and −11.7% for RCP8.5), with yields in the other four zones remaining stable overtime. Applying the emulated agroforestry leads to increase in maize yield under current and future climatic conditions compared to maize monocultures, particularly in regions for which yield losses under climate change are expected. A 10% agroforestry shade will reduce maize yield losses by 6.9% (RCP2.6) and 4.2 % (RCP8.5) while 20% shade will reduce maize yield losses by 11.5% (RCP2.6) and 11% (RCP8.5) for projected loss zones. Overall, our results show quantitatively that agroforestry buffers yield losses for areas projected to have yield losses under climate change in Ethiopia, and therefore should be part of building climate-resilient agricultural systems.

As a rapid and nondestructive approach, the analysis of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based imagery may be of assistance to estimate N and height. The main objective of this study is to present an approach to predict leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC, g kg−1) and PH (m) with machine learning techniques and UAV-based multispectral imagery in maize plants. An experiment with 11 maize cultivars under two rates of N fertilization was carried during the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 crop seasons. The spectral vegetation indices (VI) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference red-edge index (NDRE), green normalized difference vegetation (GNDVI), and the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) were extracted from the images and, in a computational system, used alongside the spectral bands as input parameters for different machine learning models. A randomized 10-fold cross-validation strategy, with a total of 100 replicates, was used to evaluate the performance of 9 supervised machine learning (ML) models using the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of regression (R2), and root mean square error (RMSE) metrics. The results indicated that the random forest (RF) algorithm performed better, with r and RMSE, respectively, of 0.91 and 1.9 g.kg−1 for LNC, and 0.86 and 0.17 m for PH. It was also demonstrated that VIs contributed more to the algorithm’s performances than individual spectral bands. This study concludes that the RF model is appropriate to predict both agronomic variables in maize and may help farmers to monitor their plants based upon their LNC and PH diagnosis and use this knowledge to improve their production rates in the subsequent seasons. © 2020 by the authors.

In this paper, a long-term observation was conducted for the yield prediction of maize using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and estimations of chlorophyll contents using SPAD-502. A new vegetation index termed as modified red blue VI (MRBVI) was developed to monitor the growth and to predict the yields of maize by establishing relationships between MRBVIand SPAD-502-based chlorophyll contents. The coefficients of determination (R2s) were 0.462 and 0.570 in chlorophyll contents’ estimations and yield predictions using MRBVI, and the results were relatively better than the results from the seven other commonly used VI approaches. All VIs during the different growth stages of maize were calculated and compared with the measured values of chlorophyll contents directly, and the relative error (RE) of MRBVI is the lowest at 0.355. Further, machine learning (ML) methods such as the backpropagation neural network model (BP), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme learning machine (ELM) were adopted for predicting the yields of maize. All VIs calculated for each image captured during important phenological stages of maize were set as independent variables and the corresponding yields of each plot were defined as dependent variables. The ML models used the leave one out method (LOO), where the root mean square errors (RMSEs) were 2.157, 1.099, 1.146, and 1.698 (g/hundred grain weight) for BP, SVM, RF, and ELM. The mean absolute errors (MAEs) were 1.739, 0.886, 0.925, and 1.356 (g/hundred grain weight) for BP, SVM, RF, and ELM, respectively. Thus, the SVM method performed better in predicting the yields of maize than the other ML methods. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that the MRBVI calculated from images acquired at different growth stages integrated with advanced ML methods should be used for agricultural-and ecological-related chlorophyll estimation and yield predictions. © 2020 by the authors.

As opposed to waiting until the harvest season, multispectral imagery using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are capable of measuring the canopy metrics and vegetation indices (VIs) traits at different time points of the growth cycle. This resourceful time series aerial image processing with appropriate analytical framework is very important for the automatic extraction of phenotypic features from the image data. Many studies have demonstrated the usefulness of advanced remote sensing technologies coupled with machine learning (ML) approaches for accurate prediction of valuable crop traits. Until now, Cassava has received little to no attention in aerial image-based phenotyping and ML model testing. Results: To accelerate image processing, an automated image-analysis framework called CIAT Pheno-i was developed to extract plot level vegetation indices/canopy metrics. Multiple linear regression models were constructed at different key growth stages of cassava, using ground-truth data and vegetation indices obtained from a multispectral sensor. Henceforth, the spectral indices/features were combined to develop models and predict cassava root yield using different Machine learning techniques. Our results showed that (1) Developed CIAT pheno-i image analysis framework was found to be easier and more rapid than manual methods. (2) The correlation analysis of four phenological stages of cassava revealed that elongation (EL) and late bulking (LBK) were the most useful stages to estimate above-ground biomass (AGB), below-ground biomass (BGB) and canopy height (CH). (3) The multi-temporal analysis revealed that cumulative image feature information of EL + early bulky (EBK) stages showed a higher significant correlation (r = 0.77) for Green Normalized Difference Vegetation indices (GNDVI) with BGB than individual time points. Canopy height measured on the ground correlated well with UAV (CHuav)-based measurements (r = 0.92) at late bulking (LBK) stage. Among different image features, normalized difference red edge index (NDRE) data were found to be consistently highly correlated (r = 0.65 to 0.84) with AGB at LBK stage. (4) Among the four ML algorithms used in this study, k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) showed the best performance for root yield prediction with the highest accuracy of R2 = 0.67, 0.66 and 0.64, respectively. Conclusion: UAV platforms, time series image acquisition, automated image analytical framework (CIAT Pheno-i), and key vegetation indices (VIs) to estimate phenotyping traits and root yield described in this work have great potential for use as a selection tool in the modern cassava breeding programs around the world to accelerate germplasm and varietal selection. The image analysis software (CIAT Pheno-i) developed from this study can be widely applicable to any other crop to extract phenotypic information rapidly. © 2020 The Author(s).","Above-ground biomass; Automated aerial image processing; Cassava; Machine learning; Multispectral UAV imagery; Root yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

However, the key genetic components responsible for the reduction in cotton yield in saline-Alkali soils are still unclear. Results: Here, we evaluated three main components of lint yield, single boll weight (SBW), lint percentage (LP) and boll number per plant (BNPP), across 316 G. hirsutum accessions under four salt conditions over two years. Phenotypic analysis indicated that LP was unchanged under different salt conditions, however BNPP decreased significantly and SBW increased slightly under high salt conditions. Based on 57,413 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis, a total of 42, 91 and 25 stable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified for SBW, LP and BNPP, respectively. Phenotypic and QTL analysis suggested that there was little correlation among the three traits. For LP, 8 stable QTLs were detected simultaneously in four different salt conditions, while fewer repeated QTLs for SBW or BNPP were identified. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated that their regulatory mechanisms were also quite different. Via transcriptome profile data, we detected that 10 genes from the 8 stable LP QTLs were predominantly expressed during fiber development. Further, haplotype analyses found that a MYB gene (GhMYB103), with the two SNP variations in cis-regulatory and coding regions, was significantly correlated with lint percentage, implying a crucial role in lint yield. We also identified that 40 candidate genes from BNPP QTLs were salt-inducible. Genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and cell structure maintenance were rich in plants grown in high salt conditions, while genes related to ion transport were active in plants grown in low salt conditions, implying different regulatory mechanisms for BNPP at high and low salt conditions. Conclusions: This study provides a foundation for elucidating cotton salt tolerance mechanisms and contributes gene resources for developing upland cotton varieties with high yields and salt stress tolerance. © 2020 The Author(s).","Boll number per plant; Boll weight per plant; Genome-wide association study; Gossypium hirsutum; Lint percentage; Salt stress; Transcriptome analysis","analysis; anatomy and histology; chemistry; cotton; genetic variation; genetics; genome-wide association study; Gossypium; salinity; soil; Cotton Fiber; Genetic Variation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Gossypium; Salinity; Soil",Article,Scopus

Nondestructive crop growth monitoring based on remote sensing technologies can accurately assess crop N status, which may be used to guide the in-season site-specific N recommendations. The fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing is a low-cost, easy-to-operate technology for collecting spectral reflectance imagery, an important data source for precision N management. The relationships between many vegetation indices (VIs) derived from spectral reflectance data and crop parameters are known to be nonlinear. As a result, nonlinear machine learning methods have the potential to improve the estimation accuracy. The objective of this study was to evaluate five different approaches for estimating rice (Oryza sativa L.) aboveground biomass (AGB), plant N uptake (PNU), and N nutrition index (NNI) at stem elongation (SE) and heading (HD) stages in Northeast China: (1) single VI (SVI); (2) stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR); (3) random forest (RF); (4) support vector machine (SVM); and (5) artificial neural networks (ANN) regression. The results indicated that machine learning methods improved the NNI estimation compared to VI-SLR and SMLR methods. The RF algorithm performed the best for estimating NNI (R2 = 0.94 (SE) and 0.96 (HD) for calibration and 0.61 (SE) and 0.79 (HD) for validation). The root mean square errors (RMSEs) were 0.09, and the relative errors were &lt;10% in all the models. It is concluded that the RF machine learning regression can significantly improve the estimation of rice N status using UAV remote sensing. The application machine learning methods offers a new opportunity to better use remote sensing data for monitoring crop growth conditions and guiding precision crop management. More studies are needed to further improve these machine learning-based models by combining both remote sensing data and other related soil, weather, and management information for applications in precision N and crop management. © 2020 by the authors.","Fixed-wing UAV remote sensing; Machine learning; Nitrogen status diagnosis; Precision nitrogen management; Random forest","Antennas; Crops; Decision trees; Fixed wings; Food supply; Linear regression; Mean square error; Neural networks; Nitrogen; Nutrition; Random forests; Reflection; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Machine learning methods; Nitrogen management; Nitrogen status; Remote sensing technology; Root mean square errors; Stepwise multiple linear regression; Sustainable agricultural development; UAV remote sensing; Learning systems",Article,Scopus

High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) is a non-destructive and rapid approach of monitoring and measuring multiple phenotypic traits related to the growth, yield, and adaptation to biotic or abiotic stress. Researchers have conducted extensive experiments on HTP and developed techniques including spectral, fluorescence, thermal, and three-dimensional imaging to measure the morphological, physiological, and pathological resistance traits of cotton. In addition, ground-based and aerial-based platforms were also developed to aid in the implementation of these HTP systems. This review paper highlights the techniques and recent developments for HTP in cotton, reviews the potential applications according to morphological and physiological traits of cotton, and compares the advantages and limitations of these HTP systems when used in cotton cropping systems. Overall, the use of HTP has generated many opportunities to accurately and efficiently measure and analyze diverse traits of cotton.

Random forest (RF), artificial neural networks (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machines (SVM) were used to develop models. Training and validation of these models were conducted using in-situ observations from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) from 2001 to 2016. The rule of the traditional Köppen-Geiger (K-G) climate classification was used to classify climate regions. The input variables were land surface temperature (LST) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), monthly precipitation data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 product, and the Digital Elevation Map (DEM) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The overall accuracy (OA) based on validation data from 2001 to 2016 for all models was high over 95%. DEM and minimum winter temperature were two distinct variables over the study area with particularly high relative importance. ANN produced more realistic spatial distribution of the classified climates despite having a slightly lower OA than the others. The accuracy of the models using high altitudinal in-situ data of the Mountain Meteorology Observation System (MMOS) was also assessed. Although the data length of the MMOS data was relatively short (2013 to 2017), it proved that the snowy, dry and cold winter and cool summer class (Dwc) is widely located in the eastern coastal region of South Korea. Temporal shifting of climate was examined through a comparison of climate maps produced by period: from 1950 to 2000, from 1983 to 2000, and from 2001 to 2013. A shrinking trend of snow classes (D) over the Korean Peninsula was clearly observed from the ANN-based climate classification results. Shifting trends of climate with the decrease/increase of snow (D)/temperate (C) classes were clearly shown in the maps produced using the proposed approaches, consistent with the results from the reanalysis data of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC). © 2019 Park et al.

Understanding local vegetation changes is crucial for projecting ecosystem dynamics. In this paper, we make a case for Himalayan mountain areas to explore vegetation dynamics and their influencing factors. Firstly, the interannual trends of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were extracted by the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) algorithm and linear regression method. Moreover, the influence of environmental factors on interannual NDVI trends was assessed using the Random Forests algorithm and partial dependence plots. Subsequently, the time-lag effects of seasonal NDVI on different climatic factors were discussed and the effects of these factors on seasonal NDVI changes were determined by partial correlation analysis. The results show that (1) an overall weak upward trend was observed in NDVI variations from 1982 to 2015, and 1989 is considered to be the breakpoint of the NDVI time series; (2) interannual temperature trends and the shortest distance to large lakes were the most important factors in explaining interannual NDVI trends. Temperature trends were positively correlated with NDVI trends. The relationship between the shortest distance to large lakes and the NDVI trend is an inverted U-shaped; (3) the time-lags of NDVI responses to four climatic factors were shorter in Autumn than that in Summer. The NDVI responds quickly to precipitation and downward long-wave radiation; (4) downward long-wave radiation was the main climate factor that influenced NDVI changes in Autumn and the growing season because of the warming effect at night.

This function is defined as the capacity of a soil to supply nutrients and water and to produce plant biomass for human use, providing food, feed, fiber, and fuel. For farmers, the productivity function delivers an economic basis and is a prerequisite for agricultural sustainability. Our study was designed to develop an agricultural primary productivity decision support model. To obtain a highly accurate decision support model that helps farmers and advisors to assess and manage the provision of the primary productivity soil function on their agricultural fields, we addressed the following specific objectives: (i) to construct a qualitative decision support model to assess the primary productivity soil function at the agricultural field level; (ii) to carry out verification, calibration, and sensitivity analysis of this model; and (iii) to validate the model based on empirical data. The result is a hierarchical qualitative model consisting of 25 input attributes describing soil properties, environmental conditions, cropping specifications, and management practices on each respective field. An extensive dataset from France containing data from 399 sites was used to calibrate and validate the model. The large amount of data enabled data mining to support model calibration. The accuracy of the decision support model prior to calibration supported by data mining was ~40%. The data mining approach improved the accuracy to 77%. The proposed methodology of combining decision modeling and data mining proved to be an important step forward. This iterative approach yielded an accurate, reliable, and useful decision support model for the assessment of the primary productivity soil function at the field level. This can assist farmers and advisors in selecting the most appropriate crop management practices. Embedding this decision support model in a set of complementary models for four adjacent soil functions, as endeavored in the H2020 LANDMARK project, will help take the integrated sustainability of arable cropping systems to a new level. © 2019 Sandén, Trajanov, Spiegel, Kuzmanovski, Saby, Picaud, Henriksen and Debeljak.","Agricultural decision-making; Data mining; Decision support model; Expert knowledge; Soil functions; Yield",,Article,Scopus

The West African population is expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years. The responses of crops to short-term climate change is critical to the population and the decision makers tasked with food security. This leads to three questions: how will crop yields change in the near future? What influence will climate change have on crop failures? Which adaptation methods should be employed to ameliorate undesirable changes? An ensemble of near-term climate projections are used to simulate maize, millet and sorghum in West Africa in the recent historic period (1986-2005) and a near-term future when global temperatures are 1.5K above pre-industrial levels to assess the change in yield, yield variability and crop failure rate. Four crop models were used to simulate maize, millet and sorghum in West Africa in the historic and future climates. Across the majority of West Africa the maize, millet and sorghum yields are shown to fall. In the regions where yields increase, the variability also increases. This increase in variability increases the likelihood of crop failures, which are defined as yield negative anomalies beyond 1 standard deviation during the historic period. The increasing variability increases the frequency of crop failures across West Africa. The return time of crop failures falls from 8.8, 9.7 and 10.1 years to 5.2, 6.3 and 5.8 years for maize, millet and sorghum respectively. The adoption of heat-resistant cultivars and the use of captured rainwater have been investigated using one crop model as an idealized sensitivity test. The generalized doption of a cultivar resistant to high-temperature stress during flowering is shown to be more beneficial than using rainwater harvesting. © Author(s) 2018.",,"Agriculture; Climate models; Crops; Decision making; Failure analysis; Food supply; Adaptation methods; Climate projection; Global temperatures; High temperature stress; Pre-industrial levels; Rain water harvesting; Short-term climate changes; Standard deviation; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; decision making; food security; high temperature; maize; millet; sorghum; temperature effect; West Africa; Zea mays",Article,Scopus

The advances in precision agriculture over the past few years have substantially enhanced the efficiency of applying spatially variable agronomic inputs for irrigation, such as fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, and water, and we can attribute them to the increasing number of innovations that utilize new technologies that are capable of monitoring field crops for varying spatial and temporal changes. Remote sensing technology is the primary driver of success in precision agriculture, along with other technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), robotic systems, weather forecasting technology, and global positioning systems (GPSs). More specifically, multispectral imaging (MSI) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) have made the monitoring of the field crop health to aid decision making and the application of spatially and temporally variable agronomic inputs possible. Furthermore, the fusion of remotely sensed multisource data—for instance, HSI and LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data fusion—has even made it possible to monitor the changes in different parts of an individual plant. To the best of our knowledge, in most reviews on this topic, the authors focus on specific methods and/or technologies, with few or no comprehensive reviews that expose researchers, and especially students, to the vast possible range of remote sensing technologies used in agriculture.

We evaluated the efficacy of creating high-resolution, broad-scale indicators of yield from simple models that combine yield mapping data, a precision agriculture tool, with the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Landsat 5 and 7 ETM+ imagery. These models were then generalised to test its potential operationalisation across a large agricultural region (>1/2 million hectares) and the state of South Australia (>8 million hectares). Annual models were the best predictors of yield across both areas. Moderate discrimination accuracy in the regional analysis meant that models could be extrapolated with reasonable spatial precision, whereas the accuracy across the state-wide analysis was poor. Generalisation of these models to further operationalise the methodology by removing the need for crop type discrimination and the continual access to annual yield data showed some benefit.

Various global soil moisture products have been mostly retrieved from microwave remote sensing data. However, currently there is rarely spatially explicit and time-continuous soil moisture information with a high resolution at the national scale. In this study, we generated a 1km soil moisture dataset for dryland wheat and maize in China (ChinaCropSM1 km) over 1993-2018 through a random forest (RF) algorithm based on numerous in situ daily observations of soil moisture. We independently used in situ observations (181327 samples) from the agricultural meteorological stations (AMSs) across China for training (164202 samples) and others for testing (17125 samples). An irrigation module was first developed according to crop type (i.e., wheat, maize), soil depth (0-10, 10-20cm) and phenology. We produced four daily datasets separately by crop type and soil depth, and their accuracies were all satisfactory (wheat r 0.93, ubRMSE 0.033m3m-3; maize r 0.93, ubRMSE 0.035m3m-3). The spatiotemporal resolutions and accuracy of ChinaCropSM1 km were significantly better than those of global soil moisture products (e.g., r increased by 116%, ubRMSE decreased by 64%), including the global remote-sensing-based surface soil moisture dataset (RSSSM) and the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) SM.

Methods: This study developed a new method for differentiating maize from other summer crops based on the revised time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) method, a phenology-based classification method, by combining the phenological information of multiple spectral bands and indexes instead of one single index. First, we compared the phenological characteristics of four main summer crops in Henan Province of China in terms of multiple spectral bands and indexes. The key phenological periods of each band and index were determined by comparing the identification accuracy based on the county-level statistical areas of maize. Second, we improved the TWDTW distance calculation for multiple bands and indexes by summing the rank maps of a single band or index. Third, we evaluated the performance of a multi-band and multi-period TWDTW method using Sentinel-2 time series of all spectral bands and some synthetic indexes for maize classification in Henan Province. Results and Discussion: The results showed that the combination of red edge (740.2 nm) and short-wave infrared (2202.4 nm) outperformed all others and its overall accuracy of maize planting area was about 91.77% based on 2431 field samples. At the county level, the planting area of maize matched the statistical area closely. The results of this study demonstrate that the revised TWDTW makes effective use of crop phenological information and improves the extraction accuracy of summer crops’ planting areas over a large scale. Additionally, multiple band combinations are more effective for summer crops mapping than a single band or index input.

However, there are limited modeling applications that study this relationship at regional scales mainly due to data availability and computational cost. This study proposes a methodological framework using the SWAT+ model to predict and project sediment yield at a regional scale in data-scarce regions using global datasets. We implement a framework that (a) incorporates topographic factors from high/medium resolution DEMs (b) incorporates crop phenology data (c) introduces an areal threshold to linearize sediment yield in large model units and (d) apply a hydrological mass balance calibration. We test this methodology in the Nile Basin using a model application with (revised) and without (default) the framework under historical and future climate projections. New hydrological insights for the region: Results show improved sediment yield estimates in the revised model, both in absolute values and spatial distribution when compared to measured and reported estimates. The contemporary long term (1989 – 2019) annual mean sediment yield in the revised model was 1.79 t ha−1 yr−1 and projected to increase by 61 % (44 % more than the default estimates) in the future period (2071 – 2100), with the greatest sediment yield increase in the eastern part of the basin.

To this end, the study employed a quantitative research methodology and obtained data from 345 farmers from the northern districts of Bangladesh. Using a cross-sectional survey design and convenience sampling method, a study of premium fruit growers was undertaken to assess IoT use in agriculture, and the primary survey data were analyzed using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach via AMOS 26. The study confirmed that effort expectancy, performance expectancy, facilitating condition, hedonic motivation, government support, price value, personal innovativeness, and trust influence the willingness of Bangladeshi farmers to adopt the IoT. Additionally, predictors such as trust and willingness to adopt were observed to influence the willingness to pay for the IoT, while the construct ‘performance expectancy’ produced no effect. The study also revealed that the willingness to adopt moderates the association between performance expectancy, price value, and willingness to pay for the IoT. This research has novel implications because it investigates the behavior of rural customers with respect to innovation adoption, which in this case is the IoT in agriculture. It outlines precise reasons for the willing adoption of the IoT in agriculture, which will, in turn, assist marketers of IoT technology in the design of appropriate marketing strategies to increase acceptance in rural areas.

This research integrated two important open-sourced systems (R and Python) combined with automated hyperspectral narrowband vegetation index calculation and the state-of-the-art AI-based automated machine learning (AutoML) technology to estimate yield and biomass, based on three crop categories (spring wheat, pea and oat mixture, and spring barley with red clover) with multifunctional cultivation practices in northern Europe and Estonia. Our study showed the estimated capacity of the empirical AutoML regression model was significant. The best coefficient of determination (R2) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) for single variety planting wheat were 0.96 and 0.12 respectively; for mixed peas and oats, they were 0.76 and 0.18 in the booting to heading stage, while for mixed legumes and spring barley, they were 0.88 and 0.16 in the reproductive growth stages. In terms of straw mass estimation, R2 was 0.96, 0.83, and 0.86, and NRMSE was 0.12, 0.24, and 0.33 respectively. This research contributes to, and confirms, the use of the AutoML framework in hyperspectral image analysis to increase implementation flexibility and reduce learning costs under a variety of agricultural resource conditions.

The advantages of image-based phenotyping are related to the high spatial and temporal resolution of the retrieved data and the non-destructive and rapid method of data acquisition. This study trains parametric and nonparametric regression models to retrieve leaf area index (LAI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), fractional vegetation cover (fCover), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), canopy chlorophyll content (CCC), and grain yield (GY) of winter durum wheat breeding experiment from four-bands UAV images. A ground dataset, collected during two field campaigns and complemented with data from a previous study, is used for model development. The dataset is split at random into two parts, one for training and one for testing the models. The tested parametric models use the vegetation index formula and parametric functions. The tested nonparametric models are partial least square regression (PLSR), random forest regression (RFR), support vector regression (SVR), kernel ridge regression (KRR), and Gaussian processes regression (GPR). The retrieved biophysical variables along with traditional phenotypic traits (plant height, yield, and tillering) are analysed for detection of genetic diversity, proximity, and similarity in the studied genotypes. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), Duncan’s multiple range test, correlation analysis, and principal component analysis (PCA) are performed with the phenotypic traits. The parametric and nonparametric models show close results for GY retrieval, with parametric models indicating slightly higher accuracy (R2 = 0.49; MRSE = 0.58kg/plot; rRMSE = 6.1%). However, the nonparametric model, GPR, computes per pixel uncertainty estimation, making it more appealing for operational use. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that grain filling was better than flowering phenological stage to predict GY. The nonparametric models show better results for biophysical variables retrieval, with GPR presenting the highest prediction performance. Nonetheless, robust models are found only for LAI (R2 = 0.48; MRSE = 0.64; rRMSE = 13.5%) and LCC (R2 = 0.49; MRSE = 31.57 mg m−2; rRMSE = 6.4%) and therefore these are the only remotely sensed phenotypic traits included in the statistical analysis for preliminary assessment of wheat productivity. The results from ANOVA and PCA illustrate that the retrieved remotely sensed phenotypic traits are a valuable addition to the traditional phenotypic traits for plant breeding studies. We believe that these preliminary results could speed up crop improvement programs; however, stronger interdisciplinary research is still needed, as well as uncertainty estimation of the remotely sensed phenotypic traits. © 2022 by the authors.

Yet, the water balance of cultivated areas is strongly influenced by applied management practices (e.g. planting, irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting). The SWAT+ (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model represents agricultural land by default in a generic way, where the start of the cropping season is driven by accumulated heat units. However, this approach does not work for tropical and subtropical regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, where crop growth dynamics are mainly controlled by rainfall rather than temperature. In this study, we present an approach on how to incorporate crop phenology using decision tables and global datasets of rainfed and irrigated croplands with the associated cropping calendar and fertilizer applications in a regional SWAT+ model for northeastern Africa. We evaluate the influence of the crop phenology representation on simulations of leaf area index (LAI) and evapotranspiration (ET) using LAI remote sensing data from Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) and WaPOR (Water Productivity through Open access of Remotely sensed derived data) ET data, respectively. Results show that a representation of crop phenology using global datasets leads to improved temporal patterns of LAI and ET simulations, especially for regions with a single cropping cycle. However, for regions with multiple cropping seasons, global phenology datasets need to be complemented with local data or remote sensing data to capture additional cropping seasons. In addition, the improvement of the cropping season also helps to improve soil erosion estimates, as the timing of crop cover controls erosion rates in the model. With more realistic growing seasons, soil erosion is largely reduced for most agricultural hydrologic response units (HRUs), which can be considered as a move towards substantial improvements over previous estimates. We conclude that regional and global hydrological models can benefit from improved representations of crop phenology and the associated management practices. Future work regarding the incorporation of multiple cropping seasons in global phenology data is needed to better represent cropping cycles in areas where they occur using regional to global hydrological models. © Copyright:",,"Biology; Cultivation; Decision tables; Erosion; Hydrology; Land use; Remote sensing; Soils; Tropics; Agricultural land use; Crop phenology; Cropping seasons; Global datasets; Leaf Area Index; Management practises; Remote sensing data; Soil and Water assessment tools; Soil erosion; Tool models; Crops; agricultural land; agricultural management; hydrological change; land use; soil and water assessment tool",Article,Scopus

Nineteen articles were selected from a search outcome of 530. About 74% of the studies used mechanistic models, which are favored for climate risk management research as they account for crop management practices. European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, Hamburg, are the predominant global climate models (GCMs) used across Africa. A range of approaches have been assessed to improve the effectiveness of the connection between seasonal forecast information and mechanistic crop models, which include GCMs, analogue, stochastic disaggregation, and statistical prediction through converting seasonal weather summaries into the daily weather. GCM outputs are produced in a format compatible with mechanistic crop models. Such outputs are critical for researchers to have information on the merits and demerits of tools and approaches on integrating seasonal forecast and crop models.

However, a current knowledge gap lies in the integration of AutoML technology and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) within image-based data classification tasks. Therefore, we employed a state-of-the-art (SOTA) and completely open-source AutoML framework, Auto-sklearn, which was constructed based on one of the most widely used ML systems: Scikit-learn. It was combined with two novel AutoML visualization tools to focus particularly on the recognition and adoption of UAS-derived multispectral vegetation indices (VI) data across a diverse range of agricultural management practices (AMP). These include soil tillage methods (STM), cultivation methods (CM), and manure application (MA), and are under the four-crop combination fields (i.e., red clover-grass mixture, spring wheat, pea-oat mixture, and spring barley). Furthermore, they have currently not been efficiently examined and accessible parameters in UAS applications are absent for them. We conducted the comparison of AutoML performance using three other common machine learning classifiers, namely Random Forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). The results showed AutoML achieved the highest overall classification accuracy numbers after 1200 s of calculation. RF yielded the second-best classification accuracy, and SVM and ANN were revealed to be less capable among some of the given datasets. Regarding the classification of AMPs, the best recognized period for data capture occurred in the crop vegetative growth stage (in May). The results demonstrated that CM yielded the best performance in terms of classification, followed by MA and STM. Our framework presents new insights into plant–environment interactions with capable classification capabilities. It further illustrated the automatic system would become an important tool in furthering the understanding for future sustainable smart farming and field-based crop phenotyping research across a diverse range of agricultural environmental assessment and management applications. © 2021 by the authors.

Over-fertilization can have negative influences on the field and the regional level (e.g., agro-ecosys-tems). Remote sensing of the plant N of field crops presents a valuable tool for the monitoring of N flows in agro-ecosystems. Available data for validation of satellite-based remote sensing of N is scarce. Therefore, in this study, field spectrometer measurements were used to simulate data of the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites developed for vegetation monitoring by the ESA. The prediction performance of normalized ratio indices (NRIs), random forest regression (RFR) and Gaussian processes regression (GPR) for plant-N-related traits was assessed on a diverse real-world dataset including multiple crops, field sites and years. The plant N traits included the mass-based N measure, N concentration in the biomass (Nconc), and an area-based N measure approximating the plant N uptake (NUP). Spectral indices such as normalized ratio indices (NRIs) performed well, but the RFR and GPR methods outperformed the NRIs. Key spectral bands for each trait were identified using the RFR variable importance measure and the Gaussian processes regression band analysis tool (GPR-BAT), highlighting the importance of the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region for estimation of plant Nconc—and to a lesser extent the NUP. The red edge (RE) region was also important. The GPR-BAT showed that five bands were sufficient for plant N trait and leaf area index (LAI) estimation and that a surplus of bands effectively reduced prediction performance. A global sensitivity analysis (GSA) was performed on all traits simultaneously, showing the dominance of the LAI in the mixed remote sensing signal. To delineate the plant-N-related traits from this signal, regional and/or national data collection campaigns producing large crop spectral libraries (CSL) are needed. An improved database will likely enable the mapping of N at the agro-ecosystem level or for use in precision farming by farmers in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

Agriculture is strongly affected by climate change due to increasing temperatures, water shortage, heavy rainfall and variations in the frequency and intensity of excessive climatic events such as floods and droughts. Farmers need to adapt to climate change by developing advanced and sophisticated farming systems instead of simply farming at lower intensity and occupying more land. Integrated agricultural systems constitute a promising solution, as they can lower reliance on external inputs, enhance nutrient cycling and increase natural resource use efficiency. In this context, the concept of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) emerged as a promising solution to secure the resources for the growing world population under climate change conditions. This work proposes a CSA architecture for fostering and supporting integrated agricultural systems, such as Mixed Farming Systems (MFS), by facilitating the design, the deployment and the management of crop–livestock-=forestry combinations towards sustainable, efficient and climate resilient agricultural systems. Propelled by cutting-edge technology solutions in data collection and processing, along with fully autonomous monitoring systems, e.g., smart sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the proposed architecture called MiFarm-CSA, aims to foster core interactions among animals, forests and crops, while mitigating the high complexity of these interactions, through a novel conceptual framework. © 2021 by the authors.","climate smart agriculture; internet of things; mixed farming systems; participatory learning; socio-economic modelling; unmanned aerial vehicles",,Article,Scopus

Remote sensing is a viable tool to estimate the plant’s nutritional status to determine the appropriate amounts of fertilizer inputs. The aim of the study was to use remote sensing to characterize the foliar nutrient status of mango through the development of spectral indices, multivariate analysis, chemometrics, and machine learning modeling of the spectral data. A spectral database within the 350–1050 nm wavelength range of the leaf samples and leaf nutrients were analyzed for the development of spectral indices and multivariate model development. The normalized difference and ratio spectral indices and multivariate models–partial least square regression (PLSR), principal component regression, and support vector regression (SVR) were ineffective in predicting any of the leaf nutrients. An approach of using PLSR‐combined machine learning models was found to be the best to predict most of the nutrients. Based on the independent validation performance and summed ranks, the best performing models were cubist (R2 ≥ 0.91, the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) ≥ 3.3, and the ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) ≥ 3.71) for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and zinc, SVR (R2 ≥ 0.88, RPD ≥ 2.73, RPIQ ≥ 3.31) for calcium, iron, copper, boron, and elastic net (R2 ≥ 0.95, RPD ≥ 4.47, RPIQ ≥ 6.11) for magnesium and sulfur.

Screening for end-use quality traits is usually secondary to grain yield due to high labor needs, cost of testing, and large seed requirements for phenotyping. Genomic selection provides an alternative to predict performance using genome-wide markers under forward and acros location predictions, where a previous year’s dataset can be used to build the models. Due to large datasets in breeding programs, we explored the potential of the machine and deep learning models to predict fourteen end-use quality traits in a winter wheat breeding program. The population used consisted of 666 wheat genotypes screened for five years (2015-19) at two locations (Pullman and Lind, WA, USA). Nine different models, including two machine learning (random forest and support vector machine) and two deep learning models (convolutional neural network and multilayer perceptron) were explored for cross-validation, forward, and across locations predictions. The prediction accuracies for different traits varied from 0.45-0.81, 0.29-0.55, and 0.27-0.50 under cross-validation, forward, and across location predictions. In general, forward prediction accuracies kept increasing over time due to increments in training data size and was more evident for machine and deep learning models. Deep learning models were superior over the traditional ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction (RRBLUP) and Bayesian models under all prediction scenarios. The high accuracy observed for end-use quality traits in this study support predicting them in early generations, leading to the advancement of superior genotypes to more extensive grain yield trails. Furthermore, the superior performance of machine and deep learning models strengthens the idea to include them in large scale breeding programs for predicting complex traits. © 2021 by the authors.

In the study, a hybrid inversion method, which combined a physical model with a statistical method, was proposed to estimate the crop LAI. The simulated compact high-resolution imaging spectrometer (CHRIS) canopy spectral crop reflectance datasets were generated using the PROSAIL model (the coupling of PROSPECT leaf optical properties model and Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves model) and the CHRIS band response function. Partial least squares (PLS) was then used to reduce the dimension of the simulated spectral data. Using the principal components (PCs) of PLS as the model inputs, the hybrid inversion models were built using various modeling algorithms, including the backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR), and random forest regression (RFR). Finally, remote sensing mapping of the CHRIS data was achieved with the hybrid model to test the inversion accuracy of LAI estimates. The validation result yielded an accuracy of R2 = 0.939 and normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) = 6.474% for the PLS_RFR model, which indicated that the crops LAI could be estimated accurately by using spectral feature extraction and a hybrid inversion strategy. The results showed that the model based on principal components extracted by PLS had a good estimation accuracy and noise immunity and was the preferred method for LAI estimation. Furthermore, the comparative analysis results of various datasets showed that prior knowledge could improve the precision of the retrieved LAI, and using this information to constrain parameters (e.g., chlorophyll content or LAI), which make important contributions to the spectra, is the key to this improvement. In addition, among the PLS, BP-ANN, LS-SVR, and RFR methods, RFR was the optimal modeling algorithm in the paper, as indicated by the high R2 and low NRMSE in various datasets. © 2020 by the authors.

In the past, empirical algorithms have been widely employed to retrieve information on this biochemical plant component from canopy reflectance. However, these approaches do not seek for a cause-effect relationship based on physical laws. Moreover, most studies solely relied on the correlation of chlorophyll content with nitrogen, and thus neglected the fact that most N is bound in proteins. Our study presents a hybrid retrieval method using a physically-based approach combined with machine learning regression to estimate crop N content. Within the workflow, the leaf optical properties model PROSPECT-PRO including the newly calibrated specific absorption coefficients (SAC) of proteins, was coupled with the canopy reflectance model 4SAIL to PROSAIL-PRO. The latter was then employed to generate a training database to be used for advanced probabilistic machine learning methods: a standard homoscedastic Gaussian process (GP) and a heteroscedastic GP regression that accounts for signal-to-noise relations. Both GP models have the property of providing confidence intervals for the estimates, which sets them apart from other machine learners. Moreover, a GP-based sequential backward band removal algorithm was employed to analyze the band-specific information content of PROSAIL-PRO simulated spectra for the estimation of aboveground N. Data from multiple hyperspectral field campaigns, carried out in the framework of the future satellite mission Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP), were exploited for validation. In these campaigns, corn and winter wheat spectra were acquired to simulate spectral EnMAP data. Moreover, destructive N measurements from leaves, stalks and fruits were collected separately to enable plant-organ-specific validation. The results showed that both GP models can provide accurate aboveground N simulations, with slightly better results of the heteroscedastic GP in terms of model testing and against in situ N measurements from leaves plus stalks, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.1 g/m². However, the inclusion of fruit N content for validation deteriorated the results, which can be explained by the inability of the radiation to penetrate the thick tissues of stalks, corn cobs and wheat ears. GP-based band analysis identified optimal spectral settings with ten bands mainly situated in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral region.

Here, we added a sediment diagenesis and sediment carbon (C) resuspension module into the SWAT-C model and tested it for simulating both particulate organic C (POC) and dissolved organic C (DOC) fluxes using 4 years of monthly observations (2014-2017) in the Tuckahoe watershed (TW) in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region. Results: Sensitivity analyses show that parameters that regulate POC deposition in river networks are more sensitive than those that determine C resuspension from sediments. Further analyses indicate that allochthonous contributions to POC and DOC are about 36.6 and 46 kgC ha-1 year-1, respectively, while autochthonous contributions are less than 0.72 kgC ha-1 year-1 for both POC and DOC (less than 2% of allochthonous sources). The net deposition of POC on the riverbed (i.e., 11.4 kgC ha-1 year-1) retained ca. 31% of terrestrial inputs of POC. In addition, average annual buried C was 0.34 kgC ha-1 year-1, accounting for only 1% of terrestrial POC inputs or 3% of net POC deposition. The results indicate that about 79% of deposited organic C was converted to inorganic C (CH4 and CO2) in the sediment and eventually released into the overlying water column. Conclusion: This study serves as an exploratory study on estimation of C fluxes from terrestrial to aquatic environments at the watershed scale. We demonstrated capabilities of the SWAT-C model to simulate C cycling from uplands to riverine ecosystems and estimated C sinks and sources in aquatic environments. Overall, the results highlight the importance of including carbon cycle dynamics within the riverbed in order to accurately estimate aquatic carbon fluxes and stocks. The new capabilities of SWAT-C are expected to serve as a useful tool to account for those processes in watershed C balance assessment. © 2020 The Author(s).","DOC; POC; Resuspension; Sediment diagenesis","aquatic environment; carbon cycle; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; diagenesis; dissolved organic carbon; particulate organic carbon; resuspension; river bed; terrestrial environment; watershed; Maryland; Mid-Atlantic States; Tuckahoe River; United States; Peltandra virginica",Article,Scopus

Smart farming technologies (SFTs) are expected to assist in reverting this situation. In this work, 1064 SFTs were derived from scientific papers, research projects, and industrial products. They were classified by technology readiness level (TRL), typology, and field operation, and they were assessed for their economic, environmental, and labor impact, as well as their adoption readiness from end‐users. It was shown that scientific articles dealt with SFTs of lower TRL than research projects. In scientific articles, researchers investigated mostly recording technologies, while, in research projects, they focused primarily on farm management information systems and robotic/automation systems. Scouting technologies were the main SFT type in scientific papers and research projects, but variable rate application technologies were mostly located in commercial products. In scientific papers, there was limited analysis of economic, environmental, and labor impact of the SFTs under investigation, while, in research projects, these impacts were studied thoroughly. Further, in commercial SFTs, the focus was on economic impact and less on labor and environmental issues. With respect to adoption readiness, it was found that all of the factors to facilitate SFT adoption became more positive moving from SFTs in scientific papers to fully functional commercial SFTs, indicating that SFTs reach the market when most of these factors are addressed for the benefit of the farmers. This SFT analysis is expected to inform researchers on adapting their research, as well as help policy‐makers adjust their strategy toward digitized agriculture adoption and farmers with the current situation and future trends of SFTs. © 2020 by the authors.

A popular implementation involves the deployment of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), which embed low energy consumption sensory nodes to capture the critical environmental parameters prevailing on the farms. However, to manage the ever-increasing volumes of raw data successfully, new approaches must be explored. Under this scope, current work reports on the design and development of an IoT system, having in mind the case of olive groves, which are considered the dominant sector for agricultural activity in the Mediterranean Basin. The system incorporates the cloud/fog computing paradigm to equip the olive growers with a low-cost solution for accurate, reliable, and almost real-time monitoring of their crops. Its core is based on a three-layered network architecture, capable of dynamically balancing the generated load, by pushing cloud-elastic resources to the underlying fog network. As such, the premise of the approach lies in the conforming character of the system that allows for targeted alterations to its operational functionality to meet stringent latency and traffic load environmental monitoring constraints. To evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture, a demo prototype is developed and deployed in the facilities of the Ionian University. Experimental results illustrate the efficiency, flexibility, and scalability of the approach in terms of latency, achieving response time reduction across all platforms, a subject of the utmost importance when it comes to precision agriculture of the future. Moreover, it is shown that the system is capable of dynamic functionality adaptation, to meet network traffic load constraints, achieving high throughput (on average 95%) and addressing potential environmental dangers to olive oil production. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the genetic basis of many domesticated characteristics remains to be explored. Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is the most important tetraploid cotton species, accounting for about 90% of world cotton commerce. Here, we reveal the effects of domestication on fiber and stress traits through comprehensive analyses of semi-domesticated races and cultivated cotton accessions. A total of 416 cotton accessions were genotyped, and a decrease in genetic diversity from races to landraces and modern cultivars was detected. Furthermore, 71 domestication selective sweeps (DSS) and 14 improvement selective sweeps (ISS) were identified, with the Dt sub-genome experiencing stronger selection than the At sub-genome during the both selection types. The more expressed genes and a delay in the expression peak of genes related to secondary cell wall (SCW) development in modern cultivars compared to semi-domesticated cotton races, may have contributed to long fibers in these plants. However, down-regulation of genes related to stress response was responsible for decreasing stress tolerance in modern cultivars. We further experimentally confirmed that silencing of PR1 and WRKY20, genes that showed higher expression in the semi-domesticated races, drastically compromised cotton resistance to V. dahliae. Our results reveal fiber improvement and decreased stress tolerance as a result of the domestication of modern upland cotton cultivars. © Copyright © 2019 Zhu, Li, Wang, Li, Si, Cai and Guo.","artificial selection; domestication; expression profile; fiber development; single nucleotide polymorphism array; stress tolerance; upland cotton",,Article,Scopus

Hence, deeply understanding and monitoring crop growth for an optimized N management is advisable. In this context, remote sensing facilitates the capturing of crop traits. While several studies on estimating biomass from spectral and structural data can be found, N is so far only estimated from spectral features. It is well known that N is negatively related to dry biomass, which, in turn, can be estimated from crop height. Based on this indirect link, the present study aims at estimating N concentration at field scale in a two-step model: first, using crop height to estimate biomass, and second, using the modeled biomass to estimate N concentration. For comparison, N concentration was estimated from spectral data. The data was captured on a spring barley field experiment in two growing seasons. Crop surface height was measured with a terrestrial laser scanner, seven vegetation indices were calculated from field spectrometer measurements, and dry biomass and N concentration were destructively sampled. In the validation, better results were obtained with the models based on structural data (R2 &lt; 0.85) than on spectral data (R2 &lt; 0.70). A brief look at the N concentration of different plant organs showed stronger dependencies on structural data (R2: 0.40-0.81) than on spectral data (R2: 0.18-0.68). Overall, this first study shows the potential of crop-specific across-season two-step models based on structural data for estimating crop N concentration at field scale. The validity of the models for in-season estimations requires further research. © 2019 by the authors.","Biomass; Nitrogen concentration; Plant height; Precision agriculture; Spectrometer; Terrestrial laser scanning; Vegetation indices","Biomass; Ecology; Laser applications; Nitrogen; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Spectrometers; Vegetation; Field experiment; Field spectrometer measurements; Nitrogen concentrations; Plant height; Spectral vegetation indices; Terrestrial laser scanners; Terrestrial laser scanning; Vegetation index; Crops",Article,Scopus

Under this scenario, the question that arises is how to address the demand for agricultural products given that the pressures on land use have already increased. In addition, it is obvious that climate change will have a serious negative impact and threaten the productivity and sustainability of food production systems. Therefore, understanding and predicting the outcome of crop production, while considering adaptation and sustainability, is essential. The need for information on decision making at all levels, from crop management to adaptation strategies, is constantly increasing and methods for providing such information are urgently needed in a relatively short period of time. Thus arises the need to use effective data, such as satellite and meteorological data, but also operational tools, to assess crop yields over local, regional, national, and global scales. In this work, three modeling approaches built on a fusion of satellite-derived vegetation indices, agro-meteorological indicators, and crop phenology are tested and evaluated in terms of data intensiveness for the prediction of wheat yields in large scale applications. The obtained results indicated that medium input data intensity methods are effective tools for yield assessments. The methods, namely, a semi-empirical regression model, a machine learning regression model, and a process-based model, provided high to moderate accuracies by fully relying on freely available datasets as sources of input data. The findings are comparable with those reported in the literature for detailed field experiments, thereby introducing a promising framework that can support operational platforms for dynamic yield forecasting, operating at the administrative or regional unit scale. © 2022 by the authors.","AquaCrop; data fusion; machine learning; publicly available datasets; yield prediction",,Article,Scopus

Wheat quality is primarily determined by the grain protein content (GPC) and composition, and both of these are affected by nitrogen (N) levels in the plant as it develops during the growing season. Hyperspectral remote sensing is gradually becoming recognized as an economical alternative to traditional destructive field sampling methods and laboratory testing as a means of determining the N status within wheat. Currently, hyperspectral vegetation indices (VIs) and linear nonparametric regression are the primary tools for monitoring the N status of wheat. Machine learning algorithms have been increasingly applied to model the nonlinear relationship between spectral data and wheat N status. This study is a comprehensive review of available N-related hyperspectral VIs and aims to inform the selection of VIs under field conditions. The combination of feature mining and machine learning algorithms is discussed as an application of hyperspectral imaging systems. We discuss the major challenges and future directions for evaluating and assessing wheat N status. Finally, we suggest that the underlying mechanism of protein formation in wheat grains as determined by using hyperspectral imaging systems needs to be further investigated.

This study is to develop a method for crop type mapping using Sentinel-2 10 m bands (i.e., red, green, blue, and near-infrared) and to examine the benefit of the derived 10 m crop type map. The crop type mapping was conducted for two study areas with significantly different field sizes and crop types in South Dakota and California, respectively. The Sentinel-2 10 m surface reflectance and the derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) acquired in the 2019 growing season were used to generate monthly median composites as classification input. The training and evaluation samples were derived from CDL by (i) finding good quality 30 m CDL pixels and (ii) identifying a single representative Sentinel-2 10 m pixel time series for each 30 m good quality CDL pixel. The random forest algorithm was trained using 80% of the samples and evaluated using the 20% remaining samples, and the results showed high overall accuracies of 94% and 83% for South Dakota and California study areas, respectively.

This research aims to present the application of both conventional and modern prediction methods in precision fertilization by integrating agronomic components with the spatial component of interpolation and machine learning. While conventional methods were a cornerstone of soil prediction in the past decades, new challenges to process larger and more complex data have reduced their viability in the present. Their disadvantages of lower prediction accuracy, lack of robustness regarding the properties of input soil sample values and requirements for extensive cost-and time-expensive soil sampling were addressed. Specific conventional (ordinary kriging, inverse distance weighted) and modern machine learning methods (random forest, support vector machine, artificial neural networks, decision trees) were evaluated according to their popularity in relevant studies indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection over the past decade. As a shift towards increased prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, an overview of state-of-the-art remote sensing methods for improving precise fertilization was completed, with the accent on open-data and global satellite missions. State-of-the-art remote sensing techniques allowed hybrid interpolation to predict the sampled data supported by remote sensing data such as high-resolution multispectral, thermal and radar satellite or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based imagery in the analyzed studies. The representative overview of conventional and modern approaches to precision fertilization was performed based on 121 samples with phosphorous pentoxide (P2 O5 ) and potassium oxide (K2 O) in a common agricultural parcel in Croatia. It visually and quantitatively confirmed the superior prediction accuracy and retained local heterogeneity of the modern approach.

Using growth-stage information to estimate winter wheat yields in a timely manner is essential for accurate crop management and rapid decision-making in sustainable agriculture, and to increase productivity while reducing environmental impact. UAV remote sensing is widely used in precision agriculture due to its flex-ibility and increased spatial and spectral resolution. Hyperspectral data are used to model crop traits because of their ability to provide continuous rich spectral information and higher spectral fidelity. In this study, hyperspectral image data of the winter wheat crop canopy at the flowering and grain-filling stages was acquired by a low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and machine learning was used to predict winter wheat yields. Specifically, a large number of spectral indices were extracted from the spectral data, and three feature selection methods, recursive feature elimination (RFE), Boruta feature selection, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), were used to filter high spectral indices in order to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Four major basic learner models, (1) support vector machine (SVM), (2) Gaussian process (GP), (3) linear ridge regression (LRR), and (4) random forest (RF), were also constructed, and an ensemble machine learning model was developed by combining the four base learner models. The results showed that the SVM yield prediction model, constructed on the basis of the preferred features, performed the best among the base learner models, with an R2 between 0.62 and 0.73. The accuracy of the proposed ensemble learner model was higher than that of each base learner model; moreover, the R2 (0.78) for the yield prediction model based on Boruta’s preferred characteristics was the highest at the grain-filling stage. © 2022 by the authors.

Whilst extreme weather conditions may cause extreme impacts, crop failure commonly is induced by the occurrence of multiple and combined anomalous meteorological drivers. For these cases, the explanation of conditions leading to crop failure is complex, as the links connecting weather and crop yield can be multiple and non-linear. Furthermore, climate change is likely to perturb the meteorological conditions, possibly altering the occurrences of crop failures or leading to unprecedented drivers of extreme impacts. The goal of this study is to identify important meteorological drivers that cause crop failures and to explore changes in crop failures due to global warming. For that, we focus on a historical failure event, the extreme low soybean production during the 2012 season in the midwestern US. We first train a random forest model to identify the most relevant meteorological drivers of historical crop failures and to predict crop failure probabilities. Second, we explore the influence of global warming on crop failures and on the structure of compound drivers. We use large ensembles from the EC-Earth global climate model, corresponding to present-day, pre-industrial +2 and 3° C warming, respectively, to isolate the global warming component. Finally, we explore the meteorological conditions inductive for the 2012 crop failure and construct analogues of these failure conditions in future climate settings. We find that crop failures in the midwestern US are linked to low precipitation levels, and high temperature and diurnal temperature range (DTR) levels during July and August. Results suggest soybean failures are likely to increase with climate change. With more frequent warm years due to global warming, the joint hot-dry conditions leading to crop failures become mostly dependent on precipitation levels, reducing the importance of the relative compound contribution. While event analogues of the 2012 season are rare and not expected to increase, impact analogues show a significant increase in occurrence frequency under global warming, but for different combinations of the meteorological drivers than experienced in 2012. This has implications for assessment of the drivers of extreme impact events. © Copyright:",,"Climate models; Crops; Decision trees; Earth (planet); Condition; Crop failures; Crop yield; Extreme weather conditions; Failure events; Meteorological condition; Non linear; Precipitation level; Soybean production; Storylines; Global warming; climate change; climate effect; crop production; extreme event; forest dynamics; global warming; United States",Article,Scopus

In this study, the conceptual requirements from the agricultural and computer science perspectives were determined as a basis for developing a consistent, scientifically sound, and user-friendly FNMS, especially applicable in European countries. This FNMS enables farmers and their advisors to make knowledge-based decisions based on comprehensive and integrated data. © 2021 by the authors.","Data fusion; Decision support system; Digital agriculture; Farm management system; Nitrogen balance; Nutrient management; Software architecture",,Article,Scopus

In recent years, deep learning (DL) methods have been considered in the context of genomic prediction. The DL methods are nonparametric models providing flexibility to adapt to complicated associations between data and output with the ability to adapt to very complex patterns. Main body: We review the applications of deep learning (DL) methods in genomic selection (GS) to obtain a meta-picture of GS performance and highlight how these tools can help solve challenging plant breeding problems. We also provide general guidance for the effective use of DL methods including the fundamentals of DL and the requirements for its appropriate use. We discuss the pros and cons of this technique compared to traditional genomic prediction approaches as well as the current trends in DL applications. Conclusions: The main requirement for using DL is the quality and sufficiently large training data. Although, based on current literature GS in plant and animal breeding we did not find clear superiority of DL in terms of prediction power compared to conventional genome based prediction models. Nevertheless, there are clear evidences that DL algorithms capture nonlinear patterns more efficiently than conventional genome based. Deep learning algorithms are able to integrate data from different sources as is usually needed in GS assisted breeding and it shows the ability for improving prediction accuracy for large plant breeding data. It is important to apply DL to large training-testing data sets. © 2021, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Genomic selection; Genomic trends; Plant breeding","algorithm; deep learning; plant breeding; prediction; review; animal; Bayes theorem; biological model; genetic selection; genome; genomics; phenotype; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Deep Learning; Genome; Genomics; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Selection, Genetic",Review,Scopus

This study used a satellite-based vegetation production model (i.e., eddy covariance light use efficiency, EC-LUE) to estimate national winter wheat gross primary production, and then combined this model with the harvest index (ratio of aboveground biomass to yield) to convert the estimated winter wheat production to yield. Specifically, considering the spatial differences of the harvest index, we used a cross-validation method to invert the harvest index of winter wheat among counties, municipalities and provinces. Using the field-surveyed and statistical yield data, we evaluated the model performance, and found the model could explain more than 50% of the spatial variations of the yield both in field-surveyed regions and most administrative units. Overall, the mean absolute percentage errors of the yield are less than 20% in most counties, municipalities and provinces, and the mean absolute percentage errors for the production of winter wheat at the national scale is 4.06%. This study demonstrates that a satellite-based model is an alternative method for crop yield estimation on a larger scale. © 2021 by the authors.

Both are related to surface soil moisture (SSM), which is susceptible to drought, and phenology plays an important role in these vegetation-moisture relationships. Based on a variety of gridded SIF, NDVI, and SSM datasets obtained from satellite sensors, we presented the detailed relationships of SSM with SIF and NDVI in different phenological stages. Results showed that SIF and NDVI were significantly correlated with SSM in different phenological stages, especially during the maturity and senescence stages. For different vegetation types, SIF was more sensitive than NDVI to SSM anomalies in grasslands and forests during the maturity stage and rainfed croplands during the senescence stage. These relationships were regulated by precipitation and mean temperature, and decreased precipitation had the most significant impact when accompanied by increased temperature during the maturity stage or decreased temperature during the senescence stage.

For this, the following methods of Machine Learning (ML) were implemented: (i) Deep Learning (DL) and (ii) Bayesian Regularized Neural Network (BRNN) both in combination with different hyperparameters. These ML methods were also compared with Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (GBLUP) and different Bayesian regression models [Bayes A, Bayes B, Bayes Cπ, Bayesian Ridge Regression, Bayesian LASSO, and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)]. DL models, using Rectified Linear Units (as the activation function), had higher predictive ability values, which varied from 0.27 (pilodyn penetration of 6 years old eucalypt trees) to 0.78 (flowering-related traits of maize). Moreover, the larger mini-batch size (100%) had a significantly higher predictive ability for wood-related traits than the smaller mini-batch size (10%). On the other hand, in the BRNN method, the architectures of one and two layers that used only the pureline function showed better results of prediction, with values ranging from 0.21 (pilodyn penetration) to 0.71 (flowering traits). A significant increase in the prediction ability was observed for DL in comparison with other methods of genomic prediction (Bayesian alphabet models, GBLUP, RKHS, and BRNN). Another important finding was the usefulness of DL models (through an iterative algorithm) as an SNP detection strategy for genome-wide association studies. The results of this study confirm the importance of DL for genome-wide analyses and crop/tree improvement strategies, which holds promise for accelerating breeding progress. © Copyright © 2020 Maldonado, Mora-Poblete, Contreras-Soto, Ahmar, Chen, do Amaral Júnior and Scapim.","Bayesian regularized neural network; deep learning; eucalypt; genomic prediction; machine learning; single-nucleotide polymorphisms; tropical maize",,Article,Scopus

A classification of carbon models was developed; global (carbon-nitrogen and multi-element) and ecosystem models were singled out. The latter ones fall into carbon cycle models (agroecosystem, phytocenosis, and greenhouse gases (CO2and CH4) emissions) and carbon-nitrogen cycle models (various ecosystems, forest, and microbiological). The following difficulties arising when mathematical methods are used for description of the carbon cycle were discussed: multiple methods of calculation; high requirements to input data; limited availability of input information; necessity to consider climate change; errors in description of the functional dependence of CO2emission on temperature. The challenges of quantitative evaluation of components of the carbon biogeochemical cycle were analyzed, i.e., the dual role of soil both as a carbon stock and a source of car-bon compounds, which are greenhouse gases, as well as the interaction of carbon and nitrogen cycles, separation of the pool of soil organic carbon into fractions, and the ratio of microbial and root respirations. Further development of the obtained models will help to better assess greenhouse gases fluxes, to properly determine the effect of climatic and anthropogenic factors on them, and to create a strategy for reducing their emissions. © 2020 Kazan Federal University.

The ability to accurately grasp soil nutrient information is a prerequisite for scientific fertilization within the field of precision agriculture. Information pertaining to soil macronutrients, such as N, may be obtained quickly through hyperspectral imaging techniques. Objective of this research is to explore the use of a deep learning (DL) network to estimate the abundance of urea fertilizer mixed soils for spectroradiometer data. The proposed approach was tested for silt clay and loamy types of soils. Spectral regions of 1899.2 nm for urea and 2195.1 nm for soils were identified as optimum spectral absorption features. The accuracy evaluation was performed using a linear regression model between actual and estimated abundances. At 1899.2 nm, the coefficient of determination (R2) for mixed samples of urea and silt clay soil was found to be 0.945, while R2 for urea mixed loamy soil were 0.954. Similarly, at 2195.1 nm, R2 obtained 0.953 for urea mixed silt clay soil and 0.944 for urea mixed loamy soil. The results show that the estimated abundances obtained through the derivative analysis for spectral unmixing (DASU)-based DL network facilitated a greater accuracy in comparison to the sole use of DASU. These results were then verified through conventional chemical analysis methods. The outcome of this article determines the abundance of urea mixed soils. Therefore, it is inferred that the hyperspectral imaging technique may be utilized in-situ to assess the agricultural land's soil fertility status. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Deep learning (DL) network; hyperspectral remote sensing; precision agriculture; soil macronutrients; spectral unmixing","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Chemical analysis; Clay; Hyperspectral imaging; Learning systems; Metabolism; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Regression analysis; Silt; Spectroscopy; Urea; Urea fertilizers; Accuracy evaluation; Coefficient of determination; Derivative analysis; Learning-based approach; Linear regression models; Soil nitrogen content; Spectral absorption features; Spectro-radiometers; Deep learning; machine learning; multispectral image; precision agriculture; remote sensing; soil fertility; soil nitrogen; soil nutrient; spectral analysis; urea",Article,Scopus

It seems to have the potential to partially replace Norway spruce, as it is less sensitive to expected warmer and drier conditions. It is, however, not well known in which regions these new plantings would be particularly favourable and if specific provenances may be better adapted to the new conditions than others. Therefore, we estimated the potential early height growth under climate conditions in 2040–2060 for 20 beech provenances across a region covering the Czech Republic and Slovakia. This Central European region is expected to experience considerably drier and warmer conditions in the future. For this exercise, we implemented a new neural network model developed from height growth information obtained from the open-access BeechCOSTe52 database. The simulations are driven by past and future climate data obtained from the WorldClim database of historical climate data and future climate projections. Simulations revealed that provenances originating from drier regions performed on average significantly better than those from regions with good water supply. Moreover, provenances originating from drier regions had a particularly large advantage in the relatively arid regions of Central Czechia and Southern Slovakia. We can also confirm that all provenances showed a high phenotypic plasticity of height growth across the whole investigated region. © 2022 by the authors.","common garden; eco distance; Fagus sylvatica; local adaptation; neural network model; phenotypic plasticity","Climate change; Climate models; Driers (materials); Forestry; Water supply; Common garden; Dry condition; Eco distance; European beech; Fagus sylvatica; Height growth; Local adaptation; Neural network model; Phenotypic plasticity; Warmer conditions; Neural network models; Driers; Fagus Sylvatica; Forestry; Growth; Height; Slovakia; Water Supply",Article,Scopus

This paper presents for the first time the potential of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-based high-resolution hyperspectral and LiDAR data acquired from in-season stand crops for estimating seed protein and oil compositions of soybean and corn using multisensory data fusion and automated machine learning. UAV-based hyperspectral and LiDAR data was collected during the growing season (reproductive stage five (R5)) of 2020 over a soybean test site near Columbia, Missouri and a cornfield at Urbana, Illinois, USA. Canopy spectral and texture features were extracted from hyperspectral imagery, and canopy structure features were derived from LiDAR point clouds. The extracted features were then used as input variables for automated machine-learning methods available with the H2O Automated Machine-Learning framework (H2O-AutoML). The results presented that: (1) UAV hyperspectral imagery can successfully predict both the protein and oil of soybean and corn with moderate accuracies; (2) canopy structure features derived from LiDAR point clouds yielded slightly poorer estimates of crop-seed composition compared to the hyperspectral data; (3) regardless of machine-learning methods, the combination of hyperspectral and LiDAR data outperformed the predictions using a single sensor alone, with an R2 of 0.79 and 0.67 for corn protein and oil and R2 of 0.64 and 0.56 for soybean protein and oil; and (4) the H2O-AutoML framework was found to be an efficient strategy for machine-learning-based data-driven model building.

Effective management requires data collection over large spatio-temporal scales, readily accessible and integrated information from monitoring, and tools to support decision-making. However, there are many roadblocks to achieving adequate and timely information on both the effectiveness, and long-term success of conservation efforts, including limited funding, inadequate sampling, and data processing bottlenecks. These factors can result in ineffective, or even detrimental, management decisions in already impacted ecosystems. An automated approach facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) provides conservation managers with a toolkit that can help alleviate a number of these issues by reducing the monitoring bottlenecks and long-term costs of monitoring. Automating the collection, transfer, and processing of data provides managers access to greater information, thereby facilitating timely and effective management. Incorporating automation and big data availability into a decision support system with a user-friendly interface also enables effective adaptive management. We summarise the current state of artificial intelligence and automation techniques used in marine science and use examples in other disciplines to identify existing and potentially transferable methods that can enable automated monitoring and improve predictive modelling capabilities to support decision making. We also discuss emerging technologies that are likely to be useful as research in computer science and associated technologies continues to develop and become more accessible. Our perspective highlights the potential of AI and big data analytics for supporting decision-making, but also points to important knowledge gaps in multiple areas of the automation processes. These current challenges should be prioritised in conservation research to move toward implementing AI and automation in conservation management for a more informed understanding of impacted ecosystems to result in successful outcomes for conservation managers. We conclude that the current research and emphasis on automated and AI assisted tools in several scientific disciplines may mean the future of monitoring and management in marine science is facilitated and improved by the implementation of automation.

Existing spatial interpolation methods have relatively low accuracy, and the resolution of available long-term gridded products of air temperature for China is coarse. Point observations from meteorological stations can provide long-term air temperature data series but cannot represent spatially continuous information. Here, we devised a method for spatial interpolation of air temperature data from meteorological stations based on powerful machine learning tools. First, to determine the optimal method for interpolation of air temperature data, we employed three machine learning models: random forest, support vector machine, and Gaussian process regression. A comparison of the mean absolute error, root mean square error, coefficient of determination, and residuals revealed that a Gaussian process regression had high accuracy and clearly outperformed the other two models regarding the interpolation of monthly maximum, minimum, and mean air temperatures. The machine learning methods were compared with three traditional methods used frequently for spatial interpolation: inverse distance weighting, ordinary kriging, and ANUSPLIN (Australian National University Spline). Results showed that the Gaussian process regression model had higher accuracy and greater robustness than the traditional methods regarding interpolation of monthly maximum, minimum, and mean air temperatures in each month. A comparison with the TerraClimate (Monthly Climate and Climatic Water Balance for Global Terrestrial Surfaces), FLDAS (Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System), and ERA5 (ECMWF, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, Climate Reanalysis) data sets revealed that the accuracy of the temperature data generated using the Gaussian process regression model was higher. Finally, using the Gaussian process regression method, we produced a long-term (January 1951 to December 2020) gridded monthly air temperature data set, with 1 km resolution and high accuracy for China, which we named GPRChinaTemp1km. The data set consists of three variables: monthly mean air temperature, monthly maximum air temperature, and monthly minimum air temperature. The obtained GPRChinaTemp1km data were used to analyse the spatiotemporal variations of air temperature using Theil-Sen median trend analysis in combination with the Mann-Kendall test. It was found that the monthly mean and minimum air temperatures across China were characterised by a significant trend of increase in each month, whereas monthly maximum air temperatures showed a more spatially heterogeneous pattern, with significant increase, non-significant increase, and non-significant decrease. The GPRChinaTemp1km data set is publicly available at 10.5281/zenodo.5112122 (He et al., 2021a) for monthly maximum air temperature, at 10.5281/zenodo.5111989 (He et al., 2021b) for monthly mean air temperature, and at 10.5281/zenodo.5112232 (He et al., 2021c) for monthly minimum air temperature. © 2022 Copernicus GmbH.

In this study, a Machine Learning (i.e. Random Forest, RF) based observational constraining approach is proposed for reducing the uncertainties of future maize yield projections by seven process-based crop models. Based on the observationally constrained crop models, future changes in yield average and yield variability for the period 2080-2099 are investigated for the globe and top ten producing countries. Results show that the uncertainties of crop models for projecting future changes in yield average and yield variability can be largely reduced by 62% and 52% by the RF-based constraint, respectively, while only 4% and 16% of uncertainty reduction is achieved by traditional linear regression-based constraint. Compared to the raw simulations of future change in yield average (-5.13 ± 18.19%) and yield variability (-0.24 ± 1.47%), the constrained crop models project a much higher yield loss (-34.58 ± 6.93%) and an increase in yield variability (3.15 ± 0.71%) for the globe. Regionally, the constrained models show the largest increase in yield loss magnitude in Brazil, India and Indonesia. Our results suggest more agricultural risks under climate change than previously expected after observationally constraining crop models.

However, in semi-arid regions, remotely sensed discrimination of tree species is difficult primarily due to the tree similarities, small and sparse canopy cover, but may also be due to overlapping woody canopies as well as seasonal leaf retention (deciduous versus evergreen) characteristics. Similar studies in different biomes have achieved low accuracies using coarse spatial resolution image data. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of multi-temporal, airborne hyperspectral imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) derived data for tree species classification in a semi-arid desert region. This study produces highly accurate classifications by combining multi-temporal fine spatial resolution hyperspectral and LiDAR data (~1 m) through a reproducible scripting and machine learning approach that can be applied to larger areas and similar datasets. Combining multi-temporal vegetation indices and canopy height models led to an overall accuracy of 95.28% and kappa of 94.17%. Five woody species were discriminated resulting in producer accuracies ranging from 86.12% to 98.38%. The influence of fusing spectral and structural information in a random forest classifier for tree identification is evident. Additionally, a multi-temporal dataset slightly increases classification accuracies over a single data collection. Our results show a promising methodology for tree species classification in a semi-arid region using multi-temporal hyperspectral and LiDAR remote sensing data. © 2022 by the authors.

To fill this knowledge gap, we created a systems understanding of agroecosystem N dynamics and quantified the impact of controllable (management) and uncontrollable (weather, climate) factors on N fluxes and soybean yields. We performed a simulation experiment across 10 soybean production environments in the United States using the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model and future climate projections from five global circulation models. Climate change (2020–2080) increased N mineralization (24%) and N2O emissions (19%) but decreased N fixation (32%), seed N (20%), and yields (19%). Soil and crop management practices altered N fluxes at a similar magnitude as climate change but in many different directions, revealing opportunities to improve soybean systems’ performance. Among many practices explored, we identified two solutions with great potential: improved residue management (short-term) and water management (long-term). Inter-annual weather variability and management practices affected soybean yield less than N fluxes, which creates opportunities to manage N fluxes without compromising yields, especially in regions with adequate to excess soil moisture. This work provides actionable results (tradeoffs, synergies, directions) to inform decision-making for adapting crop management in a changing climate to improve soybean production systems.

Agricultural modernization will be made possible by the Internet of Things (IoT), a technology with a great promise for revolutionizing the industry. Agricultural products will be in high demand by 2050 due to a 30% increase in the global population, so there is a need to devise new mechanisms for agriculture, and smart agriculture is one of those mechanisms; however, smart agriculture needs to be explored further to realize its potential fully. So, to explore the potential of this field, the researchers have used a corpus that is extracted from the Scopus database from the year 2008 to the year 2022 and applied the LDA technique. A corpus of 4309 articles was selected from the Scopus database to apply the latent Dirichlet analysis (LDA) model to predict research areas for smart agriculture. Using IoT technology, farmers and producers may better manage their resources, such as fertilizer consumption and the number of trips made by farm vehicles, while minimizing waste and maximizing productivity, including water, electricity, and other inputs. This data-driven experimental study identifies smart agriculture research trends by implementing a topic modeling technique previously used in smart agriculture. The authors have created seventeen research themes in smart agriculture based on the LDA topic modeling.

This article presents a review of some of the different possible approaches taken on climate change, to demonstrate the need to build a multidisciplinary perspective of the problem. It is understood that only the integration of different perspectives, presented by different areas of knowledge, such as natural sciences, social and economic sciences and human sciences, will make it possible to build modeling and predictive scenarios, which realistically may represent the development of the earth system under the influence of climate change. In this way, with the support of all areas of knowledge, the creation of forecast models where all possible changes to the different variables of the earth system may be simulated will allow for the mitigation measures presented to be analyzed in advance and, thus, prioritized.

Agroforestry systems promise a number of benefits to enhance nature’s contributions to people. There are a wide range of agroforestry systems implemented representing different levels of establishment across the globe. This range and the long time periods for the establishment of these systems make empirical assessments of impacts on ecosystem functions difficult. In this study we investigate how simulation models can help to assess and predict the role of agroforestry in nature’s contributions. The review of existing models to simulate agroforestry systems reveals that most models predict mainly biomass production and yield. Regulating ecosystem services are mostly considered as a means for the assessment of yield only. Generic agroecosystem models with agroforestry extensions provide a broader scope, but the interaction between trees and crops is often addressed in a simplistic way. The application of existing models for agroforestry systems is particularly hindered by issues related to code structure, licences or availability. Therefore, we call for a community effort to connect existing agroforestry models with ecosystem effect models towards an open‐source, multi-effect agroforestry modelling framework. © 2021 by the authors.

The advanced deep learning sensor fusion technique has been reported to improve the performance of the machine learning application for processing the collected sensory data. This paper extensively reviews the state-of-the-art methods for plant water stress assessment that utilized the deep learning sensor fusion approach in their application, together with future prospects and challenges of the application domain. Notably, 37 deep learning solutions fell under six main areas, namely soil moisture estimation, soil water modelling, evapotranspiration estimation, evapotranspiration forecasting, plant water status estimation and plant water stress identification.

Modeling and predicting the biomass and yield of individual plants at the farm scale represents a major challenge in precision agriculture, particularly when salinity and other abiotic stresses may play a role. Here, we evaluate a diversity panel of the wild tomato species (Solanum pimpinellifolium) through both field and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based phenotyping of 600 control and 600 salt-treated plants. The study objective was to predict fresh shoot mass, tomato fruit numbers, and yield mass at harvest based on a range of variables derived from the UAV imagery. UAV-based red–green–blue (RGB) imageries collected 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 weeks before harvest were also used to determine if prediction accuracies varied between control and salt-treated plants. Multispectral UAV-based imagery was also collected 1 and 2 weeks prior to harvest to further explore predictive insights. In order to estimate the end of season biomass and yield, a random forest machine learning approach was implemented using UAV-imagery-derived predictors as input variables. Shape features derived from the UAV, such as plant area, border length, width, and length, were found to have the highest importance in the predictions, followed by vegetation indices and the entropy texture measure. The multispectral UAV imagery collected 2 weeks prior to harvest produced the highest explained variances for fresh shoot mass (87.95%), fruit numbers (63.88%), and yield mass per plant (66.51%). The RGB UAV imagery produced very similar results to those of the multispectral UAV dataset, with the explained variance reducing as a function of increasing time to harvest. The results showed that predicting the yield of salt-stressed plants produced higher accuracies when the models excluded control plants, whereas predicting the yield of control plants was not affected by the inclusion of salt-stressed plants within the models. This research demonstrates that it is possible to predict the average biomass and yield up to 8 weeks prior to harvest within 4.23% of field-based measurements and up to 4 weeks prior to harvest at the individual plant level. Results from this work may be useful in providing guidance for yield forecasting of healthy and salt-stressed tomato plants, which in turn may inform growing practices, logistical planning, and sales operations. © Copyright © 2020 Johansen, Morton, Malbeteau, Aragon, Al-Mashharawi, Ziliani, Angel, Fiene, Negrão, Mousa, Tester and McCabe.","biomass; multi-spectral; random forest; RGB; salinity; tomato plants; UAV; yield",,Article,Scopus

Forty percent of this water is derived from groundwater. Approximately 20%-30% of the groundwater sources are saline and 20%-50% of global irrigation water is salinized. Salinization reduces crop yields and the number of crop varieties which can be grown on an arable holding. Structured ZVI (zero valent iron, Fe0 pellets desalinate water by storing the removed ions as halite (NaCl) within their porosity. This allows an ""Aquifer Treatment Zone"" to be created within an aquifer, (penetrated by a number of wells (containing ZVI pellets)). This zone is used to supply partially desalinated water directly from a saline aquifer. A modeled reconfigured aquifer producing a continuous flow (e.g., 20 m3/day, 7300 m3/a) of partially desalinated irrigation water is used to illustrate the impact of porosity, permeability, aquifer heterogeneity, abstraction rate, Aquifer Treatment Zone size, aquifer thickness, optional reinjection, leakage and flow by-pass on the product water salinity. This desalination approach has no operating costs (other than abstraction costs (and ZVI regeneration)) and may potentially be able to deliver a continuous flow of partially desalinated water (30%-80% NaCl reduction) for $0.05-0.5/m3. © 2017 by the authors.","Aquifer; Desalination; Irrigation; Salinization; Zero valent iron (ZVI, Fe0)",,Article,Scopus

Recently, machine learning (ML) models have received increasing attention for GESM due to their vast capabilities. In this context, this paper sought to review the modeling procedure of GESM using ML models, including the required datasets and model development and validation. The results showed that elevation, slope, plan curvature, rainfall and land use/cover were the most important factors for GESM. It is also concluded that although ML models predict the locations of zones prone to gullying reasonably well, performance ranking of such methods is difficult because they yield different results based on the quality of the training dataset, the structure of the models, and the performance indicators. Among the ML techniques, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) are the most widely used models for GESM, which show promising results. Overall, to improve the prediction performance of ML models, the use of data-mining techniques to improve the quality of the dataset and of an ensemble estimation approach is recommended. Furthermore, evaluation of ML models for the prediction of other types of gully erosion, such as rill–interill and ephemeral gully should be the subject of more studies in the future. The employment of a combination of topographic indices and ML models is recommended for the accurate extraction of gully trajectories that are the main input of some process-based models. © 2022 by the authors.","gully erosion susceptibility mapping (GESM); machine learning; random forest; support vector machine",,Review,Scopus

Unfortunately, using traditional microbiological methods, most microorganisms remain unculturable. The emergence of metagenomics has resolved the challenge of capturing the entire microbial community in an environmental sample by enabling the analysis of whole genomes without requiring culturing. Metagenomics as a non-culture approach encompasses a greater amount of genetic information than traditional approaches. The plant root-associated microbial community is essential for plant growth and development, hence the interactions between microorganisms, soil, and plants is essential to understand and improve crop yields in rural and urban agriculture. Although some of these microorganisms are currently unculturable in the laboratory, metagenomic techniques may nevertheless be used to identify the microorganisms and their functional traits. A detailed understanding of these organisms and their interactions should facilitate an improvement of plant growth and sustainable crop production in soil and soilless agriculture. Therefore, the objective of this review is to provide insights into metagenomic techniques to study plant root-associated microbiota and microbial ecology. In addition, the different DNA-based techniques and their role in elaborating plant microbiomes are discussed. As an understanding of these microorganisms and their biotechnological potentials are unlocked through metagenomics, they can be used to develop new, useful and unique bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides that are not harmful to the environment.

The applied methodology consists of elaborating a custom‐developed analytical framework based on a dataset containing 22 relevant indicators, considering four main dimensions that describe the intricacies of the EU agricultural and rural environment, in the CAP context: rural, emissions, macroeconomic, and financial. The results highlight that an increase of the agricultural research and development funding, as well as the agriculture employment rate, negatively influence the degree of rural pov-erty. The rural GDP per capita is influenced by the size of the employment rate in agriculture. It seems that environmental sustainability, identified by both fertilizers used and emissions from agriculture parameters, significantly influences the GDP per capita. In predicting emissions in agriculture, the direct payment, degree of rural poverty, fertilizer use, employment in agriculture, and agriculture labor productivity are the main independent parameters with the highest future importance. It was found that when predicting direct payments, the rural employment rate, employment in agriculture, and gross value added must be considered the most. The agricultural, entrepreneurial income prediction is mainly influenced by the total factor productivity, while agricultural research and development investments depend on gross value added, direct pay-ments, and gross value added in the agricultural sector. Future research, related to prediction models based on CAP indicators, should also consider the marketing dimension. It is recommended for direct payments to be used to invest in upgrading the fertilizers technologies, since environmental sustainability will influence economic growth. © 2021 by the authors.

As nondestructive remote sensing equipment with high precision, high flexibility, and low-cost, unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have been widely used to monitor crop biomass. In this review, UAS platforms and sensors, biomass indices, and data analysis methods are presented. The improvements of UAS in monitoring crop biomass in recent years are introduced, and multisensor fusion, multi-index fusion, the consideration of features not directly related to monitoring biomass, the adoption of advanced algorithms and the use of low-cost sensors are reviewed to highlight the potential for monitoring crop biomass with UAS.

Salinity limits the growth and productivity of crops worldwide. Na+/H+ antiporters play a key role during the plant development and in its tolerance to salt stress. The aim of the present study was a genome-wide characterization and expression pattern analysis under the salinity stress of the sodium-proton antiporter (NHX) of Gossypium barbadense in comparison with Gossypium hirsutum. In G. barbadense, 25 NHX genes were identified on the basis of the Na+_H+ exchanger domain. All except one of the G. barbadense NHX transporters have an Amiloride motif that is a known inhibitor of Na+ ions in plants. A phylogenetic analysis inferred three classes of GbNHX genes—viz., Vac (GbNHX1, 2 and 4), Endo (GbNHX6), and PM (GbNHX7). A high number of the stress-related cis-acting elements observed in promoters show their role in tolerance against abiotic stresses. The Ka/Ks values show that the majority of GbNHX genes are subjected to strong purifying selection under the course of evolution. To study the functional divergence of G. barbadense NHX transporters, the real-time gene expression was analyzed under salt stress in the root, stem, and leaf tissues. In G. barbadense, the expression was higher in the stem, while in G. hirsutum the leaf and root showed a high expression. Moreover, our results revealed that NHX2 homologues in both species have a high expression under salinity stress at higher time intervals, followed by NHX7. The protein-protein prediction study revealed that GbNHX7 is involved in the CBL-CIPK protein interaction pathway. Our study also provided valuable information explaining the molecular mechanism of Na+ transport for the further functional study of Gossypium NHX genes. © 2020 by the authors.

In order to meet a variety of demands, suitable cultivars and innovative breeding methods need to be developed. Breeding methods have changed over time following the advance of genetics. With the advent of new sequencing technology in the early 21st century, predictive breeding, such as genomic selection (GS), emerged when large-scale genomic information became available. GS shows good predictive ability for the selection of individuals with traits of interest even for quantitative traits by using various types of the whole genome-scanning markers, breaking away from the limitations of marker-assisted selection (MAS). In the current review, we briefly describe the history of breeding techniques, each breeding method, various statistical models applied to GS and methods to increase the GS efficiency. Consequently, we intend to propose and define the term digital breeding through this review article. Digital breeding is to develop a predictive breeding methods such as GS at a higher level, aiming to minimize human intervention by automatically proceeding breeding design, propagating breeding populations, and to make selections in consideration of various environments, climates, and topography during the breeding process. We also classified the phases of digital breeding based on the technologies and methods applied to each phase.

U.S. soybean yields, which comprise 32 % of the total soybeans planted in the world, continue to experience unprecedented grain loss due to the soybean cyst nematode (SCN) plant pathogen. SCN remains one of the primary disruptive pests despite the existence of advanced management techniques such as crop rotation and SCN-resistant varieties. SCN detection is a key step in managing this disease; however, early detection is challenging because soybeans do not show any above ground symptoms unless they are significantly damaged. Direct soil sampling remains the most common method for SCN detection, however, this method has several problems. For example, the threshold damage methods—adopted by most of the laboratories to make recommendations—is not reliable as it does not consider soil pH, N, P, and K values and relies solely on the egg count instead of assessment of the root infection. To overcome the challenges of manual soil sampling methods, deep learning and hyperspectral imaging are important current topics in precision agriculture for plant disease detection and have been proposed as cost-effective and efficient detection methods that can work at scale. We have reviewed more than 150 research papers focusing on soybean cyst nematodes with an emphasis on deep learning techniques for detection and management. First: we describe soybean vegetation and reproduction stages, SCN life cycles, and factors influencing this disease. Second: we highlight the impact of SCN on soybean yield loss and the challenges associated with its detection. Third: we describe direct sampling methods in which the soil samples are procured and analyzed to evaluate SCN egg counts. Fourth: we highlight the advantages and limitations of these direct methods, then review computer vision- and remote sensing-based detection methods: data collection using ground, aerial, and satellite approaches followed by a review of machine learning methods for image analysis-based soybean cyst nematode detection. We highlight the evaluation approaches and the advantages of overall detection workflow in high-performance and big data environments. Lastly, we discuss various management approaches, such as crop rotation, fertilization, SCN resistant varieties such as PI 88788, and SCN’s increasing resistance to these strategies. We review machine learning approaches for soybean crop yield forecasting as well as the influence of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers on SCN infestation reduction. We provide recommendations for soybean research using deep learning and hyperspectral imaging to accommodate the lack of the ground truth data and training and testing methodologies, such as data augmentation and transfer learning, to achieve a high level of detection accuracy while keeping costs as low as possible. © 2022, The Author(s).","Convolutional neural networks; Data augmentation; Deep learning; Heterodera glycines; Hyperspectral imaging; Machine learning; Multispectral imaging; Soybean; Soybean cyst nematode; Vegetation indices",,Review,Scopus

Solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) is one of the functional traits to analyze the vegetation and assess plant phenotyping. Estimation of SIF through hyperspectral imaging technique gaining its popularity in the recent days than any other estimating techniques due to its contiguous spectrum property, which allows us to obtain more information. Another merit of hyperspectral images is that they can be used to acquire data on different scales. In our review, we have focused on three major areas as follows, a.) Hyperspectral imaging techniques in estimating SIF in different scales varying from Ground Scale to Orbital Scales. b.) Correlation of other functional traits and factors influences the SIF estimation c.) Machine learning techniques used to interpret the SIF traits for Agricultural Monitoring. Moreover, the aforementioned areas are becoming crucial in the recent trend, and we confine our review with the state-of-the-art techniques exclusively from 2010 to 2021. We comprehend the details in the review to provide insights on the breakthrough made in hyperspectral imaging for SIF estimation, allowing the reader to deepen their understanding in the areas of plant phenotyping, which would enable them to explore the field for future research. © 2022 The Author(s)","Hyperspectral imaging; Machine learning; Plant phenotyping; Solar induced fluorescence","Fluorescence; Hyperspectral imaging; Spectroscopy; Environmental change; Functional traits; Hyperspectral imaging techniques; Machine learning techniques; Orbitals; Plant phenotyping; Plant traits; Recent trends; Solar-induced fluorescences; Spectra properties; Machine learning; environmental change; estimation method; imaging method; phenotype; satellite imagery; solar radiation",Review,Scopus

Despite these challenges, as technologies evolve and prices drop, a surge of new data are being collected. Although a wealth of data are being collected at different scales (i.e., proximal, aerial, satellite, ancillary data), this has been geographically unequal, causing certain areas to be virtually devoid of useful data to help face their specific challenges. However, even in areas with available resources and good infrastructure, data and knowledge gaps are still prevalent, because agricultural environments are mostly uncontrolled and there are vast numbers of factors that need to be taken into account and properly measured for a full characterization of a given area. As a result, data from a single sensor type are frequently unable to provide unambiguous answers, even with very effective algorithms, and even if the problem at hand is well defined and limited in scope. Fusing the information contained in different sensors and in data from different types is one possible solution that has been explored for some decades. The idea behind data fusion involves exploring complementarities and synergies of different kinds of data in order to extract more reliable and useful information about the areas being analyzed. While some success has been achieved, there are still many challenges that prevent a more widespread adoption of this type of approach. This is particularly true for the highly complex environments found in agricultural areas. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview on the data fusion applied to agricultural problems; we present the main successes, highlight the main challenges that remain, and suggest possible directions for future research. © 2022 by the author.

Machine vision is one of the most popular parts of machine learning and has been widely used where advanced automation and control have been required. The trend has shifted from classical image processing and machine learning techniques to modern artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) methods. Based on large training datasets and pre-trained models, DL-based methods have proven to be more accurate than previous traditional techniques. Machine vision has wide applications in agriculture, including the detection of weeds and pests in crops. Variation in lighting conditions, failures to transfer learning, and object occlusion constitute key challenges in this domain. Recently, DL has gained much attention due to its advantages in object detection, classification, and feature extraction. DL algorithms can automatically extract information from large amounts of data used to model complex problems and is, therefore, suitable for detecting and classifying weeds and crops. We present a systematic review of AI-based systems to detect weeds, emphasizing recent trends in DL. Various DL methods are discussed to clarify their overall potential, usefulness, and performance. This study indicates that several limitations obstruct the widespread adoption of AI/DL in commercial applications.

These and other digitalization-enabling technologies are generating a massive amount of data with enormous potential to manage supply chains more efficiently and sustainably. Nevertheless, the intricate patterns and complexity embedded in large volumes of data present a challenge for systematic human expert analysis. In such a datadriven context, Computational Intelligence (CI) has achieved significant momentum to analyze, mine, and extract the underlying data information, or solve complex optimization problems, striking a balance between productive efficiency and sustainability of food supply systems. Although some recent studies have sorted the CI literature in this field, they are mainly oriented towards a single family of CI methods (a group of methods that share common characteristics) and review their application in specific FSC stages. As such, there is a gap in identifying and classifying FSC problems from a broader perspective, encompassing the various families of CI methods that can be applied in different stages (from production to retailing) and identifying the problems that arise in these stages from a CI perspective. This paper presents a new and comprehensive taxonomy of FSC problems (associated with agriculture, fish farming, and livestock) from a CI approach; that is, it defines FSC problems (from production to retail) and categorizes them based on how they can be modeled from a CI point of view. Furthermore, we review the CI approaches that are more commonly used in each stage of the FSC and in their corresponding categories of problems. We also introduce a set of guidelines to help FSC researchers and practitioners to decide on suitable families of methods when addressing any particular problems they might encounter. Finally, based on the proposed taxonomy, we identify and discuss challenges and research opportunities that the community should explore to enhance the contributions that CI can bring to the digitization of the FSC. © 2021 by the authors.

The quality of data collected from sensors greatly influences the performance of the modelling processes using ML algorithms. These three elements (e.g., BD, ML and IoT) have been used tremendously to improve all areas of rice production processes in agriculture, which transform traditional rice farming practices into a new era of rice smart farming or rice precision agriculture.

Canopy structure-and chlorophyll-sensitive VIs derived from Sentinel-2 images were used to estimate the start and end of the growing season (SOS and EOS, respectively) during the period 2016-2018, for an SRC poplar (Populus spp.) plantation in Lochristi (Belgium). Three different filtering methods (Savitzky-Golay (SavGol), polynomial (Polyfit) and Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS) and five SOS-and EOS threshold methods (first derivative function, 10% and 20% percentages and 10% and 20% percentiles) were applied to identify the optimal methods for the determination of phenophases. Our results showed that the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) had the best fit with GPP phenology, as derived from eddy covariance measurements, in identifying SOSand EOS-dates. For SOS, the performance was only slightly better than for several other indices, whereas for EOS, MTCI performed markedly better. The relationship between SOS/EOS derived from GPP and VIs varied interannually. MTCI described best the seasonal pattern of the SRC plantation's GPP (R2 = 0.52 when combining all three years). However, during the extreme dry year 2018, the Chlorophyll Red Edge Index performed slightly better in reproducing growing season GPP variability than MTCI (R2 = 0.59; R2 = 0.49, respectively). Regarding smoothing functions, Polyfit and HANTS methods showed the best (and very similar) performances. We further found that defining SOS as the date at which the 10% or 20% percentile occurred, yielded the best agreement between the VIs and the GPP; while for EOS the dates of the 10% percentile threshold came out as the best. © 2020 by the authors.

The increasing availability of soil data that can be efficiently acquired remotely and proximally, and freely available open-source algorithms, have led to an accelerated adoption of ML techniques to analyse soil data. Given the large number of publications, it is an impossible task to manually review all papers on the application of ML in soil science without narrowing down a narrative of ML application in a specific research question. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the application of ML techniques in soil science aided by a ML algorithm (latent Dirichlet allocation) to find patterns in a large collection of text corpora. The objective is to gain insight into publications of ML applications in soil science and to discuss the research gaps in this topic. We found that (a) there is an increasing usage of ML methods in soil sciences, mostly concentrated in developed countries, (b) the reviewed publications can be grouped into 12 topics, namely remote sensing, soil organic carbon, water, contamination, methods (ensembles), erosion and parent material, methods (NN, neural networks, SVM, support vector machines), spectroscopy, modelling (classes), crops, physical, and modelling (continuous), and (c) advanced ML methods usually perform better than simpler approaches thanks to their capability to capture non-linear relationships. From these findings, we found research gaps, in particular, about the precautions that should be taken (parsimony) to avoid overfitting, and that the interpretability of the ML models is an important aspect to consider when applying advanced ML methods in order to improve our knowledge and understanding of soil. We foresee that a large number of studies will focus on the latter topic. © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

Governments and industries are developing strategies to respond to the risks and opportunities associated with these disruptors. Modelling is a useful tool for system conceptualisation, understanding, and scenario testing. Today, New Zealand and other nations need integrated modelling tools at the national scale to help industries and stakeholders plan for future disruptive changes. In this paper, following a scoping review process, we analyse modelling approaches and available agricultural systems’ model examples per thematic applications at the regional to national scale to define the best options for the national policy development. Each modelling approach has specificities, such as stakeholder engagement capacity, complex systems reproduction, predictive or prospective scenario testing, and users should consider coupling approaches for greater added value. The efficiency of spatial decision support tools working with a system dynamics approach can help holistically in stakeholders’ participation and understanding, and for improving land planning and policy.

We utilised bibliometric analysis to investigate the present state of the art and emerging trends in the relationship between AI and the agri-food industry. The research identified three distinct growth phases and the most prevalent AI strategies in the industry. In addition, we analysed key trends and offered researchers and practitioners insightful recommendations for future research. Using resource-based view (RBV) as the theoretical lens, this study established a framework emphasising the long-term effects of AI on various agri-food resources and proposed several research propositions.

Since eddy covariance flux towers have a relatively small footprint and are distributed unevenly across the world, upscaling the observations is necessary to obtain global-scale estimates of biosphere-atmosphere exchange. Based on cross-consistency checks with atmospheric inversions, sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) and dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), here we provide a systematic assessment of the latest upscaling efforts for gross primary production (GPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the FLUXCOM initiative, where different machine learning methods, forcing data sets and sets of predictor variables were employed.</p> Spatial patterns of mean GPP are consistent across FLUXCOM and DGVM ensembles ( at 1 spatial resolution) while the majority of DGVMs show, for 70 of the land surface, values outside the FLUXCOM range. Global mean GPP magnitudes for 2008-2010 from FLUXCOM members vary within 106 and 130 PgC class with the largest uncertainty in the tropics. Seasonal variations in independent SIF estimates agree better with FLUXCOM GPP (mean global pixel-wise) than with GPP from DGVMs (mean global pixel-wise). Seasonal variations in FLUXCOM NEE show good consistency with atmospheric inversion-based net land carbon fluxes, particularly for temperate and boreal regions. Interannual variability of global NEE in FLUXCOM is underestimated compared to inversions and DGVMs. The FLUXCOM version which also uses meteorological inputs shows a strong co-variation in interannual patterns with inversions (for 2001-2010). Mean regional NEE from FLUXCOM shows larger uptake than inversion and DGVM-based estimates, particularly in the tropics with discrepancies of up to several hundred grammes of carbon per square metre per year. These discrepancies can only partly be reconciled by carbon loss pathways that are implicit in inversions but not captured by the flux tower measurements such as carbon emissions from fires and water bodies. We hypothesize that a combination of systematic biases in the underlying eddy covariance data, in particular in tall tropical forests, and a lack of site history effects on NEE in FLUXCOM are likely responsible for the too strong tropical carbon sink estimated by FLUXCOM. Furthermore, as FLUXCOM does not account for fertilization effects, carbon flux trends are not realistic. Overall, current FLUXCOM estimates of mean annual and seasonal cycles of GPP as well as seasonal NEE variations provide useful constraints of global carbon cycling, while interannual variability patterns from FLUXCOM are valuable but require cautious interpretation. Exploring the diversity of Earth observation data and of machine learning concepts along with improved quality and quantity of flux tower measurements will facilitate further improvements of the FLUXCOM approach overall. © 2020.

Each of these three domains requires dedicated sensor technology currently in place for ground and airborne applications and either have satellite concepts under development (e.g., HySPIRI/SBG (Surface Biology and Geology), Sentinel-8, HiTeSEM in the TIR) or are subject to satellite missions recently launched or scheduled within the next years (i.e., EnMAP and PRISMA (PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa, launched on March 2019) in the VNIR/SWIR, Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) in the SIF). Identification of plant water stress or drought is of utmost importance to guarantee global water and food supply. Therefore, knowledge of crop water status over large farmland areas bears large potential for optimizing agricultural water use. As plant responses to water stress are numerous and complex, their physiological consequences affect the electromagnetic signal in different spectral domains. This review paper summarizes the importance of water stress-related applications and the plant responses to water stress, followed by a concise review of water-stress detection through remote sensing, focusing on TIR without neglecting the comparison to other spectral domains (i.e., VNIR/SWIR and SIF) and multi-sensor approaches. Current and planned sensors at ground, airborne, and satellite level for the TIR as well as a selection of commonly used indices and approaches for water-stress detection using the main multi-/hyperspectral remote sensing imaging techniques are reviewed. Several important challenges are discussed that occur when using spectral emissivity, temperature-based indices, and physically-based approaches for water-stress detection in the TIR spectral domain. Furthermore, challenges with data processing and the perspectives for future satellite missions in the TIR are critically examined. In conclusion, information from multi-/hyperspectral TIR together with those from VNIR/SWIR and SIF sensors within a multi-sensor approach can provide profound insights to actual plant (water) status and the rationale of physiological and biochemical changes. Synergistic sensor use will open new avenues for scientists to study plant functioning and the response to environmental stress in a wide range of ecosystems. © 2019 by the authors.","Crop stress; Drought; Emissivity; Evapotranspiration (ET) modeling; Remote sensing; Temperature; Thermal infrared (TIR); Water stress; Water use","Crops; Data handling; Drought; Fluorescence; Food supply; Forestry; Imaging techniques; Infrared radiation; Physiological models; Physiology; Plants (botany); Satellites; Stresses; Temperature; Water supply; Emissivity; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Shortwave Infrared Reflectance; State-of-the-art techniques; Thermal infrared; Thermal infrared remote sensing; Water stress; Water use; Remote sensing",Review,Scopus

Other problem includes; object classification, location, scaling, neurons behavior analysis in hidden layers, rule, and template matching. Also, the lack of extant literature on the issues associated with ANN application to PR seems to slow down research focus and progress in the field.

In evaluating the performance of ANN models, some statistical indicators for measuring the performance of the ANN model in many studies were adopted. Such as the use of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and variance of absolute percentage error (VAPE).

Appropriate strategies for data storage, management, and evaluation are needed to make efficient use of experimental findings. Computational approaches of data mining are essential for deriving statistical trends and signatures contained in data matrices. Although, current biology is challenged by high data dimensionality in general, this is particularly true for plant biology. Plants as sessile organisms have to cope with environmental fluctuations. This typically results in strong dynamics of metabolite and protein concentrations which are often challenging to quantify. Summarizing experimental output results in complex data arrays, which need computational statistics and numerical methods for building quantitative models. Experimental findings need to be combined by computational models to gain a mechanistic understanding of plant metabolism. For this, bioinformatics and mathematics need to be combined with experimental setups in physiology, biochemistry, and molecular biology.

A U-Shape convolutional neural network (U-Net), based on a deep residual learning framework, was developed for the semantic segmentation of date palm trees. A comprehensive set of labeled data was established to enable the training and evaluation of the proposed segmentation model and increase its generalization capability. The performance of the proposed approach was compared with those of various state-of-the-art fully convolutional networks (FCNs) with different encoder architectures, including U-Net (based on VGG-16 backbone), pyramid scene parsing network, and two variants of DeepLab V3+. Experimental results showed that the proposed model outperformed other FCNs in the validation and testing datasets. The generalizability evaluation of the proposed approach on a comprehensive and complex testing dataset exhibited higher classification accuracy and showed that date palm trees could be automatically mapped from VHSR UAV images with an F-score, mean intersection over union, precision, and recall of 91%, 85%, 0.91, and 0.92, respectively.

Together these stresses suppress global crop production by as much as 50% and their impacts are predicted to be exacerbated by climate change. Infrastructure and management practices can mitigate these detrimental impacts, but are costly. Crop breeding for improved tolerance has had some success but is progressing slowly and is not keeping pace with climate change. In contrast, Silicon (Si) is known to improve plant tolerance to a range of stresses and could provide a sustainable, rapid and cost-effective mitigation method. The exact mechanisms are still under debate but it appears Si can relieve salt stress via accumulation in the root apoplast where it reduces “bypass flow of ions to the shoot. Si-dependent drought relief has been linked to lowered root hydraulic conductance and reduction of water loss through transpiration. However, many alternative mechanisms may play a role such as altered gene expression and increased accumulation of compatible solutes. Oxidative damage that occurs under stress conditions can be reduced by Si through increased antioxidative enzymes while Si-improved photosynthesis has also been reported. Si fertilizer can be produced relatively cheaply and to assess its economic viability to improve crop stress tolerance we present a cost-benefit analysis. It suggests that Si fertilization may be beneficial in many agronomic settings but may be beyond the means of smallholder farmers in developing countries. Si application may also have disadvantages, such as increased soil pH, less efficient conversion of crops into biofuel and reduced digestibility of animal fodder. These issues may hamper uptake of Si fertilization as a routine agronomic practice. Here, we critically evaluate recent literature, quantifying the most significant physiological changes associated with Si in plants under drought and salinity stress. Analyses show that metrics associated with photosynthesis, water balance and oxidative stress all improve when Si is present during plant exposure to salinity and drought. We further conclude that most of these changes can be explained by apoplastic roles of Si while there is as yet little evidence to support biochemical roles of this element. © Copyright © 2020 Thorne, Hartley and Maathuis.","agronomy; drought; osmotic stress; oxidative stress; photosynthesis; review; salinity; silicon fertilization",,Article,Scopus

In total, 151 studies were identified and categorised. Seventy-six percent of N recommendation systems are empirical and based on spatialised vegetation indices (73% of them); 21% are based on mechanistic crop simulation models with limited use of spatialized data (26% of them); 3% are based on machine learning techniques with the integration of spatialised and non-spatialised data. Recommendation systems appeared worldwide in 2000; they were often applied in the exact location where calibration had been carried out. Thirty percent of the studies use advanced recommendation techniques, such as sensor/approach fusion (44%), algorithm add-ons (30%), estimation of environmental benefits (13%), and omme multi-objective decisions (13%). However, some limitations have been identified. For example, empirical systems need specific calibrations for each site, species, and sensor, rarely using soil, veg-etation, and weather data together, while mechanistic systems need large input data sets, often non-spatialised. We conclude that N recommendation systems can be improved by better data and the integration of algorithms. l use only. © the Author(s), 2022.","data fusion; empirical models; Fertilisation; fertiliser amount; mechanistic models; sensors","algorithm; calibration; fertilization (reproduction); machine learning; precision agriculture; vegetation",Article,Scopus

Plant phenotyping robots have emerged as a high-throughput technology to measure morphological, chemical and physiological properties of large number of plants. Several robotic systems have been developed to fulfill different phenotyping missions. In particular, robotic phenotyping has the potential to enable efficient monitoring of changes in plant traits over time in both controlled environments and in the field. The operation of these robots can be challenging as a result of the dynamic nature of plants and the agricultural environments.

It is a key to improve productivity by using the best agricultural practices and optimal usage of resources. Agriculture faces diverse challenges due to soil degradation, climate variation, and increasing costs. To unfold these challenges, PA uses Wireless Sensor Networks(WSNs) and exploits acquisition, communication, and processing of the data as basic enabling technologies to amplify the crop yield. Also, many other multidisciplinary technologies are supporting PA in finding the most novel use cases for PA. The use of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed PA at almost every level. The fog/edge paradigm is mitigating many challenges such as network bandwidth and security by bringing computation closer to the deployed network. At the same time, Software Defined Networks (SDN) brings flexibility, big data assists in handling data, and nanotechnology plays a crucial part in driving the innovation in PA. This paper delves into ways these technologies are transforming PA in respective tracks, exhibiting the significance of integrating multidisciplinary approaches towards the future of PA.

Generally, methylation within genes promoter inhibits regulatory protein binding and represses transcription, whereas gene body methylation is associated with actively transcribed genes. However, it remains unclear whether there is interaction between methylation levels across genic regions and which site has the biggest impact on gene regulation. We investigated and used the methylation patterns of the bread wheat cultivar Chinese Spring to uncover differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between roots and leaves, using six machine learning algorithms and a deep neural network. As anticipated, genes with higher expression in leaves were mainly involved in photosynthesis and pigment biosynthesis processes whereas genes that were not differentially expressed between roots and leaves were involved in protein processes and membrane structures. Methylation occurred preponderantly (60%) in the CG context, whereas 35 and 5% of methylation occurred in CHG and CHH contexts, respectively. Methylation levels were highly correlated (r = 0.7 to 0.9) between all genic regions, except within the promoter (r = 0.4 to 0.5). Machine learning models gave a high (0.81) prediction accuracy of DEGs. There was a strong correlation (p-value = 9.20×10−10) between all features and gene expression, suggesting that methylation across all genic regions contribute to gene regulation. However, the methylation of the promoter, the CDS and the exon in CG context was the most impactful.

Quantifying these benefits is challenging in agroforestry systems, largely due to landscape complexity and the diversity of management approaches. Digital tools designed for agroforestry typically focus on timber and crop production, and not the broader range of benefits usually considered in assessments of ecosystem services and natural capital. The objectives of this review were to identify and evaluate digital tools that quantify natural capital benefits across eight themes applicable to agroforestry systems: timber production and carbon sequestration, agricultural production, microclimate, air quality, water management, biodiversity, pollination, and amenity. We identified and evaluated 63 tools, 9 of which were assessed in further detail using Australia as a case study. No single tool was best suited to quantify benefits across each theme, suggesting that multiple tools or models could be combined to address capability gaps. We find that model complexity, incorporation of spatial processes, accessibility, regional applicability, development speed and interoperability present significant challenges for the tools that were evaluated.

In recent years, there has been significant progress in plant phenomics and genomics approaches for generating reliable large datasets. However, selecting an appropriate data integration and analysis method to improve the efficiency of phenome-phenome and phenome-genome association studies is still a bottleneck. This study proposes a hyperspectral wide association study (HypWAS) approach as a phenome-phenome association analysis through a hierarchical data integration strategy to estimate the prediction power of hyperspectral reflectance bands in predicting soybean seed yield. Using HypWAS, five important hyperspectral reflectance bands in visible, red-edge, and near-infrared regions were identified significantly associated with seed yield. The phenome-genome association analysis of each tested hyperspectral reflectance band was performed using two conventional genome-wide association studies (GWAS) methods and a machine learning mediated GWAS based on the support vector regression (SVR) method. Using SVR-mediated GWAS, more relevant QTL with the physiological background of the tested hyperspectral reflectance bands were detected, supported by the functional annotation of candidate gene analyses. The results of this study have indicated the advantages of using hierarchical data integration strategy and advanced mathematical methods coupled with phenome-phenome and phenome-genome association analyses for a better understanding of the biology and genetic backgrounds of hyperspectral reflectance bands affecting soybean yield formation. The identified yield-related hyperspectral reflectance bands using HypWAS can be used as indirect selection criteria for selecting superior genotypes with improved yield genetic gains in large breeding populations.

In this context, better knowledge of how climate will change in West Africa and how such changes will impact crop productivity is crucial to inform policies that may counteract the adverse effects. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of climate change impacts on agriculture inWest Africa based on the recent scientific literature.West Africa is nowadays experiencing a rapid climate change, characterized by a widespread warming, a recovery of the monsoonal precipitation, and an increase in the occurrence of climate extremes. The observed climate tendencies are also projected to continue in the twenty-first century under moderate and high emission scenarios, although large uncertainties still affect simulations of the future West African climate, especially regarding the summer precipitation. However, despite diverging future projections of the monsoonal rainfall, which is essential for rain-fed agriculture, a robust evidence of yield loss in West Africa emerges. This yield loss is mainly driven by increased mean temperature while potential wetter or drier conditions as well as elevated CO2 concentrations can modulate this effect. Potential for adaptation is illustrated for major crops in West Africa through a selection of studies based on process-based crop models to adjust cropping systems (change in varieties, sowing dates and density, irrigation, fertilizer management) to future climate. Results of the cited studies are crop and region specific and no clear conclusions can be made regarding the most effective adaptation options. Further efforts are needed to improve modeling of the monsoon system and to better quantify the uncertainty in its changes under a warmer climate, in the response of the crops to such changes and in the potential for adaptation. © 2016 Sultan and Gaetani.","Adaptation; Agriculture; Climate change; Impacts; West African monsoon",,Review,Scopus

To date, limited field scale AFs models are available to simulate all possible ESS and BD together. We conducted an extensive systematic review of available agroforestry (AF), BD, and soil erosion models for the simulation potential of seven most desirable ESS in AFS. Simple to complex AF models have an inherent limitation of being objective-specific. A few complex and dynamic AF models did not meet the recent interest and demands for the simulation of ESS under AFS. Further, many ESS modules especially soil erosion, GHGs emission, groundwater recharge, onsite water retention, nutrients and pesticide leaching, and BD are often missing in available AF models, while some existing soil erosion models can be used in combination with AF models. Likewise mechanistic and process-based BD diversity models are lacking or found limited simulation potential for ESS under AFS. However, further efforts of model development and improvement (integration and coupling) are needed for the better simulation of complex interactive processes belonging to ESS under AFS. There are different possibilities but a proficient modeling approach for better reliability, flexibility, and durability is to integrate and couple them into a process-based dynamic modular structure. Findings of the study further suggested that crop modeling frameworks (MFW) like SIMPLACE and APSIM could be potential ones for the integration and coupling of different suitable modeling approaches (AF, soil protection, GHGs emission, flood prevention, carbon sequestration, onsite water retention, ground recharge, nutrient leaching, and BD modules) in one platform for dynamic process based ESS estimation on daily basis at the field scale.

Annual crop yield production is one of the most crucial components of the global food supply. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed global food security, production, and supply chains. Using biomass estimation as a reliable yield indicator, space-based monitoring of crops can assist in mitigating these stresses by providing reliable product information. Research has been conducted to estimate crop biophysical parameters by destructive and non-destructive approaches. In particular, researchers have investigated the potential of various analytical methods to determine a range of crop parameters using remote sensing data and methods. To this end, they have investigated diverse sources of Earth observations, including radar and optical images with various spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. This paper reviews and analyzes publications from the past 30 years to identify trends in crop monitoring research using remote sensing data and tools. This analysis is accomplished through a systematic review of 277 papers and documents the methods, challenges, and opportunities frequently cited in the scientific literature. The results revealed that research in this field had increased dramatically over this study period. In addition, the analyses confirmed that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) had been the most studied vegetation index to estimate crop parameters. Moreover, this analysis showed that wheat and corn were the most studied crops, globally. © 2022 by the authors.","agriculture; biomass; crop characterization; Earth observation data; leaf area index; meta-analysis; remote sensing; systematic review; yield","Climate change; Food supply; Geometrical optics; Observatories; Optical remote sensing; Population statistics; Supply chains; Vegetation; Crop characterization; Earth observation data; Leaf Area Index; Meta-analysis; Population growth; Remote sensing data; Remote sensing technology; Remote-sensing; Systematic Review; Yield; Crops",Review,Scopus

Insufficient or excessive application of N fertilizers can limit crop yield and quality, especially as excessive N fertilizers can damage the environment and proper fertilizer application is essential for agricultural production. Efficient monitoring of crop N content is the basis of precise fertilizer management, and therefore to increase crop yields and improve crop quality. Remote sensing has gradually replaced traditional destructive methods such as field surveys and laboratory testing for crop N diagnosis. With the rapid advancement of remote sensing, a review on crop N monitoring is badly in need of better summary and discussion. The purpose of this study was to identify current research trends and key issues related to N monitoring. It begins with a comprehensive statistical analysis of the literature on remote sensing monitoring of N in rice and wheat over the past 20 years. The study then elucidates the physiological mechanisms and spectral response characteristics of remote sensing monitoring of canopy N. The following section summarizes the techniques and methods applied in remote sensing monitoring of canopy N from three aspects: remote sensing platforms for N monitoring; correlation between remotely sensed data and N status; and the retrieval methods of N status. The influential factors of N retrieval were then discussed with detailed classification. However, there remain challenges and problems that need to be addressed in the future studies, including the fusion of multisource data from different platforms, and the uncertainty of canopy N inversion in the presence of background factors. The newly developed hybrid model integrates the flexibility of machine learning with the mechanism of physical models. It could be problem solving, which has the advantages of processing multi-source data and reducing the interference of confounding factors. It could be the future development direction of crop N inversion with both high precision and universality. © 2022 by the authors.","nitrogen remote sensing; quantitative retrieval; research prospect; rice and wheat","Data handling; Monitoring; Nitrogen fertilizers; Physiological models; Remote sensing; Crop quality; Crop yield; Multisource data; N fertilizers; Nitrogen remote sensing; Quantitative retrieval; Remote sensing monitoring; Remote-sensing; Research prospect; Rice and wheat; Crops",Review,Scopus

Development of the Haber-Bosch industrial process for ammonia synthesis helped to relieve N limitation of agricultural production, fueling the Green Revolution and reducing hunger. However, the massive use of industrial N fertilizer has doubled the N moving through the global N cycle with dramatic environmental consequences that threaten planetary health. Thus, there is an urgent need to reduce losses of reactive N from agriculture, while ensuring sufficient N inputs for food security. Here we review current knowledge related to N use efficiency (NUE) in agriculture and identify research opportunities in the areas of agronomy, plant breeding, biological N fixation (BNF), soil N cycling, and modeling to achieve responsible, sustainable use of N in agriculture. Amongst these opportunities, improved agricultural practices that synchronize crop N demand with soil N availability are low-hanging fruit. Crop breeding that targets root and shoot physiological processes will likely increase N uptake and utilization of soil N, while breeding for BNF effectiveness in legumes will enhance overall system NUE. Likewise, engineering of novel N-fixing symbioses in non-legumes could reduce the need for chemical fertilizers in agroecosystems but is a much longer-term goal. The use of simulation modeling to conceptualize the complex, interwoven processes that affect agroecosystem NUE, along with multi-objective optimization, will also accelerate NUE gains. © Copyright © 2021 Udvardi, Below, Castellano, Eagle, Giller, Ladha, Liu, Maaz, Nova-Franco, Raghuram, Robertson, Roy, Saha, Schmidt, Tegeder, York and Peters.","agronomy; biological nitrogen fixation; breeding; microbiome; nitrogen use efficiency; policy; roots; soil health",,Review,Scopus

In comparison with multispectral imaging, hyperspectral imaging is a more advanced technique that is capable of acquiring a detailed spectral response of target features. Due to limited accessibility outside of the scientific community, hyperspectral images have not been widely used in precision agriculture. In recent years, different mini-sized and low-cost airborne hyperspectral sensors (e.g., Headwall Micro-Hyperspec, Cubert UHD 185-Firefly) have been developed, and advanced spaceborne hyperspectral sensors have also been or will be launched (e.g., PRISMA, DESIS, EnMAP, HyspIRI). Hyperspectral imaging is becoming more widely available to agricultural applications. Meanwhile, the acquisition, processing, and analysis of hyperspectral imagery still remain a challenging research topic (e.g., large data volume, high data dimensionality, and complex information analysis). It is hence beneficial to conduct a thorough and in-depth review of the hyperspectral imaging technology (e.g., different platforms and sensors), methods available for processing and analyzing hyperspectral information, and recent advances of hyperspectral imaging in agricultural applications. Publications over the past 30 years in hyperspectral imaging technology and applications in agriculture were thus reviewed. The imaging platforms and sensors, together with analytic methods used in the literature, were discussed. Performances of hyperspectral imaging for different applications (e.g., crop biophysical and biochemical properties' mapping, soil characteristics, and crop classification) were also evaluated. This review is intended to assist agricultural researchers and practitioners to better understand the strengths and limitations of hyperspectral imaging to agricultural applications and promote the adoption of this valuable technology.

Numerous vegetation indices (VIs) based on satellite data have participated in the construction of GPP models. However, the relative performance of various VIs in predicting GPP and what additional factors should be combined with them to reveal the photosynthetic capacity of vegetation mechanistically better are still poorly understood. We constructed two types of models (universal and plant functional type [PFT]-specific) for solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and Leaf Area Index (LAI) based on two widely used machine learning algorithms, i.e., the random forest (RF) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) algorithms. A total of thirty plant traits and environmental factors with legacy effects are considered in the model. We then systematically investigated the ancillary variables that best match each vegetation index in estimating global GPP. Four types of models (universal and PFT-specific, RF and BPNN) consistently show that SIF performs best when modeled using a single vegetation index (R2 = 0.67, RMSE = 2.24 g C·m−2·d−1); however, NIRv combined with CO2, plant traits, and climatic factors can achieve the highest prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 1.40 g C·m−2·d−1). Plant traits effectively enhance all prediction models’ accuracy, and climatic variables are essential factors in improving the accuracy of NIRv- or LAI-based GPP models, but not the accuracy of SIF-based models. Our findings provide valuable information for the configuration of the data-driven models to improve the accuracy of predicting GPP and provide insights into the physiological and ecological mechanisms underpinning GPP prediction. © 2022 by the authors.","gross primary productivity; leaf area index; machine learning; NIRv; solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence","Budget control; Carbon; Chlorophyll; Climate change; Ecosystems; Fluorescence; Forestry; Infrared devices; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Neural networks; Photosynthesis; Physiological models; Vegetation; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Environmental factors; Gross primary productivity; Leaf Area Index; Machine-learning; NIRv; Plant traits; Productivity model; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Vegetation index; Forecasting",Article,Scopus

In this scenario, the extensive exploration of available wild, resistant or susceptible germplasms and unraveling the genetic diversity remains vital for breeding programs.

This paper reviewed 164 articles published between 2005 and 2019 that applied different AI techniques to bioenergy systems. This review focuses on identifying the unique capabilities of various AI techniques in addressing bioenergy-related research challenges and improving the performance of bioenergy systems. Specifically, we characterized AI studies by their input variables, output variables, AI techniques, dataset size, and performance. We examined AI applications throughout the life cycle of bioenergy systems. We identified four areas in which AI has been mostly applied, including (1) the prediction of biomass properties, (2) the prediction of process performance of biomass conversion, including different conversion pathways and technologies, (3) the prediction of biofuel properties and the performance of bioenergy end-use systems, and (4) supply chain modeling and optimization. Based on the review, AI is particularly useful in generating data that are hard to be measured directly, improving traditional models of biomass conversion and biofuel end-uses, and overcoming the challenges of traditional computing techniques for bioenergy supply chain design and optimization. For future research, efforts are needed to develop standardized and practical procedures for selecting AI techniques and determining training data samples, to enhance data collection, documentation, and sharing across bioenergy-related areas, and to explore the potential of AI in supporting the sustainable development of bioenergy systems from holistic perspectives. © 2021 The Authors.

The introduction of new farming techniques in the past century (e.g., during the Green Revolution) has helped agriculture keep pace with growing demands for food and other agricultural products. However, further increases in food demand, a growing population, and rising income levels are likely to put additional strain on natural resources. With growing recognition of the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment, new techniques and approaches should be able to meet future food demands while maintaining or reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture. Emerging technologies, such as geospatial technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI), could be utilized to make informed management decisions aimed to increase crop production. Precision agriculture (PA) entails the application of a suite of such technologies to optimize agricultural inputs to increase agricultural production and reduce input losses. Use of remote sensing technologies for PA has increased rapidly during the past few decades. The unprecedented availability of high resolution (spatial, spectral and temporal) satellite images has promoted the use of remote sensing in many PA applications, including crop monitoring, irrigation management, nutrient application, disease and pest management, and yield prediction. In this paper, we provide an overview of remote sensing systems, techniques, and vegetation indices along with their recent (2015–2020) applications in PA. Remote-sensing-based PA technologies such as variable fertilizer rate application technology in Green Seeker and Crop Circle have already been incorporated in commercial agriculture. Use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased tremendously during the last decade due to their cost-effectiveness and flexibility in obtaining the high-resolution (cm-scale) images needed for PA applications. At the same time, the availability of a large amount of satellite data has prompted researchers to explore advanced data storage and processing techniques such as cloud computing and machine learning. Given the complexity of image processing and the amount of technical knowledge and expertise needed, it is critical to explore and develop a simple yet reliable workflow for the real-time application of remote sensing in PA. Development of accurate yet easy to use, user-friendly systems is likely to result in broader adoption of remote sensing technologies in commercial and non-commercial PA applications. © 2020 by the authors.

More and more resource studies are emerging providing 1000 and more genotypes and millions of SNPs for one species covering a hitherto inaccessible intraspecific genetic variation. The larger the databases are growing, the better statistical approaches for genomic selection will be available. However, there are clear limitations on the statistical but also on the biological part. Intraspecific genetic variation is able to explain a high proportion of the phenotypes, but a large part of phenotypic plasticity also stems from environmentally driven transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, post-translational, epigenetic and metabolic regulation. Moreover, regulation of the same gene can have different phenotypic outputs in different environments. Consequently, to explain and understand environment-dependent phenotypic plasticity based on the available genotype variation we have to integrate the analysis of further molecular levels reflecting the complete information flow from the gene to metabolism to phenotype. Interestingly, metabolomics platforms are already more cost-effective than NGS platforms and are decisive for the prediction of nutritional value or stress resistance. Here, we propose three fundamental pillars for future breeding strategies in the framework of Green Systems Biology: (i) combining genome selection with environment-dependent PANOMICS analysis and deep learning to improve prediction accuracy for marker-dependent trait performance; (ii) PANOMICS resolution at subtissue, cellular and subcellular level provides information about fundamental functions of selected markers; (iii) combining PANOMICS with genome editing and speed breeding tools to accelerate and enhance large-scale functional validation of trait-specific precision breeding. © 2020 The Authors.

Food security is a matter of concern for stakeholders and policymakers as the global population is predicted to bypass 10 billion in the coming years. Crop improvement via modern breeding techniques along with efficient agronomic practices innovations in microbiome applications, and exploiting the natural variations in underutilized crops is an excellent way forward to fulfill future food requirements. In this review, we describe the next-generation breeding tools that can be used to increase crop production by developing climate-resilient superior genotypes to cope with the future challenges of global food security. Recent innovations in genomic-assisted breeding (GAB) strategies allow the construction of highly annotated crop pan-genomes to give a snapshot of the full landscape of genetic diversity (GD) and recapture the lost gene repertoire of a species. Pan-genomes provide new platforms to exploit these unique genes or genetic variation for optimizing breeding programs. The advent of next-generation clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR/Cas) systems, such as prime editing, base editing, and de nova domestication, has institutionalized the idea that genome editing is revamped for crop improvement. Also, the availability of versatile Cas orthologs, including Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14, improved the editing efficiency. Now, the CRISPR/Cas systems have numerous applications in crop research and successfully edit the major crop to develop resistance against abiotic and biotic stress. By adopting high-throughput phenotyping approaches and big data analytics tools like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), agriculture is heading toward automation or digitalization. The integration of speed breeding with genomic and phenomic tools can allow rapid gene identifications and ultimately accelerate crop improvement programs. In addition, the integration of next-generation multidisciplinary breeding platforms can open exciting avenues to develop climate-ready crops toward global food security. © Copyright © 2021 Razzaq, Kaur, Akhter, Wani and Saleem.","abiotic stress; climate change; CRISPR/Cas; crop improvement; food security; genome editing; genomics; next-generation breeding",,Review,Scopus

As with the green revolution in the last century, plant genetics may offer concrete opportunities to increase yield and crop adaptability. However, the rate at which the threat is happening requires powering new strategies in order to meet the global food demand. In this review, we highlight major recent ‘big data’ developments from both empirical and theoretical genomics that may speed up the identification, conservation, and breeding of exotic and elite crop varieties with the potential to feed humans. We first emphasize the major bottlenecks to capture and utilize novel sources of variation in abiotic stress (i.e., heat and drought) tolerance. We argue that adaptation of crop wild relatives to dry environments could be informative on how plant phenotypes may react to a drier climate because natural selection has already tested more options than humans ever will. Because isolated pockets of cryptic diversity may still persist in remote semi-arid regions, we encourage new habitat-based population-guided collections for genebanks. We continue discussing how to systematically study abiotic stress tolerance in these crop collections of wild and landraces using geo-referencing and extensive environmental data. By uncovering the genes that underlie the tolerance adaptive trait, natural variation has the potential to be introgressed into elite cultivars. However, unlocking adaptive genetic variation hidden in related wild species and early landraces remains a major challenge for complex traits that, as abiotic stress tolerance, are polygenic (i.e., regulated by many low-effect genes). Therefore, we finish prospecting modern analytical approaches that will serve to overcome this issue. Concretely, genomic prediction, machine learning, and multi-trait gene editing, all offer innovative alternatives to speed up more accurate preand breeding efforts toward the increase in crop adaptability and yield, while matching future global food demands in the face of increased heat and drought. In order for these ‘big data’ approaches to succeed, we advocate for a trans-disciplinary approach with open-source data and long-term funding. The recent developments and perspectives discussed throughout this review ultimately aim to contribute to increased crop adaptability and yield in the face of heat waves and drought events. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper briefly examines the history of crop modelling by international crop research centres of the CGIAR (formerly Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research but now known simply as CGIAR), whose primary focus is on less developed countries. Basic principles of crop modelling building up to a Genotype × Environment × Management × Socioeconomic (G × E × M × S) paradigm, are explained. Modelling has contributed to better understanding of crop performance and yield gaps, better prediction of pest and insect outbreaks, and improving the efficiency of crop management including irrigation systems and optimization of planting dates. New developments include, for example, use of remote sensed data and mobile phone technology linked to crop management decision support models, data sharing in the new era of big data, and the use of genomic selection and crop simulation models linked to environmental data to help make crop breeding decisions. Socio-economic applications include foresight analysis of agricultural systems under global change scenarios, and the consequences of potential food system shocks are also described. These approaches are discussed in this paper which also calls for closer collaboration among disciplines in order to better serve the crop research and development communities by providing model based recommendations ranging from policy development at the level of governmental agencies to direct crop management support for resource poor farmers. © 2018 by the authors.","Agri-food-systems; Big data; CGIAR; Crop management; Crop modelling; Data sharing; Food security; Foresight; Global phenotyping networks; International agricultural research",,Article,Scopus

This entails diversifying the agricultural system and boosting productivity of major cereal crops through development of climate‐resilient cultivars that can sustainably maintain higher yields under climate change conditions, expanding our focus to crop wild relatives, and better exploitation of underuti-lized crop species. This is facilitated by the recent developments in plant genomics, such as advances in genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation, as well as gene editing technologies, which have increased the availability of high‐quality reference genomes for various model and non‐model plant species. This has necessitated genomics‐assisted breeding of crops, including underutilized species, consequently broadening genetic variation of the available germplasm; improving the discovery of novel alleles controlling important agronomic traits; and enhancing crea-tion of new crop cultivars with improved tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses and superior nu-tritive quality. Here, therefore, we summarize these recent developments in plant genomics and their application, with particular reference to cereal crops (including underutilized species). Par-ticularly, we discuss genome sequencing approaches, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and genome‐wide association (GWAS) studies, directed mutagenesis, plant non‐coding RNAs, precise gene editing technologies such as CRISPR‐Cas9, and complementation of crop genotyping by crop phenotyping. We then conclude by providing an outlook that, as we step into the future, high‐throughput phenotyping, pan‐genomics, transposable elements analysis, and machine learning hold much promise for crop improvements related to climate resilience and nutritional superiority. © 2021 by the authors.
